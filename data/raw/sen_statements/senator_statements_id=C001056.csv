This has led to not only a humanitarian crisis, but also a dire security breakdown.""Despite the magnitude of this crisis, this trajectory can be changed. In fact, if the Biden Administration wanted to take the first step, it wouldn’t have to look far."" WASHINGTON —U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) authored the following op-ed in the Dallas Morning News about his Bipartisan Border Solutions Act amid the growing crisis along the southern border: America’s immigration crisis has a bipartisan solutionSenator John CornynDallas Morning NewsSeptember 25, 2022https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/09/25/americas-immigration-crisis-has-a-bipartisan-solution/ “Migrants used to run from us. Now they run to us.”This is the new reality for Border Patrol agents who are on the front lines of America’s unprecedented border crisis.In the last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection logged more than 2.3 million illegal border crossings. This has led to not only a humanitarian crisis, but also a dire security breakdown. When agents are changing diapers instead of patrolling the border, it creates a gateway for dangerous drugs and criminals to sneak across.In the past year, CBP has seized more than 645,000 pounds of illegal drugs, including nearly 13,600 pounds of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is killing Americans at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, the cartels that traffic both drugs and migrants are getting richer by the day.This crisis is not new, and it is not surprising.President Joe Biden ran on the promise of policies that guaranteed this exact scenario, and his administration continues to ignore the obvious crisis on our doorstep. Earlier this month, Vice President Kamala Harris boldly proclaimed, “The border is secure.”Law enforcement, local leaders, nonprofits, landowners and other experts on the ground in Texas will attest that her claim is patently false.In July, I led a trip to the Rio Grande Valley with Sen. Ted Cruz to give our Senate colleagues a firsthand look at the deadly scene playing out along our border. We heard stories of young children making the dangerous journey alone, teenagers being recruited to smuggle migrants, and local businesses trying to stay afloat amid safety concerns and significant financial losses. Across the board, every system responding to this crisis is stretched thin and beyond overwhelmed, making it nearly impossible to stop dangerous drugs and individuals from streaming into our country.Despite the magnitude of this crisis, this trajectory can be changed. In fact, if the Biden administration wanted to take the first step, it wouldn’t have to look far.Last year, I introduced the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act with Texas Reps. Tony Gonzales, R-San Antonio, and Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. This bill addresses the growing migrant influx at the border through a number of systemic reforms.One of the biggest strains is migrant processing. The Bipartisan Border Solutions Act will help streamline this system by establishing at least four regional processing centers in high-traffic areas. These facilities will help improve efficiency and coordination between the various government agencies. They will also ensure we don’t have to skip important steps of the process, such as issuing a notice to appear to begin removal proceedings in immigration court, due to a facility running beyond its capacity.This legislation will also ease the strain on immigration courts, which are already battling a backlog more than 1.9 million cases deep. It creates a pilot program to expedite credible fear screenings, one of the first steps of the legal process, and instructs immigration courts to prioritize cases of migrants who arrive during surges. This will ensure those with legitimate claims can be granted asylum without lengthy delays, while also disincentivizing individuals with weak or fabricated asylum claims from attempting the dangerous journey to the border at all.Currently, it can take years for a single immigration case to be adjudicated. With the current surge in migration, the number of cases and the wait times will only continue to grow. It’s in everyone’s best interest to resolve cases fairly and efficiently, and deliver migrants the legal certainty they need to move forward with their lives. To support this goal, our bipartisan bill requires the hiring of hundreds of immigration judge teams, asylum officers, litigation teams, and other staff.This bill makes a number of other common sense changes to alleviate staffing shortages, expand language translation and legal orientation services for migrants, and improve coordination between federal, state and local officials.With busloads of migrants now arriving to places like Washington, D.C., and New York City, maybe the Biden administration will understand that their strategy of inaction is reckless and untenable.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “To avoid re-traumatizing victims during the investigation process, it’s imperative we give these individuals the support they need to ensure survivors feel respected during the interview process and abusers are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”“We must provide investigators of child abuse and sexual exploitation with the tools and training to interact sensitively with survivors and witnesses,” said Sen. Coons. “We’ve seen the tragic consequences of mishandled victim interviews that can resurface the trauma of abuse for survivors of these crimes. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation requires the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams of trained professionals in the course of such investigations to ensure the pursuit of justice does not inadvertently cause more harm to the very people the system is trying to protect.”“I applaud Senator Cornyn’s leadership on this issue to correct an egregious wrong committed by certain FBI agents regarding their treatment of victims of sexual abuse,” said Sen. Graham. “Requiring the FBI to use appropriate, tried and true methods to interview child victims will help ensure the FBI’s failure in the Nassar case doesn’t happen again. This legislation will make it clear that we expect better.”“As we work to support survivors of child sexual abuse and trafficking, we need to provide law enforcement with the training and skills they need to investigate these crimes and help victims,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “Our bipartisan legislation will ensure law enforcement officers can partner with child advocacy centers to use the most effective techniques when conducting these critical investigations.”Background:During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing examining the Inspector General’s Report on the FBI’s Handling of the Larry Nassar investigation last year, retired gymnast and survivor McKayla Maroney shared striking testimony of how she was treated by the FBI personnel who interviewed her. This legislation was formulated with input from child welfare groups to address the mistreatment of child witnesses like those described during that hearing.Under this legislation, victims would be interviewed by those with the expertise to appropriately address and treat their trauma. This bill would require the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams when investigating child sexual abuse cases, child sexual abuse material cases, and child trafficking cases, including in situations where the interviewed victim is no longer a child. These multidisciplinary teams would be composed of appropriate investigative personnel, mental health professionals, medical personnel, family advocacy case workers, child advocacy center personnel, and prosecutors. Members of these teams have expertise in their field, can provide trauma-informed care, and are required to stay current on industry training. The use of these teams would prevent re-traumatizing victims, and the information-sharing and case review provisions would ensure accountability so cases are not dropped or forgotten in the future. Investigations would be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team at regularly scheduled times to share information about case progress, address any investigative or prosecutorial barriers, and ensure victims receive support and needed treatment.This legislation is supported by the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network, the National District Attorneys Association, Army of Survivors, the National Children’s Alliance, Keep Kids Safe, Together for Girls, Darkness to Light, the Monique Burr Foundation for Children, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), and the Brave Movement.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “This legislation would prevent adversaries like China and Russia from ‘ghost-lobbying’ by requiring foreign agents to register and disclose political activity to the Department of Justice.”“Corrupt foreign adversaries like Vladimir Putin exploit every weakness available to undermine the core American values of transparency and the rule of law,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “Our bill would shore up America’s defenses by closing a glaring loophole in our foreign agent reporting system.  I’m pleased to join this important bipartisan effort.”“For too long, exemptions in U.S. law have allowed many persons in the United States who are paid to actively promote the interests of Communist China and other strategic adversaries to avoid registering as foreign agents,” said Sen. Hagerty. “I’m pleased to co-sponsor the Preventing Adversary Influence, Disinformation, and Obscured Foreign Financing Act to end these exemptions. As nations like Communist China seek to exert new forms of foreign interference and malign influence in our democracy, laws governing the registration of foreign agents must keep pace with this evolving threat to U.S. national security.”“I’m pleased to join this strong, bipartisan bill against foreign adversaries meddling in our legislative process,” said Sen. Fischer. “China, Russia, and other adversaries tirelessly seek to undermine our national interests and influence U.S. policy in their favor. Our legislation will stop individuals working for foreign powers from skirting disclosure laws that identifies them as such.”“Federal law should not provide protection for entities who are willing to do business with our enemies,” said Sen. Rubio. “If a lobbyist or consultant wants to work with our adversaries to subvert American interests, we deserve to know about it. Our bill would ensure U.S. law no longer provides cover for these corrupt cronies.”Background:The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) has not been amended since the 1990s, and the law has not kept up with modern foreign adversary influence campaigns using commercial activities and registration loopholes as subterfuge to spread disinformation. Currently, agents representing foreign adversaries are able to avoid FARA registration by taking advantage of the commercial activities and Lobbying Disclosure Act(LDA) exemptions to avoid disclosing their lobbying efforts to the DOJ. This legislation would make it easier for the U.S. government to catch these unregistered agents in the act by removing the commercial activities and LDA registration exemptions that make it easy for foreign agents to lobby for America’s adversaries without having to disclose that they are being paid by a foreign adversary government. Foreign adversaries of the United States are defined by executive order as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and the Maduro regime.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “The Blackwell School in Marfa, Texas is a symbol of the progress that has been made and what still remains. I applaud the bipartisan work to pass this bill to commemorate Latino history and culture, and I look forward to this bill being signed into law.” “We must work together in Congress to paint a more accurate picture of how this country came to be. And that picture is not complete without including the history of Mexican Americans,” said Congressman Gonzales. “For decades, the Blackwell School has been an important piece of history for the City of Marfa, West Texas and Mexican Americans across the country. Establishing the Blackwell School as a National Historic Site will cement its rich, complicated legacy for generations to come.”  “The history preserved in our National Park System helps tell the rich story of our country. However, our national parks and monuments do not yet adequately represent the significant contributions, and often painful history, of diverse communities across the country,” said Sen. Padilla. “I’m proud to see our bill move forward to designate one of just a handful of national park sites commemorating Latino history. I look forward to the President signing this bill to preserve the Blackwell School and carry on the important history it holds as a cornerstone to Mexican heritage.” Background:From 1909 to 1965, the Blackwell School served as the only school for children of Mexican descent in Marfa, Texas to attend. In 2019, the school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and meets qualifications to become a National Historic Site. If signed into law, this legislation would establish the Blackwell School as one of the few national park sites specifically designated to commemorate Latino history and culture in the United States. Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Our Nation is a better place because of their unparalleled patriotism and love for our country. Now, every veteran who walks in for care at the clinic, and every person in the community who drives by, will be inspired by the service of Charles and JoAnne.” Background:Colonel Charles E. Powell was a Texas native and a 30-year Air Force pilot who volunteered to serve in Vietnam as a Rescue Crew Commander flying 168 combat missions and later served as Commander of the 17th Training Wing at Goodfellow Air Force Base. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Legions of Merit, and the Air Medal with seven Oak Leaf Clusters. After his Air Force career, Colonel Powell served his community as board member for United Way of Texas, Boy Scouts of Southwest Texas, Retired Seniors Volunteer Program, and the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce, earning Citizen of the Year by the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce, the Distinguished Citizen of the Year award from the Boy Scouts of Southwest Texas, and Veteran of the Year at Angelo State University. He also served on Senator Cornyn’s Service Academy Selection Board for more than a decade helping to review applications from Texas students applying for a nomination to U.S. service academies. His wife, JoAnne served as a Congressional District Office Manager and regional staff aide to four local Members of Congress throughout multiple decades of public service. She served on the boards of the Red Cross, Meals for the Elderly, Hospice of San Angelo, and was frequently referred to as “the First Lady of Goodfellow Air Force Base.”  Colonel Powell passed away on July 2, 2020 and JoAnne Powell passed on March 24, 2021.

Please call the Harlingen office at 956-423-0162 or the Houston office at 713-572-3337 for updated address information.  Return to Newsroom ArticlesWASHINGTON- Today, U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) introduced the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022 to reauthorize a nationwide law enforcement program focusing on the reduction of violent crime.“The Project Safe Neighborhoods program has been proven to reduce violent crime in cities that participate by focusing law enforcement efforts on organized crime networks and repeat offenders,” said Sen. Cornyn. “By fostering partnerships between federal, state, and local law enforcement to address these criminal threats, we can take a more proactive approach to protecting our communities from violent criminals.”“Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities and communities across the country, and Project Safe Neighborhoods has given law enforcement important resources to fight back,” said Sen. Cruz. “I’m proud to work with my Texas colleague John Cornyn to help state and local police officers, prosecutors, and communities work together to combat violence and bring criminals to justice.”“Crime and gun violence is a nationwide problem that must be met with a whole-of-government response,” said Sen. Feinstein. “Project Safe Neighborhoods has proven to be one of the most effective ways to bring communities and every level of government together to prevent crime. I want to thank Senator Cornyn for leading this bipartisan effort to renew this important program through 2026.”“For the past two decades, Project Safe Neighborhoods has successfully enabled law enforcement officers to fight crime through local, state and federal collaboration,” said Sen. Grassley. “Reauthorizing this critical grant program will ensure communities receive the resources needed to reduce dangerous crime in our communities, and these resources are especially important as we face a national violent crime wave.” “Far too many families have experienced the devastating toll that gun violence and drug crimes can have on a community,”said Sen. Peters. “Using proven, data-driven strategies, Project Safe Neighborhood has effectively improved collaboration between law enforcement and community partners for over two decades – and has successfully reduced drug, gun violence and other violent offenses in communities in Michigan and throughout the country. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan legislation with Senator Cornyn to continue support for this vital program – and help ensure we continue working together to make our neighborhoods safer places to work, live, and raise a family.”“Arizona communities should be safe – free of violence and crime,” said Sen. Sinema. “Our bipartisan legislation supporting the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will reduce violence, protect communities, and help ensure Arizona families are safe and secure.”“We are seeing an increase in crime across our country, and now is the time for Congress to act,” said Sen. Tillis. “This legislation provides much-needed support to local law enforcement to combat crime and map overdose patterns in our communities. I am proud to work on this commonsense legislation to create safer neighborhoods for future generations.”Background:Project Safe Neighborhoods is a nationwide partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement and prosecutors that uses evidence-based and data-driven approaches to reduce violent crime. Under Project Safe Neighborhoods, multiple law enforcement agencies cooperate and focus their enforcement efforts on organized criminal networks and repeat offenders that are driving the crime rates in a particular region. Project Safe Neighborhoods also works to build trust and partnerships between law enforcement and the communities they serve through coordinated outreach, public awareness, innovative tactics, and collaborative interventions. Since its inception in 2001, Project Safe Neighborhoods has been successfully deployed by both Democratic and Republican administrations to reduce violent crime in large cities and smaller communities across the country. According to a Michigan State University study funded by the Department of Justice in 2013, Project Safe Neighborhoods was associated with a 13.1% decrease in violent crime in cities with a high rate of program participation—including double-digit reductions in total firearms crime and homicides in every city examined by the study. The 2018 authorization of the program passed the Senate unanimously.Specifically, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022:The following organizations support Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022: Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Major County Sheriffs of America, National District Attorneys Association, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, and National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “By seeking out recommendations for modernizing our military, we work towards making sure our national defense is well-positioned for success in this rapidly-changing threat environment.” “Technology wins wars. From the long bow at the Battle of Agincourt to nuclear weapons in World War Two, technological advancements frequently turn the tides of battle and define conflicts,” said Sen. King. “As America faces growing threats from global adversaries like Russia and China, our defense technology must keep up with the times, and prevent our enemies from gaining a competitive advantage. This bipartisan bill will help the Department of Defense stay on the cutting edge of rapidly-evolving capabilities, keep our warfighters well equipped, and make sure our nation is ready to address any potential threat. It’s a critical step in keeping America safe – and without it, I fear we could someday pay the price.”Background:In order for the military to modernize quickly enough to overmatch threats posed by China and Russia, Department of Defense (DOD) programs and acquisitions need to keep pace with rapidly-changing critical defense technologies and evolving adversary capabilities. Delays and inefficiencies within the DOD bureaucracy are an impediment to figuring out what capabilities the U.S. needs to deter our adversaries and producing and procuring those capabilities fast enough to maintain our technological competitive advantage over emerging threats.This legislation would direct the Office of the Secretary of Defense to facilitate an outside study of DOD programs to make recommendations for how these programs and acquisitions can keep pace with rapidly changing technologies. The study would be led by independent organizations that are established leaders in national security and technology.This is one of several bills Sen. Cornyn has led this session that address the multipronged challenges of military modernization.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “This legislation will provide more insight into some of the bureaucratic processes and clarify the roles and responsibilities as the Army continues their modernization mission.”“As the Army moves forward on its modernization strategy, it is imperative that Congress understands the relationships between Army officials and leaders who are responsible for implementing modernization plans,” said Senator Peters. “I’m proud to join Senator Cornyn in introducing the bipartisan Army FUTURES Act, which will help provide clarity on the various authorities being utilized to transform our Army into a forward-looking force. This is a vital step in ensuring that we’re building an Army that is capable of meeting our future national security needs.”Background:The Army FUTURES Act would require the U.S. Army to submit a detailed report of the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in the modernization process for the Army as well as clear definitions for the Army modernization enterprise to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. This report would provide lawmakers with a clearer understanding of the responsibilities of the Army Futures Command (AFC) and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA [ALT]) as well as how recently-issued Army directives have impacted the overall process for the Army’s modernization mission.This legislation would:·        Require the Army to submit a detailed breakdown to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees of the roles and responsibilities of entities involved in the modernization enterprise;·        Define what the overall modernization enterprise is comprised of;·        And clearly define the modernization enterprise as whole. Identical language was included in an amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act filed by Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill (NJ-11).

Cornyn. “This legislation would authorize faster procurement of weapons and combat articles so helping our allies and partners doesn’t diminish our ability to protect ourselves.” “As the United States continues to lead the global military aid response to Ukraine amid Putin’s unprovoked war, it has become increasingly critical that we simultaneously ensure the sustainment of our defensive weapons stockpile while also providing the materials our allies and partners need to defend themselves,” said Sen. Shaheen. “This bipartisan legislation would enhance our ability to both maintain our own defenses while also helping our friends. I’m glad to partner with Sen. Cornyn on this legislation, which specifically addresses the current security challenges facing the United States and our allies.”The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Angus King (D-ME), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rick Scott (R-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).Background:While critical to defending democracy abroad, lethal aid provided to Ukraine has diminished U.S. stockpiles and left defense contractors with uncertainty on timing and orders for backfill, negatively affecting their ability to quickly ramp up production. DoD contracting processes include mandatory contract review periods and lengthy competitive open-bid windows that have slowed down efforts to rebuild stores of defense articles.This legislation would amend the DoD’s emergency acquisition authorities to allow them to use non-competitive procedures to quickly award a contract in order to replenish defense article stocks sent to an ally or partner after an attack by a foreign adversary of the U.S.While the DoD can use expedited procedures to speed up defense procurement in certain situations, backfilling depleted stockpiles is not one of them. This legislation lays out an exemption to permit the DoD to expedite the acquisitions process and decrease the time it takes to send aid in case of such an attack, subject to the following conditions:·        This authority can only be used when the U.S. is not a party to hostilities;·        The defense articles procured via this authority must be like the articles that spent from U.S. stocks;·        This authority may also be used for contracting for the movement or delivery of defense articles transferred from the U.S. to an ally or partner;·        And DoD must report to Congress within one week after deciding to use the authority.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

And there’s no question the Biden administration has put our country on shaky ground.""WASHINGTON— Following President Biden’s irresponsible student loan debt ‘cancellation’ announcement during a time of high inflation, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) authored the following op-ed in San Antonio Express-News highlighting the Biden administration’s penchant for governing by fiat instead of working with Congress to find consensus: Governing like a king, Biden hurting AmericansSenator John CornynSan Antonio Express-NewsAugust 29, 2022https://www.expressnews.com/opinion/commentary/article/Cornyn-Biden-hurting-Americans-17400702.phpOur Founding Fathers had the wisdom to establish three branches of government to prevent any one person or institution from wielding absolute power. Perennial favorite “Schoolhouse Rock!” put it perfectly: “Everybody’s act is part of the show, and no one’s job is more important.”Judging by the past two years, President Joe Biden must have missed that episode.The Biden administration has developed a dangerous habit of ignoring the legislative and judicial branches, and operating as a one-man show. The president has stretched the limits of executive power to govern unilaterally, and this trend carries serious consequences for our country.A prime example came this past week when Biden announced he would “cancel” student loans for millions of borrowers. Debt can’t be erased with a magic wand. Every dollar will be paid for by someone. Biden has just shifted the burden from wealthy, college-educated individuals to taxpayers who never took out student loans and graduates who repaid what they borrowed. This decision will cost American taxpayers roughly half a trillion dollars — all to wipe away debt that millions willingly took on. Families are underwater because of inflation, and prominent Obama administration officials acknowledge this will drive prices higher.Then there are Biden’s executive actions on energy. He campaigned on the promise of a “transition” from fossil fuels and made anti-oil and gas policies a Day One priority. On Inauguration Day, Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline permit, and halted oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. These decisions imperil our future energy security. Oil and gas producers can’t magically increase output overnight.Today, Texans are burdened by high gas prices — a product of Russia’s war on Ukraine, the post-pandemic travel boom and the administration’s policies. This is the time to take a hard look at our energy security and plan for our long-term needs. The Biden administration refuses to do so.And let’s not forget the border crisis. In the past year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has logged more than 2.3 million illegal border crossings. Border Patrol agents are spread thin and overwhelmed by the magnitude of the work.The Biden administration’s actions created this crisis, and if not for the federal courts, the problems would be worse. In April, the administration announced it would end Title 42 — one of the few tools preventing even more chaos at the border. Nearly half of the migrants who illegally crossed the southern border in the past year were returned under Title 42. Without this authority, law enforcement and our immigration system would buckle under the weight of this crisis. Fortunately, the federal courts blocked the administration’s disastrous plan.The Biden administration has attempted to prevent states from reallocating COVID relief funds to provide tax cuts for working families. It even implemented a policy to discourage Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from enforcing the law.Executive overreach carries long-term consequences, and one of the best examples comes from former President Barack Obama. On many occasions, Obama acknowledged that he lacked the authority to implement immigration reforms unilaterally. In 2010, he said, “I am not king. I can’t do these things just by myself.”Two years later, Obama tried anyway. Rather than work with Congress to build consensus and make law, he issued an executive order to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided legal status for undocumented immigrant children. Though it gave the former president a short-term “win,” this action triggered a tidal wave of fear and uncertainty for these young people, who still — more than a decade later — wonder if they will have their work authorizations revoked or be deported from the only home they have ever known.When a president governs as a king, instability follows. And there’s no question the Biden administration has put our country on shaky ground.Biden’s overzealous use of executive authority is not the system our founders envisioned, and it certainly isn’t improving the lives of Texans. The problems facing our country require elected officials — including the president — to work together, negotiate and build consensus.It’s a lot harder than signing an executive order, but it’s absolutely worth it.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “As inflation continues to drain the pockets of Americans, this disastrous policy would incentivize universities to raise tuition and unfairly punish those who sacrificed to pay off their own student loans.” Background:According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, President Biden’s plan to cancel at least $10,000 in debt per borrower would cost American taxpayers an additional $230 billion to foot the bill.  The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates this cost to be even higher between $300 billion and $980 billion over the 10-year budget window.  Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Given the Democrats’ history of weaponizing the Department of Justice, including the FBI, for political purposes, the American people deserve an honest explanation.”“This Administration has targeted parents who challenged the actions of their local school boards, suggesting they are domestic terrorists, while downplaying potential crimes by a member of the President’s own family. Given this history, the American people are understandably skeptical, and deserve to know the truth. The longer the Attorney General remains silent, the more this looks like a brazen abuse of power to target a political rival.”Earlier this week, Senator Cornyn called the reported reason behind the raid “thin gruel.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

There's a wide array of criminal threats that we encounter down at the border...”WASHINGTON – Today in the Senate Judiciary Committee, on his last day of quarantine U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) virtually questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray on whether or not the southern border is secure. Excerpts are below, and video can be found here.Senator Cornyn: “When Director Mayorkas was asked about the border, he made the, frankly, from my standpoint, implausible statement that the border was secure. From your vantage point, in your opinion, is the border secure?”Director Wray: “Well, boy, I guess I'm hesitant to substitute my judgment for the Secretary of Homeland Security, but I will tell you that I have spent a lot of time with our field offices down that have border responsibility. I have been to ports of entry, including, not that long ago, with CBP officers walking me through it, so I could really see firsthand what they're up against. And all I can say is, boy, they got a heck of a challenge…”Sen. Cornyn: “Director Wray, I've always thought of you as a straight shooter, but you won't answer that question?”Dir.

Cornyn: “In my most recent trip to the border, Senator Cruz and I took a number of our Republican Conference down to the border, many of whom had made that trip before. But we continue to hear the same sort of message from the Border Patrol in terms of the nationalities of the people they encounter there… and that's a public security threat. You agree with me?”Dir. Wray: “To me, it represents a significant security issue and represents a wide array of criminal threats that flow out of it.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

The bill is named for Jenna Quinn, a Texan and child abuse survivor, and is modeled after successful reforms passed by the Texas Legislature in 2009.  “For over a decade in Texas, Jenna’s Law has been crucial to training students, teachers, and caregivers to better identify and prevent child sexual abuse,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The increase in reporting of these cases is why I am proud to partner with advocates and Texans like Jenna Quinn to ensure that these resources are available nationwide, and I strongly urge the House to pass this legislation and send it to the President’s desk without delay.”Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) joined Sen. Cornyn on the legislation.Background:Jenna Quinn has been an outspoken advocate for survivors of child sexual abuse and was the driving force behind what is now known as Jenna’s Law in Texas. Unanimously passed by the Texas State Senate and House, Jenna’s Law was the first child sexual abuse prevention law in the U.S. that mandates K-12 trainings for students and school staff; it was amended in 2017 to include sex trafficking prevention education in schools. More than half of all states have adopted a form of Jenna’s Law.After Jenna’s Law passed in Texas in 2009, a study found educators reported child sexual abuse at a rate almost four times greater after training than during their pre-training career.The Jenna Quinn Law would:Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

The Homicide Victims’ Families’ Rights Act was inspired by this case and would require federal agencies to look at cold cases with a fresh set of eyes and apply the most up-to-date technologies and investigative standards.The bill will also empower immediate family members to request a cold case review so long as it meets certain basic criteria.

Apparently Democrats, specifically the Majority Leader and Senator Manchin, just moved those discussions out of the public eye into a secret back room.” “After saying repeatedly he would not support such reckless policies, he's done an Olympic-worthy flip-flop, and there's simply no denying it.”“Now Senator Manchin not only supports the ‘Build Back Broke’ bill, he now said it’s his proposal. He, in effect, wrote it, and it includes the same policies that he previously opposed: tax hikes on working families and small businesses, Green New Deal climate policies, socialist price controls on prescription drugs.”“They're calling it the Inflation Reduction Act. What an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Do they think anybody will be fooled?”“There are only 100 of us, and the relationships and the confidence that we have that when somebody looks you in the eye and tells you something, that they're going to stick with it, is important to negotiating in good faith and building consensus that’s necessary to pass legislation… like our mental health and school safety bill recently.”“That trust was eviscerated yesterday. Senators Manchin and Schumer did not draft this 725-page bill in the four hours between the passage of the CHIPS Act and Senator Manchin's press release.

GarlandU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20530 The Honorable Susan RiceDirector, Domestic Policy CouncilThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20500 Dear Attorney General Garland and Director Susan Rice:We the undersigned write in reference to Executive Order 14006, entitled “Reforming Our Incarceration System to Eliminate the Use of Privately Operated Criminal Detention Facilities” (“Executive Order”). We are concerned about the Executive Order’s impact on the constitutional rights of the accused, public safety, the administration of justice, and the jobs of hundreds of Texans.  Thus, we respectfully request a permanent carve-out from the Executive Order for both the Willacy County Regional Detention facility in Raymondville, Texas and the Rio Grande Detention Center in Laredo, Texas. We all have provided letters and comments to the Administration on this issue since the Willacy County Regional Detention facility closed on March 31, 2022.  As noted by Chief Judge Rosenthal in her letter dated July 7, 2022, the Executive Order has created numerous unintended consequences, which primarily have affected the constitutional rights and physical safety of pretrial detainees.  As a result of the Executive Order, detainees must now travel between 160 to 240 miles roundtrip for court appearances.  This has caused long periods of confinement in crowded spaces, while being shackled for the entire day, for hundreds of pretrial detainees.  The Executive Order also has delayed court appearances, prohibited family appearances, and prevented pretrial detainees’ access to legal counsel.  As Chief Judge Rosenthal said, “[t]he system depends on these detainees having swift access to counsel, followed by prompt court appearances and plea hearings and sentences.” All of these problems will be compounded if the administration closes the Rio Grande Detention Center.  Indeed, if this location close as scheduled in October 2023, 1,600 detainees will suffer as a result.  Yet the effects borne by these pretrial detainees will reverberate across other parts of South Texas.  Indeed, the displacement of pretrial detainees from both the Willacy County Regional Detention facility and the Rio Grande Detention Center places a burden not only on the pretrial detainees, judges, and lawyers in the Southern District of Texas, but also the surrounding facilities forced to intake the pretrial detainees.  Placing pretrial detainees in overcrowded facilities, housing cooperating witnesses with sentenced defendants, or relying on small overcrowded local jails is not a solution.  Furthermore, the impact of the Executive Order will affect hundreds of jobs and harm local economies.  The closing of the Willacy County Regional Detention facility caused hundreds of employees to lose their livelihoods, leaving families without a steady source of income during a period of great economic uncertainty.  Now, the hard-working correctional officers and employees of the Rio Grande Detention Center and their families will soon face the same grim circumstances.  The requested carve-out is not unprecedented.  Both the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, Ohio, and the Western Region Detention Facility in San Diego, California, received carve outs from the Executive Order.  Detainees in the Rio Grande Valley face circumstances similar to those faced by detainees in Ohio and California.  It is our shared hope that the Administration will extend the same carve-out to our South Texas detention facilities. Thus, we the undersigned join the request of South Texas stakeholders, including the Southern District of Texas judges, the Marshals Service, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Federal Public Defender, and the Criminal Justice Act Panel District Representative in the Southern District of Texas, and respectfully request that the Administration carve out an exception from the Executive Order and allow both the Willacy County Regional Detention facility and the Rio Grande Detention Center to operate. We look forward to your prompt decision and welcome the opportunity to engage in further discussions regarding the impact that the Executive Order has had on the Southern District of Texas. Regards,/s/Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

A coastal barrier protection system will reduce the impact of hurricanes and tropical storms, and help keep Texas communities safer,” said Sen. Cruz. “It’s not only an important safety measure, but it will save money in the long term by softening the destructive power of storms along the Gulf Coast. This is a win-win, not just for Texans, but for taxpayers nationwide.”“The coastal barrier is a matter of national security. The Texas Gulf Coast is home to millions of people, countless homes and jobs, and numerous refineries. The Texas Coastal Spine Authorization Act will strengthen the resiliency of the Gulf Coast,” said Rep.

Cornyn. “This legislation would allow federal agencies to recuperate the value of these guns by selling them back to the federal law enforcement officers who use them.”“Instead of destroying retired weapons—which wastes millions in tax dollars—law enforcement officers should have the option to purchase these firearms. Revenue from the sales would help cut the cost of purchasing new weapons, and would allow officers to purchase firearms they’re already accustomed to,” said Sen. Cotton.“It’s important for law enforcement to be equipped with the necessary resources for their job, including tools to promote gun safety and prevent gun violence,” said Sen. Tillis. “This legislation will enable federal law enforcement to purchase retired handguns for use on the force but to also further safety and training programs for gun safety education. I will always work hard for our brave law enforcement.”Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) have also cosponsored the legislation.Background:The Federal Law Enforcement Service Weapon Purchase Act allows federal law enforcement officers to buy their retired weapon at the fair market value within six months of the end of its service life. The agency must conduct a background check prior to purchase.The bill is endorsed by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Fraternal Order of the Police, Women In Federal Law Enforcement, and the National Treasury Employees Union. Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Doss Memorial Act, which renames the U.S. Border Patrol Station in Rocksprings, Texas in Agent Doss’s honor:  “Officers like Agent Doss who are lost in the line of duty remind us of the courageous sacrifices that law enforcement, and their families, make each day,” said Sen. Cornyn. “I’m proud to see her commitment to public safety live on at the Border Patrol Station in Rocksprings in her honor. May her years of service and leadership be an example for future generations.” “Like too many in her profession, Donna Doss made the greatest sacrifice protecting her community and the country she loved,” said Rep. Arrington. “The Donna Doss Border Patrol station will serve as a symbol to honor her, her legacy, her family, and all law enforcement who risk their lives to protect their fellow countrymen as Donna Doss did. I pray that her family finds some comfort in this legislation being signed into law.” “The loss of Agent Doss is a tragic reminder of the dangers our Border Patrol agents and law enforcement face every time they put on their uniform,” said Rep. Gonzales.  “The Donna M. Doss Border Patrol Station in Rocksprings will be a solemn reminder of the ultimate sacrifice she made and cement her legacy of service and heroism for generations to come.” Background:Agent Doss had served more than 15 years in the Border Patrol when she was killed in the line of duty on February 2, 2019 after she was struck by a vehicle in Tye, Texas. Sen. Cornyn honored Agent Doss on the Senate floor following her tragic death in February 2019 and first introduced this bill in September 2020.This legislation is supported by the National Border Patrol Council and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA).Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “We must act to ensure Justices and their families are protected from those who wish to cause them harm by extending Supreme Court police security to family members.”“Millions of Americans who tuned into Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearing couldn’t miss seeing her husband and daughter on national TV,” said Sen. Coons. “If the families of Supreme Court Justices have the same profile and exposure as the highest ranking officials in our government, they deserve the same level of protection. We must take threats that come from extremes on both sides of the political spectrum against Supreme Court Justices seriously, and that makes this bill an unfortunate necessity.”If enacted, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act would extend security protection to Supreme Court Justices and their families in line with what is provided to certain Article I and Article II officers and their families. Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “The House of Representatives passed this legislation nearly unanimously, and it is imperative that the Senate quickly do the same so we can prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law.”  “Throughout Vladimir Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russian commanders and troops have committed innumerous horrific war crimes and atrocities against innocent civilians and they must be held accountable,” said Sen. Gillibrand, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “I am proud to join the bipartisan Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, which will ensure the U.S. is collecting and analyzing evidence of Russia’s war crimes, as well as identifying those responsible, in an effort to hold them accountable and possibly deter additional atrocities. We stand united in our efforts to bring these war criminals to justice.”Sen. Rick Scott said, “It’s clear that Russian forces, under the control of Vladimir Putin are committing murder, rape and genocide. These atrocities are war crimes and cannot go unpunished. I am proud to join Senator Cornyn and our colleagues on this good bill and make clear that America stands for human rights and will be relentless in our work to hold Putin and his thugs accountable.”“This effort is an important step in exposing Putin’s campaign of war crimes against innocent Ukrainians. Men, women, and children from Mariupol to Bucha have laid lifeless in the street, victims of unspeakable atrocities committed by Putin’s barbaric invasion. Gathering and analyzing evidence will assist in prosecuting and holding accountable those complicit in these Russian atrocities. The full force of U.S. and international law must be brought to bear,” said Sen. Blumenthal.""While Russian troops at the direction of Putin are invading a sovereign country and committing heinous crimes against the Ukrainian people, President Biden and Congress must work together on a coordinated response to war crimes,"" said Sen. Tillis. ""This legislation will require a report to Congress on everything the United States is doing to respond to the war in Ukraine and keep a record of any evidence of war crimes. We must hold Putin's regime accountable for starting this unprovoked war against a free and sovereign democracy and spilling the blood of innocent people.""“Russia’s barbaric invasion has devastated Ukraine, demolished cities, and killed an untold number of Ukrainians who want nothing more than to leave peacefully in their home country. This unprovoked assault is horrific, and it is absolutely essential that those responsible pay the consequences,” said Sen. King. “Our bipartisan bill is an important step to hold Vladimir Putin and his accomplices accountable for their atrocities – and puts Russian leaders on notice that the world is watching their every step.”“The world has watched in horror as Putin has used brute military force in an attempt to subjugate the peaceful country of Ukraine, killing countless innocent civilians in his path,” said Sen. Collins. “From Bucha to Mariupol, the abject cruelty and viciousness of the Russian occupation have been on full display.  Our bill would help ensure that these atrocities are identified and preserved, exposing war crimes committed by Putin, Russian generals, and soldiers.  As we continue to support the Ukrainians in their fight to defend their people and their democracy, this effort will place additional pressure on Russia to bring an end to this terrible war.”“Vladimir Putin and the Russian troops under his command must be held accountable for the heinous war crimes being committed against innocent Ukrainians. Our bill will ensure that evidence is preserved so war criminals may one day be brought to justice and these atrocities are never forgotten,” said Sen. Feinstein.""Vladimir Putin and his soldiers are war criminals,"" said Sen. Blackburn. ""Intentionally targeting civilians and willfully causing widespread destruction in a sovereign nation cannot be enabled by the freest country in the world's silence. This legislation will keep a close record of the evidence necessary for a war crimes conviction and deter perpetrators from engaging in this horrific violence.""“The atrocities we are seeing every single day being committed against innocent Ukrainians are horrendous and unacceptable – and Vladimir Putin and the Russian military must be held accountable for these crimes,” said Sen. Peters, former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Ukrainian Caucus. “This bipartisan legislation will ensure we have the evidence needed so that the Russian government cannot hide behind their crimes. I’m proud to stand with the Ukrainian people against the Russian government’s illegal invasion and will continue working to make sure we have a strong, unified front with Ukraine.”“The world has watched Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine unfold with brutal and devastating effect. Vladimir Putin, his forces and enablers must be held accountable for the destruction and suffering they have caused. This legislation will help ensure the record is crystal clear and these perpetrators do not escape responsibility for the atrocities they have directed, committed and lauded,” Sen. Boozman said.“Since Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine began, there has been overwhelming evidence that Russia has been committing serious war crimes, including indiscriminately targeting civilians,” said Sen. Kaine. “This bipartisan bill is a necessary step to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. We must send a strong message to Putin and authoritarians around the world that these crimes will not be tolerated.”“A month and a half into Russia’s bloody invasion in Ukraine, alarming reports of war crimes and grave human rights violations continue to mount. Putin must be held to account for these gross atrocities – to do so, the U.S. must contribute to efforts to collect and review evidence to properly assess the human toll of this war,” said Sen. Shaheen. “I’m proud to help introduce bipartisan legislation to ensure our government collects evidence of Russian war crimes that will be needed to prosecute these crimes. Meticulously documenting Russia’s hateful violence now will help deter Russian troops from committing future war crimes. This legislation sends an unwavering bipartisan message from the Senate that the U.S. will demand accountability for growing human rights violations committed across Ukraine’s communities.”The House version of this legislation passed the House Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously and was adopted by the full House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 418-7 on April 6, 2022.Background:The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act would issue a statement of policy and require a report to Congress within 90 days to ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect, analyze, and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities as defined in the U.S. Code committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to deter the commission of such crimes by making Russian commanders, troops, and leaders aware of efforts to collect evidence and identify those committing these atrocities. The bill focuses on the development and maintenance of evidence and does not specify any specific prosecution venue in which such evidence may be used.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

It posted a map online with their home addresses and encouraged protestors to take their complaints straight to the Justices' doorsteps.”“Every single person in this chamber, especially our Democratic colleagues, should affirm that any demonstrations about this heated issue cannot threaten the safety of anyone - Supreme Court justices, pro-life advocates, or otherwise. This past weekend's events have highlighted the need to better protect the Justices and their families. They deserve the protection that, at this moment, the Supreme Court Police are not able to provide.”“Last week, Senator Coons, the Senator from Delaware, and I introduced a bill to increase protection for all nine justices and their families.”“I'm glad this bill passed the Senate last night, and I hope our colleagues in the House will take it up and pass it in the coming days.”“This radical pro-abortion bill that Senator Schumer has set for a vote on tomorrow allows for abortions at any point during a woman's pregnancy up until the time of delivery. It does this by prohibiting states from protecting an unborn child's right to life as long as one health care provider signs off that a pregnancy would pose a risk to the woman's physical or mental health.”“This extreme legislation would invalidate all state laws that limit abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. This wouldn't just impact pro-life red states. This change is so radical that it would invalidate existing laws in blue states as well.”“This bill would also invalidate laws that prevent abortion from being used as a method of sex selection.”“This bill that the Majority Leader has teed up a vote on tomorrow would also invalidate conscience laws, which protect health care providers who have deeply held objections to abortion. Conscience laws are extremely common in 46 states, allowing individual health care providers to refuse to provide abortion services.”""As shocking as this legislation is, it's not entirely new.

Cornyn. “Once law, this legislation will be a foundational piece of the U.S. response to Putin’s invasion, and I’m grateful to my colleagues in Congress and the Biden Administration for helping get this across the finish line.”“The Ukrainian people have shown their determination and ability to fend off the ongoing, unprovoked and increasingly deadly attacks from Russia, but they need substantial materiel support from the United States and our allies to win this war,” said Sen. Cardin. “I was proud to join President Biden today as he signed our bipartisan bill into law. We must do all we can to bolster Ukrainian defenses and deliver needed resources. Innocent lives and democracy are at stake; we must prevail.”“Ukraine is becoming the frontline between freedom and tyranny. It will need our help for the long haul,” Sen. Wicker said. “I am glad to see that members of both parties were able to come together to enhance efficiency and flexibility in delivering aid to Ukraine. Now we need to take the next step and get Ukraine the weapons they need without delay.”“Putin’s war in Ukraine is the gravest security threat to our world order since World War II – when the lend-lease program was created. That’s why I worked across the aisle to renew the lend-lease program to meet the current crisis created by Russia. As Ukraine fights for its future – and the future of liberal democracies around the globe – delivering military equipment to the frontlines is paramount,” said Sen. Shaheen. “I appreciate the continued bipartisan determination to usher legislation through Congress to provide aid to Ukraine and punish Putin. But we cannot let up – more action is required as the military situation develops to ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to defend itself, to address the full scope of the humanitarian crisis unfolding and to crush Putin’s ability to continue his campaign of violence.”In addition, the legislation was cosponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Angus King (I-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Joni Ernst (R-IA).Background:As part of his Arms Export Control Act and Foreign Assistance Act authorities, the President can currently lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest.

Cornyn. “This legislation will be a game-changer for Ukraine, and I’m grateful to my House colleagues for recognizing its importance and quickly sending it to the President’s desk.”“Democracy and the sovereignty of an independent nation are at risk as Ukraine does all it can to fend off the unprovoked and deadly assault from Russia,” said Sen. Cardin. “As the United States continues to support Ukrainian defenses, I’m proud of the bipartisan, bicameral support our bill received to streamline the president’s ability to further bolster Ukraine’s defenses, defend innocent civilians and protect our frontline NATO allies who may be Putin’s next targets. Ukraine must prevail against this horrific Russian aggression.”“We should be doing everything possible to assist our courageous friends in Ukraine, especially as Russia launches a new phase of attacks,” Sen. Wicker said. “Enhancing our ability to loan and lease military equipment to Ukraine is essential to helping Ukraine fight back. I am glad to see the House recognize how important this measure is. Congress has done its job, and I urge President Biden to sign this bill immediately.”“Every lever must be pulled to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s campaign of terror, which is slaughtering innocent civilians and reaping destruction across Ukraine. I’m encouraged to see the number of bipartisan bills clearing Congress to that end, which now includes my legislation with Senator Cornyn to expedite the process of moving military equipment to the frontlines,” said Sen. Shaheen. “I’ll continue to work across the aisle in support of our Ukrainian partners and to hold the Kremlin accountable for its crimes against Ukraine. The U.S. must continue to lead the global response to assist Ukraine and in fierce opposition to Putin’s tyranny, which is targeting Ukraine today and continues to pose a threat to liberal democracies around the world.”In addition, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tim Scott (R-SC), Angus King (I-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Joni Ernst (R-IA).Background:As part of his Arms Export Control Act and Foreign Assistance Act authorities, the President can currently lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest. However, bureaucratic barriers and other limitations make these authorities impractical for the current crisis facing Ukraine. This enhanced lend-lease authority would be specific to Ukraine to help remove obstacles to lending arms to Ukraine. It would not create a new program but would streamline the President’s current authority to lend the defense articles necessary to defend civilian populations in Ukraine.

Well, they go to Chicago. They go to Detroit. They go to Atlanta. They go to New York. They go to San Diego. They go to virtually every community in our country.""It's not just a border problem. This affects every single community in our country.""""If the Biden Administration doesn't want to lead in the effort, at least they can allow those of us here in the Congress to come up with ideas like my bipartisan, bicameral Border Solutions Act to try to address this crisis that we cannot tolerate any longer.""WASHINGTON – Today on the floor, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) discussed the consequences of the Biden Administration’s inaction on the situation at our southern border and its impact on crime and illegal drug trafficking. Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.“An aspect of the border crisis that is not been sufficiently discussed… is the connection between the flood of illegal drugs coming across the border, not just with 100,000 drug overdose deaths we experienced in America last year, but also with crime and gangs and guns in every community across the United States.”“It seems like there's a new headline every day about acts of violence in cities across our country.”“Rising crime rates have caused many leaders to change their tune on this idea, this crazy idea called ‘Defund the Police.’”“Because defunding the police is dangerous.”“Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 200,000 migrants along the southern border last month alone, the highest number in more than two decades. The total number of migrant encounters over the last 12 months exceeds 2.2 million.”“You might be tempted to ask, ‘What in the world is going on? Why are things changing?’ I want to make one thing clear though: I'm in no way suggesting that all of these individuals coming across the border are dangerous criminals. Many of them are economic migrants looking for a better life, something we all understand.”“But there are definitely people coming across the border who are dangerous criminals primarily associated with the drug cartels who threaten public safety in every city in America every day.”“And they fight for territory, for market share. They commit other property crimes, other crimes of violence - carjacking, larceny, armed robbery - in order to fuel their need for money.”“So once cartel members and their gang associates get drugs across the border, where do they go? Well, they go to Chicago. They go to Detroit. They go to Atlanta. They go to New York. They go to San Diego. They go to virtually every community in our country where they are then distributing to people to feed addictions, which result in overdoses and death.”“It's not just a border problem. This affects every single community in our country.”“This is happening on a daily basis in every community in our country, which is contributing to the spike in violent crime and the public's reasonable concerns that they've expressed about it, including boneheaded ideas like defunding the police.”“In recent years, the number of drug overdose deaths caused by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, have skyrocketed and so have the seizures of fentanyl at the border - virtually all made from precursors from Asia, primarily China, shipped to Mexico, manufactured there in an industrial operation which can make a fentanyl tablet look a lot like some other medication that you might take.”“Many people, too many people, have died thinking they were taking a drug for some condition only to find out it was laced with fentanyl, and resulting in their drug overdose death.”“The drugs pouring across our border make this a public health crisis as well, and the criminals sneaking across our border who are distributing these drugs in our communities all across the country are a public security crisis, a public safety crisis.”“The unlicensed guns that the gangs use to protect their territory makes this a gun violence crisis as well.”“I would argue through some of the policies promulgated by Director Mayorkas that [President Biden] has actually made it worse. He's made it more attractive to come and attempt this dangerous journey from their home into the United States. He's made it easier, given the business model of the cartels, to get more of those drugs across the border and into our communities, contributing to the crime wave that's shocking so many people.”“If the Biden Administration doesn't want to lead in the effort, at least they can allow those of us here in the Congress to come up with ideas like my bipartisan, bicameral Border Solutions Act to try to address this crisis that we cannot tolerate any longer.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

This legislation provides relief to survivors without the fear of being penalized or audited,” said Sen. Cornyn. “It would also allow survivors who go through civil proceedings to receive the same treatment as those compensated through the criminal justice system. The last thing survivors should expect is to get stuck with a bill from the IRS.”“Human trafficking survivors face numerous obstacles when trying to seek justice against the perpetrators. An unexpected tax burden should not be one of them. Passage of our bill, which ends tax penalties on survivors, will help survivors afford the legal costs of punishing individuals who have committed such heinous crimes,” said Sen. Wyden.They were joined by Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Rob Portman (R-OH), Tim Scott (R-SC), James Lankford (R-OK), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) as cosponsors.Background:Under the Internal Revenue Code, civil damages awarded to human trafficking victims are considered taxable income. This legislation would exempt civil damages from federal income taxes, allowing survivors to file their taxes without worry of penalties or fees for not reporting awarded damages as income. It also would provide parity between criminal restitution, which is tax-exempt through IRS Notice 2012-12, and civil damages, which are not. Often, human trafficking survivors’ only recourse to pursue justice against traffickers is through civil litigation. Finally, the bill codifies IRS Notice 2012-12, ensuring that restitution payments made in criminal case remain tax-free.   The Human Trafficking Survivor Tax Relief Act is supported by the Freedom Network USA, the Polaris Project, & Rights4Girls. Other organizations who have supported past efforts include the End Child Pornography and Trafficking (ECPAT), the National Association to Protect Children, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), Shared Hope International, the National Children’s Alliance, Freedom Network USA, the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking (ATEST), and the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking (CAST). Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “This legislation will help bring potential conflicts of interest to light and bolster public trust in our judicial system, and I’m glad it is on its way to the President’s desk.” “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act pass the House and head to the President’s desk for signature. This law will help protect our legal system from conflicts of interest by increasing transparency around federal judges’ financial interests. It’s an important step toward ensuring equal justice under the law. I thank Senator Cornyn and Reps. Ross and Issa for their partnership in moving this legislation across the finish line, and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law,” said Sen. Coons.The legislation is cosponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Senators John Kennedy (R-LA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA).Background:The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would require that federal judges’ financial disclosure reports be made publicly available online and require federal judges to submit periodic transaction reports of securities transactions in line with other federal officials under the STOCK Act. The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously in February, would amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to:Importantly, the bill also preserves the existing ability of judges to request redactions of personal information on financial disclosure reports due to a security concern.Under current ethics guidelines and federal law, federal judges are prohibited from hearing cases that involve a party in which they, their spouse, or their minor children have a financial interest. Federal judges are instead supposed to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality may be questioned. Despite this, a recent report from the Wall Street Journal found that between 2010 and 2018, more than 130 federal judges failed to recuse themselves in nearly 700 cases in which they or an immediate family member held stock in a company involved in the case.While federal judges are required to submit financial disclosure reports, current law does not provide sufficient transparency or certainty for litigants to discern if the judge has a conflict of interest. The current process for obtaining judicial financial disclosure forms can be cumbersome and take months or even years. By contrast, financial disclosure reports for the President, Members of Congress, and Presidential-appointed and Senate-confirmed officials are readily available online.Litigants need real-time access to judges’ financial disclosures and securities transactions in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and ensure a recusal when there’s a potential conflict of interest in their case. The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would enact necessary updates to disclosure rules and provide litigants and the public with greater confidence in the judicial system.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

I’m beyond relieved Trevor will return home to his family in Texas, who were relentless in the fight to secure his release and never gave up hope.“I applaud the President and the State Department officials who worked behind the scenes to secure Trevor’s release, as well as Congressmen Pfluger and McCaul for their efforts to keep pressure on the Administration.”Sen. Cornyn has previously met with the Reeds and repeatedly pressed the Biden Administration to secure Trevor’s release. On February 22, 2021, Sen. Cornyn introduced a Senate resolution calling for his immediate release.  It also called for release of all political prisoners, condemned politically motivated imprisonment in the Russian Federation, demanded that the Russian government respect Trevor Reed’s human rights, and expressed support for the Reed family.

James Lankford (R-OK) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) to introduce the Public Health and Border Security Act to require all COVID-19 related national states of emergency to be lifted before Title 42 is officially terminated. The legislation was supported by Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), John Thune (R-SD), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Thom Tillis (R-NC).“If Title 42 is eliminated, the Border Patrol tell me they will lose control, and the drug cartels stand to benefit the most,” said Sen. Cornyn. “With border crossings already at historic highs and those communities completely overwhelmed, it is imperative that there is a realistic plan in place to address the inevitable migrant influx. We need to enforce our existing immigration laws and deter migrants from undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States, but this decision by Biden Administration shows no interest in doing so.”Background:This legislation prevents the Administration from ending the Title 42 emergency authority until at least 60 days after ending the COVID-19 national emergency declaration. After the end of the national emergency, the Department of Homeland Security would have thirty days to submit to Congress a plan to address the impacts of the post-Title 42 migrant influx. That plan must be made in coordination with local governments, federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations on the front-lines of the migrant crisis.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

We've also got to make a judgment whether she will leave her personal beliefs and policy preferences at the door and whether she will respect the bounds of her role as a judge or attempt to establish new judge-made law. This last point is absolutely critical in my view.”“I think this is a blind spot for Judge Jackson and, frankly, many on the bench, particularly at the highest levels. Over the years, we've come to see a pattern of judges who embrace the concept of judge-made law.”“Justices on the Supreme Court are not held accountable at the ballot box, and they aren't evaluated every few years for their job performance. They're nominated by the President and confirmed for a lifetime appointment.”“She stopped the Administration from enacting immigration policies it had clear authority to implement according to the black letter law.

That's the word she used - for ‘policy’ reasons - and she chose to disregard its application. That's not staying in your lane.”“She also used a compassionate release motion to retroactively slash a dangerous drug dealer's criminal sentence because she didn't like that the government brought a mandatory minimum drug charge, even though the government had every right to do so under the applicable law.”“The promise of equal justice under law requires judges to follow the law regardless of their own personal feelings about the policies.”“Judge Jackson will attempt to use her vast legal skills to deliver specific results and get outside of her lane by making judge-made laws that are not supported by the text of the Constitution itself.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

The bill would build off the existing Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program to create a dedicated stream of funding to local and state law enforcement agencies to train their officers and the mental health professionals who work with them in de-escalation tactics, alternatives to use of force, safely responding to mental, behavioral, and suicidal crises, successfully participating on a crisis intervention team, and making referrals to community-based mental and behavioral health services and support and other social programs.“We ask law enforcement in our communities to wear too many hats, including that of mental health provider, and they often do not have enough resources or training to provide the level of care individuals in crisis need,” said Sen. Cornyn. “We must give them the necessary tools so officers feel supported while helping those experiencing mental health emergencies and other crises, and this legislation would do just that.”“Too often, police respond when someone is suffering a mental health or behavioral health issue, yet lack the resources they need to do so effectively. We can save lives by equipping officers to recognize and respond appropriately to those situations, to work with mental health professionals, and connect people to treatment,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “I’m pleased to join with Senator Cornyn on this important bill.”Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Coons (D-DE), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined as original cosponsors of the bill, which would empower police and the mental health professionals working with them to link individuals to mental and behavioral health services in their community.Background:Police are often on the front lines of behavioral and mental health and substance use crises. Studies estimate that as many as six to 10 percent of law enforcement encounters involve persons experiencing serious mental illnesses. Currently, people in crisis account for between 25-50 percent of fatalities during law enforcement encounters. Navigating an encounter with a person experiencing serious mental illness or substance use is challenging, but there are solutions that can protect the safety of people in crisis, law enforcement officers, and bystanders. Training in de-escalation tactics and other techniques can reduce excessive force complaints and fatalities during law enforcement encounters, and crisis intervention teams can improve outcomes. Law enforcement agencies across the country are seeking resources to conduct trainings in these techniques and practices.The bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act would:The bill is endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, Major County Sheriffs of America, Major Cities Chiefs Association, National Criminal Justice Association, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, National Association of Counties, American Psychological Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Counseling Association, National Register of Health Service Psychologists, American Association of Suicidology, College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists, American Association on Health and Disability, Lakeshore Foundation, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, National Association for Rural Mental Health, National Federation of Families, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, and the Niskanen Center.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “This legislation provides much needed flexibility in how that relief funding can be used which is crucial for local leaders as they invest in the areas they know best. I’m glad to see this commonsense and bipartisan solution be included so communities can make the most of the funding they have already received without further delay.” Background:Given that the American Rescue Plan Act made water, wastewater, and broadband infrastructure eligible for COVID funds, the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Fiscal Recovery, Infrastructure, and Disaster Relief Flexibility Act would provide additional flexibility for States, Tribes, and units of local government to spend their allocations of the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. It gives state and local officials additional flexibility to responsibly spend their own funds. There is a cap—the greater of $10 million or 30% of the funds—on how much of the COVID money can be spent on these new purposes (though the previous ARP set asides for water, wastewater, and broadband remain unrestricted). The bill also allows these funds to be used to provide emergency relief from natural disasters and creates a process for local officials to decline funds if their jurisdictions did not suffer budget shortfalls during COVID, an option not currently available to them under the American Rescue Plan.

She says she doesn't have one and hasn't thought much about it. That's simply not a credible response.”“Judge Jackson has a marvelous legal education. She's a charming person. She has a vast practical experience - something I think is a real plus - having served as a public defender, a federal district judge, and a circuit court judge, and not just an academician. Someone of her impressive caliber surely has a judicial philosophy.”“My concerns were further elevated as I reviewed Judge Jackson's record, and I saw examples of activism bleeding over in her decisions.”“It's crucial that we use these proceedings to understand if a judge will truly stay in their lane or whether they will attempt to legislate from the bench and deliver what Justice Biden and his Democratic colleagues are unable to achieve through the legislative process.”“A judge must call balls and strikes, and given what I've seen and her unwillingness to disclose her judicial philosophy and disavow an expansionist view of unenumerated rights, I have concerns that Judge Jackson will be pinch hitting for one team or the other. I will vote no.” Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.On President Biden Eliminating Title 42:“You and I are still required - when we fly on an airplane or take public transportation - to wear masks because that's what the Transportation Security Administration has ordered. I heard the Congresswoman say we need to follow the science, but frankly it's contradictory, the messages we are getting from the Administration.”“And, really, the point is here, if you eliminate Title 42, this is the last tool that's been available to Border Patrol to try and maintain some semblance of order on the border. And if you eliminate Title 42, the Border Patrol tells me they will lose control, and the people who will benefit the most are the drug cartels.”“We need to enforce our existing immigration laws and do it aggressively, but the Biden Administration shows no interest in doing so.”On the Russian Invasion of Ukraine & Vladimir Putin:“I am for giving the Ukrainians anything they can use and as fast as we can get it there. That's the message we had from President Zelensky time after time, and that's the message we got when I visited Poland and Germany with a bipartisan group of Senators a couple of weeks ago.”“We can't dither and worry about some of the niceties here when the Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives, and if they feel like they need to take out a fuel depot across the Russian border, go for it.”“The Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives, and I would give them everything they need faster than we are right now.”“I wouldn't trust Vladimir Putin any farther than I could throw him. I think that's really the answer, because Putin is a killer. He's a thug. He has a vision of restoring the Russian empire, the fall of which he said was the greatest geopolitical tragedy in the last hundred years. So I wouldn't trust Vladimir Putin for a minute.”On the Midterm Elections:“I think we know what the problems are right now. We know that inflation is undermining the standard of living of Americans across the country, including the people on fixed income and at the lower-end of the income scale.”“We know that violent crime has spiked because of the disrespect that the far-left has shown the police, including this ‘Defund the Police’ movement, which has killed morale and made it harder for the police to do their job.”“And we know the border is on fire, and of course, now we have an invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin. I think we got a lot to pay attention to. And, to me, those would be the issues that would drive our agenda when we get back in the majority.” Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

I told Judge Jackson it's deeply concerning to me and to the people I represent that five unelected and unaccountable Justices could upend the will of the people by invalidating laws or inventing a new right out of whole cloth.”“Judge Jackson previously suggested she didn't have a judicial philosophy at all, something I find impossible to believe with somebody with this sort of experience, and background, and incredibly impressive education. ““During her confirmation hearing, she failed to provide much clarity beyond offering vague statements about her methodology. But a methodology is not a philosophy. We need a clear understanding of how Judge Jackson views judge-made law.”“As I reviewed Judge Jackson's record, I saw some examples of activism bleeding through her decisions.”“One of Judge Jackson's opinions from her time on the D.C. District Court demonstrates the serious concerns I have about her ability to follow the letter of the law as expressed by Congress, as opposed to her personal preferences. In the case Make the Road NY v. McAleenan, a progressive organization challenged the Trump Administration regulation of expedited removal proceedings for people who illegally enter our country without the appropriate paperwork.”“Judge Jackson, who presided over this case, decidedly did not stay in her lane. She went beyond the unambiguous text to deliver a political win to a progressive group and, in the process, entered an injunction barring the use of this tool that's needed by the Border Patrol and immigration authorities in order to deter people from violating our immigration laws.”“Unsurprisingly, her decision was appealed and ultimately overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court. I think this is a clear-cut example of Judge Jackson ignoring the law as written in order to achieve a result that she preferred.”“If given a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, I have to wonder how many other laws would Judge Jackson ignore? How many other precedents would she seek to overturn simply because she doesn't agree with them?”“We have the responsibility to determine whether a nominee understands the important but limited role of federal judges and can be expected to act with restraint, fairness, impartiality, and, ultimately, in the best interest of the American people.”“Ultimately, I fear Judge Jackson has a blind spot when it comes to judge-made law, and she would use her seat on the Supreme Court to create new rights out of whole cloth and engage in result-oriented decision-making.”“For that reason, I will oppose Judge Jackson's confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Doss Memorial Act, which would rename the U.S. Border Patrol Station in Rocksprings, Texas in Agent Doss’s honor:   “Officers like Agent Doss who are lost in the line of duty remind us of the courageous sacrifices that law enforcement, and their families, make each day,” said Sen. Cornyn. “Known for her commitment to public safety and her family, I’m proud to see that Agent Doss’ legacy of service to Texas will live on at the Border Patrol Station in Rocksprings in her honor.” “Donna Doss valiantly served our country as a Border Patrol Agent for nearly 16 years and was tragically killed in the line of duty in 2019,” said Rep. Arrington. “Like many of her colleagues in law enforcement, Donna Doss is a hero for her courageous service to our country and sacrificed for her fellow man.” “Agent Doss embodied a life driven by public service and a commitment to her community, to Texas and to our country,” said Rep. Gonzales. “Her death is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices our men and women in green - and their families - make every day. I am proud to have her legacy live on in our district by renaming the Rocksprings Border Patrol station in her honor.” Background:Agent Doss had served more than 15 years in the Border Patrol when she was killed in the line of duty on February 2, 2019 after she was struck by a vehicle in Tye, Texas. Sen. Cornyn honored Agent Doss on the Senate floor following her tragic death in February 2019 and first introduced this bill in September 2020. This legislation is supported by the National Border Patrol Council and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA).Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn said. “I’m looking forward to reauthorizing this critical legislation so it can continue to help communities eradicate human trafficking on their streets and get survivors the assistance they need to rebuild their lives.”“As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the horrors of human trafficking,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will provide prosecutors and law enforcement with the training and tools they need to combat these terrible crimes, while strengthening critical programs that help identify and support survivors and victims.” Background:The Abolish Human Trafficking Act was signed into law in 2018, and this reauthorization would extend critical programs through 2027 to help combat modern-day slavery. Additionally, it establishes confidentiality protections for victims, prioritizes cybersecurity enforcement, funds prevention research, creates a victim assistance program within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), provides funding to states who treat and prevent trafficking within their foster systems, authorizes funding at the Department of Health and Human Services and at DHS, and mandates that the FBI use multidisciplinary teams when interviewing victims of child sexual abuse and trafficking.This reauthorization also extends the life of the Department of Justice Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund, financed through fines on convicted human traffickers and sexual predators and through an annual allotment from the Community Health Centers Fund. It would reauthorize key Trafficking Victims Protection Act programs that fund restorative services for victims and law enforcement anti-trafficking operations.This legislation is endorsed by the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN), Shared Hope International, Rights 4 Girls, Covenant House, Amirah, Human Rights for Kids, the National Children’s Alliance, ECPAT-USA, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, the National District Attorneys Association, and Thistle Farms.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “By increasing coordination between federal agencies and states, we can help ensure vulnerable children remain in a safe home instead of falling through the cracks.”“Too many of our foster youth face difficult experiences and go missing while in foster care. That’s unacceptable and must change. Making sure our children have a safe place to call home isn’t a partisan issue. I am pleased to partner with Senators Cornyn and Grassley on this bipartisan legislation,” said Sen. Stabenow.“The number of missing foster youth is deeply disturbing. We have a responsibility to ensure children in our foster care system are kept safe. Our bipartisan proposal will improve communication among relevant state and federal agencies to protect vulnerable children,” Sen. Grassley said.Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson (TX-30) and Tony Gonzalez (TX-23) will be introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.Background:States are currently required by law to implement plans to prevent, mitigate, and find cases of missing foster youth, but tens of thousands of foster children have gone missing in the last two decades. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services disclosed that more than 2,000 children in its care were reported missing in FY2020 alone.Increasing communication between states and the Administration of Children and Families’ (ACF) capacity building center would allow them to use real-life experiences to inform the assistance they provide to child protective service agencies. In addition, the legislation would require ACF to report to Congress on progress being made to find missing foster youth and prevent runaways.This legislation is endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

It was heartwarming to see how they have opened their hearts, doors, and homes to the women and children, the elderly and infirm trying to make their way out of Ukraine for safety,” said Sen. Cornyn. “Ukrainians are showing great courage, but one thing we heard is that they need more humanitarian relief and weapons to defend themselves and their country. We ought to provide the Ukrainians what we know they need, and that was a subject of intense questioning and discussion during our visit.”Yesterday, Sen. Cornyn joined Fox News’ America’s Newsroom to discuss the trip and future support for Ukraine. You can view the entire interview here.Background:The bipartisan delegation engaged with military leaders from United States Army Europe-Africa (USAREUR-AF) in Wiesbaden, Germany about the United States’ and NATO alliances’ commitment to freedom over tyranny. Sen. Cornyn had the opportunity to thank Texans serving overseas in Germany.From there, the delegation met with U.S. officials in Berlin at the U.S. Embassy to get an up-to-date brief on American-German long-term economic and security cooperation goalsIn Berlin, the group of bipartisan senators discussed our continued security partnership with German State Secretary of the Federal Foreign Office Andreas Michaelis. The members met with German Parliamentarians over dinner in Berlin.The next day, the senators had a security briefing with U.S. Army leadership in Poland and learned more about their effort to assist and deter Russia from further aggression. The military leaders then led a roundtable discussion with the senators, NATO allied military leaders, and non-government organizations (NGOs) helping with the humanitarian needs in Ukraine and throughout Europe. The bipartisan delegation visited a refugee processing center near the Ukrainian-Polish border where they saw firsthand how organizations are working with the Polish military and government to care for Ukrainians who’ve fled their homes.The final stop in Poland was a discussion with members of Ukrainian civil society. This included a group of passionate women who provided a clear message to the senators: Ukraine needs more military and lethal aid to win this fight. Sen. Cornyn discussed his Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act during this meeting as an additional effort to support Ukraine with military equipment. Included in the meeting were State Department officials originally stationed at Embassy Kyiv.On the last day of the CODEL, the 10 senators visited a U.S. Army base in Grafenwohr, Germany. They received a firsthand briefing of the military mission, met with constituents from each of the states represented on the CODEL, and saw the might of the U.S. Army in action.The bipartisan CODEL returned to the United States late on Sunday, March 20.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

On the campaign trail, President Biden refused to disavow court-packing. Two years ago, the Democratic Leader of the Senate went to the Supreme Court steps and threatened two sitting Supreme Court Justices by name if they did not rule in a particular way.

It amends the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to allow U.S. Border Patrol agents to receive time and a half for hours worked between 80 and 100 hours during 14 consecutive days.“Now more than ever, our border patrol agents put their lives at risk every day they put on their uniform,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The dedicated men and women who are sworn to protect and secure our border should be justly compensated, particularly as they work around the clock to keep our communities safe. While long overdue, it is crucial that the U.S. Border Patrol can focus on recruiting, retaining, and training the best agents that are paid comparably to their federal law enforcement counterparts.”“Ensuring our Border Patrol Agents receive fair overtime pay strengthens recruitment and retention and helps keep our border secure. We’ll continue working across the aisle to support our Border Patrol and keep Arizona families and communities safe and secure,” said Sen. Sinema, Chair of the Senate Border Management Subcommittee.“The men and women serving our nation as Border Patrol officers are working around the clock to protect our nation by securing our border. I’ve heard firsthand from Border Patrol agents at a muster earlier this year about the roadblocks they face,” said Sen. Lankford. “Unfortunately, this Administration has handcuffed them from actually doing their job. They’ve taken these men and women who are law enforcement and turned them into hotel-check-in. But, even when morale is down they are still working twice as hard to ensure the job is done right—and often put in hours of overtime on a regular basis. They deserve to ensure their being adequately compensated for the hard work they’re doing on our border.” “The hardworking men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol are frequently working overtime to keep our communities safe but don’t see the same pay benefits as other federal law enforcement. As we continue to deal with the crisis at our southern border, our legislation will improve border security by boosting the U.S. Border Patrol’s continued efforts to hire and retain talented agents,” said Sen. Kelly.This legislation is supported by the National Border Patrol Council:“I want to personally thank Senators Cornyn and Sinema for their leadership on this issue,” said Brandon Judd, National President of the National Border Patrol Council.  “The most important element in securing our border are our Border Patrol Agents.  The investments in fencing, drones, and sensors are important; however, without highly motivated Border Patrol Agents to track and apprehend illegal immigrants and drug smugglers none of these other investments matter.  Right now, Border Patrol does not have pay parity with our sister agencies in the federal government.  This despite the fact our agents, who are often alone or are routinely outnumbered, work in some of the toughest environments imaginable.  This legislation will restore that parity we lost during the Obama Administration and help us to recruit and retain the best of America in our ranks.”     Contact Senator Cornyn ©2022 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

They were joined by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV).“For more than five years, these grants have been supporting law enforcement as they assist individuals suffering from mental illness in our criminal justice system and on our streets,” said Sen. Cornyn. “We cannot let these important programs that have given help and hope to so many lapse, and I’m grateful to my colleagues for joining with us on this.”“As a former prosecutor, I’ve seen firsthand how public safety is improved by collaboration between law enforcement and mental health providers,” said Sen. Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that we have the training and resources to address mental health issues at all stages of the justice system, from equipping law enforcement to effectively respond to mental health calls to facilitating smooth reentry into society. It’s critical that our justice system provides people with the support they need.”“Encouraging treatment and supporting those struggling with mental health challenges in the criminal justice system is critical in improving outcomes for those individuals, protecting public safety and supporting our police officers. This legislation updates successful initiatives, such as mental health courts, crisis intervention teams and training for law enforcement. These programs have proven effective in the past, and Congress’s continued support can save lives. I look forward to working with Sen. Cornyn to make this bipartisan bill law,” said Sen. Grassley.“By taking a holistic approach to criminal justice, the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program has been a lifeline for many individuals struggling with their mental health. We’ve seen JMHCP initiatives – like crisis intervention teams, mental health courts, and training for local police – significantly improve the outcomes for people with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, and it’s essential that these programs remain up and running,” said Sen. Durbin. “Today’s bipartisan Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act ensures that individuals have access to these options and expands mental health crisis resources to address each emergency call appropriately.”“When police encounter people facing mental health crises, arrest and incarceration aren’t always right,” said Sen. Whitehouse.  “This legislation will equip communities, local law enforcement, and others with resources to work with people in crisis and keep our first responders and communities safe.  I’m glad to partner with Senator Cornyn on another smart, bipartisan reform to our criminal justice system.”“Law Enforcement Officers frequently encounter individuals experiencing mental health illness and we must provide them the necessary tools to provide assistance. The JMHCP will also ensure that grant funding is available for our veteran treatment programs and mental health courts to ensure individuals have accessible treatment and support services,” said Sen. Tillis. “I am proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation that will reauthorize these important grants that directs resources for those individuals in need.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges and substance use disorders across our communities. As we recover from this public health crisis, it is critical that our local communities have the resources they need to support individuals battling mental health issues,” said Sen. Collins. “By reauthorizing the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program, this bill would help increase law enforcement training and strengthen crisis intervention programs to help provide individuals with mental health disorders with the appropriate treatment and services.”“This bipartisan legislation will help state and local governments more effectively respond to and treat individuals experiencing a mental health crisis,” said Sen. Cortez Masto. “By taking proactive, commonsense steps to provide 24/7 meaningful crisis intervention and other critical mental health services like the 988 crisis hotline, we can help keep Nevadans safe.”Background:The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act would reauthorize the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program (JMHCP) and make several improvements to provide grantees with greater options to respond and treat individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. The bill would:In 2004, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act (MIOTCRA) created the JMHCP to help states and counties design and implement collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health systems. JMHCP grants have funded mental health courts and other court-based initiatives, diversion and deflection programs, crisis intervention teams, training for local police departments, and other programs to improve outcomes for people with mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders who come into contact with the criminal justice system. JMHCP has provided a total of 568 grants to 49 states along with the District of Columbia, Guam, and American Samoa.JMHCP was most recently reauthorized in 2016 as the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act, which was introduced by Sen. Cornyn. Provisions from this bill were signed into law as part of the 21st Century Cures Act.The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act is supported by the National Criminal Justice Association, American Correctional Association, American Legion, National Council for Mental Wellbeing, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), National Association of Social Workers (NASW), National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), National Association of Drug Court Professionals, Mental Health America (MHA), Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA), National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), National District Attorneys Association (NDAA), American Psychiatric Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Psychological Association, National Association of Counties (NACo), Major Cities Chiefs Association, National Sheriffs' Association, Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA), National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, National Association for Behavioral Healthcare (NABH), Correctional Leaders Association, American Jail Association, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

It wasn't about actually getting anything done. It was about messaging.”“Then they threw it in cruise control this fall, refusing to let the Senate vote on anything other than low-level nominees and, again, those messaging bills.”“Well, unsurprisingly, this partisan approach to governing - despite the fact that we have an evenly-divided Senate and perhaps even an evenly-divided government - this partisan approach, unsurprisingly, did not lead to great results.”“Our colleagues, though, do control the Senate, the House, and the White House, and every aspect of the legislative process is under their control. So they bear responsibility for the delay in the defense authorization bill, they bear responsibility for not passing regular appropriations, and they bear responsibility for these concerns that have been expressed by reaching the debt limit.”“Presented with this reality of an evenly-split Congress, our colleagues can make a choice whether to try to work together and build consensus and do things that can actually pass, or continue down this pathway of purely partisan attempts to legislate.

Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.“What they've basically done is to create the illusion of a lower price tag without making any real, substantive long-term cuts. And how do you do that? Well, it's the old-fashioned way.

It's starting new programs, claiming to cut them off after a year, knowing that inevitably Congress will be tempted to extend them much, much longer.”“We need to know precisely how much this bill will cost the American people.

I began 2021 with this promise to Texans: to push back against Democrats’ dangerous proposals when needed and to work together wherever possible. The year brought a heavy dose of both.Despite President Joe Biden’s pledge to be the dealmaker-in-chief, Democrats have unleashed a parade of partisan bills. At the start of last year, they went around Republicans to spend nearly $2 trillion billed as “pandemic relief,” even though less than ten percent of the funding was directly related to COVID-19 and only one percent supported vaccinations. They’ve made repeated attempts to seize states’ constitutional power to manage their own elections and skew all future elections in Democrats’ favor. And despite the fact that families are footing the bill for the highest inflation in nearly four decades, Democrats are trying to go on a nearly $5 trillion reckless tax-and-spending spree. Fortunately, they don’t have the votes to write a check that big, thanks to members of President Biden’s own party joining the unified Republican opposition.I’ve been clear in my fierce opposition to each of these bills, but I know that Texans did not send me to the Senate to simply vote “no.” While I will continue to fight legislation that harms families, the economy, or our national security, there are plenty of issues where Republicans and Democrats can work together, and I was proud to act on those opportunities in 2021 and get critical legislation signed into law.After years of fighting alongside advocates in Texas, including my friend Ms. Opal Lee of Fort Worth, I was proud that, we succeeded in making Juneteenth a federal holiday. For generations to come, folks across the country will celebrate the significance of the day Major General Gordon Granger’s troops arrived in Galveston and declared that all slaves are “forever free.”Another new law strengthens the policies and procedures for reporting missing service members. The need for this legislation became clear after the tragic murders of Spc. Vanessa Guillén, Sgt. Elder Fernandes and other service members across the country. Military installations are now required to increase security and protection protocols for reporting service members missing or AWOL, and improve information sharing with local, state and federal law enforcement if a service member goes missing. This isn’t a silver bullet, but it’s a big step toward preventing similar tragedies in the future.Bills to modernize and increase staffing at our ports of entry without spending taxpayer dollars. To ensure anyone who attacks federal officers and employees serving abroad will be brought to justice. To close a loophole abused by companies fueling the opioid epidemic. To help victims of human trafficking regain their financial independence. All of these bipartisan bills I introduced were signed into law last year.Despite the partisanship that has gripped Washington, I’ve found countless opportunities to get things done for Texas, but a great deal of work remains.This past year, annual border crossings hit an all-time high, and law enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, and border communities are being overwhelmed by the scale of the humanitarian crisis. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in our supply chains that need to be addressed. Families are struggling to cover high costs at the pharmacy – even for medications that have been available for decades. I’ve introduced bipartisan bills aimed at these and countless other challenges facing our country. I hope we can make progress on those bills this year and notch even more bipartisan wins for Texas.In 2022, I’ll keep searching for opportunities to reach across the aisle on legislation. I hope my colleagues will make an effort to do the same no matter if there’s an “R” or a “D” after their names.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

It ensures that a consumer reporting agency (CRA) will not furnish a consumer report containing adverse information about a consumer that resulted from a severe form of human trafficking or debt bondage.In a situation where the Debt Bondage Repair Act applies, the agency or court will determine which debts are the result of trafficking or debt bondage to ensure a consumer is not provided a clean slate for unrelated debts. To ensure that only those who are victims can utilize the benefits of this legislation, determinations can only be made by federal, state, or tribal government entities or a court of competent jurisdiction.This legislation is supported by numerous trafficking advocacy groups, including Shared Hope International, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, and Polaris.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.“I want to look back over some of the deadlines that the Majority Leader, the Senator from New York, has set for Senate action, and to ask whether these sort of arbitrary deadlines and attempts to do legislation essentially along party lines is the right way to actually get things done.”“When one party or the other attempts to do things unilaterally, it usually means what you see here, which is one blown self-imposed deadline after another.”“Our colleague from New York keeps setting deadlines and blowing right past them, and it looks like he's about to add another one to the list.”“Senator Schumer's latest deadline for the Build Back Bankrupt bill is December 25. That's Christmas. And while he has yet to make an official announcement, news reports are starting to confirm what we've known all along: that the Senate will not vote on this bill by Christmas.”“They've got a lot of roadblocks to overcome.”“The Congressional Budget Office now says this legislation, if in place for a full ten years, would cost $4.9 trillion. That's on top of the almost $2 trillion our colleagues spent unilaterally earlier in this year.”“It would give massive tax breaks to the wealthy while increasing taxes on the middle class, it would literally cut funding for safety net hospitals and drive the national debt to unimaginable heights, and finally, and maybe most importantly, it would hand to the federal government decisions that should be made by families.”“The Democratic Leader is on track to miss yet another deadline.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Cornyn. “For Texas, the expiration of this program would restrict access to funding for lane operations, and disrupt construction of new lanes and inspection booths. This would translate to serious negative consequences for regional economic recovery, the ongoing global supply chain crisis, and public safety.”“I've been proud to work with business and community leaders to build public-private partnerships and secure millions of dollars in federal funds to facilitate international trade at New Mexico’s ports of entry. We must remain focused on building on our recent successes, like those at the Santa Teresa port of entry, and make sure New Mexico’s vibrant border communities and growing ports of entry have the resources they need to thrive,” said Sen. Heinrich. “This bipartisan legislation will reauthorize the Donations Acceptance Program and strengthen our ports of entry. I’m proud to secure this language in the FY22 NDAA and will keep fighting for forward-looking infrastructure investments in every corner of New Mexico.”“Allowing Arizona communities to assist and improve our ports of entry operations will help us secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and fuel our economy,” said Sen. Sinema. Background:The program allows for public-private partnerships at U.S. Ports of Entry and allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to accept donations of property and technology to more efficiently secure the border and process trade. First established by Sen. Cornyn’s bipartisan Cross Border Trade Enhancement Act in 2016, this program has supported daily operations at multiple Ports of Entry.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Unfortunately, we've seen a lot of wasted valuable time, the ignoring of critical tasks, and failing to meet some of the most basic requirements of governing.”“Our colleagues used the first few months of the year to ram through a partisan $2 trillion spending bill, and then they wasted the summer on the Majority Leader's designed-to-fail agenda. It wasn't about actually getting anything done. It was about messaging.”“Then they threw it in cruise control this fall, refusing to let the Senate vote on anything other than low-level nominees and, again, those messaging bills.”“Well, unsurprisingly, this partisan approach to governing - despite the fact that we have an evenly-divided Senate and perhaps even an evenly-divided government - this partisan approach, unsurprisingly, did not lead to great results.”“Our colleagues, though, do control the Senate, the House, and the White House, and every aspect of the legislative process is under their control. So they bear responsibility for the delay in the defense authorization bill, they bear responsibility for not passing regular appropriations, and they bear responsibility for these concerns that have been expressed by reaching the debt limit.”“Presented with this reality of an evenly-split Congress, our colleagues can make a choice whether to try to work together and build consensus and do things that can actually pass, or continue down this pathway of purely partisan attempts to legislate.

Please call the Harlingen office at 956-423-0162 or the Houston office at 713-572-3337 for updated address information.  Return to Newsroom ArticlesToday the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, legislation from Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Coons (D-DE) to require online publication of financial disclosure reports for federal judges and mandate that federal judges submit periodic transaction reports for certain securities transactions.“Federal judges were wrongly excluded from the disclosure requirements put in place by the STOCK Act, which helps bolster public trust in our institutions,” said Sen. Cornyn. “I applaud my colleagues in the House for moving my legislation, which would help prevent conflicts of interest and ensure federal judges are subject to the same level of transparency as other officials.”“Every litigant deserves to have confidence that they will receive a fair hearing with an unbiased judge when they get their day in court,” said Sen. Coons. “I commend the House of Representatives for overwhelmingly passing this necessary legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass our bill and put it on the President’s desk.”Background:The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would require that federal judges’ financial disclosure reports be made publicly available online and require federal judges to submit periodic transaction reports of securities transactions in line with other federal officials under the STOCK Act. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate last October, would amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to:Importantly, the bill also preserves the existing ability of judges to request redactions of personal information on financial disclosure reports due to a security concern.Under current ethics guidelines and federal law, federal judges are prohibited from hearing cases that involve a party in which they, their spouse, or their minor children have a financial interest. Federal judges are instead supposed to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality may be questioned. Despite this, a recent report from the Wall Street Journal found that between 2010 and 2018, more than 130 federal judges failed to recuse themselves in nearly 700 cases in which they or an immediate family member held stock in a company involved in the case.While federal judges are required to submit financial disclosure reports, current law does not provide sufficient transparency or certainty for litigants to discern if the judge has a conflict of interest. The current process for obtaining judicial financial disclosure forms can be cumbersome and take months or even years. By contrast, financial disclosure reports for the President, Members of Congress, and Presidential-appointed and Senate-confirmed officials are readily available online.Litigants need real-time access to judges’ financial disclosures and securities transactions in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and ensure a recusal when there’s a potential conflict of interest in their case. The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would enact necessary updates to disclosure rules and provide litigants and the public with greater confidence in the judicial system.Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.“What they've basically done is to create the illusion of a lower price tag without making any real, substantive long-term cuts. And how do you do that? Well, it's the old-fashioned way. It's called budget gimmicks.”“Rather than remove these expensive programs entirely, they've chose to create a number of arbitrary cliffs, sunsets, and expirations. That way, they could pretend to pass these bills at a lower cost with the tacit promise to continue them at another time and another day.”“It's smoke and mirrors. It's budget gimmickry. It's starting new programs, claiming to cut them off after a year, knowing that inevitably Congress will be tempted to extend them much, much longer.”“We need to know precisely how much this bill will cost the American people. We know that our colleagues across the aisle have struggled to try to make a $6 trillion bill appear to be a $3.5 trillion and now a $1.75 trillion, but I don't think anybody is really fooled.”“The cost estimate provided by the CBO, we know - given these phony assumptions - is not an accurate statement of the true cost of the bill.”“The budget experts at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business have analyzed this legislation as if these temporary provisions would be made permanent, which I think is the safest assumption to make.”“So instead of $1.75 trillion, they pegged the cost close to $4.6 trillion over ten years.”“Last week I sent a letter to the leaders of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation requesting an updated estimate based on more reasonable assumptions. If the temporary provisions of this bill are extended, and I fully expect them to be if our Democratic colleagues have the votes to do it, this legislation will cost a whole lot more than what the American people have been told.” Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

Excerpts of Sen. Cornyn’s remarks are below, and video can be found here.“This year our Democratic colleagues, who control the Senate agenda, have ignored some of the Senate's most important and basic responsibilities, leaving us with a whole lot to do and not a whole lot of time in which to do it.”“In September, when the Senate should have passed a group of bills to fund the government for the next fiscal year, our colleagues instead kicked the can down the road.”“Instead, our Democratic colleagues found time for partisan dead-on-arrival messaging bills, while they failed to bring a single appropriations bill to the floor with a December the 3rd deadline.”“At some point in the coming days, weeks, or months, we don't know exactly when - only Secretary Yellen knows - the U.S. will run up against the debt limit.”“Democrats had a clear road map and ample time to increase the debt ceiling on their own and avoid a financial crisis, but they stubbornly refused. They said they didn't have enough time. Well, they don't have that excuse now.”“If our Democratic colleagues want to exclude Republicans and continue spending on a purely partisan basis, they will have to raise the debt ceiling in a partisan fashion.”“Before the Senate addresses either one of these crises, there's another item on the agenda: the National Defense Authorization Act.”“This bill has been waiting in the wings for months, ready for floor action, and both the Chairman of the Armed Service Committee and the Ranking Member have had to push the Majority Leader to actually bring this to the Senate floor, even at this late date.”“So two weeks ago before the Thanksgiving holidays, the Senate finally began consideration of the Defense Authorization Act.”“The fact it has not been done yet is simply inexplicable.”“Our Democratic colleagues are laser-focused on their multitrillion dollar tax-and-spending spree. After months of party infighting and countless iterations of this bill, the Democratic leaders in the House, most notably Speaker Pelosi, finally managed to pass a partisan version of this bill. They couldn't even convince every Democrat to vote for the bill.”“The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business pegs the price close to $4.6 trillion over ten years. That's the budget window, more than two and a half times the amount Democrats have previously stated. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget agrees with that estimate. They estimate that the true cost of this bill would be approximately $5 trillion over the next ten years.”“Of course, that flies in the face of President Biden's estimate that it would cost nothing.”“Last week, I sent a letter to the leaders of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation requesting a true cost estimate for this bill. The American people deserve a full and complete picture of a real-world price of this legislation.”“Our Democratic colleagues control the Senate agenda. They control the House, and they control the White House. They control every lever in the legislative process here in Washington, D.C., and this is how they've chosen to use that power.”Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."

The NSTC and NAPMP will be essential to maintaining an edge in semiconductor manufacturing leadership and hugely impactful to the region where it is established, creating a larger cluster of semiconductor investment.They wrote: “With a vibrant and long-standing space, defense, telecommunications industry, and manufacturing history, Texas is uniquely situated to foster the innovative environment in which the NSTC and NAPMP can thrive with broad engagement from chipmakers, material and equipment suppliers, chip customers, universities, research institutes and existing government partners.”“You will not find a better state in which to establish the National Semiconductor Technology Center and National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program. We strongly endorse selecting Texas as the future sites for the NSTC and NAPMP.” The full text of the letter can be found here and below.The Honorable Gina RaimondoSecretary of CommerceU.S. Department of Commerce1401 Constitution Ave, NWWashington, DC 20230November 24, 2021Dear Secretary Raimondo:We write to urge you to consider selecting Texas for the future sites of the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) and National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP) established in Sec. 9906 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283). The tech industry is big in Texas- especially in Austin where the Department’s Commercial Service office is located. The Lone Star State’s strong, well-established information technology (IT) sector has given our State a global reputation as a leader in technology. The State government has recently announced the creation of a Texas Task Force to coordinate this effort.The history of semiconductors is incomplete without Texans. From the 1958 invention of the integrated circuit in Dallas to the revitalization of the U.S. semiconductor market in the 1980s at SEMATECH in Austin, our State has a rich history as a leader in semiconductors since the industry’s inception.  Texas is home to over 200 semiconductor installations employing over 40,000 at some of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.Now home to the international headquarters for Oracle in Austin and HPE in Houston, along with significant expansion by Google, Apple, Amazon, Wipro, Microsoft, Dell and Tesla, Texas has developed a synergy with leaders in innovation. For 14 years, it has ranked among the top two states for the number of technology-related patent assignees.Centrally located both nationally and within the state itself, Austin has multiple Tier I research institutions from which to draw talent.  In fact, the National Science Foundation ranked Texas among the top tier of U.S. states for the number of doctorates awarded in tech-related fields, including electrical engineering. Acknowledging the rich innovative environment, the U.S. Army selected Austin as home for its new Army Futures Command, which focuses on science and technology development.  A strong military presence in Texas and our partnerships with like-minded allies around the world will be essential to protect an asset like the NSTC and NAPMP from our global competitors that do not abide by international trading norms.As the largest energy-producing state in the nation, including wind and solar, Texas is the ninth largest economy in the world, home to 16 sea ports, multiple land ports of entry, and has been the largest U.S. exporter for 19 years in a row. With a vibrant and long-standing space, defense, telecommunications industry, and manufacturing history, Texas is uniquely situated to foster the innovative environment in which the NSTC and NAPMP can thrive with broad engagement from chipmakers, material and equipment suppliers, chip customers, universities, research institutes and existing government partners.  You will not find a better state in which to establish the National Semiconductor Technology Center and National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program. We strongly endorse selecting Texas as the future sites for the NSTC and NAPMP.Sincerely,/s/ Contact Senator Cornyn ©2023 Senator John Cornyn   |   PrivacyProcessing..."
