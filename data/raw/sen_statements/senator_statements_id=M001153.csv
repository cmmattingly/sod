https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-delegation-united-in-urging-president-biden-to-waive-states-cost-share-for-western-alaska-disaster,"Following last week’s federal Major Disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery from the impact of Typhoon Merbok, U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska), and Governor Mike Dunleavy (R-Alaska) are urging President Biden to waive 100 percent of the State’s cost share for federal individual and public assistance for recovery efforts for 30 days, citing the cost is too great to cover with currently available resources. This would mirror the FEMA arrangement for the ongoing disaster in Puerto Rico.“Following last week’s historic storm, I knew I needed to be boots on the ground with Alaskans to survey the damage and to learn more about what I can do to support recovery efforts. I visited a number of the impacted communities over the weekend, including Nome, Elim, Golovin, Hooper Bay and Chevak. Throughout my visits, I spent time talking with Tribal leaders, community members, the National Guard, and more, who showed me firsthand the severity of the damage and how much work lies ahead in their road to recovery. We recognize the cost that comes with the destruction to key infrastructure, but we must also consider the challenges that don’t immediately meet the eye—slow moving disasters such as water damage and the loss of cultural and subsistence tools. The financial needs to replace such substantial loss is far too great without additional assistance,” said Senator Murkowski. “This waiver will go a long way in helping repair the storm’s damage to bridges, roads, water treatment plants, homes, airstrips, and more. Rural communities prior to the storm were already challenged, and it’s imperative that we help them get back on their feet and are able to return to their homes and meet basic needs like running water.” “We're tough in Alaska. But every now and then—in the aftermath of earthquakes, wildfires, typhoons, and tsunamis —we're going to need federal help. Now is that time,” said Senator Sullivan. “Just like our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, Alaskans are racing to repair homes, foundations, seawalls, airports and other critical pieces of infrastructure. We are also contending with another complication—freeze-up—which leaves a very narrow window to get cash out the door and make these communities whole by winter. Now that FEMA has decided it will cover one-hundred percent of the recovery costs for one month for victims of Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico, FEMA needs to do the same for those recovering from Typhoon Merbok in Western Alaska, where we have some of the most impoverished communities in the country. I reiterate my call on the Biden administration to treat Alaskans fairly and approve this commonsense accommodation for my constituents. I have written to the FEMA Administrator, spoke on the Senate floor about this, and twice talked directly with the Secretary of Homeland Security who told me he would address this matter.”“Having just visited Nome and other communities impacted by Typhoon Merbok over the weekend, I’ve now had the chance to speak directly with state and local officials and see the destruction first-hand,” said Representative Peltola. “I am extremely grateful that President Biden so quickly approved Governor Dunleavy’s federal disaster declaration, however, I wish to strongly reiterate my call for FEMA to waive the State of Alaska’s cost share for federal individual and public assistance for recovery efforts. This 100% federal cost share is essential to the timely cleanup efforts that are ongoing.”“After living and working in rural Alaska for 20 years, I know the next few weeks will be critical to getting essential infrastructure, homes and businesses back on their feet before winter takes over in western Alaska,” said Governor Mike Dunleavy. “Lifting the cost share for both individual and public assistance means we can address the needs of these communities immediately, and prevent any further hardships for those Alaskan families that have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the storm.”Background:On September 16, remnants of Typhoon Merbok produced widespread damage to communities in Western Alaska – flooding to homes and businesses; damage to infrastructure for power and water as well as roads and bridges; and impacts to approximately 1,000 miles of coastline.On September 20, Governor Dunleavy requested a federal disaster declaration which was immediately followed by a letter from the Alaska Congressional delegation urging President Biden to expeditiously approve his request. On September 23, the President issued a major disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery.In Governor Dunleavy’s Major Disaster request, he requested a federal waiver for the State of Alaska’s cost share for individual and public assistance recovery efforts in western Alaska, which was followed by a letter from the Alaska Congressional delegation urging FEMA to approve Governor Dunleavy’s request.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-to-receive-over-14-million-for-recreation-infrastructure_,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced that the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) will invest $37.75 million to improve recreation related infrastructure on national forests and grasslands, including $14.4 million specifically for projects within the Tongass and Chugach National Forests.These investments are made possible by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Senator Murkowski helped write, negotiate, and shepherd into law last year. Maintaining both heavily used and remote cabins located along lakes, atop mountains and on coastal islands that are available year-around requires resources and staff capacity, which has been in short supply for many years threatening the very existence of the recreation cabin program.  To respond to the call of local Alaskans and Alaska adventurers alike to save these cabins, Murkowski specifically included a carve-out for construction, reconstruction, and operation and maintenance of recreation public use cabins in Alaska in the bill.Of the $37.75 million announced nationwide:“Alaska is home to the best outdoor opportunities in the world, and recreation is a key part of our economy. To maintain and grow this world-class industry, we need infrastructure that is modern, safe, and accessible,” Murkowski said. “My efforts to support recreation infrastructure in Alaska – including recreational cabins and historic buildings – started long before the infrastructure bill was ever considered and date back to my time as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The work we did there, along with the special consideration and funding that I ultimately added to the infrastructure bill, are a home run for all us who are blessed to call Alaska home and for our visitors.” There are more than 155 special use cabins in the Tongass and 50 in the Chugach. The USFS is planning a collaborative process to include local communities in determining a strategy on improving its cabins. For more information on public engagement opportunities, visit the Alaska Region Cabin Strategy website.Background: The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law on November 15, 2021. The law provides historic investments into roads, bridges, ports, airports, broadband, ferries, water and wastewater, resilience, and energy projects—modernizing and upgrading the nation’s core infrastructure. Senator Murkowski was a lead author and negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, which also garnered support from Senator Sullivan and the late Congressman Don Young. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-delegation-applauds-approval-of_major-disaster-declaration-for-western-alaska,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska) today welcomed an announcement that President Joe Biden just approved Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy’s (R-Alaska) request for a Major Disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery from the impact of Typhoon Merbok on Alaskan families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure. This announcement comes just two days after the delegation sent a letter urging the President for his approval. “Typhoon Merbok was the strongest storm Alaska has experienced in seventy years, leaving a wake of destruction covering over 1,000 miles of coastline. I am grateful that no casualties and no serious injuries have been reported, but the impact on homes and infrastructure are extensive. So many communities throughout Western Alaska have been devastated and are in dire need of federal support. I appreciate the President for listening to us and recognizing the urgency of this situation. With winter weather looming, this federal assistance can’t come soon enough,” said Senator Murkowski. “I am on the ground in the region today and throughout the weekend traveling to the impacted communities. It is so important to see the needs firsthand and hear directly from residents as this helps guide how I can best assist them. I will be there for Alaskans through the recovery and rebuilding process by doing all I can in my role to help ensure that they have the support necessary to do so.”“I appreciate the quick response from the Biden Administration approving Governor Dunleavy’s request for a Major Disaster declaration to support Alaska’s recovery from the impacts of Typhoon Merbok on Alaska families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure,” said Senator Sullivan. “My team and I continue to work closely with our partners in the federal, state, and local governments to ensure communities in Western Alaska are fully restored following this fierce storm. And I reiterate the arguments I recently made to the Secretary of Homeland Security and FEMA Administrator – that if other communities that have been impacted by natural disasters, like Puerto Rico, get 100 percent federal reimbursement, then so should Alaska.”“I am grateful that President Biden understood how urgent the need for federal assistance was to the people of Western Alaska and thank him for swiftly approving the governor’s request for a disaster declaration,” said Representative Peltola. “Over the next couple of days, I will be visiting areas impacted by this storm to see the destruction first-hand. My office and I will continue to work with state and local officials to provide any assistance that we can.”To read the delegation’s full letter, click here.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/63-million-in-broadband-investments-announced-for-alaska,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-AK) today announced that communities on the North Slope and in Southeast Alaska will receive a total of $63 million for high-speed internet network buildout / deployment projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ReConnect Program grants, awarded to the Alaska Telephone Company and Arctic Slope Telephone, will help improve broadband access, including its affordability, for rural communities.“Having reliable internet has become a basic service that many in urban areas take for granted. In far too many remote communities in Alaska, I’ve seen and heard firsthand accounts of the unreliability and high cost of internet, with some households paying upwards of $300 a month alone for an unstable service. Connectivity means so much—for telehealth, education, our economy and so much more. That’s why I led the infrastructure bill and why I’ve made it a priority to expand broadband infrastructure and accessibility for unserved and underserved areas,” Senator Murkowski said. “I’m pleased to see these grants for Alaska and what it will mean to so many of these rural communities for years to come.”“It’s great to see the USDA continuing to award significant resources to assist with delivering high-speed internet access to rural Alaska—an essential component of 21st century infrastructure,” Senator Sullivan said. “Last month, I hosted a broadband summit in Anchorage with critical stakeholders from federal agencies, including from USDA, state and local governments, Alaska Native communities, industry, and other key partners as Alaska prepares to receive significant funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law. As these federal funds from various agencies come to Alaska, it is critical that all Alaskan stakeholders are coordinated in their response. If we coordinate well and work together, we have the potential to connect every community across our state.”GRANT RECIPIENTS [provided by USDA]:510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-strengthens-alaskas-wildfire-resilience,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-AK) today announced the Department of the Interior (DOI) is investing over $3.3 million in funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to bolster wildfire resilience on nearly 8,000 acres of land across Alaska.These wildland fire management investments will increase fuels treatments in “high wildfire hazard potential” areas, which will help protect homes, businesses, and other critical infrastructure.The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contained significant funding to reduce catastrophic wildfires on federal lands through mechanical thinning, controlled burns, fuel breaks and other activities. The infrastructure law also featured funding to improve workforce training for firefighting and vegetation management, which specifically includes Alaska Native village fire crews.“Every year, Alaska’s wildfire season impacts communities and regions across our state—with more than three million acres burned this season, alone. I recognize the devastation that causes, so as we developed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I prioritized greater funding and new tools to accelerate thinning and fuel break work,” Senator Murkowski said. “I’m pleased to now see that benefitting Alaska through investments that will protect our lands and communities by reducing fire risks, ensuring we are better equipped to fight fires that do occur, and helping to restore affected ecosystems.” “Wildfires burn millions of acres in Alaska every year—sometimes as much or more than the combined acreage burned in the rest of the country. Our state clearly has a disproportionate need for the tools and federal resources that protect lives, homes and critical infrastructure from these natural disasters,” said Senator Sullivan. “I’m glad to see these significant federal funds coming to our state that Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young and I were able to secure in the bipartisan infrastructure bill. These federal resources will help our brave firefighters prepare for upcoming wildfire seasons, prevent out-of-control burns, and ultimately keep Alaskans safe.”Background: The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law on November 15, 2021.

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-press-biden-administration_-to-quickly-re-approve-ambler-road-project,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, recently sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland reiterating their strong support for the Ambler Access Project (Ambler Road).The Senators called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to promptly complete its work to re-approve the Ambler Road following DOI’s request for a voluntary remand of the project’s Record of Decision (ROD). Murkowski and Sullivan specifically urged DOI to commit to a concrete timeline, allow the project proponent to continue important baseline scientific work, and allow geotechnical drilling to proceed.The Senators also reiterated that failure to satisfy the court’s remand order in a timely and narrow manner would defy federal law, prevent hardworking Alaskans from accessing jobs that support their families at a time of painfully high inflation, and worsen projected shortfalls of strategic minerals and metals that are crucial to clean energy and many other technologies.“This Congressionally-mandated access is essential to ensuring the economic stability of both Alaska and the nation. In Alaska alone, the Project has the potential to facilitate over 8,700 direct, indirect, and induced construction and operation jobs and nearly $700 million in annual wages. That would be top of an annual average of 360 direct jobs over the road’s construction period, and up to 81 direct annual jobs for road operations and maintenance over the life of the road.”…“Given assurances that the remand would be “timely” and given the importance of the Project to Alaska and national security, we are concerned that DOI’s first status report, filed with the Court on July 18, 2022, indicated the Department was “not yet able to identify a timeframe for completion of a draft and final supplemental environmental impact statement.” We anecdotally understand that the timeframe could be up to three years, which is categorically unacceptable and deeply contrary to every reasonable expectation for how the voluntary remand would proceed.…“Given the seven years of cooperation between all applicable federal agencies, the comprehensive [Joint Record of Decision], and the Congressionally-recognized importance of completing the Project on an expedited basis, we urge you to take the necessary steps to move the Project forward and complete the voluntary remand in a timely, workable, and definitive timeframe. Otherwise, DOI will jeopardize economic and national security by increasing our reliance on adversaries like China for those strategic minerals necessary for our defense, competitiveness, and future prosperity.”The Ambler Road would provide access to mining district and facilitate the responsible development of high-grade mineral deposits—including copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, and other metals—in northwest Alaska. A right-of-way across federal land is guaranteed by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). These critical minerals are crucial to all aspects of modern technology and national security and will help prevent the shortfalls that S&P Global, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and others have forecast in recent months. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) initially submitted its application to develop the 211-mile Ambler Road project in November 2015, making this the seventh full year of federal regulatory review. The Bureau of Land Management published a draft EIS on August 30, 2019 and held 22 public meetings in local communities, Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Washington, DC prior to issuing a favorable ROD in July 2020.Despite that, the Biden administration sought and won approval to voluntarily remand the ROD on February 22, 2022. With no apparent sense of irony, President Biden held a roundtable on “Securing Critical Minerals for a Future Made in America” that very same day—failing to recognize that the Ambler Mining District is one of the nation’s best options to produce them. On Tuesday, September 20, 2022, BLM initiated a 45-day public scoping process for a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Ambler Road project. BLM’s notice of intent states that the agency will evaluate a “range of alternatives” related to a range of topics but provides no timeframe for the completion of this additional review.  To read the Senators’ full letter regarding the Ambler Road, click here.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-delegation-urges-biden-administration-to-approve-major-disaster-declaration-for-western-alaska,"WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski
and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola
(D-Alaska) sent a letter
yesterday to President Joe Biden urging him to expeditiously
approve Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy’s (R-Alaska) request for a Major
Disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery from the impact of
Typhoon Merbok on Alaskan families, homes, businesses, schools, and
infrastructure.“This was the strongest storm in seventy years to impact our
state,” the Alaska
congressional delegation wrote. “The
damage to Western Alaska is extensive and federal assistance is essential to
help Alaskans recover in the wake of this destructive event and mitigate
against future severe weather events. “On September 16 to 18, 2022,
remnants of Typhoon Merbok produced widespread destruction and severe damage to
Western Alaska. Approximately one thousand miles of coastline were impacted.
Residents are experiencing widespread flooding; power, water, and communication
disruption; severe damage to private homes, personal property, and businesses…“Because very cold weather and freeze-up in many parts of our
state are a few weeks away, it is crucial that Alaska has the resources
necessary to provide heating fuel for winter and to quickly continue the
process of rebuilding.”The full letter can be found here and
below:Dear Mr. President:We write to urge your immediate consideration of Governor
Michael Dunleavy’s request for a
Major Disaster declaration
under Section 401  of the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act to support Alaska’s recovery from the
impact of Typhoon Merbok on Alaskan families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure. This was the
strongest storm in seventy years to impact our state. The damage to Western
Alaska is extensive and federal assistance
is essential to help Alaskans recover in the wake of this destructive
event and mitigate against future severe weather events.On
September 16 to 18, 2022, remnants of Typhoon Merbok produced widespread
destruction and severe damage to Western Alaska. Approximately one thousand
miles of coastline were impacted. Residents are experiencing widespread
flooding; power, water, and communication disruption; severe damage to private
homes, personal property, and businesses.Alaskans
are resilient. Nowhere was this more evident than in the actions of our state
and local emergency management teams, as well as the first responder and public
works personnel in the hours leading up to the storm’s landfall and now
following the storm. Our State emergency response team members are working day
and night to ensure that our communities are safe and that utilities, services,
and major infrastructure are operational as soon as possible. Alaska’s public
servants are instrumental in mitigating the immediate impact of the storm in
Western Alaska. However, much more needs to be done. Governor Dunleavy
indicated in his request that the damage was of such severity and scale that
additional federal assistance is necessary to supplement the actions of our
State agencies. Because very cold weather and freeze-up in many parts of our
state are a few weeks away, it is crucial that Alaska has the resources
necessary to provide heating fuel for winter and to quickly continue the
process of rebuilding.Typhoon
Merbok affected more than infrastructure: it is affecting Alaska’s people –
especially those in rural communities that, for example, did not have broadband
access or easy access to supplies pre-storm, or for that matter any roads to
their communities. Some Alaskans have lost their homes while others have lost
vehicles essential to survival in rural communities and other personal
property.
We are
appreciative for the prompt attention your Administration and the Region 10
FEMA team have provided to the state during and immediately following the
storm. We write with urgency to seek your quick approval of Governor Dunleavy’s
request given the scope of the damage, fast approaching winter weather, and
overall impact on Alaskans. Thank you for your attention to this emergency
matter.Sincerely,

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-peltola-urge-blm-to-re-approve-willow-project-by-years-end,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska), today sent a letter to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland urging the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to complete the permitting process for the Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) by the end of the year, in time for the winter construction season. In their letter, the Alaska congressional delegation noted that the project has been developed under the strictest environmental standards in the world and is strongly supported by Alaska Native leaders, labor leaders, the State of Alaska, legislators from both parties, and President Joe Biden.“The expeditious approval of this crucial project would greatly benefit Alaska, our nation, and the world, while demonstrating the Administration’s commitment to addressing inflation, high energy costs, the need for greater energy security, and environmental justice initiatives,” the delegation wrote. “After years of study and review, both the Administration and Alaskans can feel confident that the Project will abide by the strictest environmental considerations in the world, while being constructed and operated by a company with an impressive record of safe and responsible development on the North Slope.“We believe the final SEIS should identify the preferred alternative; appropriately weight the purpose of energy production in the NPR-A; and recognize the public interest in supporting energy security and responsible resource development. The permitting process must be completed by the end of 2022 at very latest so the project’s proponent can make a final investment decision and hire Alaskans in time for the winter construction season. That decision will not be possible, and none of those jobs will be created, in the absence of a clean and timely Record of Decision (ROD).”Click here to read the full letter.Timeline510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-welcome-congresswoman-mary-peltola_to-the-house-of-representatives,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) today attended the official swearing-in ceremony for Mary Peltola (D-Alaska), Alaska’s newly-elected Congresswoman, who will serve the remainder of the late Congressman Don Young’s term. Following the event, the Senators released the following statements:“I congratulate Congresswoman Peltola on her swearing-in and welcome her, not only as a member of our delegation, but also as the first Alaska Native to ever serve in Congress,” said Senator Murkowski. “Congresswoman Peltola’s swearing-in will ensure Alaskans once again have a voice in the House. Congresswoman Peltola has a huge task ahead, but I am committed to be there to help her transition into her new role as quickly and seamlessly as possible. I particularly appreciate her commitment to representing all Alaskans, just as Congressman Young always did, and am glad to have her with us in the fight for our state’s future.”“I appreciated the opportunity to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Congresswoman Peltola and officially welcome her to Congress,” said Senator Sullivan. “I have spoken with Mary and offered my and my staff’s assistance on case work for individual Alaskans, setting up her office, and on matters of policy, particularly those that relate to advancing Alaska’s interests, like the Willow and Ambler projects, and pushing back against the Biden administration’s unprecedented shutdown of our state.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-2-million-announced-by-usda-to-support-agriculture-in-alaska-,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will award $2 million to the Alaska Division of Agriculture for the Micro-Grants for Food Security Program (MGFSP), which will be available to fund grants for eligible Alaskans next calendar year.“Alaska  mports about 95 percent of the food we eat, and far too many Alaskans face food insecurity. That’s why I created the Micro-Grants for Food Security Program in 2018 – to ensure more Alaskans have greater access to healthy, affordable, locally grown options. The need for this program has only grown due to the continuing supply chain problems and high inflation, forcing more and more Alaskans to live off of cheaper, mass-produced imports rather than nutrient dense, fresh foods that could be grown at home.” said Senator Murkowski. “Since the program’s inception, the Alaska Division of Agriculture has received over $6 million for the MGFSP and funded projects by 770 individuals and 116 non-profit organizations and local communities. I’m working hard to plus-up funding for this program in Fiscal Year 2023 in hopes that even more Alaskans will reap similar benefits.”Background:Senator Murkowski created MGFSP via the 2018 Farm Bill to help increase food security in the non-contiguous states and territories. Due to her work as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Congress has funded MGFSP in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022. As a result, Alaskans, Hawaiians, and citizens of the U.S. Territories may apply to their respective state agriculture agencies for grant funding to strengthen small-scale, agriculture related projects, and improve opportunities to produce locally-grown food. Senator Murkowski is continuing to advocate for robust funding for the program in the Fiscal Year 2023 bill.Program Eligibility:Individuals are eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year and Indian tribes and tribal organizations, non-profit organizations, federally-funded educational facilities, and local and tribal governments that may not levy local taxes are eligible to receive up to $10,000.MGFSP funds may be used for any activities that will increase the quantity and quality of locally grown food for food insecure individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities such as: to purchase items necessary to grow and store food; expanding areas under cultivation or extend the growing season; hydroponic and aeroponic farming; building, buying, erecting or repairing fencing for livestock, poultry, and reindeer; purchasing and equipping a slaughter and processing facility; traveling to participate in agricultural education; paying for shipping for items related to growing or raising food; creating or expanding avenues for the sale of local food; and engaging in other activities related to increasing food security (including subsistence).More info is at https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/mgfsp and http://dnr.alaska.gov/ag/ag_grants.htm.  510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-urge-energy-department-to-complete-without-delay-draft-seis-for-aklng-project,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) sent a letter yesterday to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm expressing their support for the Alaska LNG Project (AKLNG), and urging the department to “complete, without delay, finalization of the draft supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS)” for the project. The letter calls for the DOE to reissue their approval of the project.“Given the United States is on the brink of an economic recession, coupled with record energy prices, completion of the regulatory process for AKLNG should be a top priority,” Senators Sullivan and Murkowski wrote. “AKLNG is the only federally permitted LNG export project on the West Coast, has 41.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas readily available, and provides a number of strategic geopolitical benefits. In fact, AKLNG would provide a supply of long-term, clean natural gas critical to our energy security and the growing global demand for energy, given Alaska has enough available gas to reduce our reliance on authoritarian foreign adversaries. Our global network of allies, military strength, world-class energy resources, dynamic economy, and most important, our democratic values and commitment to liberty, will put the United States at a distinct advantage, compared to the dictatorships of countries like China and Russia, if utilized correctly.“AKLNG also provides a significant number of environmental benefits. Given the shorter shipping routes from Alaska to meet the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of markets in Asia, Alaska natural gas generates less carbon equivalent emissions than other U.S. LNG exports and far fewer emissions than other fuels. Further, AKLNG’s associated carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) capabilities are an important aspect of the project and moving towards a low-carbon future. Alaska’s North Slope has the potential for 205 million metric tons of carbon dioxide sequestration, which is the equivalent of planting 4 billion tree seedlings over the course of ten years, or offsetting the annual emissions of 55 coal-fired power plants or 44 million cars. AKLNG would also require no additional drilling and utilize the existing infrastructure on Alaska’s North Slope, and the development of spur lines off of AKLNG’s pipeline into Alaska’s cities, towns, and villages, would all but alleviate existing air quality issues, such as the presence of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in Fairbanks.      . . .“Lastly, the draft SEIS identifies critical socioeconomic benefits associated with AKLNG. This project would create tremendous employment opportunities for hardworking Americans, including Alaska Natives, and new revenue for the State of Alaska, mirroring the economic boom communities in the state saw following the development of the North Slope in the late 1970s. Just look at the immense support AKLNG has received from the men and women who build this country, including the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA), the Alaska chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), the Alaska chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and affiliates like the Fairbanks Building-Construction Trades Unions, Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 375, Laborers' Local 341, and Laborers' Local 942.”To read the full letter, click here.

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-announces-savannas-act-guidelines-for-state-of-alaska,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) applauds the announcement that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Alaska has completed Savanna’s Act guidelines for Alaska. This bipartisan legislation, authored and stewarded into law by Senator Murkowski, requires federal law enforcement to create standard guidelines on responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans and strengthen data collection on them.This announcement follows a May 2022 letter by Senators Murkowski, Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jon Tester (D-MT) pushing the administration to implement the bipartisan legislation.“Securing Savanna’s Act into law was a huge milestone in my longstanding fight against missing, murdered, and trafficked Indigenous women and girls. I have been honored to work alongside the many Native advocates and family members who have been affected by this painful epidemic for too long. I’ve kept the pressure on the administration to ensure these cases are taken seriously and that we do everything we can to address this public safety crisis.  So it is welcomed news to see these guidelines published to implement the law which will improve coordination among all levels of law enforcement, and empower tribal governments by providing access to federal databases in cases involving missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, wherever they occur,” said Senator Murkowski. “I commend the DOJ for this important step forward. Combined with implementation of the Not Invisible Act, which was also signed into law in 2020, we can turn the tide of Native people falling victim to this epidemic. We owe it to all Alaska Natives to implement these bills in a timely manner.” For more information on Savanna’s Act guidelines, click here. Timeline on Senator Murkowski’s Efforts: 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-recognized-as-honorary-chief-of-the-uscg,"During a recent visit to Air Station Sitka to see firsthand the proposed Fast Response Cutter (FRC) housing and homeporting location, the 27th Commandant of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), Admiral Linda Fagan, recognized U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski as an honorary Chief Petty Officer of the USCG, a title given only to individuals who demonstrate the highest commitment to the Coast Guard's core values. The surprise announcement took place during a ceremony to present three members of the Air Station with Air Medals for their exemplary and heroic service on behalf of the U.S. military during their time in Alaska. In the entire history of the USCG, less than 400 individuals have been recognized with honorary Chief status. “I’m the daughter of a former USCG member. I was born in Ketchikan when my dad was stationed there on the CGC Sorrel and Thistle, so for years I have witnessed the significant support the Coast Guard brings communities throughout our state. I’ve seen how critical our Coasties are, and in my role as Senator I work diligently to ensure they have the training, infrastructure, and support they need to carry out their vital missions,” said Senator Murkowski. “While in Sitka, I had the honor and privilege of being named an Honorary Chief Petty Officer by someone I admire greatly – Admiral Linda Fagan – the first woman to serve as Commandant of the Coast Guard and the first female service chief. Throughout my time in the Senate I’ve been bestowed honors and recognitions which I hold dear, but this acknowledgment ranks among the most significant and humbling in my career and one that left me literally speechless. I will always be grateful to the Coast Guard for gifting me with their trust and recognition. As an avid supporter of all U.S. military members and their families, and a longtime advocate for the USCG, this is such an incredible honor.” “It is a great honor to bestow the rank of Chief to such a staunch supporter and advocate for our Coast Guard members and their families stationed throughout Alaska. Her leadership and passion for public service and efforts to improve our military’s quality of life while stationed in the 49th state represent the highest qualities of those privileged to don the anchor, and it’s an honor to welcome Senator Murkowski to the Mess,” said 14th Master Chief Petty Office of the CG, MCPO Heath Jones.For years, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers have recognized individuals who have demonstrated a significant commitment to the Chiefs and Chiefs Mess by bestowing upon them Honorary Chief status. Individuals are nominated for this distinction for demonstrating, through actions, significant support for the USCG and receiving the distinction requires approval from the entire Chief’s Mess, District Gold Badge, and Area Gold Badge.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/us-state-department-announces-plan-to-establish-ambassador-for-the-arctic-region,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, today applauded the announcement that the U.S. State Department has established an Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region—an initiative she has persistently advocated for.“Before today, the U.S. was the only Arctic nation without dedicated diplomatic representation for the Arctic Region at the Ambassador level or higher. For years I have advocated for our country to elevate our Arctic leadership and diplomatic efforts to properly represent our nation’s Arctic interests. I’ve kept pressure on the State Department, and introduced legislation, consistently emphasizing that it must uphold its duty to America by creating a position commensurate with our responsibilities in this rapidly evolving region,” said Senator Murkowski. “By establishing this role, America will solidify its dedication, commitment, and leadership to this strategically important region and have greater opportunities to spur the diplomacy necessary to preserve a peaceful, prosperous Arctic. This announcement—which dovetails the recent opening of the new Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies—sends a strong signal to our allies and adversaries that America is all-hands-on-deck in the Arctic. Make no mistake, because of Alaska, America is not only an Arctic nation, but an Arctic leader. I look forward to the announcing of a nominee and urge the State Department to quickly move forward with the next steps.”Background: Senator Murkowski is the leading expert in Congress on Arctic issues and has worked continuously to raise awareness of the region. At the beginning of the 114th Congress, Senator Murkowski and Senator King formed the Senate Arctic Caucus to advance issues important to the Arctic and to the people who live there. Senator Murkowski is the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region. She has co-led multiple U.S. delegations to the Arctic Council Plenary Assembly – the leading intergovernmental forum for Arctic affairs. Murkowski has also led the charge to recapitalize and expand America’s fleet of Polar Security Cutters (icebreakers).Through her legislative efforts, Senator Murkowski has comprehensively developed Arctic leadership throughout the federal government. In just the last two years, she has created the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies – a Department of Defense Regional Center dedicated to the Arctic located in Anchorage, Alaska. The aim of the Ted Stevens Center is to support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum and to foster strong international networks of security leaders to support multilateralism and diplomacy in the region. Murkowski welcomed the news that Major General (Ret.) Randy “Church” Kee was selected by the Department of Defense (DoD) to serve as the Senior Advisor for Arctic Security Affairs. Murkowski served as a distinguished guest during the grand opening of the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies in Anchorage. Senator Murkowski was also behind the reactivation of the Arctic Executive Steering Committee within the Executive Office of the President to enhance coordination of federal Arctic policies. She also led legislation that created the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Arctic and Global Resilience ensuring that the Arctic was properly represented in senior levels within the Pentagon. And finally, Senator Murkowski has been the catalyst behind every military service crafting new Arctic strategies which has resulted in the reactivation of the 11th Airborne Division – the Arctic Angels - in Alaska.  In addition to her dedicated efforts to establish the new Center for Security Studies, Senator Murkowski has worked diligently to build out a comprehensive Arctic strategy to spur greater diplomacy in the region. In October 2021, Senator Murkowski and U.S. Senator Angus King (I-ME) introduced the Arctic Diplomacy Act of 2021, legislation which will elevate Arctic issues in U.S. foreign policy by establishing an Assistant Secretary of State for Arctic Affairs who will lead and conduct U.S. foreign policy in the Arctic region and on Arctic issues. In February 2022, she continued her push through a letter alongside U.S. Senator Angus King (I-ME) and 10 of their Senate Colleagues, to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Within the letter, Senator Murkowski stressed the importance of developing a comprehensive Arctic strategy, including establishing the position of Arctic Ambassador in order to best advance our nation’s interests in the Arctic.Murkowski is heavily engaged in international mediums dedicated to sustaining the Arctic as a zone of peace.

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senator-murkowski-opposes-biden-administrations-student-loan-proposal,"Anchorage, AK – U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) provided the following statement after the Biden administration announced a student debt relief plan which includes a final extension of the zero percent interest student loan repayment pause, up to $20,000 in debt cancellation to Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 in debt cancellation to non-Pell Grant recipients whose income falls below $125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. In addition, the administration is proposing a new income-based repayment plan for current and future borrowers.“As I travel to communities across Alaska I continue to hear how individuals and families are being impacted by rising inflation—from paying for fuel to their grocery bills and other basic necessities. While cancelling some student loan debt for some Alaskans will help ease their budgets after the repayment pause expires, there is no such thing as ‘cancelling’ student loans. This action would add $300 billion to our national debt that every American will be on the hook to pay.“I am empathetic to the burden of high student debt, and I’ve been working to try to reduce the cost of education to avoid these high debts in the first place. I also supported a pause on student loan repayments during the pandemic, but those who borrow money have a duty to repay it. It seems to have escaped the President’s notice that this debt is owed to the American people who finance student loans through their taxes—many of whom have no student loans. Additionally, this loan forgiveness does not recognize the sacrifice of many Americans who scrimped and saved to pay off their student loans. Nor will it help those who take on new student loan debt tomorrow and in the years to come, or those whose federal student loans are not owned by the federal government. “There are a number of other commonsense alternatives to address this issue, but this is not the appropriate path forward.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-welcome-over-45-million-dot-grant-to-the-native-village-of-eyak-to-benefit-oil-spill-response-facility,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-AK) today announced $45.7 million in a U.S. Department of Transportation grant has been awarded to the Native Village of Eyak. This funding will allow for a 4.2 mile highway extension to connect to Cordova’s existing road system at Orca Creek to the Shepard Point Oil Spill Response Facility.“The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the release of roughly eleven million gallons of crude oil into the open ocean, impacting more than 1,300 miles of coastline. Over three decades later, communities throughout Prince William Sound are still feeling the impacts. It was a tragic event which served as a catalyst for shaping America’s oil spill response methods,” said Senator Murkowski. “The construction of the Shepard Point Marine Tribal Transportation & Oil Spill Response Facility is a long-standing, top priority for the Native Village of Eyak for years. I’m proud to have helped ensure they have the dedicated infrastructure in place to protect the environment.”“The DOT highway funding announced this week for an extended road to the Shepard Point Marine Tribal Transportation (MTT) & Oil Spill Response (OSR) Facility, coupled with the $40 million grant announced last year for the facility itself, will help the Eyak people protect their way of life and provide economic opportunities,” Senator Sullivan said. “I am pleased to see key provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation I negotiated in the Environmental and Public Works (EPW) Committee finally come to fruition. By helping prevent any future spill from becoming an ecological disaster, the fishing, tourism and resource development industries in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta region stand to benefit.”“All of us at the Native Village of Eyak would like to thank Senator Murkowski, Senator Sullivan, and their staff for their hard work and commitment to the Shepard Point project. Their support through the grant process has been critical to ensuring our community, state and nation are never again unprepared for a catastrophe like the Exxon-Valdez oil spill in 1989. We are honored to receive this award and promise to be good stewards in its use,” said Bert Adams, Executive Director of the Native Village of Eyak.The NSFLTP Program was reauthorized and funded through H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Senator Murkowski played a lead role in writing and negotiating.This funding announcement dovetails a January 2021 grant of $40.1 million awarded to the Native Village of Eyak from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-congratulate-santos-on-pikka-project-investment-decision,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) today issued the following statements welcoming Santos’ announcement that it has approved a $2.6 billion investment for Phase 1 of its Pikka project on Alaska’s North Slope.“This is great news for Alaska that will strengthen our economy for a long time to come,” Murkowski said. “The Pikka project will help refill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System while creating good jobs for Alaskans and bolstering our nation’s energy security. I appreciate the approach that Santos and their partner, Repsol, have taken to advance this project, their strong collaboration with local entities and communities, and their commitment to producing this resource with net-zero emissions from the project itself.”    “It’s exciting to see this project, which has been in the works since I was serving as Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources Commissioner, finally come to fruition,” Sullivan said. “Today’s announcement is great news for energy security, national security, and for economic and community development, including thousands of jobs for Alaskans, in our state where we have the highest environmental standards in the world.”The Pikka project is projected to produce 80,000 barrels of oil per day by 2026. Santos owns 51 percent of the project and Repsol holds a 49 percent stake. Pikka will create an estimated 2,600 construction jobs and 500 permanent jobs, furthering the companies’ strong commitment to Alaska. At present, about 98 percent of the employees for Santos’ U.S. subsidiary, Oil Search Alaska, live in Alaska.  510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/-murkowski-announces-over-57-million-in-additional-infrastructure-funding-for-alaskan-communities-,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) are awarding over $57.1 million in grants for infrastructure upgrades and development across Alaska. The grants are for road construction, dock and service center construction, and buses and bus facilities.The entities benefiting from these new awards, which are being made under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, include the Gulkana Village Council, City and Borough of Juneau, Metlakatla Indian Community, Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Fairbanks North Star Borough, City and Borough of Sitka, Bristol Bay Native Association, and Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska.“The good news from our bipartisan infrastructure law continues. This latest round of grants will help Alaskans with road construction, facility construction and upgrades, and cleaner buses for public transportation,” Senator Murkowski said. “The communities that receive these grants will benefit from better transportation, less pollution, and lower costs for their residents. I thank both FTA and DOT for considering Alaskans’ applications, and look forward to continued assistance for additional communities in the years ahead.”“As Alaska’s communities change and grow, the need for affordable public transportation will also continue to increase,” said Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities Commissioner Ryan Anderson. “Transit has become a greater necessity in all of our communities, large and small. We are really pleased to see these transit grants spread throughout the state’s transportation network.”“Sitka would like to extend a sincere thanks to Senator Lisa Murkowski for her support of Sitka's working waterfront, and the assistance with our successful raise grant application. This grant insures the continued operation of our community cold storage. Sitka's economy is held up by commercial fisherman, and we appreciate the ability to invest in them,” said Sitka Mayor Steven Eisenbeisz.“The Soaring Eagle Transit (SET) Multi-Purpose Operations and Maintenance facility will be the first and only maintenance facility for the transit. It will provide heated, dry space for COVID preventive measures, a warming shelter for customers, administrative and operations offices, and three maintenance bays. Since 2015 Soaring Eagle Transit vehicle upkeep has been performed outside the village hall parking lot. Situated in the interior of Alaska, SET must operate vehicles half the year in the winter months.  These colder temperatures 0—42 degrees cause continuous problems with the transit vehicles in terms of performance. The maintenance facility will allow SET to prolong the life of the fleet and continue to provide safe and reliable service to the residents and tourist of the Copper Valley. The Gulkana Village Staff would like to thank the Federal Transit Authority, Bus to Bus Facilities program and Senator Murkowski for the support that enables SET to be selected as a 2022 grant recipient,” said Gulkana Village Council Tribal President Eileen Ewan.“Metlakatla Indian Community would like to thank the Federal Transit Authority for awarding our project the Metlakatla Municipal Building - Annette Islands Ferry Terminal Battery Electric Bus Service in the amount of $402,257. This grant is part of our overall strategy to reduce transportation costs and reduce air pollution in Southeast Alaska. The goal is to eliminate unnecessary automobile trips and reduce auto emissions significantly. It will provide transport services to the community and supplement our elder transport services and those without adequate transportation. In addition, it will provide energy storage for our micro-grid when it is not in use reducing the cost of transportation and energy for the Metlakatla Indian Community. We again thank Senator Murkowski and the federal government for this funding,” said Metlakatla Indian Community Mayor Albert Smith.“The Ketchikan Gateway Borough is extremely excited that we were selected to receive a FTA grant to electrify our buses. This, combined with our renewable hydropower, will allow our transit department to provide quiet, exhaust free public transportation for years to come.   A win for the environment and our community. Our heartfelt appreciation to Senator Murkowski for her efforts in securing this grant for the community,” said Ketchikan Borough Mayor Rodney Dial.“Thank you to Senator Murkowski for all her efforts leading the infrastructure package and ensuring that Alaskans needs would be addressed. This grant for low emissions busses will help the Fairbanks North Star Borough improve our public transit options in a clean and efficient manner,” said Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Bryce Ward. ""I’m very pleased with the outcome and extremely proud of our team and their hard work. This grant award is a big step forward in bolstering our working waterfront and crucial to one of our major economic drivers. We’re also very appreciative of our delegation’s support, both by supporting our application and making infrastructure funding more available for communities like ours,” said Sitka Municipal Administrator, John Leach.Grants from the Federal Transit Administration’s Buses and Bus Facilities Program and Low or No Emission Vehicle Program include: Grants from through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program include:510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-senate-missed-opportunity-to-bolster-us-mineral-security-during-debate-on-partisan-reconciliation-bill,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) released the following statement after the Senate failed to accept an amendment she offered over the weekend to the partisan budget reconciliation bill. The amendment would have facilitated the responsible development of domestic graphite and cobalt deposits, like those in the Ambler Mining District in northwest Alaska, but was not agreed by a party-line vote of 50-50.     “Any measure that allocates significant dollars for clean energy technologies must also place our nation’s mineral security front and center. Unfortunately, when I offered an amendment to boost domestic projects that would produce nickel and cobalt, which are crucial for electric vehicles and energy storage, my colleagues refused to acknowledge that we have a very real problem on our hands,” Murkowski said. “This was a chance to reduce our dependence on other nations for our supply of those strategic metals. I suspect my colleagues will wish they had accepted this amendment in the years ahead, but for now, it will go down as a missed opportunity.”Murkowski’s amendment would have provided $400 million to the federal Bureau of Land Management to facilitate projects that develop domestic graphite and cobalt deposits. The amendment was fully offset and compliant with the Byrd Rule, which governs the budget reconciliation process.The United States currently imports 76 percent of its supply of cobalt and 48 percent of its supply of nickel. The International Energy Agency has estimated that “cobalt and graphite may see 6- to 30-times higher demand than today [by 2040] depending on the direction of battery chemistry evolution.” The International Monetary Fund has similarly found that “Given the projected increase in metals consumption through 2050 under a net zero scenario, current production rates of graphite, cobalt, vanadium, and nickel appear inadequate, showing a more than two-thirds gap versus the demand.”The growing mismatch between mineral supply and mineral demand could create global shortages that alter the balance of geopolitical power and hold back the adoption of new technologies, including those meant to address climate change.One project that could have benefited from the adoption of Murkowski’s amendment is the Ambler Road project in Alaska. The project, which would provide access to a mining district with a number of high-grade mineral deposits, including copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, and more, began permitting during the Obama administration and received final federal approval in July 2020. The Biden administration has since announced a court filing to reopen the previous Record of Decision, causing unnecessary delays that will serve mainly to prevent needed domestic mineral supplies from being developed.In the absence of U.S. mineral production, automakers and others are having to look abroad for needed supplies. The latest such announcement ironically came on Monday, when Reuters reported that Tesla has signed contracts worth $5 billion for nickel supply from Indonesia, which is located more than 8,000 miles from the continental U.S. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-fights-to-secure-municipality-of-anchorage-priorities-through-fy2023-appropriations-bills-,"The Senate Appropriations Committee recently published the majority’s proposal for the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) appropriations bills. As a senior member of the Committee and Ranking Member of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) included $491 million in Congressionally Directed Spending for more than 130 local projects throughout Alaska, which includes over $141.2 million to directly support the Municipality of Anchorage.  “The return of Congressionally Directed Spending presents incredible opportunities, particularly in a state like Alaska with so many unique needs. By taking the power out of the hands of D.C. bureaucrats and empowering taxpayers to have a greater voice in the appropriations process – we can make a real difference in the lives of Alaskans,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’ve heard from leaders across the Anchorage Borough, including Mayor Bronson, about their greatest needs, and I’m proud to continue to fight for those priorities. Within the current FY2023 appropriations bills, I’ve secured significant funding for the Anchorage Borough, alone. This funding will bolster public health and safety, improve hard infrastructure in support of education and healthcare, address long-standing challenges of the safe disposal of wastewater, improve the quality of life for military members and their families, and so much more. I am committed to ensuring that the needs of all Alaskans are always well-represented.”   “As our state’s biggest city, I’m pleased to see these significant appropriations planned for Anchorage. With so many pressing needs across our community, it’s imperative these projects and efforts get the funding they require,” said Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson. “I want to thank Senator Murkowski and her staff for taking our requests to heart, and going to bat for Anchorage. These funds would help advance work at the Port of Alaska; enhance public safety; support our heroic Anchorage Police officers; confront homelessness; create jobs; and safeguard public health. It’s encouraging to see these types of results when we work together as Alaskans at the local and national level.” Anchorage Borough Congressionally Directed Spending Allocations  Public Safety and Homelessness:   Water, Wastewater, and Environmental Hazards:   Public Health and Education:   Military:   Infrastructure Upgrades:  ·         Whittier: $1.2 million for well field upgrades. ·         Anchorage: $5 million to the Port of Alaska to make site improvements. ·         Girdwood: $1.6 million to replace the Ruane Road culvert in Girdwood. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-enshrine-former-us-senator-ted-stevens-arctic-legacy_through-grand-opening-of-arctic-security-studies-center,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) took part in the grand opening of the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies. The center, named after the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, will support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum, while also developing robust international networks of security leaders.“The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies—I’m so proud to be able to say that. Ted always watched out for us here in Alaska. He dedicated his life to building our state and was also the first Senator to embrace the “Arctic-ness” of America. He set the foundation, which is why it is so fitting this center bears his name. To go from vision, to concept, to this moment so quickly is a testament to all of the people who worked so hard to make this a reality. From today forward, the Stevens Center will further focus our strategic thinking about the Arctic. It will help us turn ideas into concepts, concepts into action, and action into results. And, with partners across the Arctic, it will work together in a spirit of cooperation, just as Ted and Dan always did. This center will help us truly embrace our role and responsibility as an Arctic nation,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m proud to have been a driving force in establishing and funding this initiative. It was an honor to be with true supporters of the Arctic at the grand opening for the Center – to let America, and the world, know: the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies is open for business.”“When I arrived in the Senate in 2015, I was stunned by the lack of seriousness and attention given to the Arctic region from our most senior defense leaders,” said Senator Sullivan. “The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, which I was able to pass in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, demonstrates just how much progress we’ve made. The Ted Stevens Center further cements Alaska as the center of gravity for America's Arctic security operations, policy and research and will enable our country to confront an era of authoritarian aggression with confidence and sound Arctic policy crafted by the world’s best and brightest experts, including those who know the Arctic best—Alaskans. I want to thank Senator Murkowski for initially conceiving of the idea and working to appropriate funds for the center, and Congressman Don Young for carrying it across the finish line in the House.”“This endeavor has been a Congressional and Executive Branch of government success. Specifically, this milestone is an achievement for the Alaska Congressional Delegation and the DoD team, and those of us standing up the center are honored to be a part of the team and are thrilled to see how far we have collectively come in this matter in a relatively short time. The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies achieving Initial Operating Capacity as defined by the Pentagon approved Center Plans, Objectives and Milestones (POAM) on 1 July 2022 was a significant objective for the Center's initial advancement.  Tomorrow's opening ceremony is a public acknowledgement by the Stevens Center and our DoD leadership of the importance of the combined team effort which is building capacity in Arctic and Climate Security research & analysis, executive education and strategic engagement activities to provide a soft power complement to the hard power investments the United States is making in and across the Arctic...in support of our national interests across region in collaboration with our Allies and Partners. We at the Center are truly grateful for the support of the DoD and the support of the U.S. Congress, in particular, the Alaska Congressional Delegation,” said Randy “Church” Kee, Maj Gen, USAF (Ret), Senior Advisor, Arctic Security Affairs.""Establishing the Ted Stevens Center is a clear and tangible example of the importance of the Arctic region to the fundamental security interests of our nation. Although the Center is located in Alaska, it will link the global community to the Arctic and play a central role in addressing the full spectrum of security issues unfolding before us. Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan have championed our new Center and by doing so, have ensured our nation and our state are well positioned to address future challenges throughout the region,"" said Dr. Michael Sfraga, Chair & Distinguished Fellow of the Polar Institute and Chair of the US Arctic Research Commission.“Ted would be so honored to have his name associated with a vitally important Center as well as experienced leadership and staff.  He was passionate about Arctic research and action - ensuring our country is well-prepared for any threat.  Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan have done just that in working to secure authorization and funding for the Center.  We are grateful to the leadership of the Administration for their support of an Arctic commitment benefiting our country and the world. Ted often commented, ‘Alaska’s strategic location and capabilities prepare us to respond expeditiously to protect our nation.’  As he characterized it, ‘We live along one edge of an incredible vast region - home to half of the world’s population, an emerging superpower, and a malevolent nuclear regime,’” said Catherine Stevens, widow of the late Senator Stevens and member of the Stevens family. “We are also eager to follow how the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies will partner with the Daniel K. Inouye Center for Asia Pacific Studies, and continue the legacy of getting things done, as Ted and Dan did through their strong friendship and referred to each other as ‘brothers’.”“The Ted Stevens Center will create a lasting presence by the DoD in Alaska of a high level strategic center of excellence. The TSC as it develops can not only further education but can help align interests across the polar region. A mission which includes new polar technologies can uniquely add value to existing efforts in the military mission.  Alaska Natives and our vast network of relational and familiar ties across the Arctic, together with our growing capabilities working together with the Ted Stevens Center can help sustain deep collaboration and critical understanding as we continue building our partnerships,” Julie Kitka, President of the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN).Background: The Ted Stevens Center, the first DoD regional center in the Arctic and the first new DoD regional center since 2000, will support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum, while also fostering strong international networks of security leaders. The DoD has five Regional Centers covering Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Near East-South Asia, and the Western Hemisphere—making this the sixth DoD Regional Center and the only one specifically focused on the Arctic.Senators Murkowski and Sullivan sponsored this initiative in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the late Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) successfully included the provision in the House’s version of the NDAA, which was eventually signed into law. Through her role as an appropriator, Senator Murkowski secured $10 million for the Stevens Center in the Fiscal Year 2021 appropriations package. The Center’s aim is to support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum and to foster strong international networks of security leaders to support multilateralism and diplomacy in the region. The Stevens Center will serve as a soft power tool to support and strengthen the advances DoD is making in the Arctic, using security cooperation, research and academia, and diplomacy.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-announces-housing-block-grant-award-to_cook-inlet-housing-authority-,"Anchorage, AK – Today, Senator Lisa Murkowski announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding the Cook Inlet Housing Authority (CIHA) in Alaska a $5 million Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG). CIHA is one of five eligible Indian Tribes and Tribally Designated Housing Entities who, with a combined total, recently received more than $20 million from these IHBG competitive awards. These grants were made possible by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. The CIHA grant award will help fund two projects to create 38 new rental units and 51 supportive housing units.  “In nearly every community I visit, I see the significant housing challenges faced by Alaskans. Through these kinds of federal investments and good partners like the Cook Inlet Housing Authority, we are making great strides in creating safe and affordable housing for thousands of individuals and families in the state.” said Senator Lisa Murkowski.“CIHA is grateful that we are receiving these funds to house our people safely and at such a critical time for the housing issues facing our city and state. I want to thank Senator Murkowski for making housing a priority, hearing the needs of Alaskans, and her tireless efforts that are yielding results. Housing is the nexus of a healthy and productive life - families cannot work, learn, or be healthy if their home is not healthy. Senator Murkowski has taken that to heart and we thank her and her staff for their work,” said Carol Gore, President/CEO of the Cook Inlet Housing Authority.In January 2017, HUD released a study entitled, “Housing Needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives in Tribal Areas: A Report from the Assessment of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing Needs.” Among the findings, the study found that housing conditions for tribal households are substantially worse than other U.S. households, with overcrowding in tribal areas being especially severe, especially in Alaska. In Alaska, for example, overcrowding is more than twice the rate for tribal areas overall, with 36 percent of households experiencing overcrowding. Murkowski is a strong advocate for expanding affordable housing opportunities in Alaska. Through her role on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Murkowski played a key role in negotiating a bipartisan budget deal that made substantial investments into affordable housing initiatives including the Indian Housing Block Grant program under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act (NAHASDA) in addition to formula-based funding. Currently, as Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Murkowski is leading a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and improve the NAHASDA program to expedite the construction of homes, provide housing vouchers for American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans, and incentivize public-private partnerships.  For more information about the HUD Indian Housing Block Grant Competitive Grant Program, click here.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-votes-against-tax-and-spend-reconciliation-bill,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today voted against the partisan budget reconciliation bill, which includes dramatic spending and tax increases over the next decade. Senate Democrats chose to skip the traditional committee process, released a 755-page substitute text mere hours before it was taken up by the full Senate, and eventually passed the measure on a party-line basis, with the Vice President having to break a tie vote on final passage in the evenly divided Senate.“I voted against the partisan reconciliation measure for a host of different reasons, most notably the hundreds of billions of dollars of increased taxes and new spending it contains at a time when our economy can least afford it, along with the absolute lack of transparency that went into crafting and processing it. It’s hard to describe how rushed its passage truly was, or how bad that is from the standpoint of enacting good policy,” Murkowski said. “The title of the Inflation Reduction Act is misleading, as early projections show it may actually add to inflation for the next several years. It contains hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending, and hundreds of billions more in new taxes that will burden the American people and American businesses for years to come. It does less to reduce the deficit than projected, it will harm domestic oil and gas producers, and it will dramatically grow the bureaucracy at the IRS. Even floor debate – with amendment votes starting just before midnight on Saturday, and continuing through Sunday afternoon – was designed to avoid public awareness and scrutiny. While I don’t oppose everything within the bill, there is no doubt in my mind, based on both substance and process, that the Senate should not have passed it.” 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senate-approves-sullivan-murkowski-reed-resolution-designating-august-16th-as-national-airborne-day,"WASHINGTON—The United States Senate last night unanimously approved a resolution sponsored by U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan, Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) designating August 16, 2022 as National Airborne Day. The resolution calls on all Americans to observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.The resolution also adds language acknowledging the recent re-activation of the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska as part of the ongoing history of American Airborne forces. While previous resolutions acknowledged the service of the 11th Airborne during World War II, it did not reflect the recent re-activation of the division. The 11th Airborne Division unites roughly 12,000 soldiers in Alaska under one flag, marking the first time that the Army has activated an airborne division in 70 years.“The activation of the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska earlier this summer reaffirmed the Army’s commitment to its new Arctic Strategy, our state’s unrivaled strategic location, and the importance of America’s security interests in this region,” said Senator Sullivan. “As Americans honor the service of all of our brave airborne members, this day will be particularly meaningful for Alaskans celebrating the Arctic-tough warriors of our newly-minted 11th Airborne Division who are standing by on a moment’s notice to keep us safe from threats from across the globe.”“While I’ve led this resolution to honor National Airborne Day for years, this year the resolution is particularly special to the Alaska delegation. That’s due to fact the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska just re-activated, returning to the Army’s active rolls with a reinvigorated mission focused on operations in extreme cold weather and high altitudes, including the ever-evolving Arctic. It was a truly momentous occasion, and one I was thankful to be a part of,” said Senator Murkowski. “Alaska’s Airborne units are Arctic tough—withstanding some of the most challenging climates and terrains on earth as they carry out their missions. They are truly some of our nation’s most skilled and respected forces. With today’s unanimous passage of our resolution, I’m proud my Senate colleagues joined us in formally honoring airborne divisions across the U.S. and all the strength, grit and determination they add to America’s armed services. It’s an honor to recognize their hard work in this way.”“America’s airborne forces are the tip of the spear of our military,” said Senator Reed, who served in the 82nd Airborne Division. “They are trained to operate behind enemy lines, endure the toughest conditions, and blaze the trail for our ground forces – all after jumping out of a perfectly good airplane. I am immensely proud to honor the service and sacrifice of these brave men and women by recognizing National Airborne Day.”National Airborne Day is observed on August 16 of every year to honor the U.S. Army's elite airborne troops and to celebrate all of their accomplishments. In 2002, President George W. Bush established National Airborne Day to commemorate these ""foundational efforts."" The day commemorates the first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, which soon led to the formation of the U.S. Army Airborne Units. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senate-approves-admission-of-finland-and-sweden-into-nato,"Washington, DC – The U.S. Senate this week overwhelmingly approved a treaty document that approves the admission of Finland and Sweden into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by a vote of 95-01. U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted in favor of the measure, which brings two vital allies one step closer to fully joining the trans-Atlantic alliance.“NATO will be stronger, and the world will be safer, with Finland and Sweden among its members. These Arctic nations have long been reliable partners of the United States and today, we did our part to welcome them into the world’s strongest defense alliance.“Finland and Sweden bring exceptional qualities that nearly all Arctic nations possess – resiliency, entrepreneurship, comradery, teamwork, and, of course, their strategic locations. These attributes have been on full display whenever I have visited the European Arctic, and their presence in NATO will help deter further Russian aggression, atrocities, and unprovoked war.“The Arctic will be more secure as a result of an expanded NATO partnership, but the alliance is gaining more than just military capabilities, advanced technologies, and raw manpower. We’re gaining leaders, innovators, and countries of deep character.“Today’s vote was a monumental advance for international security and global stability. This is a great moment for NATO and for the Arctic.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-celebrates-whittier-land-conveyance,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) signed the land conveyance for the site known as the Whittier “Tank Farm” at the Head of the Bay of Prince William Sound. Senator Murkowski championed the original legislation authorizing the land conveyance in 2009 and has advocated since for the completion of the land transfer.The transfer of the property to the City of Whittier is a key piece of Whittier’s efforts to transform and develop its waterfront for the economic benefit of the community. The transfer will enable Whittier to lease the conveyed parcels to the Huna Totem Corporation to begin cruise dock development, an investment into the tourism industry and will enhance visitor experience. A Memorandum of Agreement to develop cruise ship berthing and upland facilities in Whittier was recently signed between Huna Totem Corporation and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., a global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands.Celebrating the handover of the deed from the Army Corps of Engineers to the City of Whittier.“Whittier has worked hard to make this project a reality. This facility will provide another cruise destination, which will not only benefit Whittier, it will bring more tourism to Alaska while alleviating the congestion we can see in Alaskan towns during the cruise season,” said Senator Murkowski. “Finalizing this deed transfer to the City of Whittier is well-overdue, but it just goes to show the importance of dedication to seeing a project through from start to finish. Now that Whittier has procured this land, I look forward to seeing the next steps as a result—the work that will go into constructing a docking facility for cruise ships as well as structures for rail and bus access. The development that will go into this region is a win-win—for the visitors who come here and the economic viability of our Southcentral communities.”“We are encouraged to get to this point with the conveyance of the ‘Tank Farm’ as this has been a project many years in the making. This land transfer, with Senator Murkowski’s help, is such a key component for our eco-economic development project with Huna Totem and Norwegian Cruise Line in making Whittier at tourism destination at the Head of the Bay. The benefit to our community, and tourism in Alaska, is immeasurable,” said Jim Hunt, Whittier City Manager.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-statement-on-reconciliation-proposal,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today commented on her opposition to the partisan budget reconciliation bill that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is expected to bring to the Floor for debate this week or weekend. According to preliminary estimates, the measure includes $433 billion in new spending and $739 billion in tax increases over the next decade.“While I continue to review the changing draft text, one thing that is abundantly clear is that the Democrat reconciliation bill is too much new spending with new taxes that will unfortunately be shouldered by the American people,” Murkowski said. “At a time when we are already facing unprecedented prices for gasoline, home heating fuel and overall energy costs, this bill would make it more costly to produce domestic oil and natural gas, further harming places like Alaska. It spends too much, with early projections showing it may actually add to inflation through 2024. It grows the bureaucracy in the IRS leading to costly, burdensome audits on taxpayers. And my greatest concern is that it raises taxes by more than $700 billion, when indicators suggest the U.S. is already in a recession. Such sweeping tax hikes will hurt investment we need to grow the economy, harm manufacturers at a time when we are attempting to re-shore our supply chains, and result in higher costs for the American people. This wholly partisan measure is not the cure for the country’s economic distress.” 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-introduces-comprehensive-arctic-bill,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), a leader on Arctic issues, introduced the Arctic Commitment Act, comprehensive legislation to address national priorities in the Arctic Region. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senator Angus King (I-ME), co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus with Senator Murkowski. The legislation includes a wide variety of Arctic-focused provisions pertaining to national security, shipping, research, and trade. It requires reports on eliminating Russia’s monopoly on Arctic shipping and establishing a permanent U.S. maritime presence in the Arctic. It calls for investments in deepwater Arctic ports and improves coordination among federal agencies on Arctic matters. The legislation also makes necessary updates to the Arctic Research and Policy Act.“I have long raised the importance of Alaska’s location and the immense value being an Arctic nation provides to our nation,” said Senator Murkowski. “This leadership role requires our attention, stewardship and active effort. I am proud to introduce this comprehensive Arctic bill—covering everything from arctic shipping, to national security, to domain awareness and presence, and strengthening our relationships with fellow Arctic nations. Opportunities abound in the Arctic, but accompanying them are great challenges and serious competition. This legislation takes measures to help protect our Arctic interests, project our capabilities in the High North, leverage our strategic location, and deepen relations with Arctic allies. The United States is an Arctic nation, and we must invest and lead in the region.”“The United States is an Arctic Nation, and it is long overdue that we think and act strategically to seize the new opportunities of the High North, as well as the challenges of the region,” said Senator King.  “We cannot be bystanders in the region when we are at a true inflection point in the Arctic.  We must be participants – and part of that leadership role includes investments in infrastructure, and standing up for our national interests through military and policy means that demonstrate our commitment and vision to making our presence a priority there.  I thank my Co-Chair on the Senate Caucus for sharing this bipartisan perspective as we make our intentions clear to pursue and defend America’s interests.”Click here for bill text.Bill Details:Background: Senator Murkowski is the leading expert among her Congressional colleagues on Arctic issues and has worked continuously to raise awareness of the region. At the beginning of the 114th Congress, Senator Murkowski and Senator King formed the Senate Arctic Caucus to advance issues important to the Arctic and to the people who live there. Murkowski is the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region. Murkowski has also led the charge to recapitalize and expand America’s fleet of Polar Security Cutters. Senator Murkowski paved the way for the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies to be established and in her role as an appropriator, she secured $10 million in the Fiscal Year 2021 appropriations package to fund the center.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/schatz-murkowski-statements-on-first-federal-indian-boarding-school-initiative-report,"U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), vice chairman of the Committee, released the following statements on the Department of the Interior’s release of its initial investigative report initiated by its Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, which called for a comprehensive review of the legacy of federal boarding school policies.“As Native communities across the country have long known, U.S. policy directly led to the forced assimilation, family separation, and deaths of Native children through federal Indian boarding schools,” said Chairman Schatz. “Today’s initial investigative report formally acknowledges this shameful legacy. I strongly support the Department’s continuing work to understand and address the full impact of past wrongs inflicted on Native children and their communities and intend to hold committee oversight hearings into this terrible injustice.”“I welcome the Interior Department’s first investigative report formally recognizing the impacts of the boarding school system on Native children and their families,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski. “Native leaders from Alaska, Hawaii and across Indian country have called for accountability from the federal government for its Indian boarding school policies. The long-term repercussions of these past federal assimilation policies are still with us today, a shameful legacy of the attempt to eradicate Native languages and cultures. This volume exemplifies the need to continue looking into this dark side of our nation’s past. And with the help of former students and their families, advocates, tribal leaders, and other stakeholders, we can work together to address these past injustices and move forward in healing. That is why I am co-leading legislation to establish a commission dedicated to directly working on this important issue.”Volume 1 of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report can be accessed here.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/-murkowski-reiterates-strong-support-for-codification-of-roe-v-wade-,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today reiterated her strong support for the codification of abortion rights as established by Roe v. Wade (1973) and affirmed by Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). While urging the preservation of those important rights for women, Murkowski will vote against S. 4132, the Women’s Health Protection Act, which has been described as codifying Roe v. Wade, but in reality goes much further—nullifying state and religious freedom laws across the country in the process.“I strongly support women’s reproductive freedoms, including the right to abortion established by Roe and Casey. I also believe in limited government and an individual’s liberty to make choices about their own health.“Consistent with Roe and Casey, I support reasonable limits on abortion services related to maternal health. I oppose late-term abortion, as long as there are clear and workable exceptions in the case of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened. I also oppose the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, and oppose any requirement for individuals to provide these services against their religious beliefs.“Congress should codify the important protections from Roe and Casey into law as they currently exist. That’s why, in February, Senator Collins and I introduced our Reproductive Choice Act, which would prevent women’s reproductive choices from being weakened or eliminated. Our bill would reassure women that the rights they have relied on for almost 50 years will continue to be the law of the land.“The legislation before the Senate today, the Women’s Health Protection Act, goes well beyond the precedent established in Roe and Casey. It does not include the Hyde amendment, which prohibits taxpayer dollars from being spent on abortions—and has been the law almost as long as Roe. It does not include conscience protections for healthcare providers that refuse to perform abortions based on religious beliefs. It explicitly overrides the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for the first time. It also allows late-term abortions without any notable restrictions.“Instead of taking yet another failed vote on a wholly partisan measure, I urge Democrats and Republicans alike to recognize that what Senator Collins and I have offered is in line with the views of a strong majority of Americans—who support a woman’s right to choose but believe that legal abortion should include reasonable limitations.”  In Alaska, courts have interpreted abortion rights as protected under the State Constitution, so the repeal of Roe v. Wade would have no immediate effect.Details About S. 3713, the Reproductive Choice Act: 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-directs-china-package-conferees-to-support-fisheries-invest-in-blue-economy,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Oceans Caucus, released the following statements after their legislation, the Bolstering Long-Term Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, Oceans, Bays, and Estuaries Act, or the BLUE GLOBE Act, advanced one step closer to becoming law. This week the Senate passed by voice vote Senators Murkowski and Whitehouse’s motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act, to include their BLUE Globe Act in the final conference report. Their legislation accelerates technology innovation, promotes a stronger maritime workforce, and bolsters the blue economy.“The BLUE GLOBE Act is one step closer to becoming law, which is great news for Alaska’s fisheries and coastal communities. I am proud of our unanimous voice vote last night, which reflects the bipartisan support for this initiative, and look forward to working with the conferees to get this one to the President’s desk,” said Senator Murkowski. “This legislation will improve the health of our fisheries, strengthen the competitiveness of the industry’s workforce, protect against China’s illegal fishing, and diversify our blue economy. I am excited for the opportunities that our fishing communities have and will continue to fight for this critical industry.”“I’m pleased our motion passed with broad support last night, continuing the Senate’s strong bipartisan tradition of caring for the oceans,” said Senator Whitehouse. “The oceans cover seventy percent of the planet, yet there’s much left to be learned about them. New high-quality research and data will help guide the future of the Blue Economy and support maritime jobs.” WATCH: Senator Murkowski’s motion to instruct conferees to include the BLUE GLOBE Act passed by a voice vote on the Senate Floor.Background: The BLUE GLOBE Act directs existing federal ocean-focused interagency committees to improve domestic and international coordination, enhance data management and accessibility, and accelerate ocean data and monitoring innovation by giving NOAA Cooperative Institutes a stronger focus on technology advancement. The bill creates a new ocean innovation prize, and tasks the National Academy of Sciences with assessing the need for an Advanced Research Project Agency–Oceans. The legislation also prioritizes the use of innovative technology to better address Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. This measure follows successful work by the Oceans Caucus to support the passage of four international agreements aimed at combatting IUU fishing and the related legislation.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-announce-fisheries-disaster-funding-for-alaska,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today announced the U.S. Department of Commerce will direct nearly $132 million to Alaska for fishery disasters. The funds, which were appropriated by Congress, are part of a total of $144 million that will be disbursed nationwide for this purpose.“I’m pleased to announce this crucial funding is finally on the way for Alaska’s seafood industry. After facing both serious fishery disasters and the pandemic, there are owners, employees, families, and entire communities in our state who can now breathe a little easier,” Senator Murkowski said. “I thank Secretary Raimondo and Director Young, who were strong partners at the Department of Commerce and OMB as we worked to reform and improve a truly broken approval process. Going forward, I will be pushing for further assistance, to help guarantee that Alaska’s industry can keep their operations up and running and continue to provide fresh, healthy seafood at home and around the globe.”“I want to express my appreciation to Secretary Raimondo and OMB Director Young for working so closely with me and my team to get these disaster declarations approved and funds allocated for Alaska’s fishermen,” Senator Sullivan said. “These disasters have had a widespread impact across our state—devastating many of our coastal and river-based communities, fishermen, and Alaska Native subsistence users. While these federal dollars won’t make these Alaskans and their families whole, they will go a long way toward providing much-needed relief.”Alaska FY 2022 Disaster AllocationFishery DisasterAllocations2019 Alaska Norton Sound King Crab$1,434,571Alaska 2018 Upper Cook Inlet East Side Setnet Salmon and 2020 Upper Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries$9,414,0872018 and 2020 Alaska Copper River and Prince William Sound Salmon Fisheries$34,360,6242019 and 2020 Alaska Bering Sea Tanner Crab Fishery$12,948,1482020 Alaska Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod$17,790,330Alaska Norton Sound, Yukon, Chignik, Prince William Sound, and Southeast Alaska Salmon Fisheries, 2020 and 2021 Yukon River Salmon Fishery$55,984,834TOTAL$131,932,594 (Source: NOAA)510 L Street

Few have been a better partner for Alaska over the course of decades or know more about our state’s critical role in America’s defense. I can’t think of a better keynote speaker to join us as we show our appreciation to the exemplary servicemembers stationed throughout Interior Alaska.”“Since 2011, Senator Murkowski has served as the honorary host for the evening, inviting strategic and influential military dignitaries to join her. We are incredibly grateful to Senator Murkowski for her continued support of the Chamber’s military appreciation banquet,” said Lisa Herbert, co-chair of the banquet planning committee. “What an incredible opportunity for the Golden Heart community to hear from someone as esteemed as General Mattis.”Background:The Military Appreciation Banquet in Fairbanks began 52 years ago as an at-home dinner hosted by Jim and Rosemary Messer to honor military members. Since its inception, the banquet has grown into a major annual event which typically draws more than 600 people in support of military members who serve in Interior Alaska and their families.As a staunch advocate for our military and their families, Murkowski has spoken at the event on multiple occasions. As the senior Senator for Alaska, she is proud to have the responsibility of inviting a guest of honor to serve as the keynote speaker. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senators-murkowski-cortez-masto-and-tester-push-administration-to-implement-bipartisan-laws-to-protect-native-women,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) joined Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Senators Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in pushing the administration to implement the bipartisan Not Invisible Act and Savanna’s Act—which were both signed into law in October 2020—to curb the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW). The administration has missed several key implementation deadlines, and the senators are specifically demanding that the administration share weekly updates with Congress to ensure that progress is being made.“For far too long, the loved ones of missing and murdered Indigenous people went without answers, access to resources, or justice,” said the Senators. “Congress acted to rectify this nation-wide problem with legislation, and we request an update on the implementation of the provisions outlined in the Not Invisible Act and Savanna’s Act. ...We remained concerned by the lack of progress shown and our constituents deserve to know the status of your work.”Senators Murkowski and Cortez Masto have worked together on bipartisan efforts to protect Native communities. The Not Invisible Act creates a point person in the Bureau of Indian Affairs to improve coordination of violent crime prevention across federal agencies and establishes the commission that DOI and DOJ continue to work to assemble, comprised of law enforcement, tribal leaders, federal partners, service providers, and survivors, who will ensure that the Departments work together to protect Native women and to address the epidemic of missing persons, murder, and trafficking of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Savanna’s Act, named in honor of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, requires federal law enforcement to create standard guidelines on responding to these crimes and increase data collection on them.The full text of the letter is available HERE.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/tribal-broadband-funding-secured-by-murkowski-heading-to-alaska,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), a senior member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, applauded the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announcement of broadband grants, including four grants totaling $41.5 million heading to Alaska. The grants are provided through NTIA’s Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program.The Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program was created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which made $980 million available for grants to eligible Native entities for broadband deployment, digital inclusion, workforce development, telehealth, and distance learning. At the end of 2020, Senator Murkowski worked to help negotiate a bipartisan COVID relief bill, which ended months of partisan deadlock.“Alaska’s geography, terrain, climate, and vast size create significant obstacles to developing broadband infrastructure. We know the digital divide is especially pronounced across rural Alaska and in Native villages. Yet, broadband is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity for modern life, providing access to health care, education, and more,” said Senator Murkowski. “I commend the Alaskan applicants in their successful efforts that will begin to bring transformational change to their communities through the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program.”“AFN is pleased to be included in this first big group of TBCP awards on behalf of our 74 tribal consortium members,” said Alaska Federation of Natives President Julie Kitka. “We would be remiss not to recognize and thank Senator Murkowski, though. None of this would have been possible without her skilled advocacy and legislating ability.”Alaska Grant Recipients: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2022/biden-administration-awards-nearly-77-million-expand-internet-access-dozens ###510 L Street

Jackson Women's Health Organization:“The leak of an internal and deliberative document from the nation’s highest court is absolutely reprehensible and needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. It politicizes the court and erodes the public’s trust in what is supposed to be an independent judiciary, at a time when we desperately need credibility within the courts.“Roe is still the law of the land, and we must wait to see the final decision when the Supreme Court actually issues one this summer.“We don’t know what their decision may ultimately say, but if it goes in the direction that this leaked draft has indicated, my legislation with Senator Collins to codify Roe so women's reproductive protections continue, will be more important than ever.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/committee-holds-briefing-on-ancsa-in-practice_how-ancsa-works-in-the-north-slope-region-of-alaska-,"Recently, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs (SCIA) Office of Vice Chairman Lisa Murkowski held a briefing for Congressional staff to highlight how Alaska Native organizations work together in the North Slope, given the unique approach to federal Indian law, which includes the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Representatives from the region shared how multiple layers of representation and service delivery systems provide for and enhance the lives of the Iñupiat. The briefing covered the unique legal framework in Alaska as well as the ways Tribes, tribal profits, municipal governments, and Alaska Native corporations all work together in providing critical services to Alaska Native people in the area.   “I am glad Congressional staff were able to attend the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs briefing to learn more about the Native institutions serving communities in the North Slope,” said Vice Chairman Lisa Murkowski. “By building collaborative partnerships across a fragmented system, Alaska Native leaders deliver a broad range of vital programs, services, and opportunities. Together, they provide for the long-term sustainability of their communities in one of the most remote regions in the nation. I thank all of the participants who made the journey from Alaska to share the history, unique federal policy framework, and their experiences in promoting the health, well-being, and economic advancement of their region—which helps to enable federal policy that benefits Native people.”Pictured: Attendees at the ANCSA in Practice Briefing Pictured: Participants from the North Slope region briefing Congressional staffParticipants from the North Slope region included: 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senators-seek-to-reauthorize-bipartisan-star-act-to-combat-childhood-cancer,"In an effort to help thousands of children who undergo cancer treatment each year, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act of 2022 (S.4120). This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, the most comprehensive childhood cancer bill ever passed by Congress, which approved the measure unanimously in 2018. The STAR Act helps advance pediatric cancer research and child-focused cancer treatments, while also improving childhood cancer surveillance and providing resources for survivors and those impacted by childhood cancer.  Since being signed into law the STAR Act has helped deliver over $120 million to fund promising childhood cancer research and assist patients and families battling cancer.“Reauthoring the STAR Act would mean more help for kids battling cancer.  It will target federal research to ensure the medical community is better equipped to diagnose and treat pediatric cancers and assist young patients and their families.  Renewing the STAR Act will get us closer to the goal of one day curing cancers in children, adolescents, and young adults,” said Senator Reed.  “The Childhood Cancer STAR Act will support cancer research and deliver needed assistance to children with cancer and their families.  It will develop new strategies to help survivors overcome late health effects, such as secondary cancers.”“I was incredibly proud to be part of the passage of the STAR Act in 2018, which has made an important difference in the lives of children with cancer, we well as childhood cancer survivors and their families. Since that time, the legislation has resulted in unprecedented opportunities and funding for childhood cancer research, allowed us to better understand and track the incidence of disease, and improved the quality of life for childhood cancer survivors. This reauthorization will allow these opportunities to continue and bring us closer to a world without childhood cancer,” Senator Capito said.“Far too many families in Maryland and across the country face the nightmare of a child with cancer – and while their stories are all different, all of these mothers, fathers, and children are looking for hope,” said Senator Van Hollen, who introduced the Childhood Cancer STAR Act during his time in the House of Representatives. “That’s why we fought to pass the initial Childhood Cancer STAR Act, and why we’re working invest in even more research and better treatments. Maryland is proud to be home to both NIH and NCI, and this investment will help them ultimately save lives.”“Cancer is an unimaginable and heartbreaking experience for anyone—particularly for children who are diagnosed and the caregivers who support them in their treatment journey. The STAR Act Reauthorization takes a multifaceted approach to addressing childhood cancer by boosting research efforts, bolstering data collection, and improving the quality of life for all the brave children who’ve survived this awful disease,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m proud to help introduce a comprehensive childhood cancer bill in an effort to help create a world for future generations where the phrase ‘you have cancer’ doesn’t exist.”There are over one hundred different subtypes of childhood cancers.  Most new cancer diagnoses in children are for leukemia (28.1%) and brain/CNS cancers (26.5%), while malignant epithelial neoplasms and melanomas (23.3%) and brain/CNS cancers (21.9%) are top cancers for adolescents, according to Children’s Cancer Cause.Childhood cancer research has progressed in recent years, but after accidents, cancer is still the second leading cause of death in children ages 1 to 14, according to the American Cancer Society.   Health experts estimate that nearly 10,500 children in the United States under the age of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2022.U.S. Representatives Michael McCaul (R-TX), Jackie Speier (D-CA), G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), and Mike Kelly (R-PA), are introducing companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.Summary: The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Reauthorization Act of 2022Expand Opportunities for Childhood Cancer Research:  Due to the relatively small population of children with cancer and the geographic distance between these children, researching childhood cancer can be challenging.  As such, the Childhood Cancer STAR Act reauthorizes and expands existing efforts at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to collect biospecimens for childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demographic information on all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.Improve Childhood Cancer Surveillance:  Building upon previous efforts, this bill authorizes grants to state cancer registries to identify and track incidences of child, adolescent, and young adult cancer.  This funding will be used to identify and train reporters of childhood cancer cases, secure infrastructure to ensure early reporting and capture of child cancer incidences, and support the collection of cases into a national childhood cancer registry.Help Improve Quality of Life Opportunities for Childhood Cancer Survivors:  Unfortunately, even after beating cancer, as many as two-thirds of survivors suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, including secondary cancers and organ damage. This legislation will enhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they age, and establish a new pilot program to begin to explore innovative models of care for childhood cancer survivors.Ensure Pediatric Expertise at the National Institutes of Health (NIH):  Requires the inclusion of at least one expert in pediatric oncology on the National Cancer Advisory Board and would improve childhood health reporting requirements to include pediatric cancer.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-applauds-new-149-million-fcc-commitment-in-emergency-connectivity-funding-to-lower-yukon-school-district-,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski issued the following statement on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announcement of its 13th wave of Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) program support, which includes $14,947,328 available for the Lower Yukon School District (LYSD) for the upcoming school year. The funding for equipment and services aims to close the homework gap by supporting affordable broadband and connectivity efforts in the school district.“I am thrilled for the kids of the Lower Yukon School District and know this FCC commitment will be transformational for their educational opportunities. Spanning 22,000 miles across ten villages, the importance of affordable, high-quality broadband and access to off-campus learning is critical to the schools of LYSD as they pursue their mission,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski. “When students were learning from home, many kids in the ten villages within the LYSD were left with few options, jeopardizing their education. I pushed the FCC to understand the unique situations that exist within Alaska’s rural and vast school districts, and I am proud to see this funding announcement that reflects an understanding of and respect for the needs of these Alaskan communities.  From Alakanuk to Pilot Station, kids will receive the technologies and connections they deserve to have a high-quality education.”“The Lower Yukon School District serves ten villages across 22,000 square miles. Our mission is to ensure tradition, culture and quality of education for all our children. Access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband is critical for our students and their future. We thank Senator Murkowski for her support bridging the digital divide and creating educational equity for all,” said Gene Stone, Superintendent, Lower Yukon School District.Senator Murkowski previously shared an FCC announcement awarding four school districts in Alaska funding from the ECF totaling over $15 million. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/blms-npr-a-plan-harms-american-energy-security-ignores-alaskan-voices,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today slammed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for reverting the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) to the 2013 version of its Integrated Activity Plan (IAP). This shortsighted decision closes millions of acres to responsible energy development, deliberately upending a careful balance in the management of the reserve and more broadly across Alaska lands.The Biden administration’s move abandons the 2020 version of the IAP, which was developed in partnership with the North Slope Borough and in consultation with North Slope Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations. It comes mere weeks after President Biden pledged to “work like the devil to bring gas prices down.”“This was the wrong decision when it was announced in January, and it is only worse today. We need more domestic resource development, and areas explicitly designated for that purpose should be at the top of the list, not on the chopping block. It is simply shocking that the Biden administration can look at the world, and decide that Alaska is where ‘keep it in the ground’ should apply,” Senator Murkowski said. “This decision also flies in the face of many of the Alaska Natives who live on the North Slope, who participated in the 2020 plan update and who supported its finalization. The administration is choosing to ignore them, while giving outside environmental groups everything they want.”“The Bureau of Land Management has 25 million acres of land nationwide available for oil development, 23 million of which are in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I have long urged the President to cut the gimmicks and tap this true ‘strategic petroleum reserve,’ which is teeming with reserves ready to alleviate some of our nation’s dire energy needs. But yesterday, President Biden doubled down on his failed policies, removing half of this federally-established oil and gas reserve from consideration and—even more reckless—specifically removing areas with the greatest potential for actual production. This decision will prolong the pain for hard-working Americans and tighten Vladimir Putin’s grip over our allies. Needless to say, President Biden is not doing everything in his power to control prices at the pump or relieve average Americans’ pain. We now know, record inflation, unprecedented gas prices, and a despot wielding vast sums of the world’s petroleum supply will not deter Joe Biden in his relentless war on American energy production.”BLM manages the NPR-A under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act and other federal laws. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the 23-million-acre region on the western North Slope – roughly the size of the state of Indiana – contains 8.7 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil.The Alaska delegation also condemned this decision when it was first announced in January 2022.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-blm-expands-lands-available-for-native-veterans-allotments,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement about the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) decision to open 27 million acres of land for Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to select their birthright allotments—which could have been the case from day one of the Biden administration onward. BLM’s decision is based on an environmental assessment that found there would be no significant impact from lifting outdated Public Land Orders (PLOs) for this purpose.“While this decision will expand the options that some veterans have as they select their allotments, BLM is now responsible for implementing it in a manner that does not create new conflicts over lands in our state. And let’s not forget that this would not have been necessary, at all, had the administration simply let former Secretary Bernhardt’s revocation of PLOs stand when it took office,” Senator Murkowski said. “To truly do right by our veterans and all Alaskans, the Biden administration must take two additional steps. First, they need to help us open already-identified refuge and Forest Service lands so that hundreds of veterans – especially in Southeast and Southwest – can select allotments closer to where they actually live. Second, the Department of the Interior needs to admit that the PLOs are obsolete, serving no valid purpose, and lift them across Alaska in their entirety.”Murkowski sponsored the John D. Dingell Conservation, Recreation, and Management Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-9), which created the Alaska Native Vietnam-Era Veterans Land Allotment Program based on legislation she, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and the late Congressman Don Young (R-AK) had previously introduced. The program offers an estimated 3,000 Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans an opportunity to finally receive their rightful allotments after missing the window to apply while serving our nation.  Murkowski also reiterated that the location of the lands made available under this program is of equal importance to the volume of acreage made available. In 2020, the Department of the Interior released a study recommending the opening of roughly 3.7 million acres of National Wildlife Refuge System lands in Alaska, as many eligible veterans do not live near BLM lands. Many of those veterans’ traditional hunting and fishing grounds have been locked away by federal land management designations for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that occurred without any consultation. Murkowski and Sullivan have introduced legislation in this Congress, S. 1951, the Alaska Native Vietnam Veteran Land Allotment Fulfillment Act, to formally open the recommended lands to allotment selection. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-king-cove-continue-fight-for-life-saving-road,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) visited King Cove, Alaska with Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Governor Mike Dunleavy (R-AK), and Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer, Anne Zink, to push for continued federal support and the urgent approval of a short, gravel, one-lane, life-saving road needed to connect the predominantly Aleut community to the all-weather airport in nearby Cold Bay.“We recently heard from the people of King Cove, who have stewarded these lands since time immemorial. Long before the federal government ever designated a refuge – without consulting them – this was their homeland. They have and always will care for it, and they are only asking for the same fundamental health and safety protections that just about everyone in the Lower 48 takes for granted,” Senator Murkowski said. “We heard the desperation, pain, and mental trauma that the lack of reliable emergency medical access has caused. We heard heart-wrenching stories, from airplane crashes, to a baby being born on a boat in rough seas who had to be kept warm in its oven, to sick and injured elders who had to be hoisted up to the Cold Bay dock in crab pots. My hope is that Secretary Haaland came here with an open mind, truly heard what was shared with her, and will support the Alaska Native people who live in King Cove. We must uphold the land exchange agreement needed to facilitate the life-saving road and finally put an end to this terrible environmental injustice.” Senator Murkowski, Governor Dunleavy, and Secretary Haaland among students and community members at King Cove School. As part of the trip, Senator Murkowski visited the King Cove School, where she was honored with an Aleut name, Sixsadag^ulux, which translates to “never breaks in two,” from the Agdaagux Tribe of King Cove.“I’m deeply honored and humbled to have been gifted this name—especially by a people who, themselves, never break,” Senator Murkowski said. “We will never stop, and never break, in our joint effort to protect their health and safety through a life-saving road.”Dustin Newman of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association presided over the naming ceremony, along with Etta Kuzakin and Della Trumble of the Agdaagux Tribe of King Cove. Background: King Cove is located between two volcanoes near the end of the Alaska Peninsula, about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. The small gravel airstrip in King Cove is typically closed by bad weather for more than 100 days each year. Many of the flights not canceled are impacted or delayed by wind, turbulence, fog, rain, or snow squalls. By comparison, the federally-built all-weather airport in Cold Bay, which is less than 30 miles away from King Cove, has one of the longest runways in the state and is closed an average of 10 days per year. Yesterday’s flights from Anchorage to King Cove and back were no exception. It was unclear whether the delegation would be able to fly to King Cove until shortly before departure, as heavy rains and high winds (with gusts nearing 50 miles per hour) were forecast in King Cove yesterday evening and overnight.Between December 2013 and April 2022, the residents of King Cove endured at least 175 emergency medevacs. Most occurred in dangerous weather conditions and many had to be carried out by the U.S. Coast Guard (USGC), risking the lives of crews and patients alike and coming at significant expense to U.S. taxpayers. The last USCG medevac occurred in March 2022, when a crew airlifted an individual in respiratory distress.In 2019, the Department of the Interior entered into an equal-value land exchange agreement with the King Cove Native Corporation in order to facilitate the life-saving road through a small part of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The link would connect two existing roads that already exist inside and outside of the refuge. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reinstated the agreement, vacating the decision of a lower court. Senator Murkowski continues to urge the Biden administration, including Secretary Haaland, to maintain its legal defense of the agreement.    510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/sullivan-and-murkowski-ask-secretary-haaland-to-correct-injustice-approve-land-orders-needed-for-alaska-native-vietnam-era-veterans-to-select-promised-allotments,"U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) today sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, in advance of her first visit to Alaska this week, asking the secretary to expeditiously allow the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program to proceed. Specifically, the senators are requesting the secretary lift the Public Land Orders (PLOs) that would make over 28-million acres of federal land available for selection by eligible veterans or their heirs. The senators warned that the program has a five-year sunset date, which means further delays could deny thousands of Alaska Natives their birthright of a land allotment.The Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program, secured by the senators and the late Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska), was enacted as part of the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr., Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2019.Below is the full text of the letter:The Honorable Deb Haaland Secretary Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, NW Washington DC 20240 Dear Secretary Haaland: The Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program enacted in section 1119 of the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr., Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-9) was authored by the Alaska congressional delegation for the purpose of providing eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans an opportunity to select up to 160-acre parcels of land to fulfill their land allotment entitlements. Prior to your confirmation, we spoke repeatedly about the critical importance of the Department of the Interior (DOI) faithfully executing section 1119 so Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans could finally receive their allotments. Frustratingly, despite your commitment, DOI has passed up an opportunity to make millions of acres of land available in the most straightforward, publicly-supported, and legally defensible manner and effectively paused this program for much of the last year. As required by the Dingell Act, DOI, through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), developed the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This work across multiple agencies culminated in the development of the program and subsequent revocation of Public Land Orders (PLOs), providing an over 28-million-acre pool of land for eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to choose from. Lifting the PLOs is critical to administering the program because it removes encumbrances on lands throughout Alaska and meets the terms of the Dingell Act, which restricts allotment selections to only unencumbered lands. The BLM recently issued a draft Environmental Assessment (EA), which we understand may be finalized as soon as this week. Unfortunately, this draft EA allows for allotment selections on lands that are top-filed, selected, leased, permitted, in rights-of-way, or otherwise encumbered by other entities. We are concerned this may further cloud title on those lands, thereby obscuring an already complex set of land use and ownership structures, and could lead to greater conflict over them. This only further complicates and delays aging Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans or their heirs from receiving their allotments. The Alaska congressional delegation unanimously agreed with the former Secretary of the Interior’s decision to revoke 28 million acres of PLOs to help resolve the remaining State of Alaska and Alaska Native land entitlements per the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA), the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA), and the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2004 (ALTAA)—while also clearing the way for Alaska Native veterans to select lands and receive their rightful allotments. As required by ALTAA, the BLM reported to Congress in 2006 recommending the revocation of 56 million acres of PLOs. In that same report, the BLM stated to Congress that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1976 (NEPA) analysis for the revocation of the PLOs would be completed through the Resource Management Planning (RMP) process. Since that time, every RMP has recommended revocation of PLOs with the accompanied RMP NEPA analysis. In 2020, the BLM, in conjunction with the DOI Solicitors office, conducted a Determination of NEPA Adequacy on the PLOs and found that the underlying NEPA analysis was adequate.On January 20, 2021, the Biden administration through acting Secretary de la Vega, acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Daniel-Davis, and others, halted any PLO revocation announcements in the Federal Register. This placed the decision by former-Secretary Bernhardt regarding the lifting of PLOs on hold, taking 28 million acres of available land off the table from selection and leaving eligible veterans and their heirs with a dramatically reduced pool of available land totaling roughly 480,000 acres or 1.7 percent of the available lands under the lifted PLOs. Despite your commitment to us to expedite the program, you have delayed progress, weaponized the lifting of the PLOs, and convoluted the process to the point that nobody clearly understands the intentions of the Department.The BLM has already delayed this process for well over a year with no real stated purpose or need. The underlying NEPA analysis has already been completed and the PLO revocations are signed. The only needed exercise is to announce the revocation of the already signed PLOs in the Federal Register. We are aware of the existence of a Solicitor’s analysis stating even this step—announcement in the Federal Register—is unnecessary. However, if the BLM believes this is necessary, we, once again, encourage the immediate announcement in the Federal Register.In closing, we want to remind you that section 1119 includes a five-year sunset of the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program, and every day of continued delay for additional reviews, consultations, and analysis further jeopardizes the ability for Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans or their heirs to receive their promised allotments. We ask that you do the right thing and remedy the situation by immediately lifting the PLOs—in their entirety—because it is simple, takes no more time, and adds no additional costs. Your commitment to this result will accelerate the selection of lands by Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans, and help fulfill the largest Native claims in American history after a more than 50-year wait.Sincerely,  510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-statement-on-highest-inflation-in-four-decades,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) released the following statement after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a report showing inflation reached 8.5 percent over the past year, the largest year-over-year increase since 1981.“The numbers in this report serve to underscore the painful reality that Alaskans are facing every time they go to a grocery store or a gas station. Just about everything is being impacted by rising inflation as we see the cost of transportation and the overall cost of living punish families and businesses across our state.“In rural parts of Alaska, the impacts are even more dramatic. In Noatak, people are paying almost $18 for a gallon of gasoline. In Point Hope, families are paying up to $8 for a loaf of bread and $3.39 for a quart of milk. These are real impacts that can be financially crippling. “What we are seeing demands a comprehensive response from the Biden administration, the Federal Reserve, and policymakers. As part of that, we need to focus on supply chains and increase the domestic supply of a wide range of resources—starting with energy, which rose by 11 percent over the past month alone—and extending to minerals, which form the basis for just about every product in our modern society.“Alaska is uniquely positioned to help, if only the Biden administration would allow us to do so. We can produce more oil, to ease pain at the pump. We can build a gasline, to add billions of cubic feet to world markets each day. We can produce graphite, cobalt, and many additional minerals to help restrain rising commodity prices. And we can do all this without compromising environmental standards and continuing to reduce emissions.“Resource producers in Alaska are ready to work. It’s time for the Biden administration to unleash our potential to help reduce inflation. At this point, there’s simply no substitute and no excuse for not doing so.”To read BLS’ Consumer Price Index for March 2022, click here.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-speier-call-on-army-secretary-to-address-high-alaska-servicemember-suicide-rate,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, and Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel have sent a letter to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth calling on the Army to do more to address the high incidence of service member deaths by suicide in Alaska and to take comprehensive actions to change the current trajectory.“The rate of suicides among America’s military community is both heartbreaking and gut wrenching. One suicide alone is too many. Even more troubling is that the rate of suicide by those stationed in Alaska is even higher. I’ve heard firsthand from so many servicemen and women in Alaska about the challenges they face—from physical and psychological trauma, isolation, to seasonal depression. We need to do everything in our power to turn this tide and be there for our service members—to get them the proper help they need so suicide is never the answer. This includes working to ensure there are enough mental health providers to serve those who are defending our nation,” Senator Murkowski said. “This is one of my highest priorities and I appreciate working with Representative Speier, Senator Sullivan and others to ensure the military services have the resources to see this through.”“It is a tragedy that the scourge of suicide disproportionately harms Alaska's military service members and their families,” Senator Sullivan said. “Alaska is home to thousands of military service members and more veterans per capita than any other state. But along with that proud distinction, our state also has horrifically high rates of military suicide. As a Marine, I have seen firsthand what happens when service members suffering from a mental health crisis do not receive help. Even when a service member musters the courage to seek help, it can take 60 days to actually see a professional—and, as we’re seeing, these brave Americans rarely have 60 days. I want to thank Congresswoman Speier and Secretary Wormuth for joining me in Alaska to hear from our soldiers directly. I will continue to fight to keep this issue front-and-center for our service members, for the families who have suffered the unbearable pain of suicide, and for our future generations. Ensuring our service members and their families have access to the resources and support they need to improve their mental health and prevent suicide will continue to be one of my highest priorities in the U.S. Senate. One life lost is one too many.”“The epidemic of military suicides across America cries out for immediate action, especially in Alaska where twice as many servicemembers died in 2021 compared to 2020. I have spoken previously with the spouses and parents of servicemembers who have died by suicide there, as well as other servicemembers and behavioral health care providers overwhelmed with demand in the region. And I will travel to Alaska later this month, joining Senator Sullivan to review the situation on the ground as part of a congressional delegation,” Representative Speier said. “There are reforms that we can make to fix this, but to do so we must understand clearly what challenges exist and where action must be taken. There is nothing like talking directly to the servicemembers, face to face, to find solutions. We must do this to ensure our servicemembers are getting what they need to stop this senseless loss of lives.”The letter to Secretary Wormuth asks for the Army’s plans to address several areas of concern based on observations and extensive feedback from service members and civilians in Alaska, including:Click here for a copy of the letter.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-supports-additional-penalties-for-russia,"The Senate today passed two measures to impose additional penalties on Russia over its bloody, unprovoked war on Ukraine. The first measure, H.R. 6968, imposes a legislative ban on Russian energy imports and contains language crafted in part by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) to expedite its implementation. The second measure, H.R. 7108, would suspend permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), a key benefit of World Trade Organization membership, for Russia and Belarus.“Congress remains united in our support for Ukraine, and we will hold the Russian regime accountable for the devastation, atrocities, and war crimes it has committed. As part of that, I’m grateful to Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo of the Finance Committee for working with Senator Manchin and me to reinforce and tighten the language of the Russian energy import ban,” Senator Murkowski said. “Now, President Biden needs to step up and remove his administration’s sanctions on resource projects in Alaska. There is no question that Alaska can and would do more to produce the energy and minerals that America and the world need, if only the administration would partner with us instead of blocking us at every turn. If there was ever a time for the President to look in the mirror and bring his policies back to reality, it is right now.”Background: On March 3, 2022, Senators Murkowski and Manchin introduced S. 3757, the Ban Russian Energy Imports Act, to prohibit the importation of Russian crude oil, petroleum, petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal. Their bill, which has 37 bipartisan cosponsors, is widely credited with prompting President Biden to issue an executive order to block Russian energy imports on March 8, 2022. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmed-to-be-supreme-court-justice,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today voted to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the next Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, filling the vacancy that will be created when Justice Stephen Breyer retires at the end of the current term. The nomination was confirmed by a bipartisan vote of 53-47.“I give my constitutional ‘advice and consent’ responsibility to consider Supreme Court nominees the tremendous weight it deserves. In all my reviews of Supreme Court nominees, I look at their qualifications, independence, lack of bias, integrity, and temperament. Judge Jackson met the incredibly high bar I set for service on the highest court of the land.“In addition to reviewing her record, I had the opportunity to speak with Judge Jackson on two occasions, to learn more about her background, jurisprudence, and discuss issues important to Alaskans. Her qualifications and her record demonstrate her knowledge and respect for the Constitution. I congratulate her on this achievement and celebrate her historic confirmation with Americans.“One thing that Judge Jackson’s confirmation hearings made clear is that Congress needs to revisit the PROTECT Act to address the heinous crimes of child abuse, including child pornography. It is the responsibility of Congress to provide updated direction to the U.S. Sentencing Commission and that review is underway.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-to-support-confirmation-of_judge-ketanji-brown-jackson,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced today that she will support the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has been nominated to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. “After multiple in-depth conversations with Judge Jackson and deliberative review of her record and recent hearings, I will support her historic nomination to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.“My support rests on Judge Jackson’s qualifications, which no one questions; her demonstrated judicial independence; her demeanor and temperament; and the important perspective she would bring to the court as a replacement for Justice Breyer. She clerked for Justice Breyer before working in the private sector and as a federal public defender, and then serving as Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a district court judge, and now an appeals court judge. She will bring to the Supreme Court a range of experience from the courtroom that few can match given her background in litigation.  “It also rests on my rejection of the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees, which, on both sides of the aisle, is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year. While I have not and will not agree with all of Judge Jackson’s decisions and opinions, her approach to cases is carefully considered and is generally well-reasoned. She answered satisfactorily to my questions about matters like the Chevron doctrine, the Second Amendment, landmark Alaska laws, and Alaska Native issues. The support she has received from law enforcement agencies around the country is significant and demonstrates the judge is one who brings balance to her decisions.”“I will support the motion to discharge Judge Jackson’s nomination later tonight, and her confirmation later this week.” 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-respond-to-damaging-designation-of-critical-habitat-in-alaska,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today slammed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for announcing it is designating critical habitat in U.S. waters off the coast of Alaska for the Beringia “distinct population segment” (DPS) of bearded seals and Arctic ringed seals. The designated area extends from St. Matthews to the Canadian border in the Beaufort Sea, which is roughly equivalent in size to Texas.“NOAA’s decision to designate more than 260,000 square miles as ‘critical habitat’ for seals goes beyond federal overreach. It is an abuse of power, inappropriately leveraging the Endangered Species Act. The domino effect this could have on fisheries, shipping, arctic infrastructure, responsible resource development, and more – is quite serious for Alaska and all who live, work, and raise families here,” said Sen. Murkowski. “I stand firmly with the many Alaskans, including the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the North Slope Borough, who know this immense designation of critical habitat is simply unjustifiable and will create more harm than benefit for Arctic communities and our state as a whole. Alaskans are good stewards of our environment, including the important marine species that dwell in our waters and along our coasts. We do not need – and will not accept – harmful layers of unilaterally-imposed bureaucracy that largely serve to hinder our ability to grow, subsist, and adapt in the Arctic.”“A broad coalition of Alaskans—Alaska Native organizations, resource development groups, our fishermen, individual Alaskans, Alaska’s congressional delegation, and the state—have fought against these unnecessary and overreaching ESA listings since they were issued back in 2012 and 2014,” said Sen. Sullivan. “NOAA’s designation of critical habitat for both species allows these crushing federal regulatory burdens to take effect across broad swaths of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, further locking up our lands, waters and resources. As I’ve done throughout my entire career, I will continue to fight against this federal overreach, and the deep state federal agencies and far-left radical environmentalists, who have no regard for the well-being of Alaskans and work together relentlessly to stifle our ability to have an economy, and support our families and communities.”NOAA previously proposed critical habitat for the ringed seal in 2014 and the bearded seal in 2021. The agency openly acknowledges that the proposed designation would likely result in restrictions on oil and gas activities, marine transportation, port development, defense-related activities, and commercial fishing in state and federal waters.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/administration-announces-additional-h-2b-visas,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) released the following statement after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) announced 35,000 additional H-2B nonagricultural worker visas for the second half of fiscal year 2022, which will be available to employers for the summer 2022 season.“With the tourism and fishing season right around the corner, and the economic fallout we have seen from COVID, it is vital to ensure Alaskans have the needed workers to supplement our local workforce. The federal H-2B program has been crucial in Alaska, allowing businesses to hire workers from other countries for positions and jobs they otherwise cannot fill, despite their best efforts to recruit Alaskans and Americans to fill their vacancies. I thank Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Walsh for understanding the importance and timeliness of this program, and working with me to release additional visas while we work on a permanent, long-term solution.”“Today’s supplemental H-2B visa release announcement from DHS is of critical importance to the Alaska seafood industry. Maximum staffing in Alaska’s seafood processing plants in front of the enormous harvest predictions for Bristol Bay has a multiplying effect across the industry and regional economies. It will be important for DHS and DOL to facilitate this visa release such that visas can be issued prior to the biological timing and arrival of salmon. Senator Murkowski’s continued support and leadership within the Alaska seafood industry is greatly appreciated,” said Brian Gannon, Director of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs for United Work and Travel. “The additional 35,000 H-2B visas announced today for the second half of FY22 are a potential lifeline to some seafood processing companies in Alaska, who may otherwise be short-staffed this summer.  These visas were authorized only weeks ago in the consolidated appropriations bill, and we’re grateful for Senator Murkowski’s work and leadership leading up to today’s announcement.  It’s now vital that DHS and DOL follow through and facilitate guest worker arrival in Alaska before major salmon fisheries get underway,” said Chris Barrows, President of the Pacific Seafood Processors Association.In January, DHS and DOL announced 20,000 additional H-2B visas, making the first release of supplemental visas in the first half of the fiscal year.The federal H-2B program allows businesses to hire thoroughly screened workers from foreign countries for temporary positions that they have not been able to fill with local workers. It is frequently used to support Alaska’s seafood and tourism industries. This program allows for foreign workers to work in the United States for a season and return to their home countries. These visas are for U.S. employers that are facing irreparable harm without additional workers.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-latest-biden-oil-plan-is-half-baked-irresponsible,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, today released the following statement after President Biden announced he would release approximately 180 million barrels of emergency oil reserves over the next six months. In addition, instead of taking meaningful steps to increase domestic oil and gas production, the President called on Congress to impose new fees on domestic oil and gas leaseholders.“Earlier this week, the President proposed to raise taxes on domestic energy producers by tens of billions of dollars. Today, he announced he will sell off a substantial portion of our emergency oil reserves. While this may increase supply temporarily, it is like selling off the insurance policy. It does little to increase domestic production. What he laid out isn’t a responsible plan; it’s the weakest possible effort to shift blame for rising gas prices,” Senator Murkowski said. “The administration can come up with all of the half-baked strategies it wants, including ideas from the past that have repeatedly been rejected, but they will fail to solve the fundamental problem staring them in the face until they embrace the need for more domestic production. For the administration to claim they are doing everything they can to increase production is a fantasy.”  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) contains approximately 588 million barrels of oil that are to be released in the event of “severe energy supply interruptions,” not simply rising prices that have been worsened by 15 months of misguided administration policy. A large-scale SPR sale may temporarily reduce global oil prices by a small amount, but is insufficient to offset the current price increase, sends the wrong signal for domestic production, and runs the risk of leaving the U.S. short-handed on emergency reserves in the event of a longer-term crisis. Just four weeks ago, the President announced a separate selloff of 30 million barrels from the SPR, which did nothing to restrain prices.The “use it or lose it” concept – which assumes that American oil and gas companies pay millions of dollars to the federal government for leases with no intention of ever developing them – ignores the realities and difficulties of receiving approval for energy production on federal lands. Not every lease contains developable resources; major projects – like Willow, in northeast Alaska – are actively being held up by the federal government or by the courts; and leases are, by definition, already “use it or lose it” by virtue of their contractual terms. This will do little or no good in encouraging domestic production unless the administration follows them with more realistic permitting and eliminating unreasonable delays.Murkowski, the former Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, strongly supports greater domestic energy and mineral development, particularly in her home state of Alaska—the nation’s resource storehouse. Among other major policy improvements, she led congressional efforts to open the 1002 Area of ANWR to responsible development in 2017 and included her federal mine permitting reforms in the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021. She continues to call on the Biden administration to expand access to federal areas for responsible development; to approve permits for key energy projects on a timely basis without deliberate delay; and to expedite the infrastructure, such as pipelines, needed to support them. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/dpa-announcement-on-mineral-security-will-benefit-alaska,"At the urging of U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Jim Risch (R-ID), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), President Biden today announced that he is invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to spur critical mineral production.On March 11, the Senators sent a letter to President Biden calling to invoke the DPA to rebuild the capacity of key sectors and value-chains by domestically producing and processing critical minerals such as graphite, manganese, cobalt, lithium, and nickel to support national security.“This is an overdue step that will help address one of our nation’s most significant vulnerabilities, our increasing dependence on foreign supply of critical minerals. While there are a range of actions we should be taking to address this challenge, including further federal permitting reforms, the Defense Production Act is an important complement to them,” Senator Murkowski said. “My hope is that this decision marks the start of a much more serious emphasis on our nation’s mineral security, and that real projects, especially mines, in states like Alaska, result from it. It is also critical that the five minerals addressed under this decision are just the start, not the end, of federal efforts to rebuild our domestic supply chains.”“I am pleased that President Biden has taken seriously our bipartisan call to strengthen our domestic critical minerals supply chain by invoking the Defense Production Act to increase production of five vital battery minerals. These minerals are essential to the technologies we have come to depend on and accelerating their production is vital to our energy and national security. Building out our domestic supply chain and reducing our reliance on Russia, China and other adversarial nations is more important than ever before. I urge the Administration to continue using all the tools at their disposal and working with Congress to unlock the full potential of our nation’s vast natural resources to deny any nation the ability to use supply chain dependencies against us and our allies,” said Chairman Manchin.“While I am heartened that President Biden is heeding our concerns and invoking the Defense Production Act for certain critical minerals, this needs to be the beginning, not the end, of immediate and aggressive efforts to shore up our mineral supply chains,” said Senator Risch. “The United States’ overreliance on countries like Russia and China for these vital materials is a matter of national security. Many states, including my home state of Idaho, contain rich deposits of critical minerals we cannot afford to ignore any longer. We must take action to prioritize domestic critical mineral development before this serious threat turns into an active crisis.”“We cannot go from a dependency on foreign oil to a dependency on Chinese minerals,” said Dr. Cassidy. “It is encouraging that the administration listened to our letter and is announcing action. However, enacting the DPA without addressing the bureaucratic logjam of permitting would be little more than symbolism. We have to also streamline the permitting process that could delay any effort by years.”“Giving graphite and the battery materials the DPA Title III designation – as ‘essential to national defense’ – is a strong signal that the full force of the U.S. federal government will now be behind domestic development of these ‘super-criticals’. All of us at Graphite One want to thank Senator Murkowski, the Senate’s undisputed expert on critical minerals, and Chairman of the Senate ENR Committee, Joe Manchin who made such a compelling case for President Biden to take this step,” said Anthony Huston, the President and CEO of Graphite One. “With the USGS recognizing Graphite One’s Alaska deposit just last month as being America’s largest known graphite deposit, and adding to that our plan to produce battery-ready anode material, Graphite One is ready to answer the call, and create a complete advanced graphite supply chain solution for the U.S.”""Alaska’s miners are pleased that the Biden Administration has finally connected the dots between increased mineral demand and the American sources to meet it.  The Presidential Determination refers to the need for 'environmentally responsible domestic mining and processing,' and no place does it better than we do in Alaska.  It is our hope that the Administration will expand beyond the minerals related just to battery storage, and aggressively pursue domestic development of all of the minerals we need more of, like copper, gold, silver, and zinc.  It is also our hope that the President’s policies are met with the most important thing needed to grow domestic mining: regulatory certainty.  We are deeply appreciative of Senators Murkowski and Sullivan for reminding the Administration of this, and for frequently highlighting the importance of a stable permitting regime in Congress,"" said Deantha Skibinski, Executive Director of Alaska Miners Association. 510 L Street

Federal representatives will be present to answer questions about programs and resources the law is making available. Officials from several state agencies – which are responsible for the allocation of significant formula funding from the new law – will also be on hand.The event is free and open to the public.“Our bipartisan infrastructure law provides for truly historic investments that will benefit communities across Alaska for years to come. I’m hosting this symposium to help Alaskans understand and maximize the assistance we bring to our state to improve, maintain, and upgrade our infrastructure,” said Senator Murkowski. “Any Alaskan who is interested is welcome to attend, and I look forward to connecting those who do with our federal and state partners.”What:             Infrastructure Grant Symposium, hosted by Senator Lisa MurkowskiWho:               Representatives from Federal and State Agencies When:             Monday, April 11, 2022 from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm AKDTWhere:           Dena’ina Civic and Convention Center, 600 W 7th Ave, Anchorage, AK, 99501RSVP:            On Senator Murkowski’s website Download a PDF of the “Save the Date” HERE.Agenda for the Infrastructure Grant Symposium 10:00 am                                 Doors OpenTikahtnu Ballroom 10:30 am                                 Introduction                                                 State Director Steve Wackowski10:35 am                                 Welcome Senator Lisa Murkowski11 am – 12:00 pm                  Invited Speakers12:00 pm – 4:00 pm              Agency OverviewsProgram Directors will highlight funding opportunities and other key pointsTikahtnu E-C10:00 am – 4:00 pm               Resource Fair 4:00 pm                                  Adjourn510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-lead-resolution-honoring-congressman-don-young-,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today thanked the Senate for unanimously cosponsoring and passing their resolution honoring the life and legacy of Congressman Don Young, who served Alaska in the House of Representatives for the last 49 years. Congressman Young passed away on March 18, 2022.“Congressman Don Young was larger than life, as is the legacy he leaves behind. He devoted 49 years to the service of Alaska and the nation. In that time, he shepherded critical, generational legislation into law and became Dean of the House—the longest-serving Republican of all time. He became a close friend to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, but was always best known for his steadfast loyalty to his home state,” said Senator Murkowski. “This resolution is one of the many ways we will honor Congressman Young, to ensure that the life and leadership of the Congressman for all Alaska, one of the most effective legislators of our time, will be remembered always.”Click here for video of Senator Murkowski’s remarks at Congressman Young’s Lying in State Ceremony.“Don Young was so authentic in an age of overly-coached politicians. He was a throwback to a time and a place where people were respected, not so much for how they talked or how they looked, but for what they could do. And boy did he do a lot in life and for Alaska. He was a teacher, a tugboat captain, a gold miner, a mayor and, of course, he was a relentless fighter in the House for the great state of Alaska,” said Senator Sullivan. “Don’s sudden death leaves a major void in Congress, in Alaska, in the hearts of his family, and in all of us who knew and loved him. It leaves a very real void in our small but mighty Alaska delegation. But his tenacious, indomitable spirit lives on. Rest in peace, Don Young.”Click here for video of Senator Sullivan’s remarks at Congressman Young’s Lying in State Ceremony.Murkowski and Sullivan introduced S. Res. 565 yesterday and asked unanimous consent to pass it as Congressman Young lay in state in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall. Every member of the Senate cosponsored the resolution.

Now that the President has detailed his priorities, those of us in Congress will begin to evaluate which programs to fund and at what levels. As part of this, and just as we did for FY 2022, we will have an opportunity to bring taxpayer dollars back to our state through a very transparent Congressionally Directed Spending process,” Senator Murkowski said. “I look forward to hearing directly from Alaskans about their needs so I can advocate for them, and help build on the considerable progress we made last year.”Senator Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Interior-Environment Subcommittee, will make the Appropriations Request Form for FY 2023 available for interested Alaskans on her website starting today.

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/klobuchar-murkowski-collins-sinema-bipartisan-legislation-to-honor-supreme-court-justices-ginsburg-and-oconnor-passes-the-house,"U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, with U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), announced that their bipartisan legislation to honor U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor with statues in the U.S. Capitol campus or on Capitol grounds has passed the House. The bill now goes to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Members of the House of Representatives, led by Democratic Women’s Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Lois Frankel (D-FL), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), and Jackie Speier (D-CA), and Vice Chairs Congresswomen Veronica Escobar (D-TX) and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX), and Bipartisan Women’s Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Madeleine Dean (D-PA) and Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR), led the passage of the House companion legislation.“Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor were trailblazers long before reaching the Supreme Court, opening doors for women at a time when so many insisted on keeping them shut. The Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of democracy, a place where people from across our country have their voices represented and heard. It is only fitting that we honor their remarkable lives and service to our country by establishing statues in the Capitol. Now that this bill has passed the House, I look forward to it being signed into law,” Klobuchar said. “The contributions of Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have left an enduring impact on our nation, and their legacies of service have inspired generations of women,” said Murkowski. “I’m proud to see that this bipartisan bill has now passed the House of Representatives and Senate, and will soon head to the President’s desk to be signed into law. Having a place for their statues in the U.S. Capitol is a fitting way to honor these Justices and ensures their legacies live on.”“Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg will always be known as dedicated public servants, fierce champions for equality, and accomplished Americans who broke countless barriers in the field of law,” said Collins. “Statues in the nation’s capital honoring the first two women to serve on the highest court in the land will serve as fitting tributes to their invaluable contributions to our country.”“Justice O’Connor and Justice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women in law and life. By permanently placing their statues in the U.S. Capitol, we’re honoring their legacy and reminding visitors to our nation’s Capitol that women can achieve their dreams through grit and determination,” said Sinema. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Angus King (I-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Tina Smith (D-MN) joined their colleagues in cosponsoring the legislation.

And, in some cases, TECs were outright denied access to life-saving data that the CDC routinely made available to other public health authorities, including state and local health departments. Access to epidemiological data is vital for TECs to provide accurate and timely public health information, including recommendations, to the Native communities they serve,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski. “Our bill amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations and TECs have access to public health data and surveillance programs guaranteed to them as tribal public health authorities under existing federal law. I hope following our legislative hearing, we can get this bill done so that there are no further needless delays in accessing important health data.”Click here to watch Senator Murkowski’s remarks.The following witnesses testified during the legislative hearing:Click here to watch the video of the hearing and to read the witnesses’ testimony. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-announces-new-round-of-fcc-emergency-connectivity-funding-commitments-to-alaska-,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) shared three announcements from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) in support of broadband and connectivity in Alaska.First, the FCC awarded four school districts in Alaska funding from the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF), a program that helps schools and libraries provide the telecommunication tools and services students and communities need. Second, the FCC will open a third application filing window for emergency connectivity funding, from April 28 to May 13. Finally, the FCC announced an extension to the deadline to spend the funding awarded through the third window of applications: July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023. These announcements follow significant advocacy from Senator Murkowski surrounding Alaska’s unique circumstances and needs.LOCATION RECIPIENT TOTALKotzebueNorthwest Arctic Borough School District$14,371,030.47McGrathIditarod Area School District$508,166.40TokAlaska Gateway School District$134,033.15FairbanksYukon-Koyukuk School District$630,444.00 “Education is fundamental to the future of any state, but the inability to access the internet and virtual learning at home, at school, and at the community library is deterring educational progress for students across Alaska. I worked hard with the FCC to ensure that Alaska’s schools, particularly rural schools that lack connectivity and broadband, will be able to provide students with the ability to get their work done from home,” said Senator Murkowski. “The good news doesn’t end at the announcement of funding awarded to these four school districts, though. I know that many schools and libraries in Alaska struggled with the ECF application process. I also recognize how important this funding is to maximize opportunities for young Alaskans. That’s why I pushed the FCC to ensure that they have enough time not only to apply for funding, but also to spend any funding that they may receive. I appreciate the FCC for recognizing the unique needs of Alaskans. This support is too critical to Alaska – to the educational experience of our young people – to be rushed.”ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:The funding awarded to Alaska comes as a result of the first and second window of ECF applications. For more information on the schools and libraries receiving funding, click here.The third application filing window will allow eligible schools and libraries a chance to submit requests for FCC funding for the purchase of eligible learning tools and equipment. This third opportunity will likely be the last round of applications available for the remaining ECF funds. For more information about the third window for applying, click here. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-cantwell-spearhead-legislation-to-strengthen-blue-economy-and-support-coastal-communities,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced the Ocean Regional Opportunity and Innovation Act of 2022 (Ocean ROI Act of 2022), which would direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish “Ocean Innovation Clusters” (ocean clusters) to strengthen the coastal communities and blue economy of the nation. Senator Murkowski is a strong supporter of Ocean Clusters, including the Alaska Ocean Cluster which serves as a hub for private, public, and academic stakeholders to collaborate on opportunities to promote and enhance the maritime industry. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) are original cosponsors of the legislation.For text of the bill, click here.“The U.S. is home to a number of burgeoning ocean clusters, including the Alaska Ocean Cluster, which have emerged as critical facilitators of blue economy development. It’s time for the U.S. to catch up with our Arctic friends in Iceland and Norway who have long brought together public, private, and academic stakeholders to create sustainable value in the maritime industry through existing and novel opportunities. Clusters offer members physical workspaces—often including some sort of project incubation space—as well as networking, funding and investment opportunities. By boosting our existing clusters and creating new ones where they don’t exist, we are paving the way for some of Alaska’s most innovative minds to further advance Alaska’s blue economy—a significant and direct investment in our state,” said Senator Murkowski.“From protecting orcas from vessel noise, to transitioning to a carbon free future for our ports and maritime industry, Washington’s ocean cluster, called Maritime Blue, is working hard to solve complex challenges facing our economy. This bill would build on their success by creating a new grant program to fund ocean innovation clusters and grow Washington’s 30 billion dollar maritime economy,” said Senator Cantwell.Specifically, the Ocean ROI Act of 2021 would require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the administrator of the U.S. Economic Development Agency, and in consultation with the administrator of NOAA, to designate at least one ocean cluster in each of the five domestic NOAA Fisheries regions and the Great Lakes region. This would ensure that at least one cluster is designated in Alaska. The bill would also create grants for cluster operation and administration and one-time capital investments for physical infrastructure.“We are grateful Senator Murkowski recognizes ocean clusters as a framework to advance innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development. Her leadership is invaluable as we seek to tackle local, national, and global maritime issues,” said Garrett Evridge, Managing Director of the Alaska Ocean Cluster. “The timing couldn't be better to formalize a national cluster network. This legislation will help us respond to challenges while advancing a modern and resilient ocean sector.”“The Alaska Ocean Cluster has been an incredible resource as we've aligned our technology with customer needs in the state. There is a huge opportunity for ocean clusters to help accelerate startups focused on maritime solutions,” said Kortney Opshaug, CEO and founder of Blue Ocean Gear.  “Our ability to provide value and solutions to communities and companies in the Arctic has been strengthened by the advice, coaching, and connections offered by the Alaska Ocean Cluster,” said Leslie Canavera, CEO and co-founder of PolArctic, “Expansion of ocean innovation clusters nationally will facilitate coordination among companies, tribes, municipalities and other stakeholders to realize the potential of the blue economy.”Background: On June 8, 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released the first official Marine Economy Satellite Account statistics, which demonstrated that the ocean economy accounted for 1.9 percent, or $397 billion, of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2019. BEA also found that the growth of the ocean economy outpaced that of the economy as a whole in 2019. Under the current growth rate, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development projected that the global ocean economy would double its 2010 contribution to world gross value added by 2030, from $1.5 to $3 trillion.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-sullivan-speak-in-memory-of-congressman-don-young-,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, spoke on the Senate floor last night to honor the life and legacy of the Congressman for All Alaska, Don Young, who passed away last Friday, on March 18, 2022.Click here for video of Senator Murkowski’s speech.Click here for video of Senator Sullivan’s speech.  “It has been a tough few days for our office. Our hearts are still heavy, but the sheer outpouring of love and support for our boss, Congressman Don Young, has meant the world to us. As a boss, he was unlike any other. Congressman Young wasn't just an unrelenting advocate for Alaska, but also the biggest supporter of his staff in both Alaska and D.C. The relationship between a Member of Congress and their staff is vital for the people they serve. With Congressman Young, there was never a question of whether or not he had our backs. He saw talent within each of us and built a second-to-none team to serve his constituents. Congressman Young empowered his staff every day to get the job done on behalf of Alaskans. For 49 years, Congressman Young stood strong for the 49th State, and across this incredible career, his staff became a family. We are especially grateful to Senators Murkowski and Sullivan for honoring Congressman Young and his tremendous record of accomplishments on the Senate Floor. Current and former Alaska Delegation staff have stood by us in this difficult moment, and we could not be more thankful. Like so many others whose lives he touched, we loved our boss. There will never be another Don Young. We take comfort in knowing that his legacy will inspire future generations of public servants to stand up for Alaska just as passionately as he did,” said Congressman Young's former staffers, now operating as the Office of Alaska At-Large.“For those who didn’t have the privilege of knowing Congressman Young, as so many Alaskans did, he was all of the things that have been written and said about him these past several days. He was all of that—and more. He was larger than life, as colorful as they come. He was tough, gruff, and very feisty. But he was also warm and engaging. He was charming. But most of all, he was passionate; he was a passionate man about Alaska, and Alaskans, to his very core. And he was loyal and devoted—to his family, friends, and staff who served him. And he was loyal to the state and the people he loved so dearly,” said Senator Murkowski. “Being a Congressman for Alaska requires every last bit of you. It requires tremendous sacrifice, from you and your family. If you doubt that, just ask Anne Walton Young. Since they married in 2015, she has been by his side literally every day—in the office and traveling. She knows the work ethic of this man and the heart of this man and how hard he worked for all Alaska. From his first day through his last, Don Young gave it his all. And, as a true man of the people, he was the perfect Alaskan to serve in the people’s chamber.”“Don Young has been great friends with presidents and world leaders, but what really motivated and moved him was helping people, especially Alaskans. It didn’t matter their title, their political affiliation—he just wanted to help people,” said Senator Sullivan. “When we lost Don Young, we lost a piece of Alaska, a piece of ourselves, a piece of his indomitable, irascible spirit. But his spirit will live on in everything that he has done for our state and every Alaskan, from the trans-Alaska pipeline to the Ketchikan Shipyard, to the many land exchanges, to the health clinics dotting our state, to the state-of-the-art Alaska Native medical center, and in his wonderful family.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-examines-solutions-to-support-affordable-high-quality-childcare,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) took part this week in a U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing to examine barriers to access to childcare and to discuss solutions.During the hearing, Senator Murkowski pointed out, “It’s pretty clear out there that our childcare providers in this country, certainly in my state, can barely make ends meet.  Providers are competing with other employers for workers. Far too many parents cannot afford high-quality childcare even if they can find it… So I appreciate that we are looking for ways to provide more support.” Senator Murkowski also observed that while there was broad consensus about the problems and the need for sustained, increased investment in childcare, “It’s not always about the money,” and legislative solutions must be flexible to meet the varied needs in Alaska and across the country. “What is it that we have to do in order to make sure that we have quality providers and that our families are able to afford care for their children? We have got to make it work here. I don’t want us to be in a situation where we were with No Child Left Behind, where the one-size-fits-all approach didn’t fit a rural state like Alaska and we had to work and fight for exemptions and waivers,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski.  Senator Murkowski’s comments during the HELP hearing, and her question to one of the witnesses, can be viewed here.After the hearing, Senator Murkowski stated, “There is a lot at stake when it comes to crafting solutions that support our childcare providers, raise wages for childcare workers, and help parents find and afford high-quality childcare. We need to acknowledge that any legislative solutions must be flexible to meet the different needs and circumstances across the states and among families. I will continue working together with my colleagues to find truly bipartisan solutions that will work for all types of providers, all kinds of families, in all parts of the country.”Background:The House and Senate Majority have included proposals for child care and universal preschool in the Build Back Better Act.  These provisions can be found here, at Subtitle D beginning on page 242.  Summaries can be found here and here. Senator Murkowski has co-sponsored S. 3899, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Reauthorization Act of 2022.

Women’s History Month also provides a continuing opportunity for us to recognize Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian women, the wealth of contributions they have made to the United States and to reflect on Native culture, traditions and experiences that have shaped history. For their impact through military or public service, advancements in the fields of business, education, arts, law, and sciences, or efforts made in protecting traditional ways of life, we honor Native women through the passage of this Senate resolution,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski. As we celebrate the historic Tribal provisions in the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, I’m proud to partner with Vice Chairman Murkowski on this important resolution during this year’s Women’s History month that honors the continuing impact Native women have on our shared American history,” said Chairman Schatz.In addition to Vice Chairman Murkowski and Chairman Schatz, the following 25 senators co-sponsored the resolution: Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Steve Daines (R-MT), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hoeven (R-ND), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Tina Smith (D-MN), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).Click here for full text of the resolution.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-shares-a-message-of-reflection-on-mlk-day,"In light of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) shared the following message:Click here for video.Click here for a high-res photo.“When we reflect on what matters to us as Americans—things like equality, freedom, justice—it’s hard to forget the remarkable leaders who fought to secure these rights in the ongoing quest toward a more perfect union.“Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s commitment to Civil Rights and leading with kindness changed the course of history. His mission and dream still serve as guiding light for our nation today.“We can all learn something from Dr. King. His resilience brought power to his cause. His dedication to the path of freedom—and avoidance of bitterness and hatred along the way. His dreaming, which inspired millions.“As I work alongside my colleagues in the Senate, I’m mindful of Dr. King’s quote: ‘We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.’ Despite our differences, building understanding and listening, with respect and being good and kind Americans to one another—is the strongest answer.“Together, let’s all use today as a day of service and reflection. Thank you, and be well.” 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-welcomes-usda-announcement-for-new-mariculture-facility-on-prince-of-wales-island,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today welcomed the announcement that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will award $500,000 to Southeast Conference to design a mariculture processing facility to be located on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska—home to one of the largest kelp farms in the United States.“Creating sustainable economies in rural and remote communities can be challenging, but this investment, in recognition of the promise that Alaska’s unique and growing mariculture industry holds, is important progress. This new facility will create jobs and support a growing industry in our state. While finfish and shellfish are two pillars of the seafood economy in Alaska, the commercial use of kelp and other seaweeds for food and other purposes is on the rise in many of our coastal communities. I commend USDA for giving Southeast Conference the opportunity to use their local knowledge to create a blueprint for a culturally and geographically appropriate facility,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’ve long said that those who work in the seafood and mariculture industries are truly the farmers of the sea and have been a strong advocate for Alaska’s Blue Economy with the administration. We appreciate this investment and look forward to seeing its positive impact on this rapidly growing industry.”Mariculture is the cultivation of kelp, oysters, and other marine organisms. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-mental-health-trust-land-exchange-near-completion-,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Congressman Don Young all R-Alaska, welcomed the finalization of approximately 45 miles of permanent access easements, which mark the completion of a long-running land exchange between the Alaska Mental Health Trust (AMHT) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). This final step follows more than twenty years of work, including significant leadership and support from the Alaska Congressional Delegation and the State of Alaska.  “While my 2017 legislation accelerated the Alaska Mental Health Trust land exchange, this has been a very long effort, requiring collaboration from stakeholders, the State of Alaska, and the federal government alike,” Senator Murkowski said.  “After the many years of work that have gone into completing this land exchange, this announcement is welcomed news. It will provide timber for harvest in Southeast, protect viewsheds and local trails in our communities, and raise revenue for mental health services across the state. Today, I join so many Alaskans in celebrating the land exchange crossing the finish line, and the many opportunities it will afford Alaskans for years to come.”“Alaska’s timber industry has been a consistent target of successive Democratic administrations in Washington,” Senator Sullivan said. “These easements will provide vital access for the Mental Health Trust to fully utilize lands exchanged under the 2017 Alaska Mental Health Land Exchange Act. This is finally some good news for the hard-working Alaskans of Southeast who rely on the timber economy, as well as for the vulnerable Alaskans across the state who utilize the critical services of the Alaska Mental Health Trust. I’m glad to see the completion of this exchange, which works to the benefit of the Mental Health Trust, the Forest Service, and, most importantly, Alaskans.”""This is a great day for Alaska! Our state is home to a rich timber industry, which has historically provided needed revenues and economic opportunity in Southeast Alaska. Over the years, however, onerous federal regulations have reduced available timber supply, decreasing revenues and directly impacting services Alaskans depend on, including access to mental health care,” Congressman Young said. “In Congress, I have worked hard to ensure the USFS is not harming the Alaska Mental Health Trust by locking up harvestable timber. In the 115th Congress, I introduced a legislative fix that was enacted as part of the 2017 Consolidated Appropriations package. I am proud of our 'small but mighty' Delegation for getting it across the finish line. The completion of this land exchange is a true cause for celebration, and I am grateful for the hard work of Senators Murkowski and Sullivan, countless local leaders, and federal partners who worked with us in good faith. It is my great hope that through this newly available acreage, the Alaska Mental Health Trust can turn the tide in declining income and provide essential services to the Alaskans who need them most.""The easements exchanged today allow mutual use for AMHT and the USFS, while providing critical access to the new Trust lands and allowing continued public access to the USFS lands. The Trust will utilize its lands for timber sales, which provide revenue to the Trust to support its beneficiaries while providing crucial supply for Southeast Alaska’s remaining timber industry. With the contracts that are already in place, the Trust expects approximately 201 million board feet (MMBF) to be harvested from its newly acquired Trust lands.Additional Background: The land exchange process formally began in 2011. Murkowski authored the legislation providing for the land exchange, which was enacted into law in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017. Phase 1 of the land exchange, completed in February 2019, transferred approximately 2,400 acres of National Forest land at Naukati on Prince of Wales Island to AMHT in exchange for 2,585 acres of AMHT land near Ketchikan. This phase protected old growth stands, viewshed and trail lands near Ketchikan for timberlands. Through timber sales on those acquired timberlands the AMHT raises revenue for mental health services in the state.The balance of the exchange, Phase 2, was partially completed in April 2020 with conveyance of an additional 1,530 acres of USFS land to the AMHT in Naukati and an additional 3,020 acres (Parcel K-4 on Gravina Island) of AHMT land to the Forest Service near Ketchikan. The closing of Phase 2 took place in August 2021, marking the completion of the final acreage to be exchanged, with approximately 18,494 acres of national forest lands being conveyed to the AMHT and 17,980 acres of AMHT land being conveyed to the Forest Service.All of the lands for exchange were collaboratively selected through work by local stakeholders, the AMHT, and the USFS. ###510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/casey-tillis-smith-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-community-health-workforce,"As communities across the Nation tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tina Smith (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen the workforce of community health workers and address health disparities among underserved communities. Studies have demonstrated that community health workers can identify and address the specific health needs of their communities, promote healthy behavior and reduce hospitalization. The Building a Sustainable Workforce for Healthy Communities Act would reauthorize a competitive grant program to support state and local governments, tribal organizations and community-based organizations in expanding community health worker programs.“Investing in the health care workforce has never been so vital,” said Senator Casey. “The pandemic highlighted inequities in health care that long preceded it and exacerbated the public health and economic crises we are currently experiencing. Community health workers are uniquely suited to understanding the needs of a community and reducing health risks. By investing in our health care workforce, we can put the country on the road to economic recovery.”“With the current labor shortages facing our communities, we must continue to invest in the future of our health care workforce,” said Senator Tillis. “Our communities need more support, proper resources, and access to necessary health care. I am proud to introduce this commonsense legislation that will do just that, ensuring we are recruiting, training, and retaining qualified frontline health care professionals.”“Community health workers play a vital role promoting health in their communities,” said Senator Smith. “This bill will help empower community health workers to promote optimal health outcomes for populations in medically underserved communities, taking an important step forward in advancing health equity and closing health disparities.”“Community health workers serve an important role, particularly in areas with shortages of health providers. They are patient advocates—providing care, education, resources, follow-up, and so much more,” said Senator Murkowski. “As we continue to grapple with COVID-19 and health care provider shortages, this grant program would help communities ensure community health worker services are able to continue and expand.”Grant funding would be used to recruit and train community health workers who understand the needs of the community and support outreach to underserved communities and those requiring additional assistance during a public health emergency. These health care workers would promote positive health behaviors and improve access to services supporting physical and mental health, such as childcare, housing, education, nutrition and employment.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/vice-chairman-murkowski-underscores-need-to-increase-access-and-affordability-of-broadband-in-native-communities,"During a Senate Committee on Indian Affairs (SCIA) roundtable this week on “Closing the Digital Divide in Native Communities through Infrastructure Investment,” Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Vice Chairman of the SCIA, provided an opening statement and questioned panelists about the importance of closing the digital divide through implementation of appropriations, COVID-19 relief bills, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“Closing the digital divide in Native communities has seemed like an impossible task for many years, but Congress has finally stepped up through the passage of bipartisan legislation to provide long awaited investment in broadband infrastructure to Indian Country, Alaska Native villages, and Native Hawaiian communities. I am proud to have been involved with this legislative effort from the start,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski during her opening statement. “As a member of the G10 bipartisan working group and one of the lead negotiators and authors of the infrastructure legislation, a top priority of mine was to ensure Native people were not left out or left behind. I’m proud the infrastructure law includes support for Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and other Native communities, and tribal set-asides across the board. As the country invests in itself to stay competitive, we know Tribal nations and Native communities have a greater need for these investments in the first place.”Click here to watch the Vice Chairman’s opening statement.“We are at a pivotal moment with many opportunities to expand broadband into places that have been unserved or underserved. This includes rural Alaska and especially Native villages. Many of the challenges that face Indian Country are similar but perhaps more pronounced in Alaska. While Tribes, states, and ANCs prepare to access these new investments, Alaska faces unique obstacles to extending robust broadband infrastructure to every community,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski during the questioning period of the SCIA roundtable.Click here to watch the Senator’s questioning of the panelists.The roundtable panelists included:Click here to watch the entire roundtable.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-votes-to-sanction-nord-stream-2,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) yesterday voted in favor of S. 3436, the Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Implementation Act, which would impose sanctions with respect to entities responsible for the planning, construction, or operation of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. The vote, set at a threshold of 60 for passage, failed by a margin of 55-44.“Our partners in Europe need better options to meet their energy demand, but increasing their dependence on Russian gas is not one of them. Especially with Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border, with an invasion possible at any time, we cannot allow Russia to consolidate its control over Europe’s energy security and further weaken Ukraine’s status as a key transit state,” said Senator Murkowski. “The Biden administration’s decision to waive sanctions on Nord Stream 2 was a mistake that is allowing Russia to increase its malign influence in the region, including its ability to manipulate prices and supply. We need stronger action than we’ve seen from this White House, and this legislation is a way to require it.”Background:The Nord Stream 2 pipeline would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream system, which runs from Russia to Germany, and deliver an additional 55 billion cubic meters of gas each year. In 2020, Russia accounted for 48 percent of Europe’s natural gas imports.Last year, the Biden administration chose to waive sanctions on the company behind the project – Nord Stream 2 AG – despite a mandatory obligation to impose them. Senate Republicans and Democrats alike have strongly objected to the Biden administration’s failure to use their mandatory sanction authorities against the project, which is now nearly complete. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-welcomes-supreme-court-decision-blocking-bidens-vaccine-sweeping-mandate-for-businesses,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its vaccine and testing mandate for private companies with more than 100 employees. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) order for larger businesses to either require vaccines or have a masking and testing policy.“I join many Alaskans in welcoming the Supreme Court decision to uphold the stay on OSHA’s Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) today. From the start, I have questioned the constitutionality of the Biden administration’s mandate that employers with more than 100 employees require that their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to regular testing and mask wearing. Not only is it an overreach by the federal government, but Alaskan employers continue to tell me that the mandate would have tremendous negative impacts on our workforce and economy. In the midst of severe testing and workforce shortages and businesses struggling to stay open, Alaskan employers should not also have to deal with a federal mandate which could make the labor shortage even more acute. Nor should employees be forced to choose between a vaccine they don’t want, inaccessible and, time consuming testing, or losing their jobs,” said Senator Murkowski. “While I am fully vaccinated and encourage others to do the same, the federal government does not have the authority to mandate vaccinations through this ETS.  I’m glad that the Supreme Court recognized that the U.S. Senate spoke loud and clear on this and came to the same conclusion—that OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the mandate.”Background:  510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/delegation-welcomes-major-announcement-on-denali-park-road,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, issued the following statements after Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced that $25 million from the bipartisan infrastructure law is being made available to expedite a solution for Denali Park Road access.The investment is one of the first that the Department of the Interior (DOI) has made under the infrastructure law. It is both timely and critical for Alaska, as the Denali Park Road has continued to face deterioration, including landslides, bringing closures and halting travel.“Just weeks after our bipartisan infrastructure bill became law, it is already producing substantial benefits for Alaska. The Pretty Rocks Landslide at Polychrome Pass on the Denali Park Road has long been a slow-moving disaster, and this crucial funding will help ensure the road is once again safe for locals and visitors to traverse,” Senator Murkowski said. “As ranking member of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, I’ve made fixing this road a priority—pressing multiple administrations for both near-term improvements and a long-term, sustainable solution. That work dovetails with my efforts on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which we designed to help address needs across Alaska. I thank the Secretary for working with us to prioritize the Denali Park Road and look forward to further investments in our state under this landmark law.”“Denali National Park is considered by many to be the crown jewel of our national park system,” said Senator Sullivan. “Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock here each year to witness the park’s natural beauty and wildlife and to enjoy the endless outdoor recreational activities that Denali has to offer. These improvements are great news for the Denali Borough and Alaska’s tourism industry, enabling out-of-state visitors and our own residents to continue safely accessing this world-class park. I also pressed senior DOI officials to make sure that this $25 million in road construction goes to Alaska workers and contractors who know how to build our state better than anyone.”“Big investments are already on their way to the great State of Alaska! The soaring peaks of Denali are some of our state's most iconic natural features. Each year, Denali National Park welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the world, and it is vital that this treasured attraction remains accessible for years to come,” said Congressman Young. “Last night, I received a personal phone call from Interior Secretary Haaland informing me that $25 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be made available to address the Petty Rocks landslide. Over the past few years, the landslide has severely degraded Denali's road system, putting public access in severe jeopardy. This crucial funding will go a long way toward restoring the road and enhancing its resiliency for the future. The Alaska Delegation was united in our fight to ensure the infrastructure law would provide historic support for our state. This funding is just the tip of the iceberg in what will prove to be game-changing infrastructure investments in Alaska. I am grateful to the Administration, the National Park Service, and the countless Alaskan advocates who helped make this grant a reality. I want to remind the rest of our great nation that Denali is open for visitors in 2022, and we hope you will consider experiencing our great outdoors and everything Alaska has to offer.”Background: Secretary Haaland announced today that the Department of the Interior (DOI) will allocate $25 million from the Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) to accelerate work at Denali, allowing the National Park Service to move Phase 1 of the project forward in Fiscal Year 2022. The FLTP received funding through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides historic investments into roads, bridges, ports, airports, broadband, ferries, water and wastewater, resilience, and energy projects—modernizing and upgrading the nation’s core infrastructure. Senator Murkowski was a lead author and negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, and garnered support by the entire Alaska Congressional Delegation. ###510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/senators-coons-murkowski-reintroduce-legislation-to-support-spouses-of-veterans-who-died-from-als,"U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), the co-chair of the Senate ALS Caucus, and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate ALS Caucus, re-introduced the Justice for ALS Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure the surviving spouses of veterans receive the full benefits they are owed. Companion legislation was introduced in the House last October by U.S. Representatives Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.).According to the ALS Association, military veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS as those who haven’t served in the military. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides an additional monthly financial benefit to the surviving spouse and family of a deceased veteran who had a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. However, the average life expectancy for an individual diagnosed with ALS is just 2-5 years after diagnosis, resulting in many families whose spouses have not reached the eight-year threshold to allow them access to this benefit. The Justice for ALS Veterans Act would ensure surviving spouses of veterans who die from ALS receive these payments, regardless of how long a veteran had ALS prior to death.“ALS is a particularly cruel and brutal disease that takes the lives of thousands of Americans each year, including many veterans who have sacrificed so much for this nation,” said Senator Coons. “Denying the families of veterans who succumb to this disease because of a bureaucratic test shortly after the death of a parent, spouse, or other loved one is simply adding insult to injury. Our military families deserve so much better, and that’s why I’m working with Senator Murkowski to ensure families impacted by ALS have access to the benefits they rightfully deserve.”“Under current law, the spouses and families of veterans with ALS are denied full benefits if they didn’t survive at least eight years with the disease. This is tone-deaf and unreasonable considering the typical life expectancy for a person living with the disease is two to five years following diagnosis. Our current policies fail to acknowledge that the impact of ALS – losing a loved one to this cruel and unforgiving disease – will remain with their loved ones far beyond their passing,” said Senator Murkowski. “Regardless of how long the veteran lived with ALS prior to losing their battle, we have a responsibility to support our veterans and their families. I am proud to join Senator Coons in support of the ALS and military community through the reintroduction of this legislation.”“ALS is at least twice as likely to affect veterans as the civilian population. That means those who signed up to serve our country are at least twice as likely to face a relentless, currently 100% fatal disease in ALS. On top of that, their loved ones are being denied financial resources due to the rapid progression of this horrific disease,” said Dr. Megan Miller, I AM ALS Director of Research and Policy. “The Justice for ALS Veterans Act will ensure all survivors of veterans who died of ALS receive the financial support they are due. We applaud Senators Coons and Murkowski for their continued dedication to the ALS and veteran communities, and wholeheartedly support this effort.”“The ALS Association supports increasing compensation for surviving spouses of veterans who die from ALS, regardless of how long they lived with the disease,” said Neil Thakur, Chief Mission Officer of the ALS Association. “ALS not only impacts the person with the disease, but their entire family, and causes great financial stress. This bill can help ease the burden for surviving spouses. We thank Senators Coons and Murkowski for introducing this important legislation which Congress should pass immediately.”“Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an aggressive disease that leaves many veterans totally incapacitated, is recognized by the VA as a presumptive service-connected disease and, due to its progressive nature, automatically rates any diagnosed veteran at 100% once it is determined to be service connected,” said Jim Marszalek, DAV National Service Director. “Individuals diagnosed with ALS have an average lifespan of 2-5 years. Sadly, many veterans are unable to meet DIC’s 8-year requirement for the additional amounts payable to survivors. The Justice for ALS Veterans Act would allow survivors of veterans who pass away due to service-connected ALS to receive that additional monthly compensation, regardless of the length of time it was service-connected. DAV applauds Senator Coons and Senator Murkowski in their efforts in providing justice for ALS veterans and their families.”""Survivors should not be denied a benefit others receive simply because the service-connected disease their veterans acquired made it nearly impossible for them to meet an eight-year life expectancy requirement,” said Heather Ansley, Director of Government Relations at Paralyzed Veterans of America. “We thank Senators Coons and Murkowski for introducing this important legislation and urge the Senate to pass it quickly.”ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that destroys the body’s ability to control muscle movement. There is currently no known cause and no cure. Senators Coons and Murkowski were the lead Senate sponsors of the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act, which was signed into law by President Biden in December after receiving unanimous support in the Senate.### 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/no-action-administration-targets-npr-a-for-latest-restrictions-on-alaska-resource-development,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, issued the following statements after the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signaled that it plans to close millions of additional acres in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to responsible resource development.“With zero analysis or consultation with Alaskans, the Biden administration has decided to upend the NPR-A’s current management plan to return to an outdated policy that is worse for our state’s economy, worse for our nation’s energy security, and contrary to federal law,” Senator Murkowski said. “BLM claims a need for greater ‘balance’ in managing this area, but fails to realize that balance is what will be lost through this move. This is a petroleum reserve, specifically designated for energy development, located within a state that already has tens of millions of acres of parks, refuges, and federal wilderness. The current management plan was carefully crafted to protect the reserve’s most sensitive areas and includes numerous safeguards for responsible development. Sweeping restrictions like this – which are being imposed even as the Biden administration implores OPEC+ to produce more oil – demonstrate everything that is wrong with its energy policies.”“There they go again. Yesterday it was 20 executive actions from the Biden administration targeting our state’s economic opportunities and future, today it’s 21. No state in the country has been singled out like Alaska with such a destructive war on our working families, which hits our Alaska Native communities particularly hard,” said Senator Sullivan. “Moving to revert back to the 2013 Obama administration version, which removes roughly fifty percent of the NPRA from oil and gas development, will hurt Alaska’s economic future, our nation’s security, and likely violates federal law. Reverting back to the 2013 management plan is not only arbitrary and contrary to good science, it will be harmful to the very people and issues the Biden administration purports to care most about—indigenous communities, and racial and environmental equity. Instead, the Biden White House is taking its orders from radical extreme environmental groups who care nothing about Alaskans. I will continue to fight this war on Alaska’s workers and economy with everything I’ve got.”“For years, the NPR-A has been crucial to providing affordable energy to families across our country. This move by the Biden Administration is not only insulting to the hardworking men and women on the North Slope, but also extremely foolish. Gas prices around the nation are soaring; why then would President Biden and the BLM want to kneecap our domestic production, thereby emboldening our oil-producing adversaries overseas? This decision is yet another insult among a series of anti-Alaska actions taken by this Administration. By reverting to the 2013 IAP, BLM is attempting to shut down almost 50% of the NPR-A – that's over 11 million acres. To put this in perspective, the President’s home state of Delaware could fit in this part of the NPR-A about seven times over. No state should be subject to such a heavy-handed decision, and certainly not Alaska. Our state has proven that conservation and energy development can go hand in hand. Despite this, the Administration continues working to stifle American energy production and economic opportunity in Alaska,” said Congressman Young. “This reversion, championed by bureaucrats thousands of miles away from the NPR-A, is dead wrong. I condemn it and call on President Biden to end his Administration's attacks on Alaska's economy and way of life.”The Biden administration announced yesterday that it plans to use Alternative A – the “No Action Alternative” from the NPR-A’s 2020 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) as its preferred alternative to manage the reserve. This would close approximately half of the surface acreage of the reserve, which is roughly the size of Indiana, to energy leasing.The Alaska delegation strongly supported the previous administration’s decision to re-evaluate and revise the NPR-A’s IAP. That process, which concluded in early 2021, resulted in a management plan that BLM itself described as including “important safeguards for wildlife and sensitive resources, while allowing for responsible oil and gas leasing across 18.6 million acres of the NPR-A. These safeguards include no surface occupancy, controlled surface use, timing limitations and provide for new and emerging technologies to access subsurface resources while maintaining important surface values.” The preferred alternative selected under the early 2021 IAP kept more than four million acres of the NPR-A closed to leasing and represented a suitable balance for managing the reserve.BLM administers the NPR-A under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act and other federal laws. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the 23 million-acre region on the western North Slope – roughly the size of the state of Indiana – contains 8.7 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-commends-16-million-investment-for-food-security-in-alaska,"Today, U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced $1.6 million in Micro-Grants for Food Security Program (MGFSP) contracts were delivered to 366 individuals and non-profits within Alaska. These contracts will fund 234 projects that will help Alaskans grow more local, nutritious food in communities throughout the state.Murkowski created MGFSP via the 2018 Farm Bill to help increase food security in the non-contiguous states and territories. Due to her work as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Congress funded MGFSP in Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021 and the program is slated to receive an increase in funding in FY22. As a result, Alaskans, Hawaiians, and citizens of the U.S. Territories may apply to their respective state agriculture agencies for grant funding to “increase the quantity and quality of locally-grown food in food insecure communities through small-scale, agricultural-related projects.” “I developed this program because Alaska imports about 95 percent of the food we eat, and far too many Alaskans lack access to affordable, nutritious food. By increasing opportunities to grow, store, and process our own food, we are not only combatting the issue of food insecurity, but helping Alaskans find the stability and confidence they need to continue to call our state home,” said Senator Murkowski. “I am grateful to Alaska Division of Agriculture Director David Schade and his staff for their efforts to ensure the success of the Micro-Grants program in this first year of its implementation. The number of Alaskans who applied for these programs—particularly during the first year they were available—is incredibly significant. To know that over $1.6 million will be distributed to support Alaska’s food security is wonderful news. I look forward to the positive impact these grants will have in communities across our state, and I remain committed to ensuring continued federal funding for the Micro-Grants program in the years ahead.”Additional background on MGFSP:Individuals, Indian tribes and tribal organizations, non-profit organizations, federally-funded educational facilities, and local and tribal governments that may not levy local taxes are eligible to apply for MGFSP grant funds. Individuals are eligible to receive up to $5,000 per year; other eligible entities may receive up to $10,000 per year.  MGFSP funds may be used to purchase items necessary to grow and store food; expanding areas under cultivation; hydroponic and aeroponic farming; building, buying, erecting or repairing fencing for livestock, poultry, and reindeer; purchasing and equipping a slaughter and processing facility; traveling to participate in agricultural education; creating or expanding avenues for the sale of local food; and engaging in other activities related to increasing food security (including subsistence).The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved its Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Murkowski worked in include $6 million for the Micro-Grants for Food Security program. This represents a $1 million increase over Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021.  The agricultural agencies in Alaska and Hawaii are guaranteed to receive 40 percent of the available funds. Earlier this year, Senator Murkowski penned an opinion piece with Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) to highlight the realities of food insecurity, share additional details of the MGFSP, and encourage those who are eligible to apply.Information for the next opportunity to apply for the MGFSP will be published on the Division of Agriculture’s Grants web page: http://dnr.alaska.gov/ag/ag_grants.htm510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-statement-on-the-january-6-anniversary-,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) issued the following statement on the one-year anniversary of the attack at the United States Capitol:“Today marks one year since the U.S. Capitol was stormed by a mob incited by our former president. Those of us who were there to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities can never erase what we saw and heard, nor will we ever forget the desecration and violence that took place.“A year later, the sadness and anger of knowing that it was Americans who breached the center of our democracy, to thwart certification of a lawful election, remains with me. There is not a day that goes by that I am not thankful to our Capitol Police officers, who attempted to hold the line on that awful day to protect Congress and those of us who serve as part of it. I mourn for the individuals we lost and for those who continue to stand watch with injuries, both visible and invisible. My heart is also heavy knowing that American institutions and ideals remain tarnished by this terrible event.“We cannot ignore the riots of January 6th nor what led up to the insurrection at our Capitol. We must understand so that it is never repeated. Our nation – and especially those who would lead it – must also focus on healing our divisions instead of deepening them. That is the only way we will remain a country committed to civil discourse, the right to peaceably assemble, and, so importantly, the peaceful transition of power.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-announces-disbursement-of-cares-act-funding-to-alaskas-fisheries,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today announced that $50 million in fishery assistance, secured through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and. Economic Security (CARES) Act, will be disbursed this week to Alaska’s commercial harvesters, sport fishing charters, and seafood processors. This funding comes as a result of the efforts of Senator Murkowski to make direct assistance available to subsistence, commercial, and charter fishery participants, processors, fishery-related businesses and fishery-dependent communities that have been negatively affected by the economic and other impacts of COVID-19.“Alaska’s fisheries and seafood sector are a critical driver of our State’s economy, employing more than 58,000 people and producing billions of dollars in economic output in our state each year. Unfortunately, I continue to hear from Alaska’s seafood industry about the numerous ongoing challenges they are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As I worked to help craft the CARES Act, I was adamant that robust funding was included for those who bring Alaskan halibut, salmon, and countless other seafood products to market. I recognize that the time between allocation and distribution has been frustrating and long, but I’m encouraged to know that those checks are officially hitting the mailboxes of hardworking Alaskans. The positive impacts this funding will have will be felt not only here at home, but across the nation as it boosts our economy and allows Alaska’s world class seafood to continue to be enjoyed around the globe,” said Senator Murkowski.“This CARES Act funding is serving as a vital source of support for fishermen.  We appreciate that Congress recognized the need to support those in our seafood supply chain that are experiencing losses, through this and other support programs,” said Chris Barrows, President of Pacific Seafood Processors Association.“Alaskans from all fishing sectors owe a debt of gratitude to Lisa and Dan for directing so much relief to businesses based in our state. Many charter operators and guides were devastated by the loss of business due to COVID, and these funds are a welcome relief,” said Ben Mohr, executive director of the Kenai River Sportfishing Association.“UFA is glad to hear that the initial $50 million of AK CARES Act Fisheries Relief funding is finally being distributed to Alaskans.  We thank the Alaska Congressional Delegation for all the work that they did to secure this funding and applaud the delegation’s quick response to the economic harm caused by the pandemic, beginning back in 2020.  The lengthy wait for the distribution of these funds, at a time when fishermen needed assistance the most, highlights the need for improvement of the distribution process for disaster relief funds for the fishing industry,” said Tracy Welch, Executive Director of United Fishermen of Alaska.Background:In May of 2020, as the pandemic was shutting down the U.S. economy, Senator Murkowski was able to help secure $300 million for fisheries assistance in the CARES Act, of which Alaska received $50 million. Congress approved a new authority through the CARES Act for the Secretary of Commerce to provide direct assistance to fishermen to address losses related to COVID. The State of Alaska worked with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PAC States) and National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to create a spend plan for the first and second rounds of funding. The Commission is currently drafting applications for round two, which are anticipated to be available in mid to late January of 2022. In order to apply for Round 2 funds, applicants will need to know their Round 1 relief amounts. Additional guidance will become available once applications have been finalized and approved by ADF&G staff.For more information, please contact the ADF&G. or monitor the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission’s website.   510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/king-cove-murkowski-mark-eight-years-and-157-medevacs_since-rejection-of-life-saving-road,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) today issued the following statement on the eight-year anniversary of the Department of the Interior’s rejection of a short, one-lane, gravel, life-saving road needed to connect King Cove, Alaska to the all-weather airport in nearby Cold Bay. The single-lane road is crucial to providing reliable emergency medical access for all who live in King Cove.Two days before Christmas in 2013, former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced she would not allow the simple road – approved by Congress on a bipartisan basis, but conditioned on a public interest determination – to be built to connect two existing roads on either side of the 315,000-acre Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. Since then, King Cove has been forced to endure an additional 157 medevacs. Most occurred in dangerous weather conditions and many had to be carried out by the U.S. Coast Guard, risking the lives of crews and patients alike. “Sally Jewell made a horrible decision eight years ago, and it is the good people of King Cove who have paid the price ever since. A single medevac is too many, let alone 157. It is simply unconscionable that the federal government has failed to protect these Alaskans’ health and safety, especially in the midst of a global pandemic that has made emergency medical access all the more critical,” Murkowski said.Murkowski reiterated her request to current Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland – who has prioritized tribal consultation – to visit King Cove and finally address this decades-long environmental injustice.“I am calling on Secretary Haaland to visit King Cove to see the need to protect local residents’ health and safety as soon as possible. The federal government has a trust responsibility to the Tribes of King Cove, but it has been broken for decades. I also urge her to consider alternatives that could help us construct this road in an environmentally sound manner sooner than litigation will allow. As governments, Tribes must deliver a wide range of critical services, including healthcare, to their citizens. The Secretary must recognize this and act now, because King Cove needs this life-saving road more than ever,” Murkowski said.Numerous King Cove officials today expressed hope that Secretary Haaland would uphold the federal government’s trust responsibility and help them. The officials held a teleconference with Haaland in August and have asked her to visit their community to better understand the need for a life-saving road.“Secretary Haaland understands our deep-rooted connection to our ancestral land where we and our Aleut families have lived for thousands of years,” said King Cove (Native) Corporation Spokeswoman Della Trumble. “She recognizes the trust responsibility the federal government has to Native people.”“We’re hopeful U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland will visit King Cove soon to talk with residents and see first-hand the daily challenges we face,” said King Cove Mayor Warren Wilson. “Many people in King Cove have either been medevaced themselves or have family members who experienced dangerous medevacs during harsh weather.”“We know that Secretary Haaland understands we love our families, and we want them to be out of harm’s way,” said Agdaagux Tribal President Etta Kuzakin Kuzakin. “We also love King Cove, which is our home.”Kuzakin was medevaced from King Cove by the Coast Guard in 2013 in stormy weather while in premature labor with her youngest daughter, Sunnie Rae. The mother and daughter would not have survived without the Coast Guard rescue, which only occurred because the Guard was nearby on another mission.“We’re hopeful the Secretary will support us,” said Aleutians East Borough Mayor Alvin Osterback. “This issue is an injustice the federal government needs to correct so King Cove residents can feel safe when they require access to a higher level of care.”Background:King Cove is located between two volcanic mountains near the end of the Alaska Peninsula, about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. The small gravel airstrip in King Cove is typically closed by bad weather for more than 100 days each year. Nearly 40 percent of the flights not canceled are impacted or delayed by wind, turbulence, fog, rain, or snow squalls. By comparison, the all-weather airport in Cold Bay, which is less than 30 miles away from King Cove, is home to the fifth-longest runway in the state and closed an average of 10 days per year.Notable:In 2018, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke signed a land exchange agreement to facilitate the construction of the life-saving road. It continues to be held up by litigation from environmental groups.In 2016, Murkowski chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to press for the life-saving road, receiving compelling testimony from local residents and a retired Coast Guard commander who located a plane crash near King Cove that had resulted in multiple fatalities.In 2015, National Review published a longform article about King Cove entitled “Deadly Environmentalism,” which provides a comprehensive history of the issue and is well worth reading.In 2009, Murkowski secured passage of legislation facilitating a land exchange to provide for the life-saving road, but former Secretary Jewell stunningly determined that it was not in the public interest. Eight years later, 157 medevacs continue to show just how awful that decision was.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/alaska-delegation-welcomes-additional-h-2b-visas,"U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, welcomed an announcement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) that a joint temporary final rule will soon be implemented to ensure an additional 20,000 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas will be made available nationwide for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.“This announcement recognizes the significance of H-2B visas for Alaska and is vitally important for our state’s seafood industry. Despite their dogged efforts to find local seasonal workers – which must always be the preference – Alaska employers, particularly in seafood processing, often struggle to find enough workers to keep their operations running. These additional visas, which will be issued in the first half of the Fiscal Year for the first time ever, will help our seafood industry ensure a robust labor pool as we head into the 2022 season,” said Senator Murkowski. “I made it a priority early on with this administration to elevate this issue—not only for a need to raise the cap, but for a long-term solution. I thank the administration for making this a priority and will push the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to issue needed visas in a timely manner.”""A perpetually challenging issue for our seafood industry is ensuring sufficient seafood workers so that when our great Alaska fishermen harvest their world-class product they can get it to market. I appreciate the focus on this issue, and the commitment to solutions for Alaskan fishermen who are going out to sea early in the new year and rely on this program,” said Senator Sullivan.“It is vital that our state’s ongoing economic recovery is not further threatened by labor shortages. Access to sufficient nonimmigrant seasonal H-2B visas is essential for Alaska’s seafood processing industry. Filling these jobs with Alaskans continues to be my goal, but a lack of workers would have catastrophic impacts for fishermen, processors, and the fishing communities that rely on this sector being strong. The Alaskan seafood industry is a critical piece of our nation’s food supply and security. Over the last few months, I have been working on a solution to the seafood processing labor shortage, including working closely with Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas to find a fix for this critical sector,” said Congressman Young. “Today, I am very pleased to share that DHS is making thousands more H-2B visas available, which will greatly benefit Alaska’s economy and employers in the coming year. This is a tremendous victory for our state, and our Delegation’s united front has once again produced an important win for Alaska. Our work will continue as we look to find a long-term solution for labor needs in the seafood processing sector. I want to sincerely thank Secretary Mayorkas for working with me and our Senators on behalf of our state’s businesses. As always, I will continue working with anyone, regardless of party, on policies that put Alaska first.” H-2B visas allow domestic employers to temporarily hire nonimmigrants to perform nonagricultural labor or services if American workers are not available, after completing a rigorous application and certification process. These visas are critical to the survival of seafood businesses, many of which are family-owned operations that go back multiple generations. The Alaska Delegation has been active on the H-2B issue, working hard each year to ensure that an adequate number of H-2B visas are made available, and that they are issued to Alaskan employers with sufficient advance for them to prepare for the season ahead. Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young have maintained direct contact with DHS Secretary Mayorkas, working collaboratively to find a solution.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/sullivan-and-murkowski-introduce-alaska-salmon-research-task-force-act,"U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) introduced the Alaska Salmon Research Task Force Act, legislation that would form a panel of Alaska’s salmon stakeholders and research experts to study Pacific salmon trends and create a coordinated research strategy for Pacific salmon in Alaska to support salmon management. The Research Task Force would be directed to conduct a comprehensive review of Pacific salmon science relevant to understanding and managing salmon returns in Alaska, and publish a report, within one year of convening, to provide recommendations identifying knowledge and research gaps and further research priorities for salmon in Alaska.“It is difficult to overstate the importance of salmon to Alaska, our communities, our economy and our traditional way of life. Over the past several years, Alaskans in some parts of the state have witnessed strong, historic runs of salmon, while Alaskans in other regions have seen shocking and unprecedented declines,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Our existing management system, with the state’s authority to manage Alaska’s salmon harvest and the federal government managing federal fishery salmon harvest and much of the at-sea research, has created a clear gap in research and research prioritization that urgently needs to be addressed. This crisis warrants the combined attention of our state and federal governments, and the expertise of our greatest scientific minds, as well as the indigenous communities that have harvested salmon for millennia. With this legislation, we would establish a body to expand our understanding, identify knowledge gaps, and ultimately drive us toward concrete policies and management decisions that we hope will bring increased abundance and stability to our salmon stocks for the benefit of all Alaskans.”“It has been said that the summer season doesn’t arrive in Alaskan coastal and in-river communities until the salmon do. In some regions we are seeing not just a decline in salmon runs, but a crash that is damaging to not only the local economies but to the culture and spirit of the people in the region. It is clear we must further our understanding of salmon and their ecosystems in these times of rapid change. I am proud to join Senator Sullivan on the Alaska Salmon Research Taskforce Act as we seek to identify and bolster the necessary science to chart a path forward to ensure these critical species thrive,” said Sen. Murkowski. “I also continue to welcome feedback from affected community members and groups on how best to target research funding and craft policy to identify and mitigate the drivers of these declines and ensure the vitality of Alaska’s salmon fisheries for future generations.”The Research Task Force would be composed of between 13 and 19 members, with the secretary of commerce appointing a representative from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and the U.S. section of the Pacific Salmon Commission. The secretary would also appoint between two and five representatives from Alaska covering the wide array of state fisheries stakeholders, including subsistence, and commercial or recreational users. Lastly, the secretary would appoint five academic experts in salmon biology, management, and ecology, or marine research. The governor of Alaska would appoint one representative of the state.The bill also directs the Research Task Force to establish a working group specifically focused on salmon returns in the AYK region of Western and Interior Alaska, where salmon return failures have had devastating impacts, and provides flexibility for the Research Task Force to establish other geographically-focused working groups. # # #510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/act-for-als-act-unanimously-passes-senate-heads-to-president-biden-for-his-signature,"Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act, legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) and Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). The bipartisan, bicameral bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week. The ACT for ALS Act would fund essential research into fast-progressing rare neurodegenerative and terminal diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and early access to promising investigational therapies for patients suffering from them and would authorize $100 million annually to implement these priorities.ALS affects 1 in 300 people, often leaving patients with no more than three years to live following their diagnosis, and disproportionately impacts U.S. military service members. ACT for ALS authorizes new grants to support expanded access and research programs. This expansion will bring investigational treatments for rapidly progressing diseases beyond their ongoing clinical trials to patients with diseases for which effective therapies don’t already exist and allow for additional research into the effectiveness of those interventions. It also creates a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program to support other research and development on ALS and other life-threatening or severely debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.“Tonight, because of the tireless work of so many ALS advocates, the Senate unanimously passed the ACT for ALS Act and sent it to President Biden’s desk,” said Senator Coons. “Thanks to this legislation and the crucial research into ALS it will fund, countless Americans and their families who face down this cruel disease every day can go to sleep tonight with a renewed sense of hope. I am grateful to Senator Murkowski and Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry for their partnership on this landmark bill.”“This is all about hope. The ACT for ALS Act will make a meaningful difference for individuals and families across the country. Passage of this bill today is a hard-earned win for the ALS community and provides much-deserved hope to all who are affected by this disease,” said Senator Murkowski. “As someone whose family has been impacted by ALS, I know how terrible this disease is and how tirelessly the ALS community continues to fight for legislation to improve treatments and quality of life and search for a cure. This bill now heading to the President’s desk is huge step forward. It will offer new hope for those who are most in need, those who today—tragically—have very few options for treatment.”“I am thrilled that the Senate has passed ACT for ALS and officially cleared the way for this life-saving, transformative legislation to be signed into law. For too long, the diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease like ALS has been a death sentence that included the devastating hopelessness of no effective treatment options. ACT for ALS will finally help people living with this cruel disease access promising treatments and create the research infrastructure that could put a cure within reach,” said Representative Quigley. “I am deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of the Senate co-leads Senators Chris Coons and Lisa Murkowski and of my House co-lead Congressman Fortenberry. But, above all, I am grateful for the tireless advocacy of an entire community who has made the dream of this accomplishment a reality.”“In a true Christmas miracle, tonight the U.S. Senate gave real hope to those suffering from the cruel, merciless disease of ALS. For over 50 years and over 50 clinical trials, ALS patients have submitted themselves to tests and trials, therapies and placebos, in accordance with the rules of the current health care policy framework. But progress has been uneven, even debatable, with serious impediments to promising new treatments. Many ALS patients have sacrificed their lives to science, as they gradually weakened and died. Tonight, this Congress advanced a new way,” said Representative Fortenberry. “ACT for ALS represents a monumental shift for those suffering from ALS and other neurodegenerative conditions. The bill does two main things: it transforms the paradigm of disease research and regulation and creates a new pathway to promising new treatments. It drives the hope. With this transformative piece of public policy, we can break through faster for those who have suffered so much. I am deeply grateful to Representative Quigley and Senators Coons and Murkowski for their partnership on this groundbreaking legislation.”“For one hundred and sixty years, there has been no hope for those diagnosed with ALS. That changed tonight. Tonight, as a result of tens of thousands of ALS advocates working nonstop to make their voices heard and demanding the chance to live, hope has finally come to people living with ALS,” said Brian Wallach, co-founder of I AM ALS. “Thanks to the relentless work of Senators Coons and Murkowski as well as Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry, ACT for ALS has now passed both the House and the Senate and is on its way to President Biden. This moment was supposed to be impossible. The ALS community, however, refused to give up. So today, we celebrate the impossible becoming real and a new chapter for the fight against ALS.”“ACT for ALS will directly impact the lives of people with ALS by providing expanded access to investigational drugs and funding new research at FDA to find treatments and cures that are urgently needed. Thank you to people with ALS and their families, ALS advocates, and to Congress for passing this historic bill,” said Calaneet Balas, President and CEO, The ALS Association.“The Muscular Dystrophy Association is incredibly grateful for our champions, Senators Coons and Murkowski as well as Congressmen Quigley and Fortenberry, for every Senator who prioritized the ALS and rare neurodegenerative disease communities by passing the ACT for ALS tonight, and for all patient advocates who spent countless hours pushing for this bill,” said Paul Melmeyer, Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy at MDA. “With tonight’s vote, this legislation, which could substantially increase access to promising therapies and advance drug development in rare neurodegenerative diseases, needs only President Biden’s signature to make this a reality.”510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-congratulates-conocophillips-on-gmt2-production,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today applauded ConocoPhillips for achieving first oil production at its Greater Mooses Tooth #2 (GMT2) drill site, located in the northeast part of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). The project received final approval from federal officials in late 2018.“Congratulations to ConocoPhillips and their dedicated team for bringing more Alaska oil to market to help refill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and create hundreds of well-paying jobs in our state. I greatly appreciate their continued commitment to, and investment in, Alaska,” Senator Murkowski said. “GMT2 again shows that Alaska has plenty of resources to responsibly develop, for the good of our nation and the world, even as we adhere to stringent environmental and labor standards. All we need is federal permission, and an administration that prefers Alaska over OPEC+.”At peak production GMT2 is estimated to yield approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day. During the past three winter seasons, ConocoPhillips estimates the project created around 700 jobs, resulting in more than 600,000 direct construction manhours.Murkowski strongly supported approval of the GMT2 project beginning with ConocoPhillips’ application for permits to drill in 2015. She worked with former Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and former Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Joe Balash to move the project forward. More information about GMT2’s approval in 2018 is available here and here.  The NPR-A is administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management and covers more than 23 million acres on the western North Slope of Alaska—an area roughly the size of Indiana. The area is specifically designated for oil and gas development and production, which will hopefully soon include ConocoPhillips’ larger Willow project.510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-defense-authorization-bill-will-bolster_alaska-national-security,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted in favor of S. 1605, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22), helping it to pass the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 88-11.This year’s NDAA authorizes $768 billion for national defense, including $740 billion for the Department of Defense’s (DOD) annual budget to ensure the Pentagon can compete and thrive amid strategic competition. The bill prioritizes military members and their families, training and readiness, strengthening defense technology, addressing high rates of suicide among the military community, and more. As in previous years, Senator Murkowski was able to prioritize Arctic security provisions.“The NDAA is one of the most critical pieces of legislation that Congress passes each year, ensuring our troops have the training, equipment, and resources needed to carry out their missions. This year’s bill includes a well-deserved raise for our troops and prioritizes improving the lives of our servicemembers and their families. It will improve military healthcare, aid spouses’ access to meaningful employment, and provide much-needed reform for military justice.“We provide resources to maintain a strong and robust global presence—including for our force posture in the Indo-Pacific—improve and increase readiness, and bolster the capabilities of our allies, such as Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, to counter the growing aggression of Iran, Russia, and China.“I’m pleased this bill supports my efforts to build out America’s leadership as an Arctic nation. I thank Senator Sullivan and Congressman Young for their efforts to boost the defense budget and to help include provisions to create an Arctic Security Initiative, reduce suicides on rural, remote, and isolated installations, and authorize construction on a new National Guard Readiness Center,” said Senator Murkowski.Murkowski pointed out the many provisions that she and the Alaska congressional delegation added to the FY22 NDAA.“This bill specifically helps troops in Alaska. It directly addresses Alaska’s alarming suicide rate among servicemembers, authorizes funding for a new National Guard Readiness Center, and provides for upgraded cold weather clothing and equipment for our Arctic troops. In light of the recent announcement that Anchorage will be the home of the newly established Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, we are codifying important technical changes for the center – including its name, location, and establishment – into law.”Murkowski also spoke to the amendments she added to the bill, including several adopted during Senate floor debate.“I was able to secure amendments to help align America’s combat rescue aircraft acquisition strategy with our national defense strategy, taking into account the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions; ensure all veterans have access to their rightfully earned burial benefits in National Cemeteries; and create an emissions tracking pilot program at certain military installations.“The final NDAA also authorizes long overdue and well-deserved Congressional Gold Medals for all surviving WWII Merchant Marine veterans. And, to continue assisting our Afghan partners, we authorize DOD to transport Special Immigrant Visa holders and other threatened Afghan partners out of Afghanistan.”Summary of Alaska and Arctic ProvisionsSummary of National Provisions510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/klobuchar-murkowski-collins-sinema-legislation-to-honor-justices-ginsburg-and-oconnor-with-statues-in-the-capitol-passes-senate,"Legislation sponsored by U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, along with U.S. Senators Murkowski (R-AK), Collins (R-ME), and Sinema (D-AZ), to place statues of former Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor in the U.S. Capitol or on the U.S. Capitol grounds to honor their service and dedication to our country passed the Senate unanimously.“Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor were trailblazers long before reaching the Supreme Court, opening doors for women at a time when so many insisted on keeping them shut. The Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of Democracy, a place where people from across our country have their voices represented and heard. It is only fitting that we honor their remarkable lives and service to our country by creating statues in the Capitol,” Klobuchar said. “This legislation honors two women who have had a tremendous impact on our nation. Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in their own right each made a mark on American history. I am proud to ensure that their legacies live on by establishing monuments of these two matriarchs in our United States Capitol. From Justice O’Connor’s being the first female justice on the Supreme Court to Justice Ginsburg’s efforts on equal citizenship rights—their leadership has made a difference for women and families for generations to come. By passing this legislation, we honor the service of these two justices and give thanks to two women who transformed the legal profession,” Murkowski said.“Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg will always be known as dedicated public servants, fierce champions for equality, and accomplished Americans who broke countless barriers in the field of law. Statues in the nation’s capital honoring the first two women to serve on the highest court in the land will serve as fitting tributes to their invaluable contributions to our country,” Collins said.“Justice O’Connor and Justice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women in law and life. By permanently placing their statues in the U.S. Capitol, we’re honoring their legacy and reminding visitors to our nation’s Capitol that women can achieve their dreams with grit and determination,” Sinema said.Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Angus King (I-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Tina Smith (D-MN) cosponsored the legislation. Members of the House of Representatives, led by Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC) Co-Chairs Congresswomen Lois Frankel (D-FL), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), and Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Vice Chairs Congresswomen Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) and Bipartisan Women’s Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Madeleine Dean (D-PA) and Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR) have introduced companion legislation.In honor of Justice Ginsburg’s and O’Connor’s trailblazing legacies, the legislation also asks the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library to consider selecting an artist from underrepresented demographic groups to create the statues. 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-latest-numbers-show-dangers-of-reconciliation-spending-spree,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) today released the following statement after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released reports showing the harm being caused by the Biden administration’s energy and social spending policies. BLS reported that inflation is at a 39-year high, while CBO projected that the ‘Build Back Better’ agenda would add $3 trillion to the deficit over a single decade if made permanent.“These reports make it abundantly clear that President Biden is on the wrong track,” Murkowski said. “Instead of completely blowing the roof off of federal spending, the Biden administration should set aside this partisan social spending agenda and focus on allowing the energy industry to produce more here at home. That would help families and businesses by reducing inflation and bringing prices back to more reasonable levels. It’s time to stop pumping air into the balloon instead of seeing how much more it can take before it explodes.”BLS reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers increased by 0.8 percent in November 2021. The inflation index has risen by 6.8 percent over the past year – the largest annual increase since 1982 – and by an annualized rate of 8.9 percent over the past three months. Energy commodity prices have risen by 57.5 percent over the past 12 months, contributing significantly to economy-wide inflation, as the administration has refused to approve major projects and called for punitive policies that will further reduce domestic output.CBO reported that extending provisions within the Build Back Better Act – the partisan budget reconciliation package passed by the House and now pending in the Senate – would increase the deficit by $3.0 trillion over a decade if extended for that duration. Setting aside timing gimmicks within the current bill that hide its true costs, CBO found the package would cost a staggering $4.9 trillion over a 10-year period.   510 L Street

It also creates a new FDA Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program to support other research and development on ALS and other life-threatening or severely debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.“I’m excited to see our colleagues in the House pass this necessary legislation at the same time that we reach a critical milestone of support in the Senate,” said Senator Coons. “ACT for ALS will create critical new programs to improve coordination and collaboration on ALS, support additional research, and help more patients access promising investigational therapies.”“The bipartisan support from the majority of my colleagues in the Senate on the ACT for ALS is great news for the ALS community,” said Senator Murkowski. “This legislation will address barriers to treatments for those living with ALS and will accelerate research and development of therapies for ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases. As someone whose family has been impacted by this disease, I’m proud to see this bipartisan and bicameral legislation garner large support that will bring positive impacts for Americans living with ALS.”“ALS is a devastating disease and unfortunately right now, far too few patients are able to access treatments to slow its progression. This bipartisan bill would help address that problem by bolstering research and development of new treatments. Let’s get this passed so we can help those suffering from ALS and eventually find a cure,” said Senator Fischer. “With more investments in ALS therapies and research, we can make much needed progress in the fight against this disease,” said Senator Heinrich. “I’m proud to join Senator Coons and colleagues from both sides of the aisle to allocate the necessary funding for these services and provide adequate care for those affected by ALS.” 510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-votes-to-overturn-vaccine-mandate-for-private-businesses,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) this week voted to overturn President Biden’s vaccine and testing mandate for private employers. After cosponsoring S.J.Res. 29, a resolution of disapproval against the vaccine mandate, she helped the Senate pass it on a bipartisan vote of 52-48.“The Senate voted to overturn the President’s mandate and I hope the House will follow suit. I question the constitutionality of this mandate and believe it sets a dangerous precedent. It is within a private employer’s right to require their employees to be vaccinated or regularly tested, but it is an overreach for the federal government to force them to do so,” Senator Murkowski said. “I strongly support vaccinations and recognize they are safe, effective, and the best available option to limit the spread of the virus and the harm it causes. I continue to urge Alaskans to get vaccinated, but a personal health decision must be a personal choice. My conversations with employers and employees across Alaska—many of whom are also pro-vaccine—only reinforced my concerns about the negative impacts this mandate would have on them, their workforce, and Alaska’s economy.”The Congressional Review Act (CRA) establishes a process through which Congress can nullify rules from the executive branch by passing of a joint resolution of disapproval. If such a resolution is approved by a majority in both chambers of Congress and signed by the President, or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential veto, the rule in question is invalidated.S.J.Res.29 seeks to overturn the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS), which requires private-sector workers at companies with more than 100 employees to receive a vaccine or be frequently tested. Last month, Senator Murkowski joined Senator Mike Braun (R-IN), Ranking Member of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, and all of her Senate Republican colleagues in introducing the measure.This formal challenge to the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for private businesses will now be sent to the House of Representatives for further action.Background:OSHA has suspended enforcement of the ETS pending review by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals510 L Street

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/vice-chairman-murkowski-takes-action-to-address-violence-occurring-in-alaska-native-communities-,"This week, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs (SCIA) held an oversight hearing focused on “Restoring Justice: Addressing Violence in Native Communities through VAWA Title IX Special Jurisdiction.” Concurrent with the hearing, Vice Chairman Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Chairman Brian Schatz (D-HI) released a discussion draft of the tribal title for the upcoming Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization for public comment.During her opening remarks at this week’s hearing, Murkowski spoke about the importance of the tribal title in the 2013 VAWA and the jurisdictional challenges that Indian Tribes continue to experience in Alaska and across Indian Country. Federal and tribal witnesses, including Michelle Demmert of the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center, testified on the need for more resources and protections to reduce the incidence of violence, particularly against Native women.Pictured: Senator Lisa Murkowski at SCIA Oversight Hearing on December 8, 2021“While issues of tribal jurisdiction are confusing and esoteric, I want to emphasize that the impacts on the ground in Native communities, particularly in places like rural Alaska, are very real and very tragic. In 2019, we had the Attorney General come to a small Native village. He looked around, he talked to the people, he left and declared a law enforcement emergency. It was based on the fact that Alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in the country and we face a unique jurisdictional landscape. Jurisdictional complexity should not deny safety or justice, and that is what we are seeing,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski on the unique tribal jurisdiction in Alaska.“I believe we have a moral imperative here in Congress that we take action to further restore and improve the implementation of this special tribal criminal law jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit violent crimes in our Native communities. I firmly believe that by empowering tribal courts in this way we can help combat this major public safety issue affecting Native people and children,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski on improving and empowering tribal courts.“Most Native communities in rural Alaska have no local law enforcement physically present. One out of three Native communities in Alaska have no local law enforcement that is physically there,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski on the lack of law enforcement presence in rural Alaska and how a solution has been raised. “I am happy to report that we have an Alaska solution to this complex jurisdictional situation in our state. We are calling it the Alaska Public Safety Empowerment pilot project. We are rolling it out as part of the discussion draft text title for all to see. Give us your feedback on it. It builds on previous legislation that you have seen from me and the product of years of work with tribal advocates and smart lawyers. The pilot project will empower a limited number of Alaska Tribes to exercise special criminal jurisdiction over certain crimes that occur in villages in Alaska.”Click here to watch Vice Chairman Murkowski’s full opening statement.Senator Murkowski invited Michelle Demmert of the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center to testify at the hearing. During the question-and-answer period, Murkowski asked Ms. Demmert about the jurisdictional landscape in Alaska and how a state-specific pilot project will bring much needed support and protections for Alaska Natives. Pictured: Michelle Demmert virtually testifying before SCIA on December 8, 2021 Click here to watch Vice Chairman Murkowski’s exchange with Michelle Demmert.Click here to watch the SCIA oversight hearing and find witness testimony.Click here to view the tribal discussion draft.Public comments on the discussion draft of the VAWA tribal title are due by December 22, 2021.

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-schatz-work-to-improve-the-safety-of-native-american-women,"Today, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai’i), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs (SCIA), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Vice Chairman of the SCIA, released draft legislation of a tribal title aimed at improving the safety of Native women in Indian Country and Alaska Native Villages. This bipartisan discussion draft reflects tribal stakeholder input over years of Committee oversight and legislative activity on public safety in Indian Country and Alaska Native communities, including work of the Chairman and Vice Chairman’s offices to jointly examine and find solutions to address violence against Native people and restore justice to their communities. In 2013, the SCIA was instrumental in securing inclusion and enactment of the bipartisan tribal title that authorized the special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction in the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 (VAWA).“Nearly a decade ago, the Violence Against Women Act of 2013 restored Tribal jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes, recognizing Tribes’ right to exercise their authority and giving them resources to go after criminals,” said Chairman Schatz. “Since then, we’ve heard from Native communities on how we can strengthen VAWA to fully empower Tribal governments and protect Native people. Our bipartisan discussion draft gives Native communities more tools to fight domestic violence crimes and keep Native women, children and families safe. I am thankful for Vice Chairman Murkowski’s partnership in this important work.”“Native women are overrepresented by nearly 250 percent among domestic violence victims in Alaska, yet one in three communities in rural Alaska have no local law enforcement. Tribes in Alaska need to be empowered to exercise special tribal criminal jurisdiction on a pilot basis,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski. “We recognize and appreciate the jurisdictional complexities in Alaska and affirm the concurrent jurisdiction of the State of Alaska over these covered crimes. The release of the bipartisan discussion draft is an important step toward ending violence against Native women in Alaska and in Indian Country. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this critical effort as the legislative process advances.""

https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/11/29/2021/murkowski-slams-interior-oil-and-gas-report,"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) today released the following statement criticizing the Department of the Interior’s “Report on the Federal Oil and Gas Leasing Program,” which it issued the day after Thanksgiving after months of unexplained delay. The report, whose preparation was frequently used to justify the Biden administration’s illegal ban on oil and gas leasing, calls for higher royalties and other policy actions that would restrict access and make energy production less viable in federal areas.“This report is exactly what we thought it would be: a series of preordained conclusions that are designed to end federal oil and gas production. President Biden campaigned on that, and his administration is now advancing what amounts to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy to achieve it,” Murkowski said. “What is especially upsetting is that it took Interior 10 months to produce a document that is just 15 pages long, lacking any meaningful analysis, and that repeatedly misrepresents how development actually works. The policies it calls for won’t maximize returns for taxpayers or even reduce emissions—instead, they will hurt production in states like Alaska, further raise energy prices, and increase our nation’s import dependence. This won’t build back any barrels, but it is – yet again – music to OPEC+’s ears.”Federal oil and gas production has fallen as a percentage of the U.S. total in recent years, while production on state and private lands has grown dramatically. Making the federal program less attractive than it already is will not reverse that dynamic. Nor will higher royalties, higher rental rates, the elimination of royalty relief, making fewer acres available for lease, or similar policies do anything to increase domestic energy security or lower energy prices.     Murkowski today reiterated her call for congressional Democrats to drop the harmful resource provisions in their partisan budget reconciliation bill, which would codify several of the counterproductive actions called for by Interior while also going beyond them to target energy-producing states like Alaska. 510 L Street
