https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-demands-answers-on-partially-chinese-owned-lithium-mine-potentially-receiving-us-funding,"Washington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) sent a
letter today to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm requesting information about
the Department of Energy potentially funding a lithium mine by Lithium
Americas, a company partially owned by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The
letter addresses the significant risks to national security and our supply
chain that would arise if federal funding were to deepen Chinese control over
America’s critical minerals and urges Granholm to reject Lithium America’s funding
request if it refuses to separate from its Chinese owner.In part, the senator wrote:“The U.S. government should apply strict oversight regarding
potential federal funding of CCP-owned or -controlled entities. DOE’s loan for
the Thacker Pass mine would be substantial and reportedly cover the majority of
the project’s capital costs. It is critical that DOE ensure taxpayer funding
does not go to corporations with CCP ties and does not increase U.S. mineral
dependence on China.”Full text of the letter may be found below.  September
27, 2022 The Honorable Jennifer GranholmSecretaryDepartment of Energy1000 Independence Ave. SWWashington, D.C. 20585Dear Secretary Granholm,I write to you requesting information and raising concerns
regarding reports of the Department of Energy potentially funding a lithium
mine controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The Washington Free Beacon recently reported plans by Lithium Americas,
an ostensibly Canadian company, to build a mine at Thacker Pass in Humboldt
County, Nevada. Worryingly, media reports indicate that Lithium Americas’
largest shareholder is Ganfeng, a Chinese company with direct ties to the CCP.
Ganfeng is currently acquiring lithium mines around the world, which, according
to former Secretary Mike Pompeo, is part of a “clear intention by the Chinese
Communist Party to control the entire supply chain for green energy.” The
United States should be reducing its dependence on China for these critical
inputs, not opening the door for China to “gain a foothold in America on
lithium mining,” as reported.I am deeply concerned that, despite clear CCP influence over the
company, Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project is under consideration for a
loan through the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technologies Vehicles
Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program. Lithium Americas’ assurances that Thacker
Pass is 100%-owned by them rather than Ganfeng are insufficient to resolve
national security concerns, given the Party’s considerable stake in the
company.The U.S. government should apply strict oversight regarding
potential federal funding of CCP-owned or -controlled entities. DOE’s loan for
the Thacker Pass mine would be substantial and reportedly cover the majority of
the project’s capital costs. As the government continues to invest in battery
supply chain programs, it is critical that DOE ensure taxpayer funding does not
go to corporations with CCP ties and does not increase U.S. mineral dependence
on China.Your department has an opportunity to leverage this ATVM loan
application to incentivize Lithium Americas to part ways with Ganfeng. Ganfeng
and any other Chinese entities with CCP ties should divest their stakes in
Lithium Americas before the company is offered this loan. If Lithium Americas
refuses to part ways with Ganfeng, then I strongly urge you to reject their
application for the ATVM loan. The United States urgently needs domestic
critical mineral production to supply its technology sector and reduce its
dependence on China; the United States does not need and should not fund
possible attempts by the CCP to deepen its control over the U.S. critical
mineral supply chain.For the reasons highlighted above, I respectfully request answers
to the following questions:1.   
Is DOE aware of Lithium Americas’
application for the Advanced Technologies Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan
Program and the company’s partial ownership by entities closely tied the CCP?2.   
What safeguards or requirements are in
place to ensure the ATVM program is not funding other companies owned or
controlled by the CCP or other adversaries?3.   
Does DOE agree that the United States
must reduce its dependence on China for critical minerals like lithium and
should invest in domestic production of such minerals? If so, does DOE believe
that funding deeper CCP control of the U.S. critical mineral supply chain is
counterproductive to this goal? If not, why not?4.   
Has DOE raised with Lithium Americas
the possibility that its loan application for the Thacker Pass project may be
harmed by the company’s partial ownership by Ganfeng or that its application
may be improved if Ganfeng divested in the company?Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward
to receiving your response.Sincerely, _________________Tom CottonUnited States Senator ###

https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-unveils-bill-to-lower-college-tuition-cost-reform-student-loans,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEContact: Caroline Tabler or James Arnold (202) 224-2353September 20, 2022Washington, D.C. — Senator
Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) today introduced the Student Loan Reform Act of 2022, a
bill that will reduce the cost of tuition by holding colleges financially
responsible for the loans they encourage students to take.Specifically, the bill requires
that colleges become guarantors of up to 50 percent of future federal student
loans and fines colleges 25 percent of the value of future defaulted loans.
This will force colleges to have a financial stake in their student’s success,
strongly incentivizing them to offer reasonably priced and useful degree
programs.The bill will also force any
university charging over $20,000 a year for undergraduate tuition to gradually
eliminate 50 percent of their administrative staff to qualify for future
student loans. Bill text is here.“America does have a student loan
problem. But it’s not the problem Joe Biden wants you to believe it is. The
real issue with student debt today is that the cost of college tuition has
skyrocketed, yet the value of a college diploma has plummeted. What’s worse is
the federal government created this problem by writing blank checks to
colleges, with little effort to control the cost or quality of higher
education. My Student Loan Reform Act of 2022 would end this academic Gilded
Age, reduce the cost of tuition, and give colleges a much-needed reality check,”
wrote Cotton.A brief overview of the bill is
below.Background:·       The Federal student loan
program has incentivized colleges to raise tuition and students to take on
unsustainable amounts of debt.·       The higher education
bureaucracy has increased 616% from 1976 to 2018, compared to only a 78%
increase in student enrollment.·       Student loan debt has grown
to a staggering $1.7 trillion—putting an enormous risk on taxpayers – while
colleges have faced no consequences if their graduates fail to pay their loans.The bill would:·      
Require any university with undergraduate tuition fees above $20,000 to
gradually eliminate up to 50% of their administrative staff to be eligible for
future student loans, excluding religious colleges and medical colleges·      
Require the richest private colleges
to distribute at least five percent of their endowment to support their
educational mission per year, or else face a penalty·      
Penalize universities up to 25%
of a borrower’s loan for every one of their students who defaults on student
loans·      
Require universities to act as
loan guarantor for up to 50% of any future federal student loans·      
Place a luxury tax of 20% on
annual undergraduate tuition fees above $40,000 with the funds raised being
used for workforce training, excluding religious colleges and medical colleges·      
Eliminate Plus loans, except for
medical and dental students and parents of undergraduates, who would have loans
capped at a $10,000 loan per year ·      
Require universities to implement
admission and hiring policies that protect political and ideological diversity
on campus·      
Ban universities from soliciting
FASFA paperwork from families who choose not to use financial aid·      
Levy a one-percent tax on the
fair market value of endowments held by the richest private colleges. The tax
would apply to private colleges that 1) have more than 500 full-time enrolled
students, 2) have endowments worth more than $2.5 billion and $500,000 per
full-time enrolled student, 3) do not have a religious mission.  ###

Warns Apple Not To Do Business With Dangerous Chinese Chipmaker
Washington, D.C. — Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) sent a
letter today to Apple CEO Tim Cook warning him of the dangers that using chips from Yangtze Memory Technologies
Corporation (YMTC) in Apple products poses to U.S. national security, consumer data security, and to Apple’s reputation and
shareholders. The letter
requested answers on why Apple made this reckless decision and what steps Apple
planned to take to protect the United States and American consumers from the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP).In part, the senator wrote:“I urge you to rethink Apple’s decision to do business
with YMTC. If Apple continues to court untrustworthy Chinese companies like
YMTC, it will do grave harm to its shareholders, its customers, and our
country. As there is bipartisan support to address the threat posed by YMTC, I
must stress for you and your shareholders the risks of this partnership with an
entity that may soon be the target of U.S. government action.”Full letter of the text may be found here and below. September
15, 2022 Mr. Tim Cook
Chief Executive OfficerApple Inc.
One Apple Park WayCupertino, CA 95014Dear Mr. Cook,I write regarding Apple’s ill-advised plans to do business with a
dangerous Chinese chipmaker, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC). YMTC is a key player in the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP)
campaign to dominate the semiconductor industry. YMTC has seized market share
thanks to an estimated $24 billion in government subsidies. These subsidies
have allowed YMTC to poach engineers and sell its flash-memory products below
cost, to the detriment of firms in the United States and allied countries. YMTC
also collaborates with Chinese companies sanctioned by the U.S. government for
human rights abuses and collaboration with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
on military-modernization projects. As a result, members of Congress from both
parties have called on the Biden administration to add YMTC to the Entity List,
and the Commerce Department may blacklist the company.China has made great strides in strategic sectors like
semiconductors due to subsidies and outright theft, but so far, its national
champions lack legitimacy—and rightfully so. Your company’s decision may change
that.I urge you to rethink Apple’s decision to do business with YMTC.
Apple and far too many other American companies already rely on China for
manufacturing and supplies. Adding another Chinese company to Apple’s supply
chain, particularly one with close ties to the CCP and PLA, compounds these
risks. If Apple continues to court untrustworthy Chinese companies like YMTC,
it will do grave harm to its shareholders, its customers, and our country. As
there is bipartisan support to address the threat posed by YMTC, I must stress
for you and your shareholders the risks of this partnership with an entity that
may soon be the target of U.S. government action.With these concerns in mind, I request that you answer the
following questions:1.   
Can Apple confirm that their products
using YMTC chips will not be available for purchase in the U.S. market or
through any e-commerce platform available in the United States? If not, what
safeguards does Apple have in place to protect U.S. national security and
consumer data security from the CCP?2.   
Did Chinese authorities require Apple
to use YMTC’s chips as part of its new iPhone 14? If not, on what basis did
Apple make its decision to use YMTC chips, despite the threat posed by YMTC?3.   
How did YMTC’s ties to companies
sanctioned for human rights abuses factor into Apple’s decision? 4.   
Have members of Apple senior
leadership considered the risk resulting from Apple making itself reliant on an
entity that is likely the target of future U.S. government action? Sincerely, Tom CottonUnited States Senator  ###

Bill text is here. “For decades, the federal government has spent billions propping up bloated colleges that serve—often poorly—a minority of our citizens. Meanwhile, the majority of Americans, who don’t go to college, are left behind. In fact, the federal government spends eight times more on college for the few than it does on job training for the many. My bill will right that wrong by investing heavily in a new workforce education strategy to help working Americans get ahead,” said Cotton.“The often well-meaning but also self-serving embrace by elites of College-for-All has done untold damage to American workers and families.

29, 2022The Honorable Katherine TaiUnited States Trade Representative600 17th Street NWWashington, DC 20508Dear Ambassador Tai:We are writing to express our deep concern with your comments indicating
American cooperation in reassembling the WTO’s appellate body. As you may know,

policy. The variety of ways in which the Appellate Body has failed to live up
to its intended purpose was cataloged in a 2020 report by the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which demonstrated that the Appellate Body
has:·     
Repeatedly ignored the mandatory
deadline for deciding appeals, ·     
Allowed Appellate Body members whose
term has expired to continue deciding appeals, ·     
Made findings on issues of fact,
including issues relating to the domestic law of WTO Members, although Members
authorized it to only address legal issues, ·     
Insisted that dispute settlement
panels treat prior Appellate Body interpretations effectively as binding
precedent,·     
Failed to apply WTO agreements in a
manner that adheres to their text (as negotiated and agreed to by WTO Members),
while filling in perceived ""gaps"" in agreements to impose new
requirements on the United States to which we never agreed.In so doing, the Appellate Body has infringed on our sovereign
laws and strayed far from the limited role that WTO members assigned to it.The Appellate Body is not only harmful, it is also corrupted by CCP influence.  WTO rules require Appellate Body members to be
“unaffiliated with any government,” yet Chinese nationals are allowed to become
members. The Chinese Communist Party’s complete control of power in the PRC
means it can coerce and intimidate any PRC national into following its will.
Moreover, a recent Appellate Body member from the PRC appears to have had – and
concealed – an improper continued role working for the PRC government. PRC
nationals will be forced to do the bidding of the CCP if they want to, or not. The
CCP shouldn’t get a vote on the WTO Appellate Body when it is the primary
threat to free and fair trade around the world.
Even without the Appellate Body, the WTO’s dispute settlement process can
remain a useful resource for U.S. policymakers. 
WTO panel decisions can still be issued and may have persuasive effect
through their force of reasoning. To the extent such decisions can be effectively
blocked by appealing to an Appellate Body that no longer exists, this fact has
allowed WTO members to regain a measure of sovereignty. And, of course, to the
extent Members want to agree to truly binding dispute settlement, they have
numerous options to do so – including, for example, an agreement not to appeal
the results of a panel decision.
Restoring the Appellate Body would only do harm to the United States and give
international bureaucrats and members of the CCP more influence over U.S. trade
policy. We ask you to continue blocking the appointment of new Appellate Body
members.

That needs to stop,” said Lankford. “After years of work and conversations with law enforcement, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice, and Oklahoma prison leadership, we finally have a bill to allow states to jam illegal cell phones in their prisons to prevent prisoners from contacting their victims or coordinating even more crime while they are incarcerated. This bill simply allows state and federal prisons to use cell phone jammers to ensure they have the tools they need to combat illegal activity in a prison.”  ""In correctional facilities across our country, inmates are using contraband cell phones to conduct illegal activities, including running drug operations, facilitating sex trafficking, and organizing escapes,” said Kustoff.“These contraband cell phones are a major problem and Congress must take action to protect the public from dangerous criminals who continue their illegal activities behind bars. I am pleased to join Senators Cotton and Graham in reintroducing this important bill that will keep our communities in West Tennessee and the United States safe.""This legislation is supported by the Correctional Leaders Association, the Council of Prison Locals, the American Correctional Association, the National Sheriff’s Association, and the Major County Sheriffs of America.Background:The use of contraband cellphones is widespread in both federal and state prison facilities. Inmates have used contraband cellphones to conduct illegal activities, including ordering hits on individuals outside of the prison walls, running illegal drug operations, conducting illegal business deals, facilitating sex trafficking, and organizing escapes which endanger correctional employees, other inmates, and members of the public.In 2018, a gang fight over territory using cellphones to trade contraband sparked a brawl inside the Lee Correctional Institution near Bishopville, South Carolina, and left seven inmates dead and 20 injured.Bureau of Prisons Correctional officer Lt. Osvaldo Albarati was murdered in 2013 for interrupting an illicit contraband cellphone business. His actual assassination was initiated by an inmate using a contraband cellphone to contact the gunman as outlined in the indictment.A 2018 report showed an FCI Fort Dix inmate arranged murder and assault from a smuggled phone in a Jersey prison.Contraband cell phones aren't only allowing violent criminals to continue their nefarious activities. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Martin Shkreli, the disgraced pharmaceutical executive sentenced to seven years for securities fraud, was still making decisions at Phoenixus AG through the use of a contraband cellphone.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

BidenThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden,We urge you to deny visas for Iranian President Raisi and his delegation to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York City in September. Raisi’s involvement in mass murder and the Iranian regime’s campaign to assassinate U.S. officials on American soil make allowing Raisi and his henchmen to enter our country an inexcusable threat to national security.Raisi’s record as a violator of human rights is long-standing and clear. In 1988, while deputy prosecutor of Tehran, Raisi served on a Death Commission which sentenced approximately 5,000 prisoners to death, including women and children, without the right to appeal or a fair trial. Raisi is proud of his record; in 2018, he defended the commission, calling it “divine punishment” and “one of the proud achievements of the system.”  In the decades since, Raisi continued to subject the Iranian people to extrajudicial prosecution, torture, and execution, such as during the 2009 Green Revolution or in his more recent tenure as the head of Iran’s judiciary. Raisi’s role in these gross human rights abuses led the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to sanction him in 2019, pursuant to Executive Order 13876. While Raisi continues the regime’s wave of repression at home, agents of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, plot to assassinate current and former senior U.S. officials in the United States. In March, the Washington Examiner reported that the Department of Justice had indictable evidence that IRGC Quds Force operatives were planning to assassinate former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton. The IRGC has reportedly been plotting similar efforts against former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former CENTCOM Commander Kenneth McKenzie, and other former officials. According to news reports earlier this month, the IRGC is also targeting current U.S. officials as part of its assassination campaign. If recent reports are true that Raisi plans to attend the UN General Assembly, the White House must deny Raisi and other Iranian officials visas to attend. Allowing Raisi to travel to the United States—while his agents actively work to assassinate senior American officials on U.S. soil—would gravely endanger our national security, given the likely presence of IRGC agents in the Iranian delegation. Furthermore, granting a mass murderer like Raisi a visa to enter our country would also legitimize his repression. It is a risk we cannot and should not take.There is strong precedent for denying an entry visa to foreign leaders. In 1988, the United States barred PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat from entering the United States to attend a meeting of the United Nations. In 2014, President Obama denied an entry visa to Iranian UN Ambassador Hamid Aboutalebi, who was involved in taking American diplomats hostage in 1979. In 2020, the United States declined to issue a visa for Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Ebrahim Raisi’s role in the regime’s human rights abuses and Iran’s continuing efforts to murder American officials should more than disqualify him from receiving a visa to the United States.Thank you for considering this important matter of national security.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Text of the bill may be found here.“Chinese investments in American farmland put our food security at risk and provide opportunities for Chinese espionage against our military bases and critical infrastructure. Instead of allowing these purchases, the U.S. government must bar the Communist Party from purchasing our land,” said Cotton.“We cannot continue giving our top adversary a foot in the door to purchase land in the United States and undermine our national security,” said Tuberville. “I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of our bill and join the effort to prohibit Chinese Communist Party involvement in America’s agriculture industry.”Background:•                    China’s agricultural investments in countries around the globe grew more than tenfold from 2009 to 2016. China’s Ministry of Agriculture claims the country had over 1,300 agricultural, forestry, and fisheries enterprises with registered overseas investments of $26 billion, at the end of 2016.•                    Chinese investments in U.S. agricultural may provide the CCP with undue leverage over U.S. supply chains and access to sensitive information critical to U.S. national security.•                    While Chinese entities held slightly less than one percent of all foreign-held acres in the U.S. in 2020, the volume of their holdings increased dramatically over the last decade. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports, Chinese investors’ holdings of U.S. agricultural land surged from 13,720 acres in 2010 to 352,140 acres in 2020.•                    The USDA’s most recent report on foreign landholding through December 31, 2020 shows foreign investors now hold an interest in nearly 37.6 million acres of agricultural land in the U.S.—an area larger than the state of Iowa.•                    Approximately 14 states have some level of foreign ownership restriction yet there are no federal restrictions on the amount of private U.S. agricultural land that can be foreign owned.•                    Land grabbing by foreign actors will become a greater threat in the coming years. With an aging population of American farmers (one-third over the age of 65), millions of acres in U.S. farmland are expected to change hands in the next decade.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

A number of troubling incidents suggest how your interpretation of Title IX could erode women’s rights, free-speech rights, parental rights, and children’s safety and innocence,” the senators continued.Text of the letter may be found here and below. The Honorable Miguel CardonaAttn: Title IX RulemakingSecretary of EducationDepartment of Education Building400 Maryland Ave, SWWashington, DC 20202 Dear Secretary Cardona,We write regarding the Department of Education’s intention to unlawfully include “gender identity” as a protected category under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681).  The Biden administration claims that Title IX, which was written to provide equal opportunities to women, protects men claiming to be women on the basis of their “gender identity.”  Consequently, your department has suggested that schools which prohibit males from using women’s bathrooms or playing women’s sports could be guilty of unlawful “discrimination.”  Your interpretation of Title IX will undermine that law’s very purpose by making schools and sports unsafe and unfair for women and girls. Equally disturbing is the likelihood that your department will weaponize Title IX to force a radical gender ideology in K-12 classrooms. A number of troubling incidents suggest how your interpretation of Title IX could erode women’s rights, free-speech rights, parental rights, and children’s safety and innocence. Given these concerns, please respond to the following questions by Monday, August 15, 2022.1.                  A middle school in Wisconsin recently filed a complaint under Title IX against three students for choosing not to refer to another student by her preferred pronouns.  Would it be a potential violation of Title IX for a student to refuse to call someone by pronouns that do not correspond to their biological sex?2.                  A school in Virginia suspended a teacher, Tanner Cross, for refusing to use a child’s “preferred” pronouns and cited Title IX as one justification.  Would it be “discriminatory” or a potential violation of Title IX for a school employee to refuse to refer to a student or colleague by their preferred name or pronouns? If yes, would teachers with religious or conscientious objections be given an exemption?3.                  When Florida passed a law to protect K-3 students from inappropriate classroom instruction, you implied it might run afoul of Title IX.  Would it be “discriminatory” or a potential violation of Title IX for a school, district, or state to limit a school employee’s ability to discuss “gender identity” with young children? Would it be a potential violation of Title IX for any school, district, or state to discipline a teacher’s or school employee’s discussion of the aforementioned topic with young children?4.                  Would it be a potential violation of Title IX for any school, district, or state to refuse to provide puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to “affirm” a students’ “gender identity” at a school health clinic?5.                  In order to comply with the Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague letter” on Title IX, a Chicago public school chose to treat a girl as a boy and override the parents’ expressed wish to treat their daughter according to her biological sex.  Would it be “discriminatory” or a potential violation of Title IX to treat a child according to their biological sex if the parents requested this, but the child preferred a different “gender identity”?6.                  An alarming number of schools deceive parents about their child’s “gender transition” by withholding information about their child’s “gender identity.” Your proposed rules favorably cite policies from California and Washoe County, Nevada, which forbid school staff from notifying parents about their child’s “gender identity.”  Would it be “discriminatory” or a potential violation of Title IX for a school employee or student to notify or inform parents about their child’s “gender transition” or alleged “gender identity”?7.                  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act guarantees parents’ “right to inspect and review the education records their children.”  Under your proposed rule, would a school be allowed to deny parents access to a child’s educational records, including sensitive information about their purported “gender identity,” for any reason? Under what circumstances could a school deny parents their right to inspect and review their children’s records? 8.                  In Loudon County, Virginia, a girl was raped in the girl’s bathroom by a boy who “identifies” as “gender fluid.”  Would it be “discriminatory” or a potential violation of Title IX to deny a boy who claimed a different “gender identity” access to the girl’s bathroom?9.                  A male student at the University of Pennsylvania who claims to be a woman, Lia Thomas, has caused discomfort through his presence and behavior in the women’s locker room. Would it be discriminatory or a violation of Title IX to deny a boy who claimed a “gender identity” that did not correspond with his biological sex to use a girl’s locker room?10.             You have claimed that your proposed rule will not address women’s sports, yet your agency appears to be enforcing Title IX to effectively end women’s sports teams. Last June, your department signed onto a statement of interest, led by the Department of Justice, arguing that West Virginia’s law to prevent biological males from participating in female athletics is a violation of Title IX. Would it be a violation of Title IX to deny a biological male who claimed a “gender identity” that did not correspond with his biological sex to join a women’s sports team?Thank you for your attention to this important manner.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

As we made clear to CA100+ when we joined, BlackRock acts independently in its investment decisions. We do not co-ordinate investment decisions with any members of Climate Action 100+, and we do not buy, sell, hold or vote our shares together with any Climate Action 100+ signatory. As fiduciaries to our clients, we consistently prioritise the long-term economic interests of our clients above any commitments or pledges not required by law.BlackRock’s intimation that it set boundaries when joining CA100+ is unconvincing, as the statement mirrors CA100+’s own language on its website.  And if this was a response to my letter, it did not answer my questions. BlackRock’s statement raises additional questions about its commitments to the CA100+ initiative. Many of the commitments investor participants make when joining CA100+ raise potential antitrust issues. For example, based on CA100+’s website:•                    “investors commit to engaging with at least one of 166 focus companies . . . and to seek commitments on the initiative’s key asks”;•                    investors are required to “work cooperatively with a number of collaborating investors”;•                    investors are “required to share information with the engagement working group and the coordinating investor network”;•                    investors are “required to liaise with relevant network staff and/or lead investors to ensure engagement priorities and ambition are aligned with the goals of the initiative, as well as with the overall collaborative approach”;•                    investors are required to “disclose through a bi-annual survey their engagement plans and priorities over the coming 12 months to ensure strong and concerted action”; and•                    investors are required to warn focus companies that “inaction by companies following engagement may result in investors taking further action.”In light of these commitments that BlackRock made when becoming a CA100+ “investor participant,” please provide answers to the following questions by August 2, 2022:1.                  Has BlackRock followed through on its intention to “participate in dialogue with companies and financial institutions” as part of the CA100+ initiative? If so, please list each company and financial institution BlackRock engaged in “dialogue” with, and explain what was discussed during such “dialogue.”2.                  In light of BlackRock’s insistence that it “acts independently” and “do[es] not co-ordinate” with other CA100+ members, does BlackRock count itself among the CA100+ “investors [that] recognise that unprecedented cross-sector collaboration is required to achieve net zero across the global economy”?3.                  Has Blackrock fulfilled the CA100+ commitments listed above? If so, please identify:a.                  the companies BlackRock has engaged with;b.                  the investors BlackRock has collaborated with;c.                  the investors BlackRock has shared information with;d.                  the investors and network staff BlackRock has liaised with; ande.                  the companies BlackRock has threatened with “further action.”In addition, please provide a copy of all bi-annual surveys BlackRock has prepared for CA100+.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

The results of the security reviews, likewise, have not been publicly released after one year. Instead, news reports indicate TikTok is nearing a deal with a U.S. company to ‘store its U.S. users’ information without its Chinese parent ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns.’”“The proposed TikTok deal would do little to address the core security concerns that motivated the August 14 order. That order was not simply concerned about data, but about a Chinese company’s ownership of a social media platform in America. If the Biden Administration focuses solely on data storage and integrity to the exclusion of the critical issue of ByteDance’s ownership, control, and influence of TikTok, serious security risks will remain and the August 14 order will go unenforced,” the senators continued.Text of the letter may be found here and below. The Honorable Janet YellenSecretaryDepartment of the Treasury1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20220 Dear Secretary Yellen,We write to inquire about the Biden Administration’s delayed response to the national security and privacy risks posed by TikTok, the video-sharing social media platform developed and owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd.On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (E.O. 13942) restricting the use of TikTok in the United States. The order noted that the app “captures vast swaths of information from its users, including… location data and browsing and search histories.” TikTok’s data-collection practices threatened to “allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information—potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” Shortly afterward, ByteDance sued in federal court and secured a preliminary injunction that halted a pending prohibition against downloading the TikTok app.President Trump issued an additional Presidential Order on August 14, 2020 (the August 14 order) directing ByteDance to divest its American assets and destroy any data it acquired through TikTok. The order also blocked ByteDance’s acquisition of another video-sharing social media platform, Musical.ly. The August 14 order was based on “credible evidence” that the acquisition threatened to “impair the national security of the United States,” likely including evidence unearthed by a review of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).On June 9, 2021, President Joe Biden revoked E.O. 13942 and ordered security reviews of TikTok and similar apps developed in adversary countries. The next month, the Biden Administration petitioned to dismiss ongoing federal litigation against ByteDance. President Biden did not, however, revoke the August 14 Presidential Order requiring ByteDance to divest its American assets, property, and data.The Biden Administration has seemingly done nothing to enforce the August 14 order nearly two years since its promulgation. The results of the security reviews, likewise, have not been publicly released after one year. Instead, news reports indicate TikTok is nearing a deal with a U.S. company to “store its U.S. users’ information without its Chinese parent ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns.”The proposed TikTok deal would do little to address the core security concerns that motivated the August 14 order. That order was not simply concerned about data, but about a Chinese company’s ownership of a social media platform in America. If the Biden Administration focuses solely on data storage and integrity to the exclusion of the critical issue of ByteDance’s ownership, control, and influence of TikTok, serious security risks will remain and the August 14 order will go unenforced.Please answer the following requests in writing:1. Identify all CFIUS member agencies that are “lead” agencies for this matter.2. Given recent press reporting that TikTok may partner with a U.S. company to store Americans’ data in the United States:a.                  Are these arrangements part of a CFIUS-ordered plan to address national security risk?b.                  Will such arrangements appropriately and adequately effectuate the directives contained in the August 14 order? If so, how?c.                  What assurances does the U.S. government have that TikTok will store U.S. data and adopt privacy policies with adequate protections?d.                  How will the U.S. government enforce any such data protection and storage arrangements vis-à-vis an independent third-party U.S. company?e.                  What steps will be taken with regard to the storage, protection, and integrity of the extensive U.S. data that has already been acquired by TikTok and ByteDance both prior to and since the August 14 order?  f.                   Will the United States impose requirements for destruction of data previously acquired and not stored within U.S. jurisdiction, and how will such a requirement be enforced and verified? g.                  How will the U.S. government ensure the TikTok app contains no malicious code and does not manipulate information and content?  How will this be accomplished and verified on an ongoing basis?  If an independent third party is responsible to the U.S. government for these functions, how will any failure to protect Americans and U.S. national security be remedied and enforced?  Has the U.S. government considered adequate means of accountability?h.                  Will TikTok be locally managed in the United States?i.                    If the control and operation of TikTok’s algorithm remains in the Chinese company’s hands, does that mean that U.S. persons’ data will be transferred to China to inform said algorithm?j.                    Will the U.S. government have the ability to routinely access and inspect the algorithm’s source code?k.                  What safeguards will the United States have to ensure protection of U.S. persons’ data in the event the CCP were to invoke its National Security Law and direct ByteDance to provide U.S. data to the Chinese government?l.                    Will only U.S. persons be the officers and employees responsible for all operations and activities of TikTok in the United States?  How will the decision-making of U.S. officers and employees be isolated from any and all influence of ByteDance’s officers and employees?3. If the divestment ordered by the August 14 order will not be effectuated, will the President issue a superseding Presidential or Executive Order?4. If divestment ordered by the August 14 order is not effectuated, to what extent will ByteDance or other Chinese persons retain ownership or control over TikTok’s operations in the United States?  Describe in detail both the ownership and control structure contemplated for TikTok in the United States.5. Are the actions that CFIUS may be taking to address the threat posed by TikTok being considered and applied by U.S. government agencies to WeChat, Didi, and other Chinese-owned or controlled apps?Please respond to these questions no later than July 22. Thank you for your prompt response to this important matter.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Representative Jim Banks (R-Indiana) is leading companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“Gender-transition procedures aren’t safe or appropriate for children. Unfortunately, radical doctors in the United States perform dangerous, experimental, and even sterilizing gender-transition procedures on young kids, who cannot even provide informed consent. Our bill allows children who grow up to regret these procedures to sue for damages. Any doctor who performs these irresponsible procedures on kids should pay,” said Cotton.“The Biden administration released official guidance recommending irreversible and life-altering surgery for minors too young to apply for a learner’s permit. These procedures lack any solid evidence and have been rejected by public health agencies around the world. Ten years from now, there will be hundreds of thousands of Americans who were permanently scarred by the radical left’s agenda before they reached adulthood. If Democrats truly supported gender-confused children, they’d support our effort to give them legal recourse,” said Banks.Text of the bill may be found here.The Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act would:The legislation is supported by the American Principles Project, Heritage Action, Family Policy Alliance, Family Research Council, Independent Women’s Forum, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Ethics and Public Policy Center, Alliance Defending Freedom, ForAmerica, Eagle Forum, CHANGED Movement.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Further, President Biden’s own press secretary announced this week that the Biden administration “certainly continue[s] to encourage [protests] outside of judges’ homes, and that’s the president’s position.” This is in stark contrast to when you sicced federal agents on parents who attended public meetings of school boards in public buildings.

We do not condone any unjustified violence against innocent parties, if that's what occurred; however, the Department had 20 months to make both these decisions but only made them after Senator Cotton refused to allow expedited consideration of Department of Justice (DOJ) nominees because DOJ had not provided these DUSMs payments for defense counsel when they were named defendants in a civil suit related to the Portland riots.

The Iranian regime arms the Houthis in Yemen with the missiles and drones that they use to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Iran equips Hezbollah and Hamas with tens of thousands of rockets, including the more than 4,000 rockets which Hamas fired at Israeli civilians last May. Last month, Iran escalated its attacks against Americans in Iraq, firing a dozen ballistic missiles from Iranian soil at the U.S. consulate in Erbil.Meanwhile, your administration appears intent on striking a new nuclear deal with Iran that will provide the regime with a pathway to nuclear weapons. A nuclear-armed Iran would have major negative regional implications. It would put at risk the existence of the State of Israel and the governments of our Arab allies, destroy America’s position in the Middle East, and ultimately threaten the U.S. homeland. A course-correction is necessary.We therefore urge your administration to take immediate action to provide Israel with the military capabilities it needs to defend itself from Iran. Most importantly, since the purchase has already been approved, your administration must expedite the delivery of KC-46A aerial refueling tankers to Israel as rapidly as possible without interrupting deliveries to our own Air Force. Accelerating delivery of tactical aircraft like the F-35I and F-15I and helicopters like the CH-53K would continue to bolster Israel’s ability to defend itself. While providing improved tactical aircraft is vital, your administration must also ensure that Israel retains adequate stockpiles of U.S.-made precision guided munitions. Finally, you must ensure that Israel possesses robust, multi-layered air defenses to mitigate attacks by Iran and its proxies, to include continued support for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow systems.Your administration must urgently fulfill America’s obligation to help Israel defend itself by giving it the tools it needs to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.Sincerely,###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Earlier last month, USTR also punted on opening new 301 investigations into China’s economic abuses. These trade concessions are a gift to Chinese producers that continue your agency’s pattern of economic appeasement.In your congressional testimony, you stated that a public “trust gap” has emerged on trade policy. Sadly, your agency’s tendency to say one thing and do another has contributed to this crisis of confidence. I urge you to change course and restore the American people’s trust in our nation’s trade policy.

However, Judge Jackson sentenced Hawkins to a mere three months in Bureau of Prisons custody. Hawkins would later re-offend—when he would have been in prison had Judge Jackson followed the sentencing guidelines—and appear before Judge Jackson again.In part, the senators wrote, “Accordingly, consistent with measures necessary to protect the privacy of the victims and other innocent third parties, please immediately provide the Committee with a copy of the probation petition that you referenced in that April 2019 order, and an explanation of what Hawkins did in 2019 that earned him twice as much time in BOP custody as your original three-month sentence. If discussing those details necessitates confidentiality, please contact the Committee to schedule a closed-door briefing on the topic. Further, please confirm whether computer monitoring software was already required prior to 2019 as part of your original sentence in the Hawkins case.”The full text of the letter may be found below. A copy of the letter may be found here.   March 25, 2022  The Honorable Ketanji Brown JacksonE. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse, Room 5700333 Constitution Avenue, NorthwestWashington, District of Columbia 20001 Dear Judge Jackson, During your confirmation hearing, you were asked by multiple members about the extraordinarily lenient sentences that you have given to child pornography offenders. Your sentences for child pornography offenders were routinely less than the sentences recommended by the sentencing guidelines and less than the sentences recommended by the prosecutors—in fact, you gave reduced sentences far more often than did average federal judges. In one specific case that was addressed at the hearing, you sentenced a man named Wesley Hawkins, who distributed child pornography on the internet. The sentencing guidelines recommended a sentence of about 8-10 years. As a result of a plea agreement, the prosecutors in the case recommended a 24-month sentence, and your own probation office recommended 18 months. You, however, sentenced Hawkins to a mere three months in BOP custody for his crimes. In 2019—when he would have been in prison if you had followed the sentencing guidelines—Hawkins apparently did something that caused you to send him back to BOP custody for six months in a halfway house, along with instituting new restrictions on his computer usage. According to the court docket in the case, on April 17, 2019 (five and one-half years after your original sentence), you concurred with the recommendation of a “Probation Petition” and ordered that Hawkins return to BOP custody in a halfway house for six months, and that he allow the probation officer to install computer monitoring software on his electronic devices. Your lenient sentencing in the Hawkins case was the subject of significant interest in the Committee’s review of your judicial record. Our review of your nomination requires that the Committee fully understand the circumstances that informed your actions in this case. Accordingly, consistent with measures necessary to protect the privacy of the victims and other innocent third parties, please immediately provide the Committee with a copy of the probation petition that you referenced in that April 2019 order, and an explanation of what Hawkins did in 2019 that earned him twice as much time in BOP custody as your original three-month sentence. If discussing those details necessitates confidentiality, please contact the Committee to schedule a closed-door briefing on the topic. Further, please confirm whether computer monitoring software was already required prior to 2019 as part of your original sentence in the Hawkins case. Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter. ###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

For this reason, I am deeply disappointed to learn that USTR is not pursuing an expansive set of Section 301 investigations into China’s anti-competitive and illegal trade practices.”“Such investigations would likely result in barriers to subsidized Chinese goods and would blunt Beijing’s attempt to dominate critical sectors through economic aggression.

In the two decades since China’s entry into the WTO, the CCP has effectively shuttered tens of thousands of American factories, destroyed millions of American manufacturing jobs, and stolen hundreds of billions of dollars of American intellectual property. China’s broad industrial destruction has fed the heartbreaking opioid crisis that still grips our nation, and is in no small part fueled by Chinese fentanyl. Far from showing contrition, China’s rulers have added insult to injury at every opportunity. You have rightfully criticized China for violating the terms of the Phase I trade deal. Instead of increasing imports from the United States by $200 billion over the baseline, China reduced purchases by nearly $14 billion. For months, your agency has negotiated in good faith to bring China into compliance with Phase I, but the Communist Party has steadfastly refused to keep their promises. Our goods trade deficit with China last year reached the highest level since 2018, and our total trade deficit surpassed $1 trillion, for the first time ever.The CCP has shown nothing but malice towards this nation and should be shown no leniency in our response to its economic aggression. For this reason, I am deeply disappointed to learn that USTR is not pursuing an expansive set of Section 301 investigations into China’s anti-competitive and illegal trade practices.Such investigations would likely result in barriers to subsidized Chinese goods and would blunt Beijing’s attempt to dominate critical sectors through economic aggression. It’s past time that we act to defend American industry, prevent China from dominating the industries of the future, and decouple key strategic sectors from China. I hope you share these objectives.Please answer the following questions so that the American people can better understand the Biden administration’s position on China’s economic aggression:Very respectfully,###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Congressman Fred Upton (R-Michigan), released the final report of the U.S. Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking. Established by the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the Commission was charged with examining aspects of the synthetic drug threat to the United States.The Commission comprised representatives of seven Executive Branch departments and agencies, four sitting members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and four subject-matter experts chosen for their deep experience and expertise on this topic.The final report serves as a bipartisan, strategic approach to combating the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States — with an overarching goal of reducing the number of overdose deaths from these drugs.The report outlines a host of evidence-based, data-driven proposals to implement a nationwide and coordinated approach to this crisis, including efforts to:Click here to read the full report.“274 Americans die every day from drug overdoses—that’s one person every five minutes, and every day it gets worse,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Co-Chair of the Commission. “We must destroy the cartels and drug trafficking networks that flood our streets with these poisons to protect our communities. I’m proud to work with my colleagues to combat this epidemic at all levels of government.”“Since 1999, we’ve lost more than one million Americans to drug overdoses. That’s one million moms, dads, sons, and daughters lost because our country’s response to the opioid epidemic has failed,” said Congressman David Trone, Co-Chair of the Commission. “It’s time to come together, from all levels of government and both sides of the aisle, to address this epidemic and put an end to it once and for all. The Commission’s informed proposals must serve as a roadmap for our country’s leadership, including Congress, to take swift, deliberate action in the months to come. Let’s get to work.”“The final report of the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking will serve as a roadmap to stanch the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States, and be our guide as we work to save lives and rebuild communities across the country,” said Senator Edward J. Markey. “This report is not the end of our work, but merely the beginning, particularly here on Capitol Hill. Now, we must follow through with comprehensive legislation to implement the report’s recommendations.”“The scourge of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids is tearing apart communities throughout Michigan and across the country. Families have been through unspeakable suffering as loved ones struggle with addiction,” said Congressman Fred Upton. “In my district, I have met with grieving parents whose grief is unbearable for them. We must redouble our efforts to secure the border against illegal trafficking by targeting Mexican cartels flooding our streets with illicit opioids and force China’s hand to crackdown on their pharmaceutical industry supplying cartels with the base compounds used to manufacture synthetic opioids. I was proud to be a part of this Commission and hope to take what’s in this report and put it into action.”The Members of Congress were joined by federal agencies and subject-matter experts in support of this vital effort:“The number of lives we’re losing and the economic impact of this crisis, and the fact that the supply is maliciously coming from entities in other nations, speaks to this as a national security crisis rather than simply a public health crisis,” said Ret. Admiral James Winnefeld, Jr. “The efforts of the Commission and this report make clear that a solution will require far more concerted resources and action at the federal level, in addition to the state, local, and non-profit levels, to tackle this epidemic in any effective way.”""A full-court press is urgently needed to break the fentanyl death grip on our families, stop the trillion-dollar toll on our economy and protect our national security,"" said Karen Tandy, former Administrator, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""Meaningful progress to reverse the direction of overdose deaths will require new strategic approaches and tools outlined by the Commission, including the implementation of economic sanctions on foreign actors involved in the trade and targeted enforcement support to dismantle drug cartels.  I am proud to have served as a member of this Commission and look forward to seeing its work enacted."" ""This report exemplifies the best of what our country can and must do to come together and address a complicated and complex national security problem. The bipartisan leadership of and support for this Commission worked together to address this difficult challenge head-on,” said David Luckey, co-leader of the RAND Corporation team that helped to prepare the report for the Commission. “The recommendations laid out in this report provide a path to achieving a consensus strategic approach toward reducing this national security threat and saving American lives.""“Combating the trafficking of fentanyl must be a high priority for the United States government, the increase in overdose deaths is a national crisis, and this crisis must be met in a whole of government and whole of society effort,” said D.L. McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst, Longview Global. “The Commission’s report outlines several recommendations for addressing this complex challenge.”Background:Since 1999, more than one million Americans have died from drug overdoses — far more than all of the US service members killed in battle in every war throughout our nation’s history. The number of our citizens lost to opioids each year is more than double the number killed by firearms, motor vehicle accidents, or suicide.Synthetic opioids – primarily fentanyl – were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the over 100,000 reported drug overdose deaths in the United States in the 12-month period ending in June 2021. According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, this rate is up 30% from the year prior.Throughout the Commission’s work, it has become abundantly clear that this cannot be narrowly defined as a local- or state-level public health concern. In 2018, it was estimated that overdose fatalities cost the United States $696 billion. With the rise in overdose deaths in years since, it is fair to estimate that fatal overdoses are now at least a $1 trillion annual cost. Given this demonstrated financial strain and its devastating human impact, it is undeniable that the epidemic presents a threat to our national security and global competitiveness. The U.S. Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking was established under Section 7221 of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2020, and, by law, concluded its work on February 8, 2022. The Commission includes several federal departments and agencies, as well as four outside members appointed by congressional leadership from the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Commission is led by two co-chairs, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Congressman David Trone (D-Maryland), who were appointed by congressional leadership and approved by the President of the United States. ###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

McDonough before the Supreme Court. In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs refused to give Thomas Buffington the disability payments he had earned, and the U.S. Court of Appeals has since defended the VA’s decision. In doing so, the Federal Circuit ignored court precedent and violated a long-standing practice of siding with the veteran when interpreting law.The senators disagree with the Federal Circuit’s decision and are supporting a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.Specifically, the senators argue:“…rather than following Congress’s instruction that the courts should interpret these laws, and should do so in favor of veterans, the decision below invoked Chevron deference to endorse an agency “interpretation” that disfavored veterans. By refusing to apply the pro-veteran canon at Chevron’s first step, the lower court departed from the plain language of the statute and improperly placed the agency’s view ahead of the established rule that any statutory ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the veteran.”Text of the brief may be found here. “No veteran should have to fight the VA to get the benefits they earned, and no court should defer to the administration instead of Congress and deny that compensation. It was wrong for the court to distort Congress’ wishes by invoking Chevron deference—the VA should pay Mr. Buffington what he’s owed,” said Cotton.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Your unwillingness to take actions that could jeopardize the doomed Vienna nuclear talks has undeniably emboldened these criminals. Meanwhile, the boom in oil sales has refilled the Iranian regime’s once-empty coffers, removed crucial American leverage over Iran, and encouraged the Iranians to stall negotiations in Vienna and irreversibly advance their pursuit of a nuclear weapon. It is long past time to stop your dithering. You are putting U.S. national security at risk.”“We urge you to enforce U.S. sanctions against entities that purchase Iranian oil and against those foreign-flagged oil tankers which keep Iran’s illicit oil trade alive. Each day you delay gives Iran more money to finance their terrorist activity and more time to develop a nuclear weapon. We would also remind you that sanctions against Iran’s oil exports are mandatory and passed Congress with bipartisan majorities. You are not above the law and must stop violating it,” the senators continued.Senator Cotton was joined by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), and John Cornyn (R-Texas).Text of the letter may be found here and below.President Joseph R. BidenThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden, We write to urge you to take action against the growing fleet of oil tankers evading U.S. sanctions and against the entities purchasing Iranian oil from these tankers.As you are aware, Iran’s energy sector is a primary source of funding to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a designated foreign terrorist organization. Because of its critical role in funding terrorism, the National Iranian Oil Company is subject to U.S. terrorism sanctions.  Therefore, enforcing oil sanctions against Iran is also enforcing terrorism sanctions against Iran. Bipartisan laws enacted by Congress in 2011 and 2012 targeting Iran’s oil exports and energy sector require the President to enforce these sanctions.The U.S. maximum pressure campaign seriously reduced Iranian oil exports and curtailed the Iranian regime’s ability to finance terrorism and other malign activities. From April 2018 to June 2020, Iranian oil exports shrank from nearly 2.9 million barrels per day to 600,000 barrels per day.  Tehran faced severe budget deficits in 2019 and 2020 due to the decline in oil sales. This massive drop in revenue gave the United States significant leverage over Iran and impeded the regime’s strategic ambitions.These gains have been threatened by the disturbing rise in Iranian oil exports since your administration began, despite U.S. sanctions remaining in place. Iran exported an estimated 418 million barrels of oil in 2021, 123 million more than in 2020.  Twice in 2021, Iranian oil exports exceeded 1.4 million barrels per day, the highest rate since March 2019.  Three-quarters of this oil was exported to China, which purchased 310 million barrels of Iranian oil last year.  In recent weeks, the Chinese government has openly acknowledged importing millions of barrels of Iranian oil for its strategic petroleum reserves. As a result of this surge in oil sales, Iranian currency reserves soared from just $4 billion at the end of 2020 to $31 billion at the end of 2021.  These Chinese purchases give the Iranian regime a vital lifeline and flout U.S. sanctions with impunity. While your administration has reportedly warned China and other countries about the sanctions risks to their companies, these entities remain unpunished.Iran’s increased oil exports are only possible because non-Iranian, foreign-flagged vessels are increasingly willing to risk U.S. sanctions to sell Iranian oil. Much of this activity is done illicitly, with foreign-flagged tankers transferring oil at sea from Iranian tankers to obscure the origin of their illegal cargo. These vessels avoid sanctions by hiding behind shell companies and often flying a false flag. Other such vessels turn off their satellite transponders, change their flag, or register under the flag of a country where maritime authorities are willing to look the other way. The number of foreign-flagged tankers suspected of involvement in the transport of Iranian oil has more than doubled from 70 vessels in November 2020 to 165 vessels in January 2022.  This fleet will only continue to grow if your administration keeps refusing to crack down on this practice.The vessel owners and their customers in China are taking greater risks because they believe that your administration is too weak and indecisive to punish them for their crimes. Your   unwillingness to take actions that could jeopardize the doomed Vienna nuclear talks has undeniably emboldened these criminals. Meanwhile, the boom in oil sales has refilled the Iranian regime’s once-empty coffers, removed crucial American leverage over Iran, and encouraged the Iranians to stall negotiations in Vienna and irreversibly advance their pursuit of a nuclear weapon. It is long past time to stop your dithering. You are putting U.S. national security at risk.We urge you to enforce U.S. sanctions against entities that purchase Iranian oil and against those foreign-flagged oil tankers which keep Iran’s illicit oil trade alive. Each day you delay gives Iran more money to finance their terrorist activity and more time to develop a nuclear weapon. We would also remind you that sanctions against Iran’s oil exports are mandatory and passed Congress with bipartisan majorities. You are not above the law and must stop violating it. The radical mullahs in Iran will only abandon their nuclear ambitions when they believe time is no longer on their side. Decisive action by your administration can stop the regime’s malign activity; more concessions and polite expressions of impatience are not going to cut it.Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely,###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

In the months immediately following passage of the CARES Act, it was understandable that the SBA’s modest workforce would face issues reviewing and processing millions of applications to these programs. We appreciate the SBA’s efforts to distribute EIDL and PPP loans to Arkansans struggling during the pandemic. However, nearly two years after these programs were signed into law, Americans are still dealing with unacceptable delays and limited communications from SBA. Here are a few examples from Arkansas:We understand there are cases with legitimate technical issues that are out of the hands of any individual SBA employee processing these applications. However, our offices have noticed a pattern of Arkansans experiencing unreasonable difficulty accessing SBA programs that were supposed to be a lifeline for businesses during the pandemic.We are also concerned that the SBA’s remote work policies may be a factor in the organization’s reduction of timely constituent services. We understand the need to provide employees with flexibility to carry out their jobs safely, but these policies must be reassessed when they negatively impact Americans’ access to federal programs.We ask that you consider ways to improve SBA’s delivery of constituent services and work with Congress to make reforms, as needed.

The Department’s Office of Legal Counsel correctly concluded in January 2021 that the only tenable reading of the CARES Act is that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) could only exercise expanded home confinement placement authority during the coronavirus national emergency, and that the law requires that the BOP return such inmates to prison and follow the limits of longstanding federal law following the end of the emergency.  Activists asked the Department to ignore the law to reach their preferred policy outcome of mass early release of serious criminals, but ignoring the law is not within your authority. Indeed, it was publicly reported this summer that the Biden administration had reviewed the law in the hopes of pleasing those activists, but found that it could not. Unfortunately, it seems that you have now decided to bow to the pressure from political activists rather than do your job. The Office of Legal Counsel, at your direction, issued a slapdash opinion reversing itself in December 2021.  That new opinion is not based on the law, but rather on the policy goals of criminal leniency. It even admits as much.  Your opinion would also allow absurd results; under your baseless reading of the CARES Act, even after the coronavirus national emergency ends, the BOP would have 30 days during which it could release as many inmates as possible to home confinement and have them stay there until the end of their sentences, whether for years or even for the remainder of their lives. Such a scenario is not plausibly contained within the temporary authority that Congress granted to you, yet would be allowable under your new opinion.It is Congress’s duty to oversee the enforcement of federal law.

A one-pager about the bill may be found here. Bill text may be found here.This evening, Senator Cotton and Senators Steve Daines (R-Montana), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) held a press conference on the bill. They were joined by Stuart and Robbi Force, whose son Taylor Force was murdered by Palestinian terrorists during a trip to Israel. A video of the press conference may be found here.“Radical Islamic terrorists shouldn’t be rewarded for killing innocent people, and banks should be held responsible for processing any sort of ‘martyr payments.’ Our bill will build upon the Taylor Force Act to ensure Palestinian terrorists don’t benefit financially for committing these senseless murders,” said Cotton.“The 2018 Taylor Force Act was an important first step toward ending the Palestinian Authority‘s outrageous ‘pay-for-slay’ system that incentivizes deadly terrorist attacks against Israelis and Americans. Senator Cotton's bill will make important progress toward this goal by targeting the financial institutions that facilitate these so-called ‘martyr payments,’” said Republican Jewish Coalition National Chairman Norm Coleman.Joining Senator Cotton on the bill are Senators Steve Daines (R-Montana), Todd Young (R-Indiana), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina).The Taylor Force Martyr Payment Prevention Act is supported by the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), and Christians United for Israel (CUFI).Background:In March 2016, a member of the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas murdered U.S. Army veteran Taylor Force in Tel Aviv, Israel. The terrorist that stabbed Taylor also severely wounded ten others before being killed by Israeli police. Soon thereafter, the terrorist’s family started receiving “martyr payments” from the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a reward for his actions.In 2018, Congress passed the bipartisan Taylor Force Act, which significantly restricts non-humanitarian U.S. aid to the PA until it ends its “pay to slay” program. The Taylor Force Act recognized the fact that money is fungible and that U.S. aid, even if restricted towards good governance programs, frees up money for the PA to spend more on martyr payments. Although this act penalized the PA for its use of martyr payments, further action is required.Recent reporting reveals that Palestinian banks and other banks in the Middle East continue to knowingly process these martyr payments, sometimes in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions. These banks flout U.S. anti-terrorism financial regulations but escape sanctions by avoiding an official U.S. presence while maintaining correspondent accounts in the United States. This untenable status quo offers a lifeline to the PA “pay to slay” program.The Taylor Force Martyr Payment Prevention Act would:###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

We further urge BIS to take all steps necessary to prevent key technologies from falling into the hands of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).As you may be aware, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently identified five technology areas key to America’s strategic competition with China: artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, semiconductors, biotechnology, and autonomous systems.  NCSC is using this framework to guide its efforts to prevent U.S. adversaries like China from acquiring technologies necessary for America’s future economic growth and military advantage.Despite the pressing need to restrict the PLA’s advancement in key technology areas, our government has done little to impede the flow of U.S. exports and investment to Chinese AI companies with PLA ties. These Chinese companies with PLA ties have been readily identified through open-source analysis. A recent report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) revealed that only eight percent of the 273 companies that supply AI equipment to the PLA are on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List.  The remaining 92% of Chinese AI companies are free to purchase key U.S. technology for use in military applications.Given these troubling gaps in the United States’ strategy to protect its core technologies, we urge BIS to emulate the Intelligence Community by identifying key American technologies that need to be safeguarded from the Chinese Communist Party. Congress has already mandated the creation of such lists in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA). We further urge BIS to expeditiously review and then add all the PLA AI suppliers listed in the CSET report to the Entity List. Both of these actions will help bolster our national security and assure Congress that the Department of Commerce takes its duties seriously.With these concerns in mind, we request that you answer the following questions:Thank you for your attention to this matter of national security. We look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely,###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

The regulations state the Department of Justice ‘views the use of certain law enforcement tools, including . . . search warrants to seek information from, or records of, non-consenting members of the news media as extraordinary measures, not standard investigatory practices.’” “Given the execution of these search warrants were not ‘standard investigatory practices,’ I have concerns about the origins of this investigation, the motivations of the investigations, and tactics used by your Department,” he continued.Text of the letter may be found here and below. The Honorable Merrick GarlandU.S. Department of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20530-0001Dear Attorney General Garland,I am writing regarding recent reports of search warrants executed by the FBI on members of the news media in the course of investigating the alleged theft of Ashley Biden’s diary. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the FBI had executed search warrants on the homes of several individuals connected to media outlet Project Veritas, including its founder, journalist James O’Keefe.The Department of Justice follows rules and regulations when investigating members of the news media. The regulations state the Department of Justice “views the use of certain law enforcement tools, including . . . search warrants to seek information from, or records of, non-consenting members of the news media as extraordinary measures, not standard investigatory practices.” Given the execution of these search warrants were not “standard investigatory practices,” I have concerns about the origins of this investigation, the motivations of the investigations, and tactics used by your Department.Please respond to the following questions and requests by November 19, 2021:1. According to court filings, the crimes predicating the search warrants fall primarily under the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA), which, inter alia, criminalizes the transport of stolen property across state lines. 2. Please provide a detailed description of the steps you took to comply with the Department of Justice regulations governing obtaining information from journalists, including steps taken to comply with your July memo broadly prohibiting acquiring journalists’ records through compulsory process. If such regulations were not followed, please provide a detailed description about why you failed to follow these procedures.3. Court records show that reporters from the New York Times contacted James O’Keefe for comments very shortly after federal agents searched the home of an associate and O’Keefe’s home. Please provide all communications between employees of the Department of Justice and the New York Time concerning the investigation into the disappearance of Ashley Biden’s diary. Please describe any actions the Department has taken to investigate the leaks from the Department of Justice to the New York Times.4. Please provide all communications between officials from the Department of Justice and the White House concerning the investigation into the disappearance of Ashley Biden’s diary. Did anyone at the White House have advance notice of the search warrants for the cellphones of journalists affiliated with Project Veritas?I look forward to your prompt response regarding this important matter.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Bill text may be found here. A one-pager about the bill may be found here.“Big tech firms have bought up rivals to crush their competition, expand their monopolistic market share, and to harm working Americans. That’s bad for America. Under this bill, the largest tech monopolies will have the burden of proving that further acquisitions are lawful and good for the American people,” said Cotton. “Competition is critical to protecting workers and consumers and spurring innovation. But today, we’re increasingly seeing companies choose to buy their rivals rather than compete,” said Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will put an end to those anticompetitive acquisitions by making it more difficult for dominant digital platforms to eliminate their competitors and enhance the platform’s market power. It’s past time to address our nation’s monopoly problem and modernize our antitrust laws for the digital economy.”“For years, American Principles Project has been urging Congress to do everything in its power to rein in the power of Big Tech. We are thrilled that Senator Cotton has taken the lead on this important issue. This bill will make it more difficult for these Big Tech companies to engage in predatory mergers and acquisitions, which will help promote a free and fair market where consumers benefit because innovation and competition are finally allowed to flourish. We encourage Republicans in both the House and Senate to take a serious look at this bill and consider providing support,” said Jon Schweppe, Director of Policy and Government Affairs, American Principles Project.“Free markets only work if there’s competition. Trillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple use their staggering market power to buy start-ups that could threaten their dominance. This unfair and abusive practice prevents competition, crushes small businesses, harms consumers and leads to a decline in innovation. The Internet Accountability Project applauds the leadership of Senators Cotton and Klobuchar for their bipartisan legislation to put the burden on Big Tech to prove their acquisitions won't strengthen their monopolistic market share while still allowing for due process and a day in court,” said Mike Davis, President and Founder, Internet Accountability Project.“If Facebook hadn’t been able to acquire WhatsApp, consumers would still be able to choose between WhatsApp’s privacy-first, 99-cents-a-year subscription service and Facebook’s personal data collection and exploitation-based service.  This bill would make it more likely that consumers have access to diverse innovative services that challenge Big Tech’s way of doing business. The bill would require corporations running the largest online platforms to justify big acquisitions, making it harder for them to simply buy and neuter competitors, and further raise entry barriers,” said Sumit Sharma, Senior Researcher, Tech Competition at Consumer Reports.“Right on the heels of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act of 2021 is another strong, bipartisan solution for addressing a piece of the Big Tech puzzle. Senators Klobuchar and Cotton should be applauded for this targeted bill to combat one of the major strategies Big Tech uses to entrench its dominance: mergers and acquisitions. With a bill like this in place, truly innovative ideas that are disruptive to the Big Tech status quo will have a chance to flourish. This bill is an important step towards a better internet for users and small businesses alike, free from Big Tech’s control,” said Charlotte Slaiman, Competition Policy Director at Public Knowledge.“For too long, the tech giants have been allowed to use predatory mergers to eliminate their competitors, seize control of pivotal new technologies, and expand their dominance. Big Tech’s track record of unimpeded acquisitions offers one of the most glaring examples of how current antitrust policy has failed America’s entrepreneurs and small businesses. We applaud this bi-partisan effort, led by Senators Klobuchar and Cotton, to stand up to Big Tech by introducing legislation that would end these anti-competitive acquisitions and help usher in a more dynamic and innovative economy. Together with other measures, including structural separation and the nondiscrimination legislation, the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act of 2021 will rein in the tech giants’ monopoly power and safeguard the well-being of independent businesses, workers, and local communities,” said Stacy Mitchell, Co-Director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.“We applaud Sens. Klobuchar and Cotton for developing bi-partisan legislation that aims to prevent platform monopolists from cementing and augmenting their already dangerous levels of power. This bill is an important step toward ensuring that Big Tech platforms cannot continue to fortify and expand their dominance through acquisition, or to eliminate competitive threats simply by buying them. Absent congressional action, platform monopolists will continue to manipulate commerce and communications in ways that threaten our democracy and wreak havoc on the free press, workers, communities, and small businesses across the country.  We look forward to working closely with Sen. Klobuchar and other partners to further strengthen this bill, and other legislative efforts to loosen Big Tech’s concentrated control of America’s critical infrastructure of speech and commerce,” said Barry Lynn, Executive Director of the Open Markets Institute.“Big Tech monopolies have shamelessly gobbled up hundreds of potential competitors over the last decade. Even when faced with historic antitrust enforcement, they have continued to pursue anticompetitive acquisitions. The answer is to make clear that predatory behavior – like Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp – will no longer be tolerated. This legislation will do just that and is an important step towards reining in the power of these companies that believe they should be above the law. We are encouraged by the bipartisan interest in this important issue and appreciate the leadership of Sen. Klobuchar to take on the Big Tech monopolies,” said Alex Harman, Competition Policy Advocate at Public Citizen.A bipartisan group led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York), House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-Rhode Island), and Ranking Member Ken Buck (R-Colorado) introduced a similar version of the bill in the House, which was voted out of the House Judiciary Committee.At a moment when the digital economy has become highly concentrated and prone to monopolization, the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act will halt further harmful consolidation by:###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Representative Michael Waltz (R-Florida) are co-sponsors of the bill. Bill text may be found here.“Beijing’s efforts to exclude Taiwan from the global health community have had deadly consequences. Our bill will ensure the United States has the resources it needs to monitor health threats emerging in the Indo-Pacific and will allow Taiwan to share its knowledge with the world,” said Cotton.“For too long, the United States has been myopically focused on traditional national security issues and it has hurt our ability to promptly respond to new threats like the COVID-19 pandemic. We must learn from countries like Taiwan that grasped the dangers of this pandemic early on and had success in suppressing it,” said Khanna. “By establishing a U.S.-Taiwan Infectious Disease Monitoring Center, Congress can help prevent future pandemics and ensure important knowledge sharing can take place between the U.S. and Taiwan.”“Taiwan’s response to the pandemic has been incredibly successful, and it is unacceptable that the Chinese government is excluding them from global efforts to combat infectious diseases,” said Cortez Masto. “This legislation will allow the U.S. to partner with Taiwan to safely monitor health threats and help prevent future pandemics.”“We should not be surprised that the Chinese Communist Party’s genocidal regime has willingly withheld information on the COVID-19 pandemic, causing devastating effects around the world,” said Rubio. “We need a reliable and transparent partner in the Indo-Pacific that will provide us with accurate information in order to prevent and mitigate future health crises. Taipei has a comparative advantage in global health and is a trustworthy democratic ally and a valued friend.  I am glad to support this effort, which will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations and benefit global health.”“Taiwan has been a global leader in monitoring infectious diseases and developed one of the most successful responses in fighting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Waltz. “By establishing a joint disease monitoring center with Taiwan, we can safely monitor the impacts of infectious diseases, share best practices, and develop responses so we can effectively combat the next global pandemic.” The bill is supported by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and Taiwan’s CDC.The U.S.-Taiwan Public Health Protection Act would:###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-herrell-bill-allows-death-penalty-for-cop-killers,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEContact: Caroline Tabler or James Arnold (202) 224-2353March 9, 2021 Cotton, Herrell Bill Allows Death Penalty for Cop-KillersWashington, D.C. – Today Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Representative Yvette Herrell (R-New Mexico) introduced the Defending Our Defenders Act. The legislation would make the murder of a state or local law enforcement officer a federal crime punishable by life in prison or the death penalty.“Law enforcement officers dedicate their lives to defending the rule of law and protecting their fellow citizens. An attack on an officer is an attack on our democracy, and those criminals must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Our bill will subject those who murder police to a punishment they deserve, life in prison or the death penalty,” said Cotton.“The murder of any law enforcement officer undermines the fabric of our society. An attack on those who ‘protect and serve’ us is an attack on our communities and the rule of law. It cannot stand — we must defend those who defend us so selflessly and bravely. They have our backs, we must have theirs,” said Herrell. “New Mexicans were shocked and saddened to learn of the murder of State Patrolman Darian Jarrott during a shoot-out with a drug runner earlier this month. Just five years ago, two other New Mexico police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty. The criminals who took these lives deserve to face the maximum penalties allowed by law.”Under the Defending Our Defenders Act, a cop-killer could receive a life sentence, or the death penalty, if certain aggravating factors are met, including: intent to ambush a police officer, prior statements advocating or promoting violence against law enforcement, participation or affiliation with anarchist or other violence promoting groups, prior threats against law enforcement, or if the murder occurred during organized anti-law enforcement activity.The Defending Our Defenders Act is supported by the National Sheriffs’ Association, National Association of Chiefs of Police, Heritage Action for America and the New Mexico Sheriffs’ Association. The bill was also endorsed by Chief John Ortolano, Hobbs Police Department, Chief David Rodriguez, Lovington Police Department, as well as the Sheriffs’ Departments of Grant, Chavez, Catron, DeBaca, Guadalupe, Lea, Lincoln, Otero, Luna, Curry, Hidalgo, Valencia, Cibola, McKinley, Socorro, Sierra, and Quay Counties. Additional background:According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund (NLEMF), the U.S. has over 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers. In 2018, 56 died in the line of duty because of felonious acts. In 2019, that number was 48, and in 2020 it was 59. Since 1786, when the first police death was recorded in the U.S., more 22,000 officers killed have been killed in the line of duty. In the State of New Mexico, 160 police officers have died in the line of duty — 91 from gunfire, four from assault, five from stabbing, and four from vehicular assault. ###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

The process would be similar to the system used for designating entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). Representative Mike Gallagher (R-Wisconsin) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.""Criminal organizations and drug cartels that terrorize our communities and wage war at our borders ought to be treated just like terrorist groups in the eyes of the U.S. government. This bill would help stop cartel violence by ensuring these groups-and anyone who helps them-face dire consequences for their actions,"" said Cotton.“Criminal organizations like MS-13 terrorize American communities through human tracking and by smuggling drugs across our southern border. This legislation will make it easier for federal officials to crack down on these transnational criminal groups,” said Blackburn.“America has a duty to keep its citizens safe from brutal cartel violence. This bill gives law enforcement a critical new tool to ensure that cross-border criminals cannot terrorize our citizens,” said Hawley.“Drug cartels along our southern border have been a problem for far too long. We need a way to keep these thugs in check, and this legislation would allow our federal law enforcement to do just that. These cartels are murderous organizations that have blurred the line between drug trafficking and terrorism, and this designation would allow us to label them for what they are,” said Sasse.“Mexican cartels wreak havoc on our border and pose a direct threat to our national security. It’s past time we give the federal government every tool it needs to go after these thugs. From crippling sanctions to visa restrictions, this bill equips the administration to ensure these criminal organizations face severe consequences for their illicit activities,” said Gallagher.Background:Text of the legislation may be found here.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing COVID-19 vaccines.But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments we would be ending the progress—started under Operation Warp Speed—that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history.”The full letter may be found here. Text is below. March 4, 2021The Honorable Joseph R. BidenPresident of the United States of America1600 Pennsylvania AvenueWashington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President,We write to ask that you protect American intellectual property against a scheme that would crush American jobs, end our progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, and worsen the pandemic.India, South Africa, and other countries are presenting a proposal at the World Trade Organization to waive all intellectual property rights for any innovation related to COVID-19. The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing COVID-19 vaccines.But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments we would be ending the progress—started under Operation Warp Speed—that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history. We are on pace to have the majority of Americans vaccinated in the next few months. In the face of historic success, why would we reverse the policies that delivered the innovations that will end the pandemic?Some countries believe that they would benefit from seizing America’s intellectual property, but this is mistaken. Waiving all rights to intellectual property would end the innovation pipeline and stop the development of new vaccines or boosters to address variants in the virus. It also wouldn’t increase the supply of vaccines because of the tremendous time and resources needed to build new manufacturing plants and acquire the knowhow to produce these complex medicines. Even if the waiver may—temporarily—result in a few copycats attempting to produce what American companies developed, it would introduce major quality control problems. Before long, people would lose faith in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Even worse, a post-development elimination of innovation rights would greatly reduce our ability to respond to future pandemics.As a global leader and a force for good, we can do a lot to help other countries overcome the virus. But destroying our rights to intellectual property wouldn’t advance our mission of fighting the virus—it would make the problem worse, for America and for the world.The end of this pandemic is in sight. More than 50 million Americans have been vaccinated, and cases have declined by more than 75% from their recent high. We stand ready to work with you to bring an end to this deadly crisis and urge you to take a strong stand against this scheme that would halt our progress.###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Impact Payments Background: On December
27, President Trump signed legislation providing emergency financial relief for
Americans during the pandemic. In part, this legislation provides a
direct payment to most Americans. If you’ve filed a tax return in recent years,
are a disabled veteran, or a Social Security or disability beneficiary, you are
likely eligible for a payment. The Treasury Department has already begun
sending out direct deposits, checks, and debit cards to eligible individuals.Eligibility:
All
U.S. residents are eligible as long as they have a work-eligible Social
Security Number and meet certain income requirements. Individuals whose income
is entirely from non-taxable, means-tested programs—such as Supplemental
Security Income benefits—are eligible as well. Click here to calculate how much assistance you will
receiveFor
Individual Filers: Americans who file their taxes as individuals will receive up to $600
in assistance. If your income was less than $75,000 in 2019, you will receive
the full amount of $600. Reduced
checks on a sliding scale will be paid to individuals making over
$75,000. For every $100 you make
over $75,000, your assistance will be reduced by $5.For Married
Couples Filing Jointly: Americans who file taxes jointly will receive up to $1,200 plus $600
for every dependent under the age of 17. If your joint income was less than
$150,000 in 2019, you will receive the full amount of $1,200 plus $600 for every
dependent under 17.  Reduced checks on a sliding scale will be paid
to couples making over $150,000,. For every $100 you make over $150,000, your assistance will be reduced
by $5.For
Heads of Household: Americans who file taxes as heads of household will receive up to
$600 plus $600 for every dependent under the age of 17. If your income was less
than $112,500 in 2019, you will receive the full amount of $600 plus $600 for
every dependent under 17.  Reduced checks on a sliding scale will
be paid to those making above $112,500,. For every $100 you make over $112,500, your assistance will
be reduced by $5. Past-Due Debts: Payments are protected from
federal debt collection, bank garnishment, or levy by private creditors or debt
collectors.Common Questions and Answers  How
will I receive my financial relief?In
most cases, no action will be required in order to receive your payment. The
federal government will disburse payment either through direct deposit, debit
card, or check, depending on what information you have on file.  When
will I receive my financial relief?  Turnaround
time will vary by individual/family unit, but the Treasury Department has
already begun distribution of direct deposits, debit cards, and checks. Does
my income impact my tax rebate check?Yes,
the credit phases out at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income, starting
at $75,000 for individuals. This phase-out rate begins at $112,500 for heads of
household and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.  What tax year will be used to determine my income?Your 2019 income will be used to determine your eligibility.  Do
I need a Social Security Number to receive payment?In
general, taxpayers without an eligible Social Security Number are ineligible
for payment. However, married couples filing jointly, in which one spouse has a
Social Security Number and one does not, are eligible for a payment of $600, in
addition to $600 per child with Social Security Number.    What
about Social Security beneficiaries?The
Treasury Department will issue payments for Social Security Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income
recipients, Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries, and Veterans
Administration beneficiaries based on information provided by the Social
Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Veterans
Administration, respectively.  Do
I have to pay taxes on these payments?No. Do
I need to have income to be eligible for payment?No.Am
I eligible for payments if I’m classified as a dependent?Individuals
claimed as dependents are not eligible for payments. The individual or couple
who claims a dependent on their tax return is eligible for $600 per dependent
under 17.   I
am in debt, can this money be garnished or seized?Payments
are not subject to administrative offset for past due federal or state debts.
Additionally, payments are protected from bank garnishment or levy by private
creditors or debt collectors.  Will
people receive a paper check or a debit card?
For
those who don’t receive a direct deposit by early January, they should watch
their mail for either a paper check or a debit card. To speed delivery of the
payments, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, part of the Treasury Department,
will be sending a limited number of payments out by debit card. Please note
that the form of payment for the second mailed EIP may be different than for
the first mailed EIP. Some people who received a paper check last time might
receive a debit card this time, and some people who received a debit card last
time may receive a paper check. IRS and Treasury urge eligible people who don’t
receive a direct deposit to watch their mail carefully during this period for a
check or an Economic Impact Payment card.  Federal

Where do I apply for unemployment?Arkansans can apply for unemployment at the Arkansas Department of
Workforce Services. Their website is https://www.dws.arkansas.gov/employers/ar-claim-help/
and their phone number is 501-682-2121. When will the $300 bonus weekly unemployment checks restart?The weekly bonus will start December 26, 2020, and last until
March 14, 2021. This 11-week extension also has an overflow period that lasts
until April 5, 2021. This means a person who finds themselves unemployed in
early 2021 will receive an additional three weeks of aid. All additional
federal benefits will end on April 5, 2021 and return to the previous
unemployment insurance system.  Would the $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit be retroactive?The $300 additional weekly benefit will only be available for the
week of December 26, 2020 and going forward.   How are the unemployment benefits calculated?The Arkansas Division of Workforce Services determines the amount
of unemployment insurance each Arkansan receives based on their gross income.
The $300 federal weekly benefit is added on top of that sum. The average in
Arkansas is $220 per week, making the average weekly benefit under this program
$550 per week.  Do I qualify for unemployment benefits?
A general rule is that you should apply if you've lost your job or
been furloughed through no fault of your own. This would include a job lost
directly or indirectly because of the pandemic. Additionally, if you are
self-employed or an independent contractor experiencing job loss, you may be
eligible. Arkansans can contact the Arkansas Division of Workforce Services to
determine eligibility. Their website is https://www.dws.arkansas.gov/employers/ar-claim-help/
and their phone number is 501-682-2121.Paycheck
Protection Program Round 2Background: On December 27, President Trump signed legislation providing
emergency financial relief for Americans during the pandemic. Part of
that legislative package included a second round of Paycheck Protection Program
(PPP) funds that will allow eligible small businesses and nonprofits to apply
for forgivable loans. These funds can be used to keep employees on payroll and
provide money for eligible expenses. Interested Borrowers/Lenders: If you are a potential borrower
interested in participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, you should
contact your financial institution and ask if they are a Small Business

Protection Program. If so, they can help assist you through this process. If
you would like to find an approved SBA lender or if you are a financial
institution interested in participating in the program, you can contact the Small Business
Administration Arkansas District Office at (501) 324-7379. Borrower Eligibility: The bill defines eligibility for loans as small businesses,

primarily engaged in advocacy or lobbying activities are ineligible. Businesses
organized in China or Hong Kong or with a 20% or greater ownership stake by
individuals in China or Hong Kong are ineligible. Lender
Eligibility: This legislation
provides authority to all current SBA 7(a) lenders who make these loans to
small businesses. It also provides that same authority to lenders who join the
program and make these loans. The SBA Administrator and the Treasury Secretary
can authorize additional lenders they deem to have the necessary qualifications
to process, close, disburse, and service these loans. Eligible

QuestionsWho
is eligible for a second PPP loan?Small
businesses, some nonprofit organizations, self-employed workers and independent
contractors are among those eligible, provided they have 300 employees or less
and can demonstrate they experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts during a
quarter in 2020 compared with the same quarter in 2019. First-time PPP
borrowers will be subject to the program’s original eligibility rules.  How
much is a business eligible for?The
maximum for second-draw loans is $2 million. Second-time PPP borrowers will
generally be eligible to borrow an amount equal to 2½ times their average
monthly payroll costs. A notable exception: Applicants in the accommodation and
food services industries, as designated by the Small Business Administration,
are eligible for loans that amount to 3½ times their average monthly payroll.  What
are the forgiveness requirements? Borrowers
are required to spend at least 60% of the funds on payroll to receive full
forgiveness. The other 40% may be used on eligible costs. These costs include
certain mortgage expenses, rent and utility payments. The bill expands
forgivable expenses to include expenditures for personal protective equipment
and other gear to protect workers; supplier costs; operations expenditures,
such as software; and property damage costs due to public disturbances during
2020. What
can you include in calculating PPP loan amount?Payroll
costs consist of employee compensation (whose principal place of residence is
the United States) in the form of salary, wages, commissions, or similar
compensation; cash tips or the equivalent (based on employer records of past
tips or, in the absence of such records, a reasonable, good-faith employer
estimate of such tips); payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or
sick leave; allowance for separation or dismissal; payment for the provision of
employee benefits consisting of group health care coverage, including insurance
premiums, and retirement; payment of state and local taxes assessed on
compensation of employees. Owner-employee
compensation replacement (if not a W-2 employee which would be included in
above) is based on 2019 Schedule C net profits, line 31. Divide that number by
12 and multiply that number by 2.5 which is 10 weeks worth of net profits for
2019.  Non-employer
PPP loans are calculated solely from 2019 Schedule C (or Schedule F) net
profits (as above). The maximum loan amount for non-employer borrowers is
$20,833. Where
do I apply?PPP
loans are backed by the SBA but issued by financial institutions, such as
banks, credit unions, fintech companies, and community lenders. Interested
businesses should call their financial institution to see if they are
participating. SBA figures show 5,460 lenders were participating when PPP
closed in August. When
will the program reopen?The
bill requires the SBA to establish regulations on small-business support no
later than 10 days after the legislation is signed into law. That would mean
the program should be operational by the second week in January.  Will
I be able to deduct money from PPP on my taxes when used for eligible expenses?Yes,
the bill changed IRS rules to allow for money received through PPP to qualify
for tax deductions.  How
is the loan forgiven?Eligible
entitites will submit forgiveness applications through their financial
institutions once the covered period for their loan has expired. The bill
provides a simplified forgiveness process for PPP loans under $150,000.
Borrowers in this category will need to complete a one-page certification
attesting they complied with program requirements, along with providing other
information.  How
is the 25% reduction in revenues calculated?Business
owners will compare gross receipts of the business before expenses are
subtracted. They will compare those for any quarter in 2020 to the same quarter
in 2019 to determine if revenues decreased by at least 25%.  What
if you weren’t in business all of 2019?  A
business must have been in operation by Feb. 15, 2020 to be eligible.If
you were not in business during the first or second quarter of 2019 but you
were in business in the third and fourth quarter of 2019, then you may compare
any quarter in 2020 with the third or fourth quarter of 2019
to determine whether gross receipts were reduced by at least 25%.  If
you were not in business during the first, second, or third quarter of 2019,
but you were in business in the fourth quarter of 2019, then you may compare
any quarter in 2020 with the fourth quarter of 2019 to determine whether gross
receipts were reduced by at least 25%. A
business that wasn’t in business in 2019 but was in business before February
15, 2020 will compare gross receipts from the second, third or fourth quarter
of 2020 to that first quarter of 2020 to determine whether gross receipts were
reduced by at least 25%.  Reminder
the first quarter runs January 1 – March 31, the second quarter runs from April
1 – June 30, the third quarter runs from July 1- Sept 30, and the fourth
quarter runs from October 1 – December 31st.  What
other forms of small-business aid are available? ·     
Live Venue
Grants: The legislation
provides $15 billion for the SBA to make grants to live venue operators, such
as theaters and live performing arts organizations. ·     
EIDL Loans: This legislation also provides $20 billion
for advance grants for applicants to the SBA’s economic-injury disaster loan
program. Small businesses and nonprofits in low-income communities that
received these grants and any small business or nonprofit that received an EIDL
advance previously are eligible to receive the full $10,000 if their award was
less than $10,000 in the first round of grants. ·     
SBA 7(a) Loans: The bill extends a provision that pays the
principal and interest on behalf of borrowers that have certain SBA loans, such
as 7(a) loans, the agency’s flagship loan offering. It also provides support
for the 7(a) program by increasing the amount of the SBA’s guarantee for
lenders.·     
Employee
Retention Tax Credit: The bill extends
the Employee Retention Tax Credit to July 1, 2021 and increases the fully
refundable portion of qualified wages from 50% to 70%. Employers are now able to
participate in both the Employee Retention Tax Credit and in the PPP. ·     
Extension of Paid
Leave Credits: The bill extends
refundable payroll tax credits through March 31, 2021. These credits are no
longer mandated, but but owners can still take advantage of the tax credit
until March 31st. The bill also allows self-employed individuals to use their
average daily self-employment income from 2019, rather than 2020, for purposes
of computing these credits. ·     
Pandemic
Unemployment Assistance: Extends the
Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, which provides continued
unemployment assistance to the self-employed, freelancers, gig workers,
part-time workers and other individuals in non-traditional employment. It also
increases the number of weeks of PUA benefits an individual may claim, from 39
to 50.
·     
Grants for
Passenger Transportation: $2 billion in
grants from the Department of the Treasury for passenger transportation
services, including the bus, motor coach, and passenger vessel industry.  Emergency Rental Assistance Background: On December 27, President Trump signed
legislation providing emergency financial relief for Americans during the
pandemic. This legislation provides $25 billion in assistance for
struggling renters through Treasury Department disbursements to U.S.
territories, tribes, and cities. This legislation also extends the CDC eviction
moratorium for an additional month, through January 31, 2021.Distribution of funds: Arkansas, as with all states, will
receive a minimum of $200 million through this program. Local jurisdictions
with a population greater than 200,000 may also apply directly to the Treasury
Department for additional emergency funding. Any amounts granted to local
jurisdictions will be reduced from the total amount granted to the state.Eligibility: An eligible household must meet all the
following criteria:1.    
Qualifies for unemployment, or has experienced a
reduction in household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced pandemic-related
financial hardship.2.    
Demonstrates a risk of experiencing homelessness or
housing instability.3.    
Has a household income at or below 80% of the area
median.Households deemed eligible may receive up to 12 months of
assistance, plus an additional three months if necessary. Grantees have
flexibility to devise additional eligibility criteria at their discretion. Grantees
can only commit to assistance in three-month intervals, after which point an
eligible household must re-apply for funds. Grantees may not make commitments
for prospective rent payments to an eligible household unless assistance has
also been provided to reduce that household’s overdue payments. Application prioritization: Grantees shall prioritize
consideration of applications for eligible households that are at or below 50%
of the area median income, or where one or more members of the household has
been unemployed for 90 days or longer.
Applying for relief: Applications for rental
assistance may be made directly to a grantee by either an eligible household or
by a landlord on behalf of that eligible household. In general, grantees will
provide funds directly to landlords and/or utility service providers. If a
landlord does not wish to participate, the grantee may provide funds directly
to eligible households. Arkansans who are interested in applying for rental
assistance should contact their Arkansas Community Action Agency. Information

The letter may be found here. Full text may be found at the bottom of this release.Cosigners of the letter include: Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Kelly Loeffler (R-Georgia), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), John Thune (R-South Dakota), Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), and Todd Young (R-Indiana). Background:  January 14, 2021 The Honorable Jovita CarranzaAdministratorU.S. Small Business Administration409 3rd St, SWWashington DC 20416 Dear Administrator Carranza,We write to urge you to take precautions so that affiliates of Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest and most notorious abortion provider, do not receive loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as they did earlier this year in defiance of the law.The coronavirus relief package Congress passed on December 21 authorizes a second round of PPP loans for certain small businesses and non-profits that received and fully spent a PPP loan earlier this year. Eligibility requirements for these “second-draw” loans are similar to the requirements for initial loans authorized under the CARES Act. Generally speaking, applicants for the initial waves of PPP loans had to employ no more than 500 employees across all of their affiliates in order to be eligible for a loan; applicants for a second-draw loan must have no more than 300 employees across all of their affiliates. As before, applicants for a second-draw loan must self-certify that they are eligible to receive such a loan; the Small Business Administration has written that “incorrect or false eligibility certifications by borrowers are subject to severe penalties.”Planned Parenthood employs about 16,000 people nationwide. The group’s national organization, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, jealously exercises control over local affiliates, subjecting them to uniform bylaws, accreditation, frequent reviews, and mandates about what services they must provide to remain part of the Federation, such as on-site abortion. Planned Parenthood affiliates thus are ineligible to receive PPP loans, as part of an affiliated group that employs far more people than the number allowed for an initial or second-draw PPP loan. This fact was admitted by none other than Planned Parenthood’s political-action committee, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which wrote that the CARES Act “gives the Small Business Administration broad discretion to exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates and other non-profits serving people with low incomes and deny them benefits under the new small business loan program.”Nonetheless, at least 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates illegally obtained more than $80 million in taxpayer funds during the initial rounds of PPP by self-certifying their eligibility for the program. In response, the SBA determined that these affiliates were ineligible to receive PPP loans and issued letters informing them of the consequences of false certifications of eligibility, including repayment of loans, loss of loan forgiveness, and other civil and criminal penalties. Members of this body previously have urged you to investigate these false certifications of eligibility, recover the more than $80 million in funds, and seek appropriate penalties against Planned Parenthood affiliates that broke the law.An equally urgent task is to ensure Planned Parenthood affiliates do not receive additional PPP loans intended for struggling small businesses and non-profits. We therefore urge you to inform participating lenders that Planned Parenthood affiliates are ineligible to receive second-draw PPP loans, and encourage them to immediately notify SBA if a Planned Parenthood affiliate applies for such a loan through their institution. Furthermore, we urge you to refer any Planned Parenthood affiliate that applies for such a loan to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Planned Parenthood affiliates are well aware that they are ineligible to receive PPP loans, on the basis of SBA’s letters and the frank admission of their political-action committee. Their attempts to apply for PPP loans are naked attempts to defraud the United States government.Thank you for your tireless efforts to help small businesses and non-profits survive the Covid-19 pandemic. With appropriate precautions, we can ensure that additional relief funds go to those that need it, in accordance with the law, rather than to unscrupulous organizations like Planned Parenthood.Sincerely,###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Last week, I opposed the effort to reject certified electoral votes for the same reason—fidelity to the Constitution—I now oppose impeachment proceedings against a former president.Congress and the executive branch should concentrate entirely for the next week on conducting a safe and orderly transfer of power. After January 20, Congress should get on with the people’s business: improving our vaccination efforts, getting kids back to school, and getting workers back on the job.”###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Today, insurrectionists occupied our Capitol. Fortunately, the Capitol Police and other law-enforcement agencies restored order without the need for federal troops. But the principle remains the same: no quarter for insurrectionists. Those who attacked the Capitol today should face the full extent of federal law. It’s past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence. And the senators and representatives who fanned the flames by encouraging the president and leading their supporters to believe that their objections could reverse the election results should withdraw those objections. In any event, the Congress will complete its constitutional responsibilities tonight.” ###nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"
