https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-introduces-bipartisan-resolution-increasing-pressure-to-halt-us-security-assistance-to-azerbaijan,"WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today introduced a bipartisan Senate Resolution condemning Azerbaijani forces’ illegal and unprovoked assault on Armenian territory and calling for the United States to immediately halt all security assistance to Azerbaijan.  The bipartisan Resolution, which follows Azerbaijani forces’ recent escalation of hostilities against Armenia, calls on President Biden to make a formal determination regarding whether Azerbaijani officials must be subject to sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The effort also calls for the Department of State to meet all statutorily required reporting requirements for consideration of U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan following the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) recent report which found the government has continued to make exceptions to bypass a 1992 law banning most U.S. military assistance to Azerbaijan without the mandatory reporting and justification requirements required by law.  “Azerbaijan’s renewed assault on Armenian territory and callous targeting of civilian infrastructure is a horrifying show of disregard for human life,” Chairman Menendez said. “As communities across the region, including in Kapan, Goris, Jermuk, Vardenis, and Tchakaten suffer at the hands of the Aliyev regime, the United States must match our words of support with robust action for the people of Armenia. With this resolution, we are making it clear that it is a national security imperative for the U.S. government to do the right thing and once and for all halt security assistance to Azerbaijan.”  Joining Menendez in introducing the Resolution was Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Today’s Resolution follows Chairman Menendez’s letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken in which he urged the Biden administration to take additional measures to stand with the Armenian people as they attempt to repel Azerbaijan’s renewed military aggression.  “As we bear witness to Azerbaijan’s most recent attack, the Administration must not to minimize the Azerbaijani assault in an effort to appear impartial. President Biden said in his 2022 State of the Union Address, ‘…when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos,’” Chairman Menendez wrote. “The United States has an important opportunity to stand with the Armenian people as they attempt to repel an authoritarian assault.”   Find a copy of the Senate Resolution here.Find a copy of the letter here.

Menendez. “This grant funding will help support the state’s efforts in battling this epidemic through treatment and prevention as we work to lower the number of lives lost to opioids.”“The opioid epidemic has taken a devastating toll on all New Jersey communities,” said Sen. Booker. “This federal funding will expand our ability to tackle this crisis head-on and offer those facing addiction the resources they need.”Specifically, New Jersey’s Opioid Response Grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is designed to provide states flexible funding to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in the ways that meet the needs of their state, with a focus on providing evidence-based treatment, including medication-assisted treatment.According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, more than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2021, an increase of more than 15 percent from 2020.“Every American deserves access to culturally responsive prevention, treatment, and recovery services and supports,” said Miriam E. Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA. “SAMHSA remains committed to fighting overdose and to reminding the nation that there is hope – treatment is effective and recovery is possible.”See moreDecember 27, 2022

From his time in the State Legislature to Congressman and then Governor, he led with intellect, passion, and dedication for New Jersey’s working families. “His work on issues ranging from education, transportation, and the environment has had meaningful impacts on families and communities across the nation. And it’s because of his Superfund Law, which he authored as a Congressman, that we are able to clean up hazardous waste sites here in New Jersey and throughout America.“I appreciate the many years that I had the privilege to work alongside Governor Florio. And I know because of his decades of public service, New Jerseyans and Americans will benefit for generations to come.

The senators’ calls reflect the FFM’s critical nature in responding to the Maduro regime’s systematic violations of human rights in Venezuela, including its methods of social, political, and economic manipulation and control, which have driven at least 6.8 million people to flee the country. “It is our view that the scale, intensity, and persistence of the Maduro regime’s behavior must be investigated and held accountable alongside those in power in Burma, Russia, and Syria—all of whom are currently being investigated by a Commission of Inquiry,” the senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “The Venezuela FFM’s important work must continue. In the face of the growing exodus of refugees and migrants from the country, the mission must be able to fully investigate and build a credible body of information documenting the regime’s crimes against the Venezuelan people. By elevating the mission to a Commission of Inquiry, it would accomplish this goal.” Find a copy of the letter HERE and below. Dear Secretary Blinken, We are writing to request your support in renewing the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Venezuela (FFM) when its mandate expires on 27 September 2022. We would also like to request that the Department, through the U.S. mission to the United Nations, take steps to elevate the FFM to a Commission of Inquiry (COI). It is our view that the scale, intensity, and persistence of the Maduro regime’s behavior must be investigated and held accountable alongside those in power in Burma, Russia, and Syria—all of whom are currently being investigated by a Commission of Inquiry. The Venezuela FFM is a critical tool in responding to the Maduro regime’s systematic violations of human rights in Venezuela. The FFM, established in September 2019, has developed and implemented a rigorous methodology for investigating the regime’s gross violations of human rights, including extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention.  It has determined that the regime has decimated the independence of Venezuela’s judicial system, enabling State-sponsored repression. The Venezuela FFM has concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Maduro regime has committed crimes against humanity. During a September 15 Senate Foreign Relations hearing on Venezuela, Assistant Secretary Nichols confirmed this assessment, stating that the Maduro regime has committed crimes against humanity. The Venezuela FFM’s important work must continue. In the face of the growing exodus of refugees and migrants from the country, the mission must be able to fully investigate and build a credible body of information documenting the regime’s crimes against the Venezuelan people. By elevating the mission to a Commission of Inquiry, it would accomplish this goal. The Venezuelan crisis has surpassed Syria’s and is now the second largest refugee and migration crisis in the world. The Maduro regime’s methods of social, political, and economic manipulation and control, including through its systemic violations of human rights, have prompted 6.8 million people to flee the country, including at least 660,000 people who have fled since July 2022, according to UN reporting. I thank you for the Department’s ongoing support for the Venezuelan people, and urge your close attention to and action in advancing accountability and respect for human rights in Venezuela.   Sincerely,See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-join-colleagues-in-urging-president-biden-to-eliminate-puerto-rico-cost-share-for-fema-hurricane-relief-assistance,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both-D-N.J.) joined several of their Senate colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden asking for the federal government to waive any local cost-share for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aid to Puerto Rico.On September 18, 2022, Hurricane Fiona made landfall in Puerto Rico, cutting off power to the entire island and leaving many areas under water. That same day, President Biden approved an emergency declaration to authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA to work in coordination on disaster relief efforts. Just yesterday, President Biden granted the request to issue a Major Disaster Declaration, a day after Sen. Menendez and Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.-07) led a bicameral push requesting this important step to unlock the flow of federal resources to the island.Public Assistance grants issued by FEMA require that states and territories shoulder a share of the cost of recovery. While these cost-share requirements can be adjusted to lighten the state or territory’s burden, this has not yet been done for Puerto Rico.“In light of the continued concerning news about the devastation the hurricane has wrought on the island, which has prompted Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to announce his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities, as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by the island, we write to urge you to waive the local cost-sharing requirements by setting the federal cost-share at 100% for Public Assistance grants issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Puerto Rico,” wrote the lawmakers.Sens. Menendez and Booker are long-time supporters of the people of Puerto Rico, and they have been ardent advocates for ensuring the federal government fully supports Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in their continued recovery efforts since Hurricane Maria devastated the islands five years ago. The Senators are now playing an active role as Puerto Rico works to recover from Hurricane Fiona.Sen. Menendez visited Puerto Rico in 2017 to survey the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria and continually fought to hold Trump Administration officials accountable for botched recovery efforts. He led efforts to extend a foreclosure moratorium for FHA insured mortgages in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, which would have put struggling families at risk of homelessness, and held FEMA accountable for cutting off federal assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures in Puerto Rico. In 2019, Sen. Menendez and his colleagues also called on the inspector general to review FEMA’s faltering efforts to rebuild Vieques’ health care facility divested by Hurricane Maria, and last year reintroduced legislation to ensure Vieques receives the federal assistance needed to help it rebuild.In addition to Sens. Menendez and Booker, the letter was signed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear President Biden: Thank you for swiftly declaring an emergency in Puerto Rico resulting from Hurricane Fiona,1 and for acting swiftly to surge federal support to the island.2 In light of the continued concerning news about the devastation the hurricane has wrought on the island, which has prompted Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi to announce his request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities,3 as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by the island, we write to urge you to waive the local cost-sharing requirements by setting the federal cost-share at 100% for Public Assistance grants issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was already facing an extremely challenging financial situation before Hurricane Maria struck five years ago this week. That hurricane and its aftermath, along with a failed federal response, resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. citizens.4 The island’s economic challenges mounted, and Puerto Rico still has not fully recovered. Now, Hurricane Fiona deals another blow to U.S. citizens who need urgent federal support. We are concerned that Puerto Rico will have difficulty covering the 25% local match, which could delay access to federal assistance for removing debris and making emergency repairs to public facilities and infrastructure. The President has statutory authority, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, to reduce or eliminate the local cost-share requirement following major disasters.5 This has been done in the past.6 We strongly urge you to take this step now, and not to allow the cost-share to impede the provision of maximum help to those in need. Thank you for your attention to this urgent request. Sincerely,###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-calls-on-big-bank-ceos-to-eliminate-overdraft-fees-on-working-families,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee today questioned the CEOs of Wells Fargo & Company, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Truist, U.S. Bancorp and PNC on the effects of overdraft fees on low-income and minority communities and called for their elimination as part of the committee’s yearly oversight hearing of the largest banks in the U.S. “A 2021 report by the Financial Health Network found that nearly 60% of all overdraft fees in 2020 were paid by low and moderate-income households and 25% were paid by Latino households specifically,” said Sen. Menendez. “Your banks made $64 billion collectively last quarter, so it’s clear to me that there is no reasonable explanation to charge overdraft fees on working families.”Sen. Menendez also pressed the bank CEOs about what the financial institutions are doing, if anything, to protect consumers from Zelle-related fraud and scams.“I’ve heard story after story from New Jersey constituents who have fallen victim to scams and fraud on Zelle, and in many instances, banks have denied their customers relief,” added Sen. Menendez. “It’s clear that consumers are slipping through the cracks of Regulation E, and detailed information from the banks will tell us what needs to be done to strengthen it. Your banks created this tool and it is your responsibility to make sure it is safe to use.”The Senator concluded by pushing Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf on why the bank has disproportionately rejected refinancing applications from African-American and Hispanic homeowners, and questioned the other banks on why they fail to encourage more minority borrowers to go through the full refinancing application process.“Mr. Scharf, in March Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo disproportionately rejected refinancing applications from African-American and Hispanic homeowners. You and I had an opportunity [to meet] and one of the things you told me in response to my questions was partially due to the fact that Wells encourages more minority borrowers to go through the full application process while some of your competitors turn them away at an earlier stage”, concluded Sen. Menendez. “The Latino community [has a] $2 trillion domestic marketplace impact already and it will continue to grow exponentially, but it needs to be treated fairly in the process.”Sen. Menendez has been a leader in the fight to hold the financial industry accountable. In July, Sen. Menendez led a letter to the banks that own Zelle’s parent company – including J.P. Morgan, Chase & Co., Bank of America, and Wells Fargo – pressing them for more information about what, if anything, the financial institutions are doing to protect consumers from fraud and scams on Zelle. Sen. Menendez has also long led the charge in the Senate for consumer protections – ranging from banks, data breach protections for consumers, to cyber security, and more. In 2014, Sen. Menendez crafted legislation following the monumental Target data breach in 2013, where he called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect American consumers.###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Arrested outside of his home in Moscow in April 2022 following a CNN interview in which he criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kara-Murza remains in prison on trumped-up charges including spreading “false” information about the Russian military. “The ongoing imprisonment of Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, which we assess is based on fabricated and politically-motivated charges, suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of his internationally recognized human rights,” the senators wrote. “[His] advocacy, as well as his opposition to the Russian Federation’s illegal war in Ukraine, are likely the primary reasons for his current wrongful imprisonment. Furthermore, one of the pending charges against Mr. Kara-Murza pertains to his participation in a conference in support of Russian political prisoners, which could suggest that the Russian government targeted him for his defense of their human rights.  Consistent with the legislation, the President must inform Congress whether or not he intends to sanction parties under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act for their complicity in wrongfully targeting Mr. Kara-Murza.  “We request that you make determinations regarding whether any foreign person is responsible for any such violations related to Mr. Kara-Murza, and if so, regarding the imposition of sanctions, consistent with the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act,” the senators added. “Our expectation is that in making your determination you will consider any relevant information, including with respect to all relevant officials and law enforcement in the Russian Federation.”  Find a copy of the letter HERE and below. Dear Mr. President: The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act requires the President, upon receipt of a request from the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, to determine whether a foreign person has engaged in a “gross violation of internationally recognized human rights” against an individual who “expose[s] illegal activity carried out by government officials” or “obtain[s], exercise[s], defend[s], or promote[s] internationally recognized human rights and freedoms,” such as freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. The President must, no later than 120 days after receiving such a request, make such a determination and submit a report with respect to it, which includes a statement of whether or not the President will impose or intends to impose sanctions with respect to the person. The ongoing imprisonment of Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, which we assess is based on fabricated and politically-motivated charges, suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of his internationally recognized human rights. Mr. Kara-Murza has a long history of holding human rights abusers accountable, including through his advocacy for the passage and implementation of the original Magnitsky Act, as well as the Global Magnitsky Act. We believe this history of defending and promoting human rights may have motivated assassination attempts against Mr. Kara-Murza in 2015 and 2017.  This advocacy, as well as his opposition to the Russian Federation’s illegal war in Ukraine, are likely the primary reasons for his current wrongful imprisonment. Furthermore, one of the pending charges against Mr. Kara-Murza pertains to his participation in a conference in support of Russian political prisoners, which could suggest that the Russian government targeted him for his defense of their human rights.  We request that you make determinations regarding whether any foreign person is responsible for any such violations related to Mr. Kara-Murza, and if so, regarding the imposition of sanctions, consistent with the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Our expectation is that in making your determination you will consider any relevant information, including with respect to all relevant officials and law enforcement in the Russian Federation.   We look forward to your response. Sincerely,See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-brown-warren-hold-wells-fargo-accountable-for-conducting-misleading-interviews-with-women-and-minority-candidates,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today sent a letter to Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf and Senior Vice President Bei Ling to express their deep concerns about the bank’s reported practice of conducting “fake interviews” with women and minority candidates after already filling vacancies. This effort comes ahead of today’s much anticipated Banking Committee hearing with the leaders of some of the largest banks in America.“According to The New York Times, Wells Fargo undertakes these fake interviews to artificially boost diversity statistics in an attempt to satisfy an internal goal to interview at least one woman and one person of color for each open position—a goal that was meant to increase diversity among Wells Fargo’s workforce,” wrote the Senators. “The information uncovered by [the reporting] is not only highly offensive and suggestive of systemic bias and discrimination at the bank, but also may represent a pattern of misleading shareholders and federal and state regulators in oversight of Wells Fargo’s execution of nondiscrimination laws and broader, public commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.”The Senators pointed out this is not the first time the financial institution has been subject to criticism over discriminatory hiring and employment practices. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Labor alleged that Wells Fargo discriminated against 30,000 Black applicants and hundreds of women in its hiring process – the case was later settled for $8 million. In 2013, approximately 320 Black financial advisers filed a class-action lawsuit against the company alleging Wells Fargo steered them away from new lucrative opportunities. This case was settled for $36 million.“Given this history […] we are concerned that Wells Fargo does not take seriously its responsibilities and commitments to federal and state regulators, to its shareholders, and to the customers and communities that it serves,” added the Senators.The Senators also expressed concerns with Wells Fargo’s response to The New York Times’ reporting. Instead of working to actually set up a fair and equitable hiring process that would lead to a more diverse workforce, the bank considered allowing hiring managers to seek exemptions from its own diversity interviewing goals altogether.\“…[I]f hiring managers can more easily opt out of its goals, diverse candidates may be considered less often for open positions. Additionally, Wells Fargo recently announced that it agreed to a third-party racial-equity audit after years of urging shareholders to vote against such audits. While these are potentially good first steps, Wells Fargo should take more immediate action to rebuild confidence in its recruitment, application, interview, and hiring processes,” concluded the Senators.The Senators have long worked to improve diversity in the financial services sector and to protect consumers from unfair practices at the biggest financial institutions. Last October, Sen. Menendez led a letter signed by 21 Senate Democrats calling on the SEC to expeditiously adopt the AMAC’s recommendations to increase diversity among asset managers. The Senator also led the charge to further diversify corporate America by authoring the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2021, legislation that would address shortcomings in the SEC’s diversity disclosure rule by requiring public companies to disclose information related to the racial, gender, ethnic makeup and veteran status of corporate boards and senior management.Over the last couple of months, Sen. Menendez, alongside Sen. Warren, Chairman Brown and several other colleagues, have been holding big banks accountable for widespread fraud and scams on Zelle, a money transfer app that is owned by seven of the U.S.’s largest banks including J.P. Morgan, Chase & Co., Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Sen. Menendez recently led a letter to the banks that own Zelle’s parent company, Early Warning Systems, LLC, pressing them for more information about what, if anything, the banks are doing to protect consumers from being defrauded on Zelle.Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear Mr. Scharf and Ms. Ling,We write with deep concern regarding recent reports that Wells Fargo conducts “fake interviews” with women and minority candidates for positions that have already been filled.

Wells Fargo settled that case for $36 million.3 Given this history and the latest New York Times report, we are concerned that Wells Fargo does not take seriously its responsibilities and commitments to federal and state regulators, to its shareholders, and to the customers and communities that it serves.In response to The New York Times article, Wells Fargo said it will attempt to end fake interviews by allowing hiring managers to seek exemptions from the bank’s diverse interviewing goals altogether.4 However, if hiring managers can more easily opt out of its goals, diverse candidates may be considered less often for open positions. Additionally, Wells Fargo recently announced that it agreed to a third-party racial-equity audit after years of urging shareholders to vote against such audits.5 While these are potentially good first steps, Wells Fargo should take more immediate action to rebuild confidence in its recruitment, application, interview, and hiring processes. We ask that you please answer the following questions about Wells Fargo’s practices no later than October 13, 2022:The practice of interviewing candidates, particularly women and minority candidates, for previously filled positions is deeply insulting to qualified, and talented applicants that have the ability enrich and contribute to Wells Fargo. We hope you will take swift action to remedy this issue and identify meaningful steps to advance recruitment, hiring, and retention of diverse employees across the bank’s business lines and senior leadership.We look forward to your prompt response to our questions.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-announce-over-80-million-in-investments-for-nj-minority-serving-financial-institutions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a senior member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and Cory Booker, (both D-NJ), today announced a combined total of more than $80 million in investments for two New Jersey financial institutions from the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) to help serve traditionally underserved communities. First Bergen Federal Credit Union, a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) based in Hackensack was awarded $1,330,000. NMB Financial Corporation, a Minority Depository Institution (MDI) based in Fort Lee was awarded $79,062,000. “We know that our small and minority-owned businesses were some of the most severely impacted from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen. Menendez.  “These investments will help individuals and communities throughout our state of New Jersey to build back stronger by providing capital for vital affordable housing and community development projects.” “It is vital that we assist small and minority-owned businesses as they rebuild from the economic downturn caused by the public health crisis,” said Sen. Booker. “These investments will aid the efforts of community-based financial institutions to ensure businesses, especially in low-income and financially underserved communities, thrive.” “These essential funds provide opportunity to underserved communities across the country, helping them to regain their footing following the pandemic and strengthening their resilience against future shocks,” said Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s announcement is a significant step toward expanding access to the capital and services to rebuild and fuel long-term economic growth.” Established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, the ECIP was created to encourage low- and moderate-income community financial institutions to augment their efforts to support small businesses and consumers in their communities. Under the program, Treasury will provide up to $9 billion in capital directly to depository institutions that are certified CDFIs or MDIs to, among other things, provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities, that may be disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Treasury will set aside $2 billion for CDFIs and MDIs with less than $500 million in assets and an additional $2 billion for CDFIs and MDIs with less than $2 billion in assets.   Sen. Menendez has long led efforts to support the work of CDFIs and annually leads the CDFI Funding Appropriations Request Letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Last June, Sens. Menendez and Booker announced the awarding of $6,335,530 in federal funding to support several of New Jersey’s CDFIs and their efforts to spur economic activity in underserved communities that were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2020, Sen. Menendez introduced the Coronavirus CDFI Funding Act, which would have injected an additional billion dollars to the CDFI Fund to support low income, rural and urban communities affected by the pandemic. Over a decade ago, Sen. Menendez fought for the passage of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 which includes the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program which allows CDFIs to access long-term, low-cost capital to jumpstart economic growth and community development, all at no cost to taxpayers. ###See moreDecember 16, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/sfrc-chairman-menendez-celebrates-historic-approval-of-kigali-amendment-to-help-combat-climate-crisis-and-create-american-jobs,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today issued the statement below following the Senate’s approval of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Approved by a 69-27 vote, the Amendment represents a historic step forward in the fight against the climate crisis by phasing down use and production of highly potent greenhouse gas chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and promotes U.S. leadership in the manufacturing sector by improving American businesses’ access to global markets.  “There a few things we can do in the Senate that can create thousands of jobs, fight the climate crisis, and help us outcompete China. That is precisely what the approval of the Kigali Amendment does and we are all better for it.  The approval of the Kigali Amendment is the single most important climate action the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has taken in over thirty years.  “Today’s historic vote is yet another recognition that the climate threat to our planet is real. We see this from the unprecedented floods across Pakistan, to the wildfires in Central Europe and the Western United States. Our nation must continue to position itself to seize the opportunities that lie ahead as we tackle these challenges and meet our responsibilities – not only for future generations but also for the millions of Americans who care about shoring up our competitive advantage in global markets.  “Between approval of Kigali, passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we are showing that the United States government can and must continue to do the work needed to preserve OUR planet in which our grandchildren will flourish. I will continue to use the strength of my voice and the power of my office so Congress builds on this momentum to shift America towards a new, clean, sustainable energy, and a flourishing green economy built on smart growth that benefits all Americans.”  Background on the Kigali Amendment: On October 15, 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda, more than 170 countries negotiated an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to include a global phasedown of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). This amendment is referred to as the “Kigali Amendment.”   The Kigali Amendment phases down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have a greenhouse gas potential 8,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide, in a swift matter that will make a dramatic dent in U.S. carbon reduction goals. Scientists estimate that, when fully implemented, Kigali will reduce global temperatures by half a degree Celsius by the end of the century. According to industry estimates, Kigali will also generate 33,000 more manufacturing jobs in the United States, representing a total of $4.8 billion annually of increased exports and $12.5 billion of increased economic output per year. Background on the Montreal Protocol:  Under the Montreal Protocol, participating countries agreed to replace ozone-depleting products, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), found in refrigerants, aerosols, and solvents. As a result, there has been a 97 percent reduction in the global consumption of controlled ozone-depleting substances—with little, if any, economic disruption.  Approval of the “Kigali Amendment” is the fifth suite of technical updates to the Montreal Protocol all of which have enjoyed strong bipartisan support for the past 35 years.  See moreDecember 22, 2022

What we’re doing today will directly positively – if we adopt ratification – impact American workers, American businesses, and American consumers,” said Chairman Menendez. “There are few things that we do in the Senate than can improve our economy, create jobs, and meet the challenge of China in this one dimension . . . . [The Kigali Amendment] will help meet our challenge against China. It will create greater security at home. It will create greater prosperity.”  Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below.  “Madam President, I rise today to once again urge my Senate colleagues to take the bipartisan, practical, pro-manufacturing step of providing advice and consent to ratifying the Kigali Amendment.  Each of the four previous amendments to this treaty, the Montreal Protocol, have enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate and Kigali should be no different.  Our companies are clear. They want us to approve this treaty so that they can maximize their export potential of cutting-edge chemicals that they have pioneered.  They want us to approve the treaty. It will generate billions of dollars in economic activity and create thousands of jobs here at home in the United States.  They’re also clear that if we fail to ratify, they stand to lose.  They will be locked out of export markets in key products. American workers will suffer, which is why the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and impacted industries all support the action we are preparing to take.  Now, I’ve heard the concerns that some colleagues have raised about China and how it benefits from its antiquated status as a ‘developing country’ under the Montreal Protocol. Frankly, it’s a fair point to raise. But it should have no bearing on whether we join Kigali. The simple fact is whether we join Kigali or not has no impact on whether China is treated as a developing country. None. On the other hand, ratifying Kigali will have a major positive benefit for us because China has doubled down on yesterday's chemicals. And we, the United States, lead on all the alternatives. Joining Kigali will turn the world away from China and its companies and toward our competitive strength. It is good for the United States and our businesses, and it is bad for China. However, I also recognize the plain fact that China is no longer a developing country, and I agree that it should not enjoy advantages under the Montreal Protocol that it receives because of decisions made more than 30 years ago.  I’ve been a steadfast champion in addressing the challenges China presents as they are not as we hope for them to be. I led passage of the Strategic Competition Act, and my Taiwan Policy Act was recently voted out of the Foreign Relations Committee on an overwhelming bipartisan basis.  So I have no problem acknowledging that China no longer should qualify as a developing country. And for that reason, I support the Lee-Sullivan Amendment.  Madam President, the Senate’s constitutional role on treaties is both unique and vital. What we’re doing today will directly positively – if we adopt ratification – impact American workers, American businesses, and American consumers.  It will meet our challenge against China. It will create greater security at home. It will create greater prosperity. There are few things that we do in the Senate than can improve our economy, create jobs, and meet the challenge of China in this one dimension. For all of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support providing advice and consent for the Kigali Amendment after the Sullivan Amendment is considered. And with that, I yield the floor.” See moreDecember 19, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-crapo-celebrate-senate-passage-of-resolution-recognizing-september-as-national-prostate-cancer-awareness-month,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) applauded the unanimous passage of S. Res. 645 in recognition of September 2022 as “National Prostate Awareness Month”. Sens. Menendez and Crapo, authored the bipartisan resolution aimed at increasing awareness of prostate cancer, which is the most common cancer in American men, except for skin cancer. By recognizing this month as “National Prostate Awareness Month,” the Senate also encouraged all Americans to take part in efforts to increase early detection, improve treatment, and discover a cure for the disease.Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. (D-N.J.-10) sponsored the resolution in the House.“Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, yet it’s a highly preventable disease,” said Sen. Menendez. “Congress has a responsibility to promote awareness and encourage men across America to increase early detection and find better treatment, thereby increasing the survival rates of American men. Early detection is key to prostate cancer survival, and no one should think it’s too early to discuss testing options with their healthcare provider.""“Checkups and testing for prostate cancer can save lives if found early,”said Sen. Crapo. “Early screenings and warnings are vitally important to detecting and treating many other types of cancer as well.  Congress must use every avenue available to continue raising awareness about the risks and early screenings to combat prostate cancer.”“I am proud to introduce this resolution because prostate cancer is a major health problem and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths for African-American men nationwide,” said Rep. Payne. “In addition, prostate cancer will account for more than one-third of all new cancers in African-American men this year alone.  If we can raise awareness, we can encourage more Americans, especially African Americans, to get screened and get early treatments.  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Men’s Health Caucus and Colorectal Cancer Caucus, I am committed to raising awareness of this disease during National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month and encouraging more Americans to get regular prostate cancer screenings to catch this disease early and save lives.”In New Jersey, prostate cancer is the third leading cause of death to cancer among men. The American Cancer Society estimates 8,580 new prostate cancer cases and 750 deaths in 2022. ""Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is a key opportunity to ensure that every man knows his risk for prostate cancer, and how to take steps to catch the disease early.  Early detection saves lives,” said Jamie Bearse, President of ZERO - The End of Prostate Cancer. “Senators Menendez and Crapo have been stalwart champion of the cause - helping men and their families to fight prostate cancer - and we're proud to partner with them and our other champions in Congress during Prostate Cancer Awareness Month and all year long.""Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Angus King (D-Maine), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) Chris Coons (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) also sponsored the resolution. See moreDecember 27, 2022

Just days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds.“Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to President Biden.“Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged,” the lawmakers added. “FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the Trump Administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread power outages.“These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need,” concluded the lawmakers.Sens. Menendez, Schumer, Gillibrand, and Blumenthal, alongside Reps. Velázquez, Espaillat, Soto and others, joined advocates today outside the Senate steps to call for bold action to help the 3.2 million Americans in Puerto Rico.Joining Sen. Menendez and Rep. Velázquez in signing the letter were Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Sens.

We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster.Hurricane Fiona devastated the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds. The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout, leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours. Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure. In addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past Sunday.In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages. These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need. Given the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona.

It is about 3.2 million United States citizens who get treated differently than if they were on the mainland of the United States and that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable. It is un-American,” said Sen. Menendez. “Puerto Ricans put on the uniform of the United States and have served in every conflict in its history. The most decorated military unit, the Borinqueneers, actually got a Congressional Gold Medal. But, a gold medal means nothing if you don’t treat your fellow citizens in a way that has dignity and respect.”[CLICK HERE FOR THE SENATOR’S REMARKS]“Five years ago, I had a bipartisan CODEL to Puerto Rico to assess the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and unfortunately the Trump Administration canceled my military plane… thinking somehow I wouldn’t go. I got myself on a relief flight and I showed up in Puerto Rico,” added Sen. Menendez. “I still have the images today. I keep them on my phone. Hundreds of images of communities devastated, bridges washed out, homes destroyed. It reminds me every day.”“While this was supposed to be a commemoration, it actually is another call to action. But this time in addition to supporting, I am organizing an effort to send a clear message to the Administration to support a major disaster declaration when the Governor of Puerto Rico submits it, and I believe the Biden Administration will do that. It has already shown its willingness to support Puerto Ricans in tangible ways not with paper towels. They need our support, and they need it now. They need Congress to exercise its oversight [because] it doesn’t matter that [we] appropriate disaster money if it doesn’t end up going to the people of Puerto Rico. It doesn’t [matter if we don’t] create an energy grid that is resilient, so that whenever the next hurricane or natural disaster comes the lights stay on…The federal government has got to get its act together, and the government of Puerto Rico has to exercise efforts over those energy entities [on the island] to ensure relief for the Puerto Rican people. This is an all hands on deck [effort]…,” concluded Sen. Menendez.Sen. Menendez visited Puerto Rico in 2017, to survey the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria and continually fought to hold Trump Administration officials accountable for botched recovery efforts. The Senator led efforts to extend a foreclosure moratorium for FHA insured mortgages in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, which would have put struggling families at risk of homelessness, and held FEMA accountable for cutting off federal assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures in Puerto Rico. In 2019, Sen. Menendez and his colleagues also called on the inspector general to review FEMA’s faltering efforts to rebuild Vieques’ health care facility divested by Hurricane Maria, and last year reintroduced legislation to ensure Vieques receives the federal assistance needed to help it rebuild. ###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-velazquez-introduce-bicameral-resolution-on-the-fifth-year-anniversary-of-hurricane-marias-landfall-in-puerto-rico-us-virgin-islands,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, alongside Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.-07) today led ## colleagues in introducing a bicameral resolution marking the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s destruction in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This year’s anniversary comes as Category 1 Hurricane Fiona made landfall in the Caribbean, devastating Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic where widespread flooding and infrastructure damage has been already reported. There are currently hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans without power and water service, in addition to residents who have lost their homes as a result of the storm.Hurricane Maria is the second deadliest storm in United States history, with the official death toll standing at 2,975 victims, while some academic experts estimate the toll to be as high as 4,645. It is also the third most costly tropical cyclone in our country’s history, with damages estimated to have cost more than $98 billion. This storm resulted in the complete collapse of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and triggered physical and mental health, migration, housing and infrastructure crises that the island has continued to face in the years since the storm. The impact of this unprecedented natural tragedy was further exacerbated by the human-made tragedy of the Trump’s Administration response following Hurricane Maria.“As we remember those who lost everything during Hurricane Maria five years ago today, one of the most devastating weather phenomena to affect the United States, my heart breaks for the people of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic following the landfall of Hurricane Fiona,” said Sen. Menendez. “This most recent storm demonstrates why the United States must do everything in its power to support our fellow Americans on the island as they find themselves yet again having to rebuild during great uncertainty for the future. The people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands deserve to know that the full force of the federal government stands behind them as they work to build a stronger, more sustainable future for all. Unfortunately, we are just beginning to grapple with the extent of Hurricane Fiona’s damages. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. My colleagues and I stand ready to support the people of Puerto Rico with urgent resources and critical funding.”“Five years ago, the lives of Puerto Ricans and those with ties to the island changed forever,” said Rep. Velázquez. “More than three thousand perished not only because of a natural disaster but also as a direct result of political mismanagement by the Trump administration. This resolution is about honoring those lost, but also reaffirming the commitment of the federal government to do right for the island. Due to the recent landfall of Hurricane Fiona, the people of Puerto Rico are once again forced to face the devastating effects of a hurricane. While we continue to reflect on this solemn anniversary, we must work to fix the challenges that plague the island such as the failing electrical grid and a lack of full parity in federal benefits. I will continue to ensure under the Biden Administration, FEMA and other federal agencies need to work together to help rebuild the island’s infrastructure to be more sustainable and withstand future storms.”Sen. Menendez is a long-time supporter of the people of Puerto Rico, and he has been an ardent advocate for ensuring the federal government fully supports Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in their continued recovery efforts, and the Senator will play an active role as Puerto Rico now works to recover from Hurricane Fiona. After the devastation by Hurricane Maria, Sen. Menendez led his colleagues in holding the Trump Administration accountable for its botched and inhumane response to the hurricane. The Senator led efforts to extend a foreclosure moratorium for FHA insured mortgages in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands, which would have put struggling families at risk of homelessness, and held FEMA accountable for cutting off federal assistance for debris removal and emergency protective measures in Puerto Rico.In 2019, Sen. Menendez and his colleagues also called on the inspector general to review FEMA’s faltering efforts to rebuild Vieques’ health care facility divested by Hurricane Maria, and last year reintroduced legislation to ensure Vieques receives the federal assistance needed to help it rebuild. Last year, Sen. Menendez and Congresswoman Velázquez also introduced the Vieques Recovery and Redevelopment Act, which in part would support the people of Vieques in recovering from the damages of Hurricane Maria.In the Senate, joining Sen. Menendez in cosponsoring the resolution are Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn,), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/chairman-menendez-opens-debate-for-senate-consideration-of-kigali-amendment-to-montreal-protocol,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered the following remarks on the Floor in support of Senate approval of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. CLICK TO WATCH “Ratifying Kigali means ensuring U.S. companies dominate the export markets. Failure to ratify means a wasted investment and a missed opportunity. Ratifying means we will see thousands more domestic manufacturing jobs—33,000 according to industry estimates. Failure to ratify means U.S. businesses that employ tens of thousands of people across the country will not be able to sell many of their products in key countries,” Chairman Menendez said. “So the choice on this is clear. … Let’s support American businesses. Let’s continue to be the global leader. Let’s support American consumers. Let’s make sure the United States stays ahead of the competition.”  Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below.  “Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. I thank the Leader for bringing this important legislative initiative to the Senate Floor. I want to thank our Republican colleagues that have joined in a bipartisan effort to send a very strong message that this is about America's competitiveness. This is about America's security. This is about challenging China. For more than 20 years, U.S. manufacturers have been hard at work pioneering new technologies for our refrigerators and air conditioners. They have defined the global standard, and they have the competitive advantage over companies in China and India, which have doubled down on yesterday’s technology.   Our companies want and need the Senate to support them so that they can continue to lead, to create jobs, and to export their goods to global markets.   And so Mr. President, that is why I come to the Floor today. To urge my Senate colleagues to provide advice and consent to the Kigali Amendment – the fifth technical update to the incredibly successful Montreal Protocol.  A treaty amendment that passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by bipartisan voice vote. This shows the depth and scope of bipartisan support.  Each of the four prior updates were approved by the full Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to do the same for Kigali.  The Amendment is a success story of business and government working together, dating back to the George W. Bush administration.   It is an update that will ensure U.S. leadership in exports into the future, and it is the only way to keep our businesses from being locked out of markets around the world. American businesses are clear: It is time to phase-down antiquated chemicals known as HFCs, which American manufacturers want to leave behind.  It is time to usher in a new era in which their modern products are purchased all over the world. Our companies already lead in this space. They have been investing billions of dollars to develop new technologies – alternatives to HFCs. And they have done so in ways that will ultimately decrease costs for U.S. consumers. That’s why—for the time being—we have the competitive advantage over China and others.  So the choice on this is clear. Ratifying Kigali means ensuring U.S. companies dominate the export markets.  Failure to ratify means a wasted investment and a missed opportunity.   Ratifying means we will see thousands more domestic manufacturing jobs—33,000 according to industry estimates. Failure to ratify means U.S. businesses that employ tens of thousands of people across the country will not be able to sell many of their products in key countries. We're talking about $4.8 billion annually of increased exports, $12.5 billion of increased economic output per year. So, do we want billions of dollars a year in more exports and economic output, or do we want to have lost jobs? Do we want lost exports? Do we want our companies suffering needlessly? Beginning in 2033, the nations around the world that have already joined Kigali—one-hundred and thirty-seven and counting that have already done this—will be required to block the imports of most HFCs from countries that have not joined Kigali.   So we would be blocked if we don’t in fact ratify this amendment. We don’t want U.S. manufacturers to be on the outside looking in. They employ thousands of people all over the country.  We don’t want them to be unable to sell products that that they have been at the forefront of developing.  Adopting this treaty amendment is the only way to keep our businesses from being locked out of global markets. Let’s not waste the engagement and encouragement by the Bush administration that led U.S. manufacturers to develop alternatives to these harmful chemicals.  Let’s not waste the accomplishments made by the AIM Act, which President Trump signed into law.  We need to remember that the AIM Act provides for the exact same chemical phase-down required by Kigali, which means we have already taken the required steps domestically. This means that we wouldn’t be required to do anything more if we ratify Kigali, but we will miss out on billions in exports and thousands of jobs if we fail to do so.   That is the essence: that is why manufacturers all over the country – in states like Wisconsin, Texas and Kentucky – support Senate approval of Kigali.  That is why there has been an outpouring of support from the business community, including major employers like Walmart, Carrier, Trane, Lennox, and others.  That is why the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the impacted industries all support this practical and bipartisan Senate action.  So in closing, I ask my colleagues to fulfill our Constitutional role in the treaty process by providing advice and consent to the Kigali Amendment.   That requires 67 votes – I think we are well on our way there. Let’s support American businesses. Let’s continue to be the global leader. Let’s support American consumers.  Let’s make sure the United States stays ahead of the competition.  Let’s beat China instead of help China at the end of the day.  We can do all of that and so much more by adopting today’s amendment.  I want to thank so many who have worked on this in a bipartisan effort. Senator Kennedy has been working very hard. I want to thank my colleague Senator Carper, the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who has been so passionate about the Kigali Amendment and such a force to bring us to this moment today.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.”See moreNovember 02, 2022

Menendez. “This money is being put towards infrastructure improvements, instructional materials, and other social and emotional programming that so many children need to adapt after a year and a half of remote learning. These once-in-a-generation investments are happening here in Garfield and in schools all across New Jersey.”“The American people entrusted congressional Democrats with the sacred responsibility of bringing America back and the successes in North Jersey communities show clearly that Democrats have delivered,” said Rep. Pascrell. “Through our urgent actions, the American economy is booming and communities like Garfield are back on their feet and running forward. It is no hyperbole to say the American Rescue Plan delivered by President Biden and Democrats is one of the transformative laws enacted by the modern Congress. Senator Menendez deserves special praise and thanks for getting these results over the finish line.”Between the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Senator and Congressman secured over $3 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding to help New Jersey schools safely reopen and address the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of their students.The Garfield Public School District, which has a diverse student population of approximately 5,000 students, has received approximately $13 million over the multiple tranches of education pandemic relief funding. School officials are in the process of a installing a $6.3 million new HVAC and ventilation system for the high school and have purchased new smart boards for every classroom and laptops for every student, as well as STEAM labs with 3D printing, laptops for every student, extended day and summer enrichment programs, and the hiring of additional social workers and counselors. TO VIEW PHOTOS CLICK HERE “The Garfield Distinct is honored to welcome Senator Menendez and Congressman Pascrell to gain insight into the use of ESSER funds in our district,” said Anna Sciacca, Superintendent of the Garfield Public School District. “The grant funds were allocated to provide a safe, healthy, and supportive learning environment for our students. The allowable uses in the three ESSER grants served to address the needs of our students, staff, and families, including desperately needed PPE equipment, technology, social-emotional supports, extended classes, summer programs, and improvement of the HVAC system at Garfield High School. The benefits to our district are immeasurable and we remain very grateful.”“You invest time and resources in the things you value most. President Biden and the Democrats in Congress demonstrated their commitment to our public education system with the funding districts received through the American Rescue Plan. And in districts throughout New Jersey, our students and communities have reaped the benefits of this historic investment,” said Donna M. Chiera, President of the American Federation of Teachers – New Jersey. “The funding allowed our schools to improve their physical plants, as well as provide more mental health services and academic resources, personnel and programs to support accelerated learning. Today in Garfield with Sen. Bob Menendez, we got to see firsthand how labor, management and families working together can make a difference.”The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP) that was signed into law last spring included $2.76 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding to help Pre-K-12 public schools across New Jersey safely reopen and address the academic, social, emotional and mental health needs of their students. New Jersey’s implementation plan allocated 90 percent of ARP ESSER funding directly to local school districts. School districts must use 20 percent of their funding for learning loss activities that address social, emotional and academic needs and the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on students from low income and minority families. Five percent of the overall ARP ESSER funding was reserved for state-level learning loss activities.Earlier this year, Sen. Menendez hosted a roundtable in Kearny with Rep. Pascrell, parents, educators, and administrators to discuss the learning loss students have experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-padilla-cornyn-unveil-senate-bipartisan-resolution-recognizing-559-hispanic-serving-institutions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – As our nation celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month, U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), co-chairs of the Senate Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Caucus, alongside Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), today unveiled a bipartisan Senate resolution recognizing 559 HSIs across the country that play an important role in educating and providing professional development opportunities to the next generation of emerging Hispanic leaders. The resolution designated the week of September 12, 2022 as “National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.”“As the proud alumnus of one of New Jersey’s leading Hispanic-Serving Institutions, my life trajectory would not have been possible without the unparalleled academic and professional opportunities I received as a student at St. Peter’s University,"" said Sen. Menendez. “It is therefore with immense appreciation for my colleagues that I thank them for supporting this bipartisan resolution, which recognizes the profound impact Hispanic-Serving Institutions have in empowering Hispanic students throughout the nation.” “Hispanic-Serving Institutions play a critical role in fostering our nation’s economic growth and vitality,” said Sen. Padilla. “California is home to the most HSIs of any state and I’ve witnessed firsthand how important their work is in providing more equitable access to higher education for Latino students. As a co-founder of the first-ever Hispanic-Serving Institutions Senate Caucus along with Senator Menendez, I’m committed to ensuring HSIs have the support they need to continue uplifting Latino communities across the country.” “As a member of the HSI Coalition in the Senate, I applaud the outstanding work of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to provide quality education for Texas’s growing Hispanic population,” said Sen. Cornyn. “I thank educators at these institutions for helping their students achieve their full potential, especially given the challenges of these past few school years.” The resolution is supported by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU). “HACU joins the 559 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the observance of HSI Week to celebrate the many accomplishments in Hispanic higher education. We are pleased that the U.S. Senate has presented this bipartisan resolution in recognition of the important role HSIs play in improving access to education and grateful to the offices of Senators Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn for, once again, leading this effort in the Senate,” said Antonio R. Flores, President and CEO of HACU. Defined as degree-granting institutions where total Hispanic enrollment constitutes no less than 25% of the total enrollment, HSIs play a critical role in educating Hispanic youth and creating economic opportunities for the economies in which these institutions are embedded. HSIs are located in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with emerging HSIs located in 40 states and the District of Colombia. Joining Sens. Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn in cosponsoring the resolution are Sens.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-on-desantis-sending-migrants-to-marthas-vineyard,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) issued the following statement in response to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently sending vulnerable migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, misleading and lying to them as human traffickers would all to score cheap political points with Trump’s MAGA base:“Using migrants at the very moment they are most desperate, most vulnerable, with the sole purpose of stoking the flames of xenophobia and white nationalism to score political points, reflects a callousness and cruelty matched only during the darkest times in our history. These are people – human beings yearning to breathe free – fleeing repression and hopelessness. But instead of welcoming these refugees and providing even the most basic care, Governor DeSantis decided to spend millions of taxpayer dollars in transportation costs, just to rile up his right-wing supporters and get more hits on Fox News. Why? Because the brand of ‘cruelty’ is the #1 seller in today’s GOP.  “President Biden should seize this moment to remind the country of what American democracy stands for. He should welcome these refugees and those from Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba that have been bussed to other states, and allow them to seek temporary protections in the United States. This was the right thing to do for Ukrainians who could not return home, and it is the right thing to do now. “Leviticus 19:33 tells us: ‘When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them.’ History will judge the demagogues of our time, as well as our inaction in this moment.”###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Menendez, who is the Senate lead of the program. “That is why I am proud to advocate each year for this vital funding that supports women and children and provides them with the tools, resources and education to build strong families and healthy communities.” “Home visits by nurses, social workers, and child development professionals improve the health and well-being of children and families,” said Sen. Booker. “I’m proud to fight for funding to make sure thousands of New Jersey families and children receive crucial support and resources to thrive.”Through MIECHV, nurses, social workers, or other professionals visit at-risk families in their homes to evaluate their living situations and provide information on resources available to improve the health, educational, and economic opportunities for at-risk children. Resources include health care, early education, parenting skills, child abuse prevention, and nutrition education or assistance.Sen. Menendez secured a provision in the American Rescue Plan that provided an additional $150 million for staffing and servicing for MIECHV programs across the country including $2,435,374 for New Jersey. The provision also includes expanded flexibility for program operators to use funding to purchase technology needed for virtual home visits, and emergency supplies such as formula, food, water, hand soap and sanitizer, diapers, and prepaid grocery cards.Sen. Menendez is the Senate champion of the MIECHV program and led the charge for a five-year reauthorization in 2017 to ensure families across the nation continue to receive services from this important program. The Senator is actively working on reauthorizing this important program which is set to expire at the end of September. In New Jersey, all twenty-one counties are served by this program. In 2020, 5,387 New Jersey families and 9,788 New Jersey children benefited from MIECHV programs with nearly 62,000 home visits.See moreNovember 23, 2022

And last October, twenty two senators, including nine members of this committee, sent you a letter supporting the recommendations and asking for immediate approval,” said Sen. Menendez. “In so many other areas, the SEC under your leadership has taken bold steps forward to protect consumers and strengthen oversight of our markets, such as your proposed climate risk disclosure rule. However, when presented with AMAC’s noncontroversial, unanimous recommendations that would promote diversity in the asset management field, you haven’t been as aggressive,” added Sen. Menendez.CLICK TO WATCHSen. Menendez has long advocated for increased diversity and inclusion across all sectors and industries. Last October, the Senator led a letter signed by 21 Senate Democrats calling on the SEC to expeditiously adopt the AMAC’s recommendations. Sen. Menendez also led the charge to further diversify corporate America by authoring the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2021, legislation that would address shortcomings in the SEC’s diversity disclosure rule by requiring public companies to disclose information related to the racial, gender, ethnic makeup and veteran status of corporate boards and senior management.In the 116th Congress, Sen. Menendez introduced the Federal Jobs Act, a bill that would have required the development and implementation of a government-wide initiative to promote, expand, and retain diverse talent across the federal workforce.

Throughout the pandemic, the hospital hired nearly 400 nurses to handle the influx of patients coming through the hospital.“During the early days of the pandemic, hospitals across the country were struggling to keep up with the number of patients coming through their doors. Cooper University Hospital faced the challenge head on, hiring additional nurses to ensure their patients were well taken care of,” said Sen. Menendez. “This major grant award is critical so that the hospital can continue providing quality care, while taking care of the doctors, nurses, and administrative staff who work tirelessly every single day.”“Since the darkest days of the pandemic and ever since, the healthcare providers at Cooper University Hospital have been on the front lines caring for people suffering because of COVID-19,” said Sen. Booker. “This important federal award shows that we have their back. I will continue fighting to secure the resources they need to protect public health.” “When the pandemic came to South Jersey, our hospitals and health care workers were on the frontline,” said Rep. Norcross. “I am grateful for the talented nursing staff and dedicated health care workforce at Cooper and throughout our region. This federal funding helped our health care systems to absorb the shock of the pandemic and kept our family and friends safe.” To ensure they could meet the health needs of the community, Cooper University Hospital hired 390 nurses over the course of pandemic with a focus on rehiring the same nurses as they became familiar with the hospital’s processes. Over the course of a little over two years, these nurses worked a total of 214,819 hours; approximately 552 hours per nurse.""On behalf of the nearly 10,000 Cooper team members who have worked tirelessly since the earliest days of this pandemic to serve our community, we say thank you to FEMA, Senator Menendez, and the entire New Jersey delegation for their ongoing support to keep our health system strong as we provide quality care to our patients,"" said Kevin O’Dowd, co-CEO of Cooper University Health Care.Last year, Sen. Menendez, who led a years-long effort to reform how FEMA responds to disasters, announced that the agency answered his call to eliminate the cost-sharing requirements for disaster grants. The directive issued by President Biden allows states and local governments to be retroactively reimbursed at 100% for eligible expenses to combat COVID-19 incurred since Jan. 2020, and to apply for full reimbursement for additional eligible expenses going forward.See moreDecember 27, 2022

The resolution celebrates the heritage, culture and immense contributions of Latinos to the United States.“The Hispanic community represents the best of America – people with different national origins, customs, cultures, and traditions all connected by their commitment to strengthening the American Dream,” said Sen. Menendez. “As the Hispanic community continues to grow and expand the promise of America, I appreciate my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for supporting this bipartisan resolution and recognizing the strength, resilience, and significance of our community.” “Texas and America are made better every day because of the contributions of Hispanic-Americans,” said Sen. Cornyn. “This bipartisan resolution will honor the more than 11 million Hispanic Americans that call Texas home, and I’m proud to help usher it through Congress for the 14th year in a row.”“Latino history has always been American history, since the birth of our nation and into its bright future,” said Rep. Cárdenas. “Our community’s involvement and influence on America’s cultural, economic and political tapestry is something that deserves both recognition and celebration. I’m so proud to lead this resolution that honors the inspiring contributions of diverse Latinos to this country. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month!”The commemoration of Hispanic Heritage Month started in 1968 as ‘Hispanic Heritage Week’ under President Lyndon B. Johnson and was expanded in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan to cover a 30-day period starting on September 15th and ending on October 15th. Latinos currently make up 18.5 percent of the U.S. population and are projected to grow to 107 million people by 2065 as 24 percent of the population. Cárdenas’ resolution notes that Hispanic-Americans contribute more than $2.6 trillion to the United States economy, more than the GDP of all but the top 17 nations in the world.Joining Sens.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/senate-foreign-relations-committee-overwhelmingly-approves-taiwan-policy-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today announced Committee approval of the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022, legislation he authored along with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to reinforce United States policy towards Taiwan in order to maintain stable cross-Strait deterrence as China expands its campaign to undermine the status quo.   Among its provisions, the bipartisan proposal expands U.S. efforts to promote the security of Taiwan, ensures regional stability, and deters further People’s Republic of China (PRC) aggression against Taiwan. The legislation also imposes steep costs on the PRC for hostile action against Taiwan by setting up a broad economic sanctions regime. “As Beijing continues to take coercive diplomatic, political, military and economic measures against Taiwan, today’s strong, bipartisan vote not only signals our unwavering support for the Taiwanese people, but our recognition of the pivotal role that the United States Congress must play in confronting these challenges. “We need to be clear-eyed about what we are facing, just as we need to be clear in our response. Despite what  some may try to argue, the primary focus of this bill has always been on deterrence and on enhancing Taiwan’s capabilities. The bill we are approving today makes clear the United States does not seek war or increased tensions with Beijing. Just the opposite. We are carefully and strategically lowering the existential threats facing Taiwan by raising the cost of taking the island by force so that it becomes too high a risk and unachievable. “After soliciting and incorporating input from Members of the Committee to address wide-ranging views and concerns, holding multiple hearings and briefings on this issue, as well as allowing for Committee members to travel to Taiwan, we passed a comprehensive piece of legislation to lay a new and bipartisan path forward for U.S.-Taiwan policy that maintains cross-Strait stability, all while reinforcing a status quo that is under threat from Beijing and that, without reinforcement, would inevitably and invariably collapse. “Today, I am incredibly proud to lead the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in speaking on behalf of the U.S. Congress so Beijing understands they have failed in trying to dictate what we can do and how, just like they will fail in preventing the United States from standing up for the people of Taiwan. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to ensure this Congress does everything needed to support Taiwan.” Last month, Chairman Menendez published an op-ed in the New York Times on the critical window of opportunity for the U.S. Congress to enact a more forward leaning policy to defend Taiwan. Citing Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, as well as the unprecedented unity among democratic nations against Putin’s own incursion into Ukraine, Chairman Menendez made the moral and strategic case for safeguarding Taiwan’s democracy through his bipartisan Taiwan Policy Act of 2022. See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/sfrc-chairman-menendez-remarks-at-full-committee-hearingassessing-us-policy-towards-venezuela,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today delivered the following opening remarks at this morning’s full Committee hearing entitled “Assessing U.S. Policy Towards Venezuela.” Testifying before the Committee were Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean Marcela Escobari. “Venezuela is the epicenter of the second largest refugee and migration crisis in the world. The Maduro regime has overseen the collapse of the economy—taking down with it the country’s entire education and healthcare systems,” Chairman Menendez said, underscoring the regime’s crimes against humanity and invitation to Russian, Cuban, Iranian, and Chinese governments into the country. “So as we review United States policy towards Venezuela, we must reckon with how—in the span of a generation—a trusted democratic partner has become a mafia state. A criminal enterprise that uses brute force to cling to power.” Continued Menendez: “Now, I want to be clear that this Committee believes in diplomacy. And Congress has long supported – and continues to support – a negotiated solution to Venezuela’s crisis. But a one-sided deal with a regime that kidnaps American citizens to increase its leverage is simply unacceptable. Unilateral concessions to a leader that tortures his political opponents is unacceptable. It’s not the path towards a successful negotiation. And it’s something the Biden administration—as well as newly elected leaders across Latin America—should keep in mind. Because given Maduro’s track record – given that he makes Al Capone look tame – there can be no return to normalcy with his regime.”CLICK TO WATCH   Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below. “This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order. Assistant Secretary Nichols and Assistant Administrator Escobari, thank you for appearing before us today as we talk about United States policy towards Venezuela and a crisis which not only has serious consequences for our national security, but the stability of our entire hemisphere. Three years ago, I walked out on the bridge at the Colombian-Venezuelan border in Cúcuta. And as I looked out at Venezuela, I saw first-hand the misery and desperation in family after family forced to flee their homeland as if it were a building on fire. The collapse of a once-thriving, modern, country. A beacon of stability in our hemisphere turned into a failed state. Run into the ground by Maduro and his thugs. Today, the situation is even more dire. Venezuela is the epicenter of the second largest refugee and migration crisis in the world. The Maduro regime has overseen the collapse of the economy—taking down with it the country’s entire education and healthcare systems. Basic household items are unaffordable for most Venezuelans. Maduro has weaponized starvation, using it as a political tool to drive over 95 percent of the country—over 26 million people—below the poverty level. And as his regime perpetrates crimes against humanity, Maduro traffics cocaine. He enriches himself and his kleptocrat buddies. And he invites the Russian, Cuban, Iranian and Chinese governments into the country. So as we review United States policy towards Venezuela, we must reckon with how—in the span of a generation—a trusted democratic partner has become a mafia state. A criminal enterprise that uses brute force to cling to power. Now, I want to be clear that this Committee believes in diplomacy. And Congress has long supported – and continues to support – a negotiated solution to Venezuela’s crisis. But a one-sided deal with a regime that kidnaps American citizens to increase its leverage is simply unacceptable. Unilateral concessions to a leader that tortures his political opponents is unacceptable. It’s not the path towards a successful negotiation. And it’s something the Biden administration—as well as newly elected leaders across Latin America—should keep in mind. Because given Maduro’s track record – given that he makes Al Capone look tame – there can be no return to normalcy with his regime. Not without the release of American hostages and Venezuela’s political prisoners. Not without a path to free and fair elections, the restoration of human rights, and a return to the rule of law. If the regime won’t seriously commit to these conditions, we must use the power of our peaceful diplomatic tools, imposing swift and severe consequences on the regime. Because while Maduro uses the prospects of negotiations to buy himself time, the physical and mental health of American hostages is deteriorating by the hour. As is the Venezuelan people’s hope for freedom as they face violence, imprisonment, and hunger every day. Let’s not forget that this crisis has forced nearly seven million people – we talk about the Ukrainians who have fled, and certainly we are in solidarity with them. But the world hardly whispers about the seven million people who have fled Venezuela since 2014. Think about that. That’s almost as many refugees as the entire population of the state of New Jersey. In fact, that’s more refugees than the combined populations of Idaho, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  Everyone needs to do more to protect Venezuelan refugees and migrants across the hemisphere. And the United States should be leading the way, protecting Venezuelans who are already here.  President Biden’s decision to provide Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status last year was the right choice after President Trump only paid lip service to Venezuelan-Americans. But I am very disappointed President Biden has only provided what was an extension instead of a full re-designation. And I’ve been disappointed by the international community’s failure to keep up with the severity of the humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela. It seems when these crises take place in other parts of the world, we get people’s attention. When they are in the Western Hemisphere, we don’t. We must all do more. So today I hope to hear the Biden administration’s strategy. What are you doing to bring home Matthew Heath, members of the CITGO 6, and other American hostages? What is the Administration doing to raise the price the regime pays for taking American hostages?  What is the plan to tackle this sprawling humanitarian crisis? What is your plan to maintain our support for democratic actors, including—but not limited to—Interim President Juan Guaidó? And how will you empower them to lead negotiations? And what is your Plan B if negotiations fail, or never even seriously start? When I authored the bipartisan VERDAD Act, with many on this committee joining as co-sponsors, I was hopeful for a diplomatic solution. But Venezuela’s crisis endures. And that’s why I will be introducing the VERDAD Expansion Act in the coming weeks. Comprehensive new legislation to tighten the screws on the regime. It defines U.S. policy on Venezuela’s political crisis. It guides humanitarian assistance. It addresses the Maduro regime’s malfeasance. And it sends a message to the Venezuelan opposition, to Venezuelan refugees, and to the Venezuelan community here in the United States that we stand with them in their effort to build a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Venezuela.  With that let me turn to the Ranking Member, Senator Risch, for his opening statement.”See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-marking-the-start-of-2022s-hispanic-heritage-month,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, released the following statement to mark the beginning of 2022’s Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15 to October 15: “Today, in New Jersey and all across America, we commemorate the start of Hispanic Heritage Month – a time when our nation comes together every year to celebrate the shared heritage, the diversity of traditions, the towering accomplishments and growing influence of the Latino community who are leading the way in every major industry from finance to entertainment to politics and beyond. It is also a time to reflect on the countless contributions Latinos and Latinas have made, and continue to make, to the economy, culture, history, and all aspects of American society.  “In my home state alone, Latinos and Latino-owned businesses are an economic powerhouse, contributing $97 billion to the state’s economy. When New Jersey became one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, Latino frontline workers showed up and worked hard to keep our state and economy afloat despite putting themselves and their families at risk. And especially this month, let’s always remember and honor the many Latinos and Latinas that have served valiantly as members of the U.S. Armed Forces to protect our freedoms and our democratic way of life at home and abroad.   “This month, we honor these contributions not only with words but with concrete results achieved under our current Democratic majority in Congress. From passing landmark bills like the American Rescue Plan to the bipartisan infrastructure law to the recent Inflation Reduction Act, we are making historic investments in underserved communities around the country, many of them are majority Latino. We secured health care benefits for thousands of Latino families, capped the cost of insulin for seniors, and passed provisions to lower everyday costs for millions of Latino families while tackling the existential threat posed by climate change. And under President’s leadership, nearly half of all Latinos with student debt will have their debt cancelled, which will unlock their economic potential and pave the way for them to pursue dreams of buying a house, opening a small business, or even starting a family.  “Despite this significant progress, we continue to confront systemic inequities that affect our community, we strive to improve representation across all sectors, from the highest levels of government to America’s corporate boardrooms, and we resolve to finally deliver humane and inclusive immigration reform that will provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. As we celebrate our rich heritage and the undeniable contributions to the fabric of American society, let us reaffirm our commitment to making sure that all Latinos, regardless of their national origin, the color of their skin or the zip code they live in, can prosper and get ahead. Let’s raise every voice, in every facet of life in America, to ensure more members of our community in New Jersey and across the nation can realize the promise of the American Dream.”###See moreDecember 07, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/as-un-general-assembly-convenes-leading-senators-unveil-resolution-urging-international-cooperation-to-address-sri-lankas-political-and-economic-crisis,"WASHINGTON – As the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York this week, U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was joined by Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in introducing a Senate resolution calling for a comprehensive international approach to address Sri Lanka’s current political and economic crisis, including challenges related to poor governance and economic policy under the Rajapaksa family’s rule. “I am proud to be joined by my colleagues in introducing our resolution that necessarily calls attention to the devastating political and economic turmoil plaguing the people of Sri Lanka,” Chairman Menendez said. “As the country grapples with its worst domestic crisis since the end of its civil war, the international community must continue to provide robust support and ensure that accountability for war crimes and respect for human rights in Sri Lanka remain top priorities. I applaud efforts by the Biden administration, our Quad partners, and the IMF in providing critical humanitarian and economic assistance, and affirm my commitment to continue to work with my colleagues to advance stability and prosperity in Sri Lanka and the broader region.” “After decades of conflict, political mismanagement, and unaddressed inequalities, the Sri Lankan people have made it clear they aspire for something better,” Senator Durbin said.  “Introduction of today’s resolution shows that the U.S. Senate stands with peaceful democratic efforts to address these long neglected challenges.” “The Rajapaksa family enriched themselves at the expense of the Sri Lankan people, ruthlessly silencing their opponents, inciting ethnic tensions, and leaving the country an economic shambles,” Senator Leahy said. “After years of civil war and government mismanagement and abuse, Sri Lanka needs a government that is committed to ethnic tolerance, equitable economic development, human rights, and justice.  That should also be the focus of U.S. policy.” “The Sri Lankan people have sent a firm message that they want their government to address the dire economic and humanitarian crises that are afflicting their country,” Senator Booker said. “I stand with the Sri Lankan people and support their peaceful efforts to address their needs. Furthermore, the international community must continue to push for justice, transparency, and accountability for human rights violations committed during the civil war to help the people of Sri Lanka move forward.”While commending the Biden administration and other Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) members’ support for Sri Lanka, the resolution calls on the UN Human Rights Council to extend its war crimes accountability resolution; urges Sri Lankan security forces to respect Sri Lankans’ rights to protest peacefully; and presses President Ranil Wickremesinghe to work with opposition parties and ethnic minority groups in efforts to address the crisis. Find a copy of the resolution HERE.See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/senators-menendez-hagerty-introduce-legislation-to-bolster-congressional-oversight-framework-for-denuclearization-of-korean-peninsula,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) today introduced the North Korea Policy Oversight Act of 2022, new legislation to bolster congressional oversight of U.S. diplomacy with North Korea.With the recent publication of a U.S. intelligence report confirming international sanctions and export controls are forcing Vladimir Putin to turn to North Korea to supply rockets and artillery shells for his illegal war on Ukraine, the new bipartisan legislation broadens U.S. efforts to further isolate Pyongyang and deny the government in North Korea and those that participate in illicit transactions with them access to the United States’ and global financial systems.Similarly, the legislation reaffirms U.S. policy to continue imposing consistent and robust sanctions on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear, cruise, and ballistic missile programs. Since January 2022, Kim Jong Un’s regime has conducted 13 ballistic missile tests, at least three of which were intercontinental ballistic missiles in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. In the strongest statement about Kim Jong Un’s nuclear doctrine, North Korea last week enacted a new law declaring itself an “irreversible” nuclear weapons state and outlining additional circumstances for deploying weapons of mass destruction.“As the international community continues to rally around a common cause in support of the people of Ukraine and against violent dictators writ large, the continuing danger of further conventional military provocation from North Korea that could reignite a serious military clash between North and South remains high, as does the potential for unintended escalation that could draw in the United States in a deadly and dangerous confrontation on the Peninsula,” said Chairman Menendez. “Adding insult to injury, we now know Vladimir Putin is so isolated that he is turning to pariah states like North Korea and Iran to try to continue his campaign of killing Ukrainians. But Russia’s desperation and lawlessness should not provide fertile ground to embolden Kim Jong Un by filling his coffers for nuclear weapons and missile programs. This bipartisan bill will go a long way in advancing peace and security in the Indo-Pacific by expanding and tightening enforcement of sanctions for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development and other destructive activities of the Kim regime.”“At a dangerous time when the threat of North Korea continues to mount, this important bipartisan legislation will impose additional sanctions on North Korea’s ability to generate revenue to fund its unlawful WMD programs, bolster support for denuclearization of North Korea, and provide additional Congressional oversight of U.S.-DPRK negotiations,” said Senator Hagerty.  Find a copy of the North Korea Policy Oversight Act of 2022 HERE. Find a copy of the section-by-section summary HERE. See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-pascrell-announce-26m-to-improve-major-north-jersey-roadway,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) and Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-N.J.-09) today announced a $26,000,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to make major improvements along a two-mile stretch on Route 7 in Hudson County. Route 7, which connects Hudson, Bergen, and Essex counties, stretches from Jersey City to Belleville. The highway often experiences major flooding as a major part of Route 7 spans across the Hackensack River.“Route 7 serves as a major thruway connecting three of our state’s most populous counties,” said Sen. Menendez. “This grant will allow for much-needed improvements, which will decrease flooding and create a safer roadway for drivers. I appreciate the Biden Administration’s commitment to improving our nation’s infrastructure and look forward to making New Jersey’s roads, bridges, and tunnels stronger, safer, and more resilient.”“This is a major investment to improve road safety and reliability for people in the most densely populated part of our state,” said Sen. Booker. “By mitigating flooding and safeguarding against poor roadway conditions, these improvements will protect drivers and strengthen the resilience of this critical thruway.”“This major federal award will have an enormously positive impact on our great state and region,” said Rep. Pascrell. “Route 7 is as an important artery connecting our largest counties. But the roadway suffers from flood events, disrupting the commutes of too many travelers. Drivers on Route 7 deserve a safe, fully operational path to get where they’re going and the injection of $26 million will get construction going now. After years of neglect, this Congress and this Administration are prioritized America’s roads and bridges and delivering for New Jersey.”The project will make drainage improvements along Route 7, including raising the roadway by approximately 3.5 feet. The project will also add three pumping stations, install new pipes, flood walls and inlet structures.The USDOT Infrastructure For Rebuilding America (INFRA) grants fund nationally significant freight and highway projects that improve safety and reliability, generate national or regional economic benefits, reduce congestion, enhance the resiliency of highway infrastructure and help protect the environment. See moreDecember 02, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-join-colleagues-in-urging-biden-to-provide-student-debt-relief-to-parent-borrowers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) today joined several colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden – pressing the Administration to provide student debt relief to parent borrowers. Following the President’s historic actions to address student debt, the Senators are urging the Administration to incorporate Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (Parent PLUS) borrowers in any administrative improvements to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) programs, extensions or creation of waivers, and in the implementation of executive actions to provide student debt relief.“We write to urge you to consider Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative changes and executive actions you undertake to improve the Department of Education’s student loan programs and provide student loan relief,” wrote the Senators to President Biden. “Currently, there are over 3.6 million Parent PLUS borrowers owing more than $107 billion, accounting for about 10% of all student loan debt. Congress created the (…) program in the 1980 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to meet demands for increased federal student lending and as a response to families who needed assistance covering their expected family contribution.”To help reduce barriers for parent borrowers, the Senators are asking the Administration to extend the additional $10,000 in student debt forgiveness to Parent PLUS borrowers whose children were Pell Grant recipients and to ensure that improvements to student loan forgiveness programs include Parent PLUS borrowers, which receive less favorable terms than other types of federal student loan programs, including higher interest rates and origination fees.“Recent studies show that an increasing number of Parent PLUS borrowers are among the lowest income families receiving Pell Grants, have among the lowest estimated family contributions (EFCs), and are typically parents of students attending public institutions or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Parent PLUS loan debt also impacts low-income Black and Latino families disproportionally,” added the Senators. “…By reducing barriers to this program for Parent PLUS borrowers and ensuring they are included in debt relief, we will move one step closer to remedying program-wide issues for these borrowers, narrowing the wealth gap, and addressing our country’s student loan debt crisis.”In addition to Sens. Menendez and Booker, the letter was signed by Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).The full text of the letter is available HERE and below. Dear President Biden:Thank you for extending the pause on federal student loans and your plan to provide student debt cancellation for the millions of Americans in need of immediate relief. This meaningful cancellation will provide relief to 95% of all federal student loan borrowers, changing the lives of millions of Americans held back from financial stability and economic opportunity by the burden of student loan debt. We write to urge you to consider Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative changes and executive actions you undertake to improve the Department of Education’s (Department’s) student loan programs and provide student loan relief.  Currently, there are over 3.6 million Parent PLUS borrowers owing more than $107 billion, accounting for about 10% of all student loan debt. Congress created the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (Parent PLUS) loan program in the 1980 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to meet demands for increased federal student lending and as a response to families who needed assistance covering their expected family contribution. In 1992, Congress removed caps on this type of lending, allowing parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance and increasing access to higher education opportunities for students with the greatest need.However, the increased access to lending came at a high cost for parent borrowers and their families. The Parent PLUS program has less favorable terms than other types of federal student loan programs, including higher interest rates and origination fees. Under the Higher Education Act, the origination fee for Parent PLUS loans is nearly four times higher than the origination fee for Stafford loans offered by the Department of Education (Department). In addition, the current interest rate for Parent PLUS borrowers is nearly double the interest rate of other types of undergraduate loans offered by the Department, with an astounding cap of 10.5% for these borrowers. High origination fees and high interest rates for Parent PLUS borrowers have forced the lowest income borrowers, Black, Brown, and older borrowers to face difficult tradeoffs in order to keep up with student loan payments, resulting in possible loan default or, in the case for some seniors, offsets in Social Security benefits.Recent studies show that an increasing number of Parent PLUS borrowers are among the lowest income families receiving Pell Grants, have among the lowest estimated family contributions (EFCs), and are typically parents of students attending public institutions or Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Parent PLUS loan debt also impacts low-income Black and Latino families disproportionally. A study based on Department calculations found that, in 2018, about 42% of Black Parent PLUS borrowers and 26% of Latino/a Parent PLUS borrowers had a zero EFC, while only 8% of white Parent PLUS borrowers had a zero EFC. A substantial portion of the children of Parent PLUS borrowers are Pell recipients, including 50% at public colleges and universities, 71% at for-profit colleges, and 80% at HBCUs.Upon graduation, the average Parent PLUS loan debt held by a student’s family member is $30,860. After ten years of repayment, over half of that initial balance remains, due in part to high interest charges each month. Parent PLUS borrowers for students who attended the fifty colleges with highest shares of white undergraduate students owe an average of 47% of their principal over the same time period. For Parent PLUS borrowers whose children attended the fifty colleges with highest shares of Black undergraduate enrollment their remaining balance is higher, owing an average of 96% of their loan principal after ten years of repayment. These disparities in repayment outcomes, coupled with the systematic barriers that Parent PLUS borrowers face in accessing student loan forgiveness programs, if left unaddressed, could exacerbate the racial wealth gap for families across this nation.Parent PLUS borrowers who are disabled, seniors, or approaching retirement are at risk of being pushed into precarious financial circumstances. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 55,200 disabled or retired Parent PLUS borrowers had defaulted on their student loans, and over 13% of those borrowers saw portions of their Social Security benefits garnished as a result. Additionally, more than half of borrowers who had such offsets in fiscal year 2015 were receiving Social Security disability benefits rather than Social Security retirement income. While Parent PLUS loans account for about one in fourteen of all outstanding federal loans, the GAO reports that one in three of the senior borrowers whose Social Security payments were subject to offsets had a Parent PLUS loan at some point in time. Social Security was designed to help Americans achieve the secure retirement they have earned and provide a critical safety-net for people with disabilities who are unable to work. Parent PLUS loans should not force seniors into a difficult retirement and financial vulnerability. Furthermore, Parent PLUS borrowers are met with limited options in regard to federal student loan forgiveness programs. Parent PLUS loans are ineligible for all but one of the Department’s income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which calculate borrowers’ payments based on a percent of discretionary income and family size. Parent PLUS borrowers are only eligible for the income-contingent repayment (ICR) plan, which requires borrowers to pay the highest share of discretionary income of all the IDR plans. Parent PLUS borrowers also face numerous hurdles to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. To qualify under current law, Parent PLUS borrowers must consolidate their loans into Direct Loans and enroll in the income-driven repayment plan that is the least generous to borrowers. Like all borrowers seeking PSLF, they must also make 120 qualifying monthly payments within 15 days of the due date and certify employment for a qualifying employer for jobs held on or after October 1, 2007. Borrowers are only eligible if they, not their child, are in qualifying employment. The PSLF program is a promise to borrowers who pursue careers in service that the government will support them with loan relief. To fulfil this promise to public servants, we must also recognize student families’ contributions to financing their children’s education through costly Parent PLUS loans.We are pleased to see the pause on federal student loans extended through December 31, 2022 and the Department’s proposed rule to allow eligible borrowers to cap monthly payments on undergraduate loans at 5% of their monthly income – down from 10% today – while shielding more income from repayment and preventing debts from ballooning over time. We especially applaud this Administration’s cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower making less than $125,000 a year (for an individual) or $250,000 (for married couples and heads of household), and the up to $20,000 for such borrowers who received Pell Grants. We know that this Administration is deeply committed to reducing wealth disparities in our nation by tackling student loan debt for all borrowers, including Parent PLUS borrowers. Thus, we urge you to ensure the additional $10,000 in student debt forgiveness is extended to Parent PLUS borrowers whose children were Pell Grant recipients, granted they meet the same income thresholds established in your student loan cancellation plan. These borrowers demonstrated significant financial need at the time they borrowed the PLUS loan, as evidenced by the fact that their students qualified for Pell Grants based on family income. Like student borrowers who received Pell Grants, these borrowers also face numerous barriers to successful repayment and should receive relief.We appreciate the Administration’s historic efforts to address the past failures of the federal student loan programs and the harm done by institutions and pervasive mismanagement by loan servicers. However, we remain concerned that in some of these actions Parent PLUS borrowers have been left out. The Department’s April 2022 announcement on the forthcoming IDR payment adjustment neglected to specifically address ways that the waiver would address shortcomings of the program for Parent PLUS borrowers. Under the limited PSLF waiver, Parent PLUS loans alone, even if consolidated, are not eligible. Without addressing this group of borrowers, any improvements to these programs will fall short in adequately addressing the multigenerational student loan debt crisis many families are facing. By reducing barriers to this program for Parent PLUS borrowers and ensuring they are included in debt relief, we will move one step closer to remedying program-wide issues for these borrowers, narrowing the wealth gap, and addressing our country’s student loan debt crisis. We strongly urge the Administration and the Department of Education to incorporate Parent PLUS borrowers in any administrative improvements to federal student loan programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Income-Driven Repayment programs, extensions or creation of waivers, and in the implementation of executive actions to provide student debt relief. Thank you for your consideration of this request.###See moreDecember 22, 2022

The AFG program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).“These grants will allow our fire departments to operate more efficiently and ensure our firefighters are properly equipped to protect themselves and keep residents safe,” said Sen. Menendez. “We must do everything we can to ensure our first responders have the tools necessary to protect our communities on a daily basis.”“New Jersey’s firefighters risk their lives to keep their communities safe,” said Sen. Booker. “This vital funding will ensure they have the tools and resources they need to protect themselves and their communities.”The following departments have been awarded AFG funding:Last month, the senator’s announced $2 million and nearly $1 million in AFG funding to fire departments across the state. The AFG program provides direct financial assistance to eligible local professional and voluntary fire departments, emergency medical services organizations, and state fire training academies to equip and train first responders. Since it was established in 2001, New Jersey has received over $180 million in funding from the AFG program to enhance response capabilities, as well as to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public and emergency response personnel.The FY 2021 AFG Program is one of three grant programs that constitute the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA’s focus on enhancing the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and related hazards. Since FY 2001, the AFG Program has awarded approximately $7.7 billion in grants to provide critically needed resources that equip and train emergency personnel to recognized standards, enhance operational efficiencies, foster interoperability, and support community resilience.See moreDecember 09, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-on-the-21st-anniversary-of-september-11th-attacks,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. –  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) issued the following statement in commemoration of the 21st anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terror attacks: “Twenty-one years ago today, nearly 3,000 Americans — including 750 from my home state of New Jersey — were senselessly murdered as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001. Our country was dramatically changed on that fateful Tuesday morning when evil found its way to our shores. Ever since, friends and families of the victims have soldiered on despite more than two decades of heartbreak, loss and grief. As we’ve done for the past two decades, today and every day, we honor their sacrifice and the void left behind through our enduring our commitment to never forget.“To ‘Never Forget’ continues to be our solemn duty. It requires us to remember the lives lost, not just through words, but through deeds and actions as well. It bounds us to our sacred oath: to care for those who are still burdened by the aftermath of the attacks, whether they be survivors facing adverse health effects from being at Ground Zero to the heroic first responders and police officers who ran towards danger as part of the rescue efforts. With each passing year — and each passing generation — it becomes even more important to do this and ensure that the memory of 9/11 does not fade from our nation’s conscience.“This also means renewing our resolve to deliver justice for 9/11 families as they deserve our full support to ensure they are treated fairly and equally. We owe it to them, and to the legacy of those we lost.” ###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/icymi-in-response-to-bidens-decision-to-cancel-student-debt-menendez-makes-case-for-how-to-further-help-borrowers,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) penned an op-ed in New Jersey’s Gannett affiliated newspapers, making the case for developing and implementing a unified plan to tackle the broken student loan system, which includes improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and lower payments under existing Income Based Repayment (IBR) programs. The Senator also argues that a comprehensive plan should provide information to borrowers about what the plan is to repay their loans, when these plans will begin, and how these different reforms ultimately work together.Read the op-ed in its entirety below:Cancelling student debt was the right thing to do. These are our next prioritiesBy Senator Bob Menendez For many families, the end of summer means the start of another school year. Teachers have prepped for months to meet their students, parents have shopped for what their kids need on the first day of school, and many are traveling across the country to move into their first college dorm.It’s an exciting time — a fresh start full of endless possibilities. This year though, it’s been made all the sweeter by President Joe Biden’s bold decision to forgive student loan debt for millions of hardworking Americans. For parents and students, it’s the greatest back to school gift they could get. For older Americans, it’s a reprieve for those who have never known life without the burden of student loan debt.Make no mistake, this move will change lives for millions who have been saddled with debt for years. Moreover, it will unleash the economic potential of countless student borrowers who serve their communities as teachers, social workers, health care professionals, and more.Take Catherine, from Plainsboro, New Jersey as an example. Student loan debt forced her to put off starting her own family and she swore off the idea of ever owning her own home. When she wrote to my office, she even questioned if becoming a public school teacher was the right decision.Thanks to the president’s executive action cancelling student debt, Catherine and so many others like her will receive well-deserved financial relief. Not only will cancellation bring down her overall balance, soon-to-be proposed regulations could reduce her student loan payment by as much as half.Simply put, wiping away student loan debt is an economic lifeline to public servants like Catherine. It’s a message that tells them, plain and simple: “your debt doesn’t define you.” It’s an important step towards restoring faith in the American Dream — that if you pursue an education, work hard, and invest in yourself, you too can thrive.Because for too long, those burdened with student loan debt haven’t even had the chance to start saving. Instead, dreams of building families or starting a business have been delayed — including by parents who have financed their children’s education. With last month’s announcement, Biden is lifting them up and giving them a chance to succeed.That said, it is just one step among many that we can take to reform our broken student loan system. Cancellation, improvements to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and lower payments in Income Based Repayment programs will make an enormous difference — but what we need is a unified plan that tackles this issue in the comprehensive manner it deserves. What, when and how: Here's what's still neededBefore we restart student loan payments, this comprehensive plan should inform borrowers of three things: what the plan is to repay their loans, when these plans will begin, and how these different reforms work together.First, we will need additional details about the president’s newly-proposed 5% IBR program, including when this program will be available to borrowers.Secondly, the PSLF program must ensure that those who go into public service — from nurses to public school educators to cops and firefighters — know with certainty that their debt will be written off after 10 years. We can start this work now by extending the PSLF waiver deadline to July 1, 2023, and guarantee that every public servant has the time they need to apply for the PSLF waiver.And finally, any forgiveness of student loan debt must not be treated as income for the purposes of taxes beyond 2025 — a provision that I first authored and championed with Senator Elizabeth Warren in the Senate and Representative Bill Pascrell in the House of Representatives.After all, the heart of this issue isn’t dollars and cents, it’s improving the lives of people like Catherine. It’s about helping hardworking families afford daycare, saving for the future, starting a family, and putting down a deposit to buy a home or starting a business. Each individual story is further evidence that fixing the problem of student loans in our country requires an approach that is all-of-the-above, not either-or.As families gear up to go back to school with a burden lifted off their backs, we shouldn’t take our eyes off of the final prize — a student loan repayment system that works and realizes the promise of the American Dream for anyone who reaches for it.###See moreDecember 22, 2022

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in sending a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, requesting information about the company’s efforts to combat cryptocurrency scams and hold bad actors accountable for cryptocurrency fraud on its platforms. “Data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shows that scams involving cryptocurrency are becoming increasingly prevalent on social media. From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 49% of fraud reports to the FTC involving cryptocurrency specified that the scam originated on social media,” wrote the senators to Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, formerly known as Facebook. “Alarmingly, these scams cost consumers a staggering total of $417 million and take many forms, from ‘investment scams’ where consumers are promised huge returns and have their investments stolen, to ‘romance scams’ where fraudsters create fake profiles to build a relationship with their targets before scamming them.”The senators also pointed out how Meta’s sites are particularly popular hunting grounds for scammers looking to defraud consumers. Of those who have reported being scammed out of cryptocurrency on a social media website, 32% identified the scam as having originated on Instagram, 26% on Facebook, and 9% on WhatsApp.“Meta has previously acknowledged the potential for crypto scammers to operate on its platforms. In fact, in January 2018, Facebook banned crypto ads, claiming that ‘there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.’ At the time, you claimed this policy was meant to ‘make it harder for scammers to profit from a presence on Facebook,’” added the senators. “This ban clearly shows that you understand the risks posed by this type of content to users. You later partially reversed the ban on crypto ads, and more recently expanded the list of regulatory licenses accepted in order to advertise cryptocurrency on Facebook and Instagram. A higher level of scrutiny is needed for this type of content.”Sen. Menendez and several of his colleagues have long been holding Meta accountable for the spread of mis/disinformation on its platforms relating to COVID-19, our elections, and the war in Ukraine. The senator has been particularly focused on how Meta is doing little to stop the spread of Spanish mis/disinformation on its platforms, including on group messaging applications like WhatsApp that allow for the rapid spread of such intentionally misleading information. In 2019, when Facebook was then working on developing its own cryptocurrency, Sen. Menendez warned about the dangers of the social media company’s proposed digital currency.A copy of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:We write to request information regarding Meta’s efforts to combat cryptocurrency scams on its social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Based on recent reports of scams on other social media platforms and apps, we are concerned that Meta provides a breeding ground for cryptocurrency fraud that causes significant harm to consumers.Data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shows that scams involving cryptocurrency are becoming increasingly prevalent on social media. From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 49% of fraud reports to the FTC involving cryptocurrency specified that the scam originated on social media.1 Alarmingly, these scams cost consumers a staggering total of $417 million and take many forms, from “investment scams” where consumers are promised huge returns and have their investments stolen, to “romance scams” where fraudsters create fake profiles to build a relationship with their targets before scamming them.2While crypto scams are prevalent across social media, several of Meta’s sites are particularly popular hunting grounds for scammers.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-pushes-for-senate-passage-of-safe-banking-act-highlights-need-to-strengthen-national-flood-insurance-program,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, today pushed for the Senate passage of the SAFE Banking Act and highlighted the need to strengthen the National Flood Insurance Program in light of recent confirmation of the staggering drop in flood insurance coverage as a result of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Risk Rating 2.0 system. The Senate Banking hearing, entitled “Current Issues in Insurance,” had witnesses from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Federal Insurance Office at the U.S. Treasury Department.“I’m concerned that businesses that have nothing to do with cannabis could face serious consequences if this bill isn’t enacted. Imagine a scenario where a New Jersey lightbulb manufacturer sells a product to a state-legalized cannabis business and there’s a fire related to the lightbulb, causing the business to suffer losses,” said Sen. Menendez in questioning Kathleen A. Birrane from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. “The SAFE Banking Act and CLAIM Act would resolve the issue I described, as well as many others. The House has passed this bipartisan measure seven times, and it’s long past time for the Senate to do the same.”Sen. Menendez is the author of the Clarifying Law Around Insurance of Marijuana (CLAIM) Act, to provide a safe harbor for insurers to do businesses with state-legalized cannabis retailers. This bipartisan legislation was included as a provision in the SAFE Banking Act.Additionally, Sen. Menendez highlighted the need to advance his bipartisan, bicameral National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization and Reform (NIFP-RE) Act in the light of FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 shock to flood insurance coverage.“Last month FEMA reported that over 425,000 policyholders dropped out of the National Flood Insurance Program since Risk Rating 2.0 took effect last year. That’s nearly 10% of the program. The agency predicted it would take years for 425,000 policyholders to drop coverage, but instead it took eight short months,” said Sen. Menendez. “A majority of homeowners across the country are already uninsured against flooding, and it’s clear Risk Rating 2.0 is only making this situation worse. This program needs to have affordable rates to get families covered and robust investments in mitigation and mapping so that we can finally address the long-term challenges of flooding. I hope we can work together to advance my bipartisan NFIP-RE Act before this problem grows even worse.”Sen. Menendez has been the leading advocate in Congress for an overhaul of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), since Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey nearly almost 10 years ago. The NIFP-RE Act would extend the program for five years, while implementing a series of sweeping reforms to address the waste, abuse and mismanagement plaguing the system. ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

It has now been more than nine months since DHS called for development of a plan to ‘provide for the consideration of deferred action, continued presence, parole, and other available relief for noncitizens who are witnesses to, or victims of, abusive and exploitative labor practices.’ Workers cannot wait any longer for these much-needed protections,” wrote the Senators to Secretary Mayorkas.   In the letter, the Senators highlight the need for a consistent, expedited processing of requests from immigrant witnesses and victims of labor and rights violations including parole, deferred action, and employment authorization. “DHS must commit to using the full range of its prosecutorial discretion authority, including granting stays of removal and release from detention where applicable,” the Senators added. “A process to protect immigrant witnesses and victims of labor rights violations that includes these components will go a long way toward securing the infrastructure investment’s potential to promote equitable, sustainable economic growth for working families.""Sen. Menendez is the author of Protecting Our Workers from Exploitation and Retaliation (POWER) Act. The bicameral legislation would protect workers from employers who use illegal business practices and threaten workers with deportation if they go to the authorities. A copy of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas:As you are aware, a company’s ability to exploit vulnerable immigrant workers threatens the historic potential of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to advance the Biden Administration’s goal of creating good, union jobs throughout the country. Exploitation of immigrant workers “drives down wages, discourages organizing, and creates unsafe working conditions for all workers.”  We are encouraged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is planning to address this problem by announcing a process to provide immigration protections and work authorization for immigrant witnesses and victims of labor law violations. We write to briefly identify several core components necessary to ensure this much-needed process is effective.First, it is imperative that DHS announce its new process swiftly. It has now been more than nine months since DHS called for development of a plan to “provide for the consideration of deferred action, continued presence, parole, and other available relief for noncitizens who are witnesses to, or victims of, abusive and exploitative labor practices.”  Workers cannot wait any longer for these much-needed protections. Second, DHS’s process must include a centralized office within USCIS that is charged with consistent, expedited processing of requests from immigrant witnesses and victims of labor and rights violations for parole (where eligible), deferred action, and employment authorization.Finally, DHS must commit to using the full range of its prosecutorial discretion authority, including granting stays of removal and release from detention where applicable.A process to protect immigrant witnesses and victims of labor rights violations that includes these components will go a long way toward securing the infrastructure investment’s potential to promote equitable, sustainable economic growth for working families. I am hopeful that your leadership on this issue will act urgently to demonstrate the Administration’s support for workers at this critical time of deep public investment in our nation’s infrastructure. Sincerely,  ###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-on-biden-administrations-actions-on-student-debt-cancellation,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. –  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) released the following statement after President Joe Biden announced the federal government will cancel $20,000 in student debt for borrowers who attended college on Pell Grants and $10,000 for those who didn’t receive these grants, with forgiveness limited to those making less than $125,000 annually. Since President Biden took office, Sen. Menendez has called for him to use his authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loans debt. “I commend President Biden for not only extending the student loan payment pause, but also cancelling up to $20,000 for many federal borrowers who attended college with Pell Grants and $10,000 for those who didn’t receive these grants during school. As a result of my work with Senator Warren in authoring and passing the Student Loan Tax Relief Act, which was successfully included in the American Rescue Plan last year, millions of Americans will not face a surprise tax bill next year because of the President’s historic decision to cancel student debt. “For many who have long postponed buying their first home, opening a small business, or even starting a family because of their student debt, today’s announcement will make a profound difference and help unleash the economic potential of thousands of student borrowers in New Jersey and millions across the country. While this is not the full cancellation amount I have advocated for, I do urge the Biden Administration to seize this opportunity to develop and implement a unified plan for improving federal student loan programs, including addressing longstanding issues with income based repayment (IBR), public service loan forgiveness (PSLF), and problems with federal student loan servicers. By waiting to restart student loan payments until a unified plan is in place, the Administration would provide transformative economic relief with minimal disruptions to borrowers.” ###See moreDecember 19, 2022

Extending the waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the historic waiver that has already resulted in over $9 billion in forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its proposed PSLF rule.“The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’ the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan,’” wrote the lawmakers to Secretary Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.”The lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF.“For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs,” added the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.”The lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.“[W]e also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers.Joining Sens. Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand in the Senate in signing the letter are: Sens.

But it is just that—temporary—and it leaves borrowers in limbo as we wait for new regulations to take effect next year,” said Randi Weingarten, President of American Federation of Teachers. “Let’s be clear, everyone who received the debt relief was promised it. This waiver was a critical step toward healing a broken student loan system that has pauperized a generation. We need to take it one step further and extend it. The people who are benefiting from this moment of relief are the same people who carried us through a pandemic—we need to honor their commitment and extend the deadline for the PSLF waiver.” “No matter what we look like, where we live, or what’s in our bank accounts, all of us should be able to pursue our dreams at an affordable college or university. But for too long, the cost of college has forced many students and families to forego their education goals or be trapped in a lifetime of debt. When educators are unable to repay their student debt, it means fewer educators in the profession, and more disruptions for their students,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “We are overwhelmingly grateful for the waiver that has allowed thousands of educators to receive the promise of PSLF, but there are simply too many educators who have been left out to end the waiver now. We implore the Biden Administration to keep the promise of PSLF and extend the waiver deadline.”“Public service workers make incredible sacrifices every day to strengthen their communities – and never more so than during the last two and a half years of this pandemic. The least we can do is ease their overwhelming student debt burden, much of which they have incurred while getting the skills and education they need to be better at their essential jobs,” said President Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME. “So many AFSCME members have benefitted from the Biden administration’s temporary waiver that expanded eligibility for loan forgiveness. But we are only scratching the surface of the need. It is time to extend the deadline and give more public service workers the time to learn about the program, apply for loan forgiveness and get the relief they need.”“The Administration's overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is just hitting its stride--delivering debt relief to educators and healthcare workers who are still reeling from the pandemic and its aftermath,” said Mike Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “We strongly urge President Biden to listen to Senators Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand, Representatives Sarbanes, Courtney, Hayes, Manning, and more than 100 of their colleagues: keep your promise to cancel student debt for every public service worker who is eligible, no matter how long it takes.” This effort is supported by 74 outside organizations, including: The School Superintendents Association (AASA), AccessLex Institute, Accountable.us, Alaska Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), American Alliance of Museums, American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW), American Association of University Women (AAUW), American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), American Council on Education (ACE), American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Psychological Association (APA), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance , Association of Young Americans (AYA), Association of Oncology Social Work (AOSW), Center for American Progress (CAP), Center for Economic Integrity, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW), Civil Service Bar Association, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU), Communication Workers of America Union (CWA), Community Service Society of New York, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), Equal Justice Works (EJW), Fosterus, Hispanic Federation, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates (HERA), International Association of Firefighters, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Jewish Federations of North America, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Legal Aid at Work, Loan Assistance Repayment Program of Minnesota, Maine Center for Economic Policy, Maryland Center for Collegiate Financial Wellness, National Action Network Washington Bureau, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Association of Deans and Directors of Social Work, National Council of Nonprofits, National Education Association (NEA), National Employment Law Project (NELP), National Military Family Association, National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Women's Law Center (NWLC), Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, New America, New Jersey Citizen Action, New Leaders, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), Nonprofit Professional Employees Union (NPEU)—IFPTE Local 70, OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates, ParentsTogether, People's Parity Party, Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), Public Law Center, Social Current, Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC), Student Debt Crisis Center, The Arc of the United States, The Debt Collective, The Education Trust, The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), UnidosUS, Virginia Poverty Law Center, Voices for National Service, and Zero Debt Massachusetts.Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear Secretary Cardona: Thank you for your continued efforts to improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. As you know, the limited PSLF waiver announced last year has already improved the lives of more than 164,0001 public servants who have had their student loans forgiven and 1 million2 who have received an average of one additional year of PSLF credit. Yet, we write today, as we believe that additional action is needed to ensure public servants—who have been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery—can access the PSLF waiver. Currently, only an estimated 15 percent of the 9 million public service workers with student debt have filed paperwork to track their qualifying payments under PSLF.3 The Department of Education (Department) will not begin its one-time review of accounts with extended forbearances and incorrectly recorded deferments, which could help borrowers make more progress toward PSLF relief, until later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022. In addition, the Department recently unveiled its sweeping proposed regulations for improving student loan programs, including PSLF—which are currently on track to take effect on July 1, 2023. Thus, we request the Department extend the PSLF waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, in order to align with new changes under forthcoming rules and minimize confusion among borrowers. The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to “overhaul” the PSLF program and “make it live up to its promise” by allowing “all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan.”4 To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.5 Moreover, the limited waiver is also a lifeline for Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) borrowers who, for the first time, have seen their payments acknowledged in the PSLF program. Last summer the Department called the treatment of public servants with FFEL loans “a matter of equity,”6 but a single year of flexibility has not been enough to overcome years of “inaccurate information about eligibility for PSLF or Direct Consolidation Loans, resulting in deceptive acts or practices.”7 Data indicates that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million “cumulative PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balance[s],” compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year that could potentially be eligible for PSLF.8 As the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond warns, this could leave millions of public servants at risk of missing out on the benefits of the PSLF waiver and its associated loan forgiveness.9  As more than 20 state attorneys general have pointed out, public service workers—particularly those in healthcare and education—continue to face challenges such as burnout and personal sacrifice to keep our nation safe during the pandemic and recovery.10 For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs. These borrowers may qualify for immediate forgiveness—especially given the PSLF waiver—or, at minimum, advance their progress towards PSLF relief. For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.  Importantly, extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards PSLF. According to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office, 200,000 active-duty military service members have federal student loans—about half of whom have balances over $13,000.11 Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the purposes of PSLF.12 The Department is currently working to ensure that all federal agencies or departments “automatically [provide] credit toward PSLF for military service members and federal employees.”13 These data matches are critical to ensuring that the agency can identify which borrowers are eligible for PSLF and provide them automatic relief. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit—maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver. Since the deadline of October 31, 2022 to qualify for PSLF under the waiver program is rapidly approaching, we ask that the Department extend this deadline in order to ensure that all public servants with federal student loans are able to benefit from this historic waiver. Given the issues stated above, we also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers.

Specially, the letter urges the agency to eliminate the ongoing, unprecedented processing delays, improve customer service, extend the suspension of automated notices and collections, and continue making maximum use of overtime and surge teams. “Since last year, numerous Members of Congress in the House and Senate have sent several letters regarding customer service issues, processing delays, and the outstanding backlog of returns,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. “Yet, we are writing again to urge the IRS to extend the suspension of automated collections, continue the pause on automated notices, keep its surge teams in place until hiring challenges and processing backlogs are adequately addressed.” In a Senate Finance Committee Hearing last April, IRS Commissioner Rettig estimated that the agency would return to a “healthy state” by the end of 2022 and expected to hire 10,000 customer service representatives between this year and next year. Yet, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), the paper return backlog has actually increased by 1.3 million and the agency has only been able to meet 12 percent of its hiring goals. Additionally, refunds are currently taking six months or longer on average compared to previous historical processing times of four to six weeks. The lawmakers added, “[W]e believe that the IRS must take additional steps to improve customer service issues, decrease processing delays, and work-down the backlog of paper returns and correspondence by continuing the maximum use of overtime and surge teams, as well as the continued suspension of automated notices and collections—which have been critical in reducing pandemic-related tax return and correspondence backlogs.” Sen. Menendez and his colleagues have long sounded the alarm about customer service issues and processing backlogs plaguing the IRS. In March, Sens. Menendez and Cassidy, along with Rep. Spanberger, led more than 100 Senate and House colleagues in a bicameral, bipartisan effort to press Commissioner Rettig for the IRS’s lack of a comprehensive plan to remedy the numerous problems affecting taxpayers as this filing season is already well underway. The month prior, Sen. Menendez and Rep. Spanberger led another bicameral effort with 45 colleagues urging the IRS to take immediate actions to reduce its massive backlog and improve its customer service during the 2022 tax filing season. Shortly after sending out the letter, the IRS announced it would be putting together a second surge team to help address the massive backlogs and continue to improve customer service.   In late January, Sens. Menendez and Cassidy, along several members of the House, led more than 200 colleagues in a bipartisan and bicameral letter calling on the IRS to provide penalty relief for taxpayers – spurring the agency to temporarily halt some, but not all of the penalty notifications. Sens. Menendez and Cassidy also used IRS Commissioner Rettig last year to keep phone lines open while addressing the unprecedented backlog of unprocessed returns and to take concrete steps that will allow them to perform basic functions well such as answering phones, providing quality online and in-person services, and processing returns in a timely manner. Joining Sens. Menendez and Cassidy in the Senate in signing this letter are Sens.

Since last year, numerous Members of Congress in the House and Senate have sent several letters regarding customer service issues, processing delays, and the outstanding backlog of returns. Several Members of Congress have urged you to provide penalty relief for taxpayers, have continually pressed the agency to pursue maximum overtime options for staff who are working on the backlog and on surge teams, and have asked the agency to deploy additional surge teams and other resources in an effective manner to reduce the backlog. Yet, we are writing again to urge the IRS to extend the suspension of automated collections, continue the pause on automated notices, keep its surge teams in place until hiring challenges and processing backlogs are adequately addressed. In a Senate Finance Committee Hearing on April 7, 2022, you estimated that the IRS would return to a “healthy state” by the end of 2022 and that the IRS expected to hire 10,000 customer service representatives between this year and next year. Yet, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), the paper return backlog has actually increased by 1.3 million from the same point as last year and that the IRS was only able to meet 12 percent of its hiring goals for processing center employees earlier this year.1 NTA also noted that the IRS has not met its 5,000 employee hiring goal for submission processing positions—falling short by 3,417 employees, and that while historically the IRS has paid refunds from paper returns in four to six weeks, refunds are currently taking six months or longer.2 Accordingly, we believe that the IRS must take additional steps to improve customer service issues, decrease processing delays, and work-down the backlog of paper returns and correspondence by continuing the maximum use of overtime and surge teams, as well as the continued suspension of automated notices and collections—which have been critical in reducing pandemic-related tax return and correspondence backlogs. Additionally, the IRS must improve its recruitment and retention efforts to adequately address the backlog and increase levels of taxpayer service. In order to gauge the extent of hiring and processing challenges still facing the Agency, we ask that you provide answers to the following questions no later than August 19, 2022: Processing Backlogs:Hiring Challenges:We appreciate your consideration of these requests and attention to these issues. Sincerely,  ###See moreDecember 19, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-lauds-bipartisan-pact-act-as-it-becomes-law-of-the-land,"SEWELL, N.J.  – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today celebrated the signing of bipartisan legislation into law, which will expand health care and benefits to more than 3.5 million veterans across the country who were exposed to toxins while serving in the military. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or PACT Act, includes the Senator’s Improving Benefits for Gulf War Veterans Act, which will expand access to essential benefits for veterans who served in the Gulf War and other wars in the region.“Simply put, the Honoring our PACT Act lives up to its name — it honors our pact to every single American who answered the call, who put their country and their community before themselves,” said Sen. Menendez. “For me, honoring our veterans goes beyond recognizing them for their service — it’s about living up to our commitment to serve those who so selflessly served us. And when we dedicate ourselves to securing healthcare and benefits for those who have been exposed to toxic substances — from Agent Orange to burn pits — we are living up to this responsibility.”  The PACT Act will address illnesses from exposure to toxic burn pits and expand presumptions related to Agent Orange exposure. The bill will also add 23 burn pit and toxic exposure-related conditions to the VA’s list of service presumptions, including hypertension. The bill would also strengthen federal research on toxic exposure and improve the VA’s resources and training for toxic-exposed veterans. It will also ensure veterans have adequate resources by investing in VA claims processing and health care facilities and boost the department’s workforce.The Senator’s provision’s will also extend to veterans who served in wars in the Gulf and who have experienced unexplained chronic symptoms known as the “Gulf War Illness”, which can include symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, memory loss, insomnia, and respiratory disorders. Exposure to pesticides and other toxins have been linked to these symptoms.Sen. Menendez celebrated yesterday’s signing of the PACT Act into law by President Biden in Sewell, alongside Gloucester County Commissioner Denice DiCarlo and local veterans.This legislation is named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson who was deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard. He died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. In June, Sen. Menendez joined veterans in Bayonne calling on his Senate colleagues to pass the bill without delay. Sen. Menendez first introduced the Improving Benefits for Gulf War Veterans Act last year.The Improving Benefits for Gulf War Veterans Act as Section 405 of the PACT Act would:Permanently extend the period of eligibility for benefitsExpand veteran eligibility for VA benefitsImprove training for VA staffCreate a single, uniform disability based questionnaire (DBQ)Earlier today, Sen. Menendez attended events in Atlantic and Cape May Counties highlighting federal funding that will have a direct impact in South Jersey communities. ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Sen. Menendez, along with Senator Cory Booker, secured the funding for these projects in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan (ARP), respectively.“These federal grants we’re celebrating today will help create a safer, more resilient U.S. 40 and renovate a portion of the Atlantic City boardwalk that has stood for over a century,” said Sen. Menendez. “By making these much needed upgrades to U.S. 40 we will have road infrastructure that can better withstand severe storm surges and prevent the crashes that occur when the highway becomes flooded. By upgrading the boardwalk, we will also be supporting small businesses that depend on tourism and will create more than a hundred new jobs to support the local economy. Simply put, these projects will help make sure that Atlantic City can continue to thrive and grow for the next century of its history.”[CLICK TO VIEW SENATOR’S REMARKS]“This project is the start of what we expect to be a complete revamping of the Atlantic City Boardwalk, and the best part is the taxpayers will not be paying a dime for this,” said Mayor Small. “Senator Menendez understands how important this is for both Atlantic City and the great state of New Jersey. I want to thank him for supporting our vision of rebuilding our iconic Boardwalk.”The $20 million dollar project to elevate U.S. 40, designed to address flooding and safety issues along the route, is funded under the historic investments made in the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) Discretionary Grant program through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed into law last year.The $6 million dollar project along the Atlantic City Boardwalk is funded under the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) $240 million competitive American Rescue Plan Travel, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation program. EDA awarded $510 million in grants to all 50 states and territories in 2021. The two programs are designed to accelerate the recovery of communities that rely on the travel, tourism and outdoor recreation sectors.The funding will help support the reconstruction of 1,200 feet of the boardwalk, from Florida to Missouri Avenues, which is over 100 years old. The project will also support the local tourism economy and is estimated to generate $5 million in private investment and create 125 jobs. The estimated cost to replace the entire boardwalk is $60 million.###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Menendez.  “That’s why the Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program, administered by the US Department of Agriculture is so important. This program provides relief to rural hospitals like Cape Regional — helping them stay open to provide essential care while also expanding the services they provide to the community like a new COVID wing.”[CLICK TO VIEW THE SENATOR’S REMARKS] “USDA Rural Development is proud to have partners like New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez who understand that investing in healthcare and community facilities contributes to the overall well-being, economic development and sustainability of rural America,” said USDA Administrator of Rural Housing Services, Joaquin Altoro.“I am really pleased that USDA Rural Development can provide Cape Regional Medical Center, Inc., with an Emergency Rural Health Care Grant in the amount of $989,300 to help them purchase critical, potentially life-saving medical equipment, and provide the best care possible to their patients,” said USDA Rural Development New Jersey State Director Jane Asselta. “USDA Rural Development is committed to ensuring that people in New Jersey’s rural communities have access to quality healthcare in the communities where they live, work, and raise their families.”“On behalf of the Cape Regional Health System Board of Trustees, the members of the Cape Regional Foundation Board, and Cape Regional Team members, I would like to thank the USDA Rural Development Program for their funding through the Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program to support the expansion of our Emergency Department,” said  Joanne, Carrocino, FACHE, President and CEO, Cape Regional Health System. “These vital funds will enable Cape Regional Medical Center to purchase essential equipment to outfit COVID treatment bays with a negative pressure air handling system, as well as dedicated radiology equipment including CT-scan, X-ray, and ultrasound.  These additions will reduce waiting times for testing and diagnoses and provide more efficient, personalized high-quality care to the residents and visitors of Cape May County.” In addition to the grant for Cape Regional Medical Center, USDA announced funding for five additional New Jersey organizations that have been impacted by the COVID pandemic. Grants will be used for a wide range of purposes, including acquiring new healthcare equipment, providing improved access to food in rural areas, expanding health care services, and replacing funds lost due to the COVID pandemic.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Sen. Menendez has fought for funding for New Jersey hospitals, health care centers, and for PPE for frontline health care professionals. Sen. Menendez proudly supported the American Rescue Plan which dedicated $7.6 billion for Community Health Centers (CHCs), $10 billion in Defense Production Act (DPA) spending to meet the need for medical supplies and PPE, and $35 billion to make Affordable Care Act (ACA) plan premiums more affordable, amongst other provisions.Sen. Menendez has also called for an independent, 9/11-style commission to investigate the country’s response to the pandemic and introduced the bipartisan National Coronavirus Commission Act last summer. Key provisions of the Senator’s bill were included in the PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was passed out of Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee by a wide bipartisan margin earlier this year in March.After visiting Cape May County, Sen. Menendez will be attending events in Atlantic and Gloucester Counties to highlight federal funding and recent legislation passed into law.###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/video-menendez-celebrates-national-health-center-week-announces-major-funding-for-njs-fqhcs,"NEWARK, N.J. - U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, which sets national health policy, today joined health care professionals at Newark Community Health Center to celebrate National Health Center Week. The senator, a champion of community health centers, underscored the importance of fully funding Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which offer a wide-range of high-quality health care services in communities throughout New Jersey.“Combined with all the other provisions to lower everyday costs, the Inflation Reduction Act, as the bill is called, makes sure that more families here in Newark can afford to go to the doctor at the community health center closest to them. We did all this because we know that CHCs — and their staffs — know how hard it is to get care. You know that early detection and regular check-ups are the difference between catching something at Stage I vs Stage IV,” said Sen. Menendez. “And you know that, when it comes to the health and wellbeing of a community — especially uninsured and medically underserved communities — the work you do here matters. As your senior U.S. Senator, I see it as my job in Washington to support the work that goes on here at Newark Community Health.”Just yesterday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced nearly $90 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding to community health centers across the country. New Jersey’s health centers are set to receive a combined total of $1,440,200, including $65,000 for Newark Community Health Center.In New Jersey, 24 community health centers operate 135 sites, providing a wide randy of health care services to nearly 600,000 New Jerseyans.Sen. Menendez was last at Newark Community Health Center in March when he announced his co-sponsorship of the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 permonth. Key provisions from this bill were included in the historic Inflation Reduction Act that passed the Senate on Sunday to reduce the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare. Unfortunately, Republicans blocked efforts to ensure this also benefited individuals with private insurance.Sen. Menendez has long championed community health centers, recognizing their importance in low and middle income neighborhoods. In the ARP, the senator secured $7.6 billion for FQHCs, including $129,653,750 for FQHCs in New Jersey. In 2019, Sen. Menendez joined his colleagues in introducing theCommunity Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which would provide a five-year extension of mandatory CHC funding. As an author of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Sen. Menendez championed an amendment that provided CHCs with $11 billion in mandatory funding over five years, expiring in 2015, for new and existing programs to expand access to health care services. Since 2015, Sen. Menendez has helped secure separate, two-year extensions for the program.Sen. Menendez also supported an amendment included in the ACA’s final passage that requires private insurance plans on the exchange to fully reimburse FQHCs at no less than the same rate as Medicaid in order to ensure the economic vitality of community health centers and properly recognize them for the valuable role they play in the American health care system.###See moreDecember 20, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-sires-outline-historic-inflation-reduction-acts-impact-on-nj-families-seniors,"ELIZABETH, N.J. - U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.), and Congressmen Albio Sires (D-N.J.-08), were joined today by seniors and advocates to highlight the impacts that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will have on hardworking families across New Jersey. The bill, which passed the Senate on Sunday, will lower the cost of prescription drugs, expand health care access, create millions of good-paying jobs, and make critical investments in the fight against climate change. The House will vote on the bill later this week.“This legislation will transform the lives of millions by lowering the cost of prescription drugs to help seniors struggling to make ends meet, including provisions I authored like the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap and smoothing provision for Medicare beneficiaries, and strengthening health care access for millions of working-class families by extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act for three years,” said Sen. Menendez.  “Too often our seniors have had to choose between affording their medication and putting food on the table, or taking a vacation, or simply enjoying their senior years. This bill will end these horror stories once and for all while also supercharging our nation’s fight against climate change by putting us on a path to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030. With this bill, we are closing tax loopholes abused by the largest corporations, creating millions of good-paying jobs, and cutting costs for American families.“This past weekend, Senate Democrats took a historic step forward to reduce consumer costs, combat climate change, and implement a fairer tax code,” said Sen. Booker. “The Inflation Reduction Act includes provisions that are broadly supported by the American public, including allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors, and making the largest Congressional investment ever to address the existential threat of climate change. It also includes critical environmental justice priorities that will help address legacy and ongoing pollution in overburdened communities that are disproportionately Black and Brown. This is a transformative piece of legislation, and despite its imperfections, I am deeply proud to have voted for it.”“I applaud Senator Menendez and Senator Booker for their dedicated work to pass the Inflation Reduction Act which will benefit so many New Jerseyans. Over the years, I have heard from many constituents who had to choose between expensive but essential medication and other necessities,” said Rep. Albio Sires. This historic bill will help put money back into the pockets of those constituents while ensuring they have access to quality health care. I look forward to voting in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act when it comes before the House and sending it to the President’s desk for his signature.”“I am proud the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Rep. Donald M. Payne, Jr.  “This bill will clean the environment, create new jobs in energy technology, make sure corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and significantly reduce the prices of life-saving medications for millions of Americans.  I am extremely disappointed that the majority of Senate Republicans refused to allow American diabetics with private insurance to benefit from a $35 cap on insulin payments.  As a diabetic and insulin user, I understand that diabetics need this medication to stay alive.  Compared to Canada and European countries, American companies have been overcharging for insulin and profiting off the backs of diabetics for years.  It forces too many diabetics to choose between food or medicine.  No American should have to make that choice.  However, this is a good bill that will provide numerous benefits to American families and the economy and I plan to support it when the bill comes up for a House floor vote this week.”The Inflation Reduction Act will transform the lives of New Jerseyans by lowering the cost of prescription drugs to help seniors struggling to make ends meet. The bill includes a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap and smoothing provision for Medicare beneficiaries authored by Sen. Menendez. More than 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries in New Jersey will see relief with lower prescription drug costs.“On behalf of our 1.2 million Garden State members and all older New Jersey residents, AARP New Jersey thanks Senator Menendez and Senator Booker for their historic votes to pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and moving one step closer to providing real relief from out-of-control prescription drug prices,” said Evelyn Liebman, AARP New Jersey Director of Advocacy. “This legislation will help bring down costs for seniors and families, helping them afford the medicines they need to stay healthy. We have been working for nearly two decades to allow Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for medications. We can't overstate what a monumental improvement this prescription drug package will be for older Americans struggling to afford their medications. We urge the House to move quickly and enact this momentous reform.”The bill will strengthen health care access for millions of working families by extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act for three years. More than 260,000 New Jerseyans will continue to receive ACA tax credits.“Working families in New Jersey and around the country continue to suffer disproportionally from the effects of the pandemic. The Inflation Reduction Act, followed by the climate justice provisions are truly historic, albeit not enough,” said Kevin Brown, SEIU 32BJ Executive Vice President and NJ State Director. “In addition to tangible positive changes, we hope to see additional measures to expand investment in home care, child care, and the creation of good union jobs for all.”The bill is also a historic victory in the fight against climate change, marking the most impactful legislation Congress has ever passed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and putting the nation on a path to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030, while also closing tax loopholes abused by the largest corporations.""The Senate took a massive step forward in the fight against climate change by passing the Inflation Reduction Act,"" said Ed Potosnak, Executive Director, New Jersey LCV. ""This legislation will invest $370 billion to curb climate pollution — the largest amount in history. And it will do it by building a new 21st century economy powered by green energy that will create millions of good-paying union jobs while investing billions of dollars in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of environmental racism and disinvestment. We want to thank Senators Menendez and Booker for their leadership in this decades-long fight to head off a climate crisis, and we call on the House of Representatives to pass this legislation later this week so it can go to President Biden for his signature.""Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 means:### See moreDecember 27, 2022

This is not a perfect bill – it does not repeal the Republican-imposed SALT cap or reform our broken immigration system – but the benefits of this legislation for New Jersey families cannot be understated. “Today, Democrats proved yet again we can deliver results for the American people, from our seniors to our small business owners to everyone in between. I will continue working to find a path forward for repealing the SALT cap for hard-working middle-class families and building a more humane and inclusive immigration system for all. My Democratic colleagues and I will never stop working to deliver real substantive solutions to address the most pressing challenges facing our nation.”###See moreDecember 19, 2022

While I fully support lowering prescription drug costs for millions of seniors, extending health care coverage subsidies for three years, and tackling the climate crisis for our children’s futures, I conceded on other key priorities for the state of New Jersey like lifting Republican-imposed SALT cap, to protect the agreement on this reconciliation package.“In order to maintain the integrity of this historic legislation, I will not only vote no on any immigration amendment introduced, but I will vote no on the final bill if any harmful immigration amendments are adopted. It has always been my north star to pass a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants that call our country home, secure our borders, and fix our broken immigration system, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is not the right legislative vehicle to address these deeply needed reforms to our immigration system.“I urge my Democratic colleagues to stand united and vote no on ALL amendments, regardless of the underlying policy and regardless of which party offers them.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-warren-lay-bare-republican-hypocrisy-after-bill-to-stop-anti-abortion-disinformation-is-blocked,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) went to the Senate Floor this week toseek unanimous consent for their bill, the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation (SAAD) Act, which would crack down on false advertising related to abortion services by so-called crisis pregnancy centers (CPC). The legislation, which was introduced alongside 14 other Senate Democrats last month, would direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising related to the provision of abortion services and collect penalties from organizations in violation. Sen. Marshall (R-Kan.) objected to the unanimous consent request, walking off the Senate floor after Sens. Menendez and Warren tried to find areas of agreement on the need to protect the personal medical information of pregnant women.“Make no mistake, crisis pregnancy centers are anti-abortion organizations who cloak themselves in benign language about ‘providing answers’ and ‘offering advice.’ They have an agenda — namely, to steer women away from abortion through a combination of guilt, concealment, harassment, and downright lies,” said Sen. Menendez. “Because they claim only to provide so-called educational services, they can promote these lies while failing to protect the personal information of pregnant women since they are not bound by federal privacy laws like HIPAA. Women in America deserve the truth and that’s what our bill aims to do.”According to the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Public Health and Surveillance, there are more than 2,500 CPCs in the United States, though some anti-abortion groups claim that the number is closer to 4,000. One study found that, on average, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics nationwide by an average of 3 to 1, but in some states, the ratio is as high as 11 to 1.The legislation is supported by: Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Center for Reproductive Rights, Advocates for Youth, American Atheists, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Public Health Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Brooklyn for Reproductive and Gender Equity, Catholics for Choice, Clearinghouse on Women's Issues, Families USA, Feminist Majority Foundation, Guttmacher Institute, In Your Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda, Jewish Women International, Medical Students for Choice, MomsRising, National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, National Birth Equity Collaborative, National Council of Jewish Women, National Council of Jewish Women – New York, National Council of Jewish Women – Greater Miami, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, National Health Law Program, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, National Organization for Women, National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women's Health Network, Nurses for Sexual and Reproductive Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, Population Institute, Power to Decide, Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Reproductive Equity Now, Sexuality Information Education Council of the U.S., SisterReach, and United for Reproductive & Gender Equity.The full text of the legislation can be found HERE.  ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

The letter comes after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined the bank $37.5 million for illegally accessing consumers’ credit reports to open fake checking and credit accounts, accrue fees, and increase profits. In the letter, the senators highlight how U.S. Bank, the nation’s fifth largest commercial bank, sought to increase sales of its products and services by rewarding employees who met sales goals and generated more revenue for the bank through an incentive-compensation program. This paved the way for unlawful actions that jeopardized the financial security of its customers in an effort to inflate the bank’s revenue stream. “Under this pressure, employees engaged in unlawful activity by utilizing customers’ personal identifying information to open deposit accounts, apply for and issue credit cards, and open lines of credit from 2010 to 2020.  All of these products accrued fees and increased profits for U.S. Bank – to the detriment of its own customers,” wrote the senators. “The CFPB found that these practices violated federal consumer laws and violated individual consumers’ control over their data privacy.” “Banks are entrusted with customers’ most sensitive information in support of applications for mortgages, loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, and financial services necessary to participate in the economy,” added the senators. “It is unacceptable that U.S. Bank provided incentives to and pressured its employees to take advantage of their unique access to a veritable treasure trove of sensitive, personal information to sign up unsuspecting customers for fee-generating financial products and services.” Sen. Menendez has long led the fight to protect consumers from banks’ malicious practices. Last month, he joined several of his colleagues in reintroducing the Fair Access to Financial Services Act, which would hold financial institutions accountable for discriminatory practices. He has also led recent efforts to hold the big banks that own Zelle accountable for not doing enough to protect consumers against widespread fraud and scams on the peer-to-peer money transfer network. In 2016, Menendez along with several of his colleagues, including Chairman Brown, also led the charge against Wells Fargo after it was found that the bank opened millions of fake customer accounts to boost its revenues to the detriment of its customers. A copy of the letter is available HERE and below: Dear Mr. Cecere:  We are deeply concerned by the reported misconduct by U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) that led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB” or “Bureau”) to issue a consent order and $37.5 million fine against U.S. Bank for illegally using consumer data to issue credit cards and lines of credit and to open deposit accounts for consumers without their knowledge or consent. Troublingly, this is the second time in less than a decade where the federal government has sought accountability and redress by a major bank for perpetuating this practice – since 2016, Wells Fargo has paid a $3 billion penalty in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in addition to a $100 million fine to the CFPB, a $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and a $50 million fine to the City and County of Los Angeles for unlawfully opening fake accounts for millions of customers without their approval.  The CFPB’s consent order tells a problematic story. According to the Bureau, U.S. Bank, the nation’s fifth largest commercial bank, sought to increase sales of its products and services by rewarding employees who met sales goals and generated more revenue for the bank through an incentive-compensation program.  Under this pressure, employees engaged in unlawful activity by utilizing customers’ personal identifying information to open deposit accounts, apply for and issue credit cards, and open lines of credit from 2010 to 2020.  All of these products accrued fees and increased profits for U.S. Bank – to the detriment of its own customers.  The CFPB found that these practices violated federal consumer laws and violated individual consumers’ control over their data privacy Banks are entrusted with customers’ most sensitive information in support of applications for mortgages, loans, credit cards, deposit accounts, and financial services necessary to participate in the economy.  It is unacceptable that U.S. Bank provided incentives to and pressured its employees to take advantage of their unique access to a veritable treasure trove of sensitive, personal information to sign up unsuspecting customers for fee-generating financial products and services.   We request that U.S. Bank brief Congressional staff on the matter.  Additionally, to understand the full scope of the problem, we request responses to the following by September 6, 2022:   The Committee plans to hold its Annual Wall Street Oversight Hearing in September of this year and we look forward to your participation.  ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-highlights-economic-benefits-of-mitigation-from-climate-change,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, in today’s hearing “Borrowed Time: The Economic Costs of Climate Change,” highlighted the cost benefit of funding mitigation projects as communities across New Jersey continue to face repetitive flooding due to severe weather events and nor’easters resulting from climate change.“Flooding is one of the most expensive and most frequent natural disasters in the United States and climate change is only going to intensify these events and it is critical that our communities are prepared for the challenges that lie ahead,” said Sen. Menendez, citing the example of the Hoboken Rebuild by Design mitigation initiative. “For every dollar we invest in mitigation, the federal government saves $6 in disaster relief spending.”“That’s why I introduced the bipartisan NFIP-RE Act, which supercharges billions of dollars for pre-disaster mitigation and resilience in the nation’s most flood prone areas.  I hope we can get to that because that is not only to save us money and save lives, it is also going to create a lot of jobs along the way,” added Sen. Menendez.In response to Republican senators who said Democrats were “over-reacting” about the threat of climate change, Sen. Menendez highlighted how the climate is costing lives and livelihoods across the country.“The suggestion that […] those of us who are concerned about climate changes are an overreaction, well, look at the wildfires in the West – how many acres have to go up in smoke? Look at the flooding in Kentucky, how many lives have to be lost? Look at the droughts in the Midwest where farmers are producing a fraction of the crop they would normally produce [. . .] “These are tectonic shifts that are affecting our very lives and livelihoods and that’s an overreaction? I think Mother Nature is not overreacting, she is sending us a message.”The Senator also highlighted how mass transit and transit-oriented communities can play an important role in addressing climate change, such as through his Livable Communities Act which encourages local communities to develop bold, innovative solutions that reflect their unique character, while leveraging existing assets, including access to transit to help revitalize neighborhoods, spur economic development, create jobs, and address their affordable housing needs.Sen. Menendez has long been a leader in the fight to fund flood mitigation projects in New Jersey such as the Hoboken Rebuild by Design Project in Hoboken for which he helped secure $230 million in funding. Last November, Sen. Menendez introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to extend the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for five years, while implementing a series of sweeping reforms to address the waste, abuse and mismanagement plaguing the system. ###See moreDecember 19, 2022

Just the opposite.”Related IssuesForeign Relations

Before the committee were Chairman Menendez’s long-time Senior Advisor and Counselor, Mr. Rolfe Michael Schiffer, nominated to serve as an Assistant Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development; Mr. Nathaniel Fick to be Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace and Digital Policy; Ms. Rachna Sachdeva Korhonen to be U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Mali; the Honorable Lucy Tamlyn to be Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Ms. Jessica Davis Ba to be U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Cote D’Ivoire.“Let me thank you Mr. Chairman and the Ranking Member for presiding over this nominations hearing. One of the most important things we do as members of the Committee is oversee nominations. We need the help of all of our colleagues in getting through the nominations. I appreciate both you and the Ranking Member for doing this. Thank you for the courtesy for being able to go.Congratulations to the nominees before us today. We thank you and all of your families for your service to our country.Let me take a few minutes of personal privilege to speak about Michael Schiffer, who has been my long-time Senior Advisor and Counselor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.He is one of the leading foreign policy minds in Washington, having also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia. He is a respected expert on Asia with a network of relationships across the continent. I never forgot … when I was on the Committee in 2006 and started going with Michael to visit Asia. It would be very interesting to me when heads of state – including when I was Chairman of the Committee previously – would say ‘hello Mr. Schiffer’ before they would say hello to me. It shows the depth of the relationships he has.I have long relied on Michael’s counsel, expertise, and judgement in dealing with some of the most vexing issues facing the Committee.No one is more qualified or more deserving of this nomination than he is.He is dedicated and committed to values-based foreign policy that champions freedom, human rights and democracy. He will be a strong advocate for those principles across the continent, and will work to ensure that USAID programming reflects our values and our interests.And he is someone who doesn’t hesitate to speak his mind.Stories abound about his willingness to speak truth to power abound. Don’t worry, Michael, I won’t share them here today. But it is an important quality that will serve him well in the executive branch as he ensures that USAID has a seat at the table and a voice in the interagency process.It is precisely that kind of leadership that we need in the Administration today. Someone who knows the right approach on assistance to Asia and how to get it there.I appreciate all of those great assets. I will not continue with my remarks because then my time will be eaten up for questions, so I will include them in the record.Michael thank you for your excellent work with us.” *These delivered remarks were lightly edited for clarity purposes.###Related IssuesForeign Relations

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/sfrc-chairman-menendez-opens-historic-floor-debate-for-nato-protocols-for-sweden-finland,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today opened Senate debate on and spoke in support of ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) protocols for Finland and Sweden.“Should we let ruthless autocrats threaten the security of democratic nations and American allies or think they can launch ground invasions against peaceful neighbors without consequences? No. Should we let the fears of an irrational dictator guide United States foreign policy? No. Should we appease a brutal butcher like Putin? No,” Chairman Menendez said. “The European public says no. The American public says no. And I hope the United States Senate says no as well.” “There is tremendous urgency and a strong case for inviting these countries. … Indeed, the qualifications of these two prosperous, democratic nations are outstanding and will serve to strengthen the NATO alliance,” Chairman Menendez added. “These are two steadfast NATO and U.S. allies with strong military and democratic institutions. They have every reason to participate in collective defense against potential Russian aggression. And NATO has every reason to embrace and welcome them into the alliance without delay.”Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below:“Mr. President, while I know the Senate and the American people’s attention has been drawn in many different directions over the past couple of months, and while we are still working through numerous legislative proposals to address real challenges that families across the United States are facing – from high food prices to gas prices to devastating natural disasters exacerbated by climate change – I am here today to encourage my colleagues to support the United States’ taking an important step forward in affirming our commitment to freedom, democracy, and collective defense.To send a signal to the world that we will unite against those actors who seek to destabilize the supply of food that threatens hunger for millions of people all over the world – who seek to weaponize energy in the middle of an unprecedented heat wave – and who think they can simply invade a neighbor with no consequences.As we grapple with the complex geopolitics, Putin’s generals are bombing Ukrainian cities. His forces are still largely blockading Ukrainian ports. His soldiers are committing war crimes.These are not only attacks on brave Ukrainians – they are attacks on the rule of international law of which we all want to live. They are attacks on the international order. They are attacks on one of the most deeply held American principles—of a nation’s right to determine its own destiny.And so, Mr. President, I rise today in support of strengthening one of the greatest tools the United States has to bolster our efforts to protect those very democratic values and our citizens – the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, known as NATO – one of the greatest alliances the world has ever seen.Welcoming Sweden and Finland into the NATO alliance will signal the United States’ ongoing commitment to peace, stability and democracy in Europe and around the world.Enlarging NATO is exactly the opposite of what Putin envisioned when he ordered his tanks to invade Ukraine.Indeed, he may have been trying to test the resolve of the alliance, and I am pleased that we have passed that test with overwhelming unity of vision and purpose.He hoped to quickly gobble up territory to correct what he has called, ‘the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century’—which in essence is the dissolution of what was the Soviet Union – with little resistance from the countries who formally united in a values-based front against the ills of that vision for Europe and for the world.But instead of a quick strike, Ukrainians – from soldiers to school teachers – bravely fought back. Instead of a Russian coup in Kyiv, President Zelenskyy rallied his nation. Instead of a divided West, we have been more united than ever.The United States, the overwhelming majority of Europe, and indeed of the entire free world have come together to support Ukraine, to support democracies and the rule of law, and to defend against brazen authoritarian aggression worldwide.However, despite the fact that Putin’s distorted worldview has run into the reality of a re-energized North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this has not dissuaded him.This has not tempered his resentment of the West.This has not stopped him from using food and gas as a weapon of war.This has not curbed the threat of further Russian aggression.And so it is absolutely critical that we take this historic step today and provide our advice and consent to ratifying the accession protocols for Sweden and Finland to join the NATO alliance.More than ever, it is crystal clear that NATO plays a vital role for the security of the United States and as a bulwark in protecting peace and democracies throughout the world.Seventy years ago, democratic nations of Europe and the United States came together to defend the liberty, freedom and individual rights of their citizens from the threat of a militarized Soviet Union.Now—as then—the defensive alliance serves as a bulwark of stability and the rule of law for the people of its member states.Partnering with our values-based partners serves as a force multiplier for our defensive military capabilities to protect our citizens and advance our interests.Indeed, the most famous of the articles of incorporation of NATO – Article 5 – that states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all – has been invoked only once: when terrorists attacked the United States and our NATO allies rallied behind us. Canadian air force was patrolling our skies. NATO joined us in our collective efforts abroad to hunt down those who had perpetrated the attacks of September 11.So we should do nothing in ratification to suggest that we are not committed to Article 5. The U.S. Constitution reigns supreme in all of our actions so we should not sow doubt about our commitment, especially in this time in history.So we are duty-bound to carefully consider who we admit into this alliance. Over the course of its seven-decade history, admission to NATO has been guided by the alliance’s open-door policy as outlined in Article 10 of NATO’s founding document and specific benchmarks that every American administration has used since the founding of NATO.Members must to have a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; fair treatment of minority populations; a commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully; an ability and willingness to contribute to NATO military operations; and a commitment to democratic civil-military relations.Mr. President, Sweden and Finland meet and exceed these benchmarks in every respect.Indeed, the qualifications of these two prosperous, democratic nations are outstanding and will serve to strengthen the NATO alliance.These are two steadfast NATO and U.S. allies with strong military and democratic institutions.They have every reason to participate in collective defense against potential Russian aggression.And NATO has every reason to embrace and welcome them into the alliance without delay.The people of Sweden and Finland and their governments have shown themselves to be strongly supportive of joining NATO. And in many ways, Finland and Sweden are ideal candidates for NATO membership.Both have large, technologically advanced, and growing militaries that are well-positioned to integrate into NATO.Both have partnered with NATO, contributing to operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq.And since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they have strengthened their relations with NATO even further.They have been engaging in dialogue and consultations. They have been exchanging information. And they have been coordinating training and exercises. In fact, given geography and history, Finland and Sweden have long equipped their militaries and prepared their societies for the prospect of Russian aggression. Their participation in NATO would reduce the burden on the United States and the whole military alliance. Finland already spends more than two percent of its GDP on its defense budget, and Sweden has repeatedly publicly committed to reaching that target as soon as possible.On top of all this, these are two nations that are models of good-governance. Two nations that respect and promote human rights.With a few detractors, I am pleased that there will be broad, bipartisan support for admitting Sweden and Finland into NATO. But let me speak to those few detractors.Some critics say they don’t want us to subsidize these wealthy European nations’ security.But of course, that’s not the case. They meet, or will soon meet, the two-percent threshold for military spending.We can count on these nations to pull their own weight. If anything, welcoming Finland and Sweden to NATO will reduce the burden on the United States.There is tremendous urgency and a strong case for inviting these countries. We must act now.For those who say that expanding NATO provokes Russia, I would say that I would say after decades of neutrality that Finland and Sweden have, they have been provoked by Russia's aggression in Ukraine to seek NATO membership.Should we let ruthless autocrats threaten the security of democratic nations and American allies or think they can launch ground invasions against peaceful neighbors without consequences? No.Should we let the fears of an irrational dictator guide United States foreign policy? No.Should we appease a brutal butcher like Putin? No.The European public says no. The American public says no. And I hope the United States Senate says no as well.So today I urge my colleagues to vote yes.Yes to providing advice and consent.Yes to supporting these historic treaties.Yes to welcoming Finland and Sweden – steadfast, loyal allies and beacons for democracy – to NATO.Yes to a Europe that is secure and prosperous.I yield the floor.”Related IssuesForeign Relations

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-blackburn-applaud-passage-of-national-mep-supply-chain-database-act-out-of-the-senate-commerce-committee,"WASHINGTON, D.C. –  U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) today applauded the unanimous passage of the National Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Supply Chain Database Act out of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. This legislation has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S Representatives Norma Torres (D-Calif.) and Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.). The bill would establish a national database with information about the interconnectivity of manufacturers in the United States supply chain. The database would help prevent future supply chain disruptions by offering manufacturers key information as they make decisions on how to retool in critical areas to meet the demand for key products, such as defense supplies, food, and medical devices.""The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep vulnerabilities in our country's national supply chains that continues to affect our long-term economic recovery,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""That's why I am pleased that the Senate Commerce Committee has passed the National MEP Supply Chain Database Act out of committee, and appreciate Sen. Blackburn's partnership in moving this bill forward. As both the House and Senate conference USICA and the COMPETES Act, I look forward to continue working to ensure this bicameral and bipartisan initiative is passed as part of the competition bill that ultimately gets passed by both chambers.This legislation will ensure that we have a better understanding of American manufacturers' capabilities and inventories in order to prevent future disruptions in our national supply chains.""“From baby formula to electronic chips, the supply chain crisis has made accessing important products more difficult for Tennesseans,” said Sen. Blackburn. “This bipartisan legislation will help get our economy back on track by improving transparency for manufacturers and businesses.”As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a national overview of our manufacturing supply chain would help avoid future bottlenecks. During the early stages of the pandemic, states understood what was produced in their states, but were generally unaware of how dependent in-state manufacturing was on out-of-state resources. This legislation would help close this gap in available information about America’s manufacturing supply chains by leveraging the Hollings MEP program of the National Institute Standards and Technology (NIST) to create the National MEP Supply Chain Database and connect MEP centers through this national database. The MEP program is a federal public-private partnership that provides small and medium-sized manufacturers technology-based services these firms need to grow and thrive in today’s economy and create well-paying manufacturing jobs.The MEP National Network includes 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico supported by more than 1,400 advisors and experts at approximately 375 MEP service locations. According to clients surveyed in FY 2020, the MEP National Network helped manufacturers achieve $13.0 billion in sales, $2.7 billion in cost savings, $4.9 billion in new client investments, and helped to create and retain 105,748 U.S. manufacturing jobs.The National MEP Supply Chain Database Act is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry, New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program, and the American Small Manufacturers Coalition.A copy of the bill text can be found HERE.###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-opening-remarks-at-hearing-on-usaid-fy2023-budget-request,"WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered the following opening remarks at this afternoon’s full Committee hearing to review the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) budget request for FY2023. Testifying before the Committee was USAID Administrator Samantha Power. CLICK TO WATCH  “When it comes to responding to natural or man-made disaster, our foreign aid programs should help save the lives of those in dire need around the world not on the basis of politics, but out of moral obligation,” Chairman Menendez said. “When we don’t address economic challenges, it leads to destabilization. When we don’t promote prosperity, it leads to human suffering. When we don’t show up, it gives the bad guys a chance to get a foothold. …This is the standard that has been used for decades, and I trust you are committed to fulfilling that vision at USAID, and to elevating the work of USAID’s development and assistance professionals.” Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below:  “This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee come to order. Administrator Power, thank you for appearing today. I am pleased you have been an engaged partner when it comes to the United States’ humanitarian aid and international development initiatives. While I may not agree with every element of the request, it is refreshing to see a USAID budget proposal that demonstrates seriousness and thoughtfulness. And with the House just passing the Ukraine Supplemental package, which provides nearly 4.4 billion dollars for USAID, I am pleased and hope that we are going to move it quickly in the Senate, maybe as early as tomorrow. Obviously this is a lot of money and we need to make sure that the executive branch engages in meaningful ongoing consultation as the money is being spent, and that we are conducting appropriate oversight. Under the Trump administration, the value of economic development and foreign assistance in advancing U.S. foreign policy was met with skepticism. They hobbled USAID from fulfilling its mission, demoralizing the workforce and risking decades of U.S. investment into some of the most vulnerable parts of the world.  The transactional approach the Trump administration took through USAID towards providing assistance to countries at the start of the pandemic was appalling. When it comes to responding to natural or man-made disaster, our foreign aid programs should help save the lives of those in dire need around the world not on the basis of politics, but out of moral obligation. This is the standard that has been used for decades, and I trust you are committed to fulfilling that vision at USAID, and to elevating the work of USAID’s development and assistance professionals. Obviously our immediate attention is on the fallout of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces have bombed maternity wards and kindergartens. They have used sexual violence as a weapon of war. They have executed civilians, hands tied behind their backs. In addition to these war crimes, Putin’s invasion has precipitated a refugee crisis and exacerbated a major global food security crisis across Africa and the Middle East. As we deliver humanitarian relief in Europe and beyond, the United States must elevate the needs of women, girls, and other at-risk populations and support neighboring countries hosting a huge influx of Ukrainian refugees.  And while addressing this crisis and its fallout, we cannot afford to overlook the rest of the world. When commodity prices soar – that affects everyone. I am extremely concerned about the risk of famine in the Horn of Africa. Additionally, the retreat of democracy in Africa is threatening gains made in the Sahel, and dashing the aspirations for participatory politics of millions across the continent. Whether it is conflict in Ethiopia or kleptocracy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or a coup in Sudan, USAID is America’s first responder, supporting democracy, good governance and providing life-saving assistance to those in need.  Health systems around the globe have been strained from the last two years of the pandemic. COVID hospitalizations and deaths are down but the threat remains. New COVID sub-variants continue to emerge. I am not convinced we are prepared. From vaccine distribution to strengthening our preparedness, this is an issue that effects the safety of everyone on the planet, and remains a national security threat here in the United States. USAID is a critical part of the United States efforts to prevent, detect and respond to future pandemic threats. Along with Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean were hard hit by COVID-19. At the same time the region is struggling against a resurgence of authoritarianism from Cuba to Venezuela and now the consolidation of the region’s third dictatorship in Nicaragua. Violent criminals from El Salvador to Mexico are undermining civilian security, exacerbating the forced migration and refugee crisis across the region. Our neighbors in the hemisphere need our assistance. We need to expand inclusive economic opportunity and strengthen democratic institutions. At a time of such great upheaval and distress, I am reassured that we have a USAID Administrator who bore witness to the siege of Sarajevo, and Putin’s aggression in Chechnya. To successfully provide emergency aid, support democratic governance, empower women and vulnerable populations, USAID must be a place where all Americans can serve. I look forward to hearing your plans for modernizing the workforce to meet today’s challenges. In particular, how you will integrate the Chief Diversity Officer into these efforts. And I hope that by partnering with small businesses here at home, our aid programs can have positive impacts both in the U.S. and abroad. In closing I would like to reinforce just how critical all these efforts are. When we don’t address economic challenges, it leads to destabilization. When we don’t promote prosperity, it leads to human suffering. When we don’t show up, it gives the bad guys a chance to get a foothold. Administrator Power, I know you strongly believe in these principles. And I look forward to your testimony. With let me turn to the Ranking Member for his opening remarks.”See moreNovember 14, 2022

We are deeply disappointed by today’s decision and will work to find solutions to address the Federal Reserve’s ongoing diversity problem.”###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-joins-bipartisan-letter-urging-treasuring-department-to-swiftly-implement-corporate-transparency-act-to-support-russian-sanctions,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Acting Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Himamauli Das, calling on the Treasury Department (Treasury) to swiftly implement the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and provide a timeline for doing so. Implementation of the CTA would upgrade the country’s anti-money laundering laws and help the federal government fully impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs. But FinCEN has proposed only one of three planned CTA rules, and is now four months past the statutory deadline for implementation. “The Treasury Department has yet to finalize the implementation of the CTA—or even set a timetable for its completion… In various hearings last month, both of you could only commit to proposing the second CTA rule by the end of ‘this year.’ These delays run contrary to the clear instructions of Congress, undermine American efforts to respond to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and hinder broader efforts to protect the U.S. financial system against the threat of illicit finance,” wrote the lawmakers. Passed by Congress last year, the CTA is landmark legislation that would upgrade the country’s anti-money laundering laws and address one of the biggest weaknesses in the United States’ anti-money laundering safeguards: anonymous shell companies that hide the true, beneficial owners of assets. Beneficial ownership disclosure, as required by the CTA, is particularly relevant amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since such information is necessary to implement the United States’ historic sanctions against Russian oligarchs and to protect national security and the stability of the U.S. financial system. The lawmakers also acknowledged that FinCEN is working with limited resources and stated that Congress is working to remedy this problem through the appropriations process.The letter was also signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Bill Cassidy (R-La.).Sen. Menendez has long led the call for ensuring the integrity and transparency of the U.S. financial system. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Menendez has led global efforts to sanction Russia and Russian individuals in response to Putin’s unjustifiable war in Ukraine and has led calls to ensure that these sanctions are fully enforced. In March, Sen. Menendez, a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, joined several of his colleagues in introducing the Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act to ensure that Vladimir Putin and Russian elites cannot use digital assets to undermine the international community’s economic sanctions against Russia following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The senator also called for the Treasury Department to close a current loophole in the U.S. sanctions regime by denying Russian nationals the ability to continue making significant deposits at U.S. banks and significant purchases of U.S. securities.The full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Secretary Yellen and Director Das: We write to urge the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to swiftly implement the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Passed by Congress last year, the CTA is landmark legislation to upgrade our country’s anti-money laundering laws. “For years, experts routinely ranked anonymous shell companies—where the true, ‘beneficial’ owners are unknown—as the biggest weakness in our anti-money laundering safeguards.” The CTA directly tackled this problem by requiring FinCEN to create a national registry of beneficial owners of companies within the United States, bolstering our nation’s efforts to combat kleptocracy, transnational crime, terrorism, and other illicit activity.Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has only amplified the importance of the CTA. The federal government cannot properly implement sanctions against Putin and his oligarchs if it does not know the full extent of their holdings. But recent reporting suggests that the Treasury Department presently lacks this information, underscoring the urgent need for beneficial ownership disclosure as required by the CTA to protect America’s financial stability and national security. Nevertheless, the Treasury Department has yet to finalize the implementation of the CTA—or even set a timetable for its completion. We appreciate that FinCEN is working with limited resources, and Congress is working to remedy that through the appropriations process. Still, over four months after the statutory deadline for implementation, FinCEN has only proposed one of its three CTA rules. In various hearings last month, both of you could only commit to proposing the second CTA rule by the end of “this year.” These delays run contrary to the clear instructions of Congress, undermine American efforts to respond to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and hinder broader efforts to protect the U.S. financial system against the threat of illicit finance. For these reasons, we respectfully request that FinCEN immediately accelerate its implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act and provide an update and a detailed timeline on your efforts to do so no later than May 23, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.  ###See moreDecember 13, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-risch-kaine-rubio-introduce-international-trafficking-victims-protection-reauthorization-act-tvpra-of-2022,"WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were joined today by Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in introducing the International Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022, comprehensive legislation to reauthorize and enhance critical programming, policy, and funding essential to the United States’ efforts to combat human trafficking around the world. Building off of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, the senators’ new legislation proposes reforms to expand U.S. efforts relating to combating human trafficking, including forced labor, as well as new requirements for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to integrate prevention efforts into the agency’s global programming. Among other provisions, the bipartisan bill also amends the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act with the aim of ensuring that the commitment and progress of countries toward implementing effective counter-trafficking measures are factors when determining recipients of U.S. development assistance. “Despite our great strides in recent years, human trafficking remains a horrific reality for countless millions of people around the world. Today, as millions of Ukrainian women and children fleeing Putin’s brutal invasion are among those at the greatest risk of being trafficked, we are reminded that traffickers seize any opportunity to exploit people in desperate circumstances, particularly victims of war and conflict,” said Chairman Menendez. “This legislation will strengthen the United States’ ability to prevent and fight human trafficking in all its forms including by expanding prevention efforts at the USAID and increasing the tools available to hold governments to account if they do not take steps to combat human trafficking. I welcome the support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and look forward to working with them to secure swift passage of this legislation so we can ensure renewed U.S. leadership to combat the scourge of human trafficking in every corner of the world.” “Human trafficking is a despicable crime that plagues the most vulnerable around the world. This reauthorization provides the State Department, through the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, important tools to continue to investigate and prosecute traffickers, help prevent further trafficking, and protect victims,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This legislation also includes important reforms that will increase oversight over U.S. anti-trafficking programs. I am proud of the leadership the United States has shown with our efforts to combat and eliminate human trafficking globally.” “Human traffickers victimize millions of people each day. We should make every possible effort to eliminate the scourge of human trafficking in the U.S. and abroad,” said Senator Kaine. “This legislation is necessary to ensure the U.S. has the resources to combat human trafficking, including prosecuting traffickers, improving prevention efforts, and ensuring support for survivors.” “Human trafficking is an urgent global crisis that has caused horrific suffering for millions worldwide,” Senator Rubio said. “This bill will provide the tools to better combat the scourge of human trafficking and hold perpetrators accountable so that women and men around the world can live safely and freely.” Find a copy of the bill summary HERE. Find a copy of the bill text HERE.See moreDecember 20, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-opening-remarks-at-nominations-hearing," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered the below statement at today’s nomination hearing for Admiral Harry Harris to serve as US Ambassador to the Republic of Korea; David Schenker to be the Assistant Secretary of State (Near Eastern Affairs); and Ambassador Tibor Nagy Assistant Secretary of State (African Affairs).His remarks follow:“Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today. We have before us a panel of high-level nominees.  I am a bit dismayed that these nomination hearings have become one of the few opportunities the committee has to really engage on the Administration’s policies.  I have requested more hearings on more topics with Administration witnesses so this committee can exercise its oversight role, and I hope the Chairman will work with me on that going forward. Collectively, these nominees will be taking on some of the most pressing national security challenges at time when goodwill toward our country is on a steep decline, the Administration’s budget proposals are slashing non-military resources, and the crumbs of U.S. credibility were left somewhere between the summits in Canada and Singapore.But on that note, I want to welcome all of the nominees today – you all have demonstrable records of service, expertise and experience in your chosen fields. Admiral Harris, you know that you have accepted this nomination at a time when our allies and adversaries are seriously questioning the U.S. commitment to Asia under the Trump Administration – and at a time when perhaps as never before adept and agile diplomacy is needed on the Korean Peninsula.  Like you, I am fully of the view that it is imperative that we improve our engagement across the region, especially with allies like the Republic of Korea politically, economically, and strategically.President Trump blind-sided everyone, including South Korea, when he carelessly conceded to Kim Jung Un this week something North Korean has long wanted—the cessation of US-South Korean joint military exercises.  In exchange for, well, apparently nothing.  So I am interested in your thoughts about how we strengthen the US-Korea alliance moving forward.From your time as our Pacific Commander, you are well aware of the extent of our challenge with North Korea.  Thank you for your service.  As we consider the outcomes of the Trump-Kim meeting, any strategy to constrain North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs must start with our allies and partners and lead to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Mr. Schenker, in the Middle East, the Trump Administration’s strategy for the U.S. role in the region is somewhere between muddled and missing. If confirmed as the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, you will have responsibility not only to craft and execute policy here in Washington, but also to drive diplomatic implementation in cooperation with our partners and allies. When it comes to Iran, I share the long-sought goal of stopping all of Iran’s nuclear and non-nuclear threats. But I worry that the President’s actions have degraded the very partnerships we need to maintain unity of effort in countering the Iranian regime’s malign activities. Regarding Israel, I share the goal of ensuring that Israel has the resources and support she needs to defend herself.  But I worry that the President’s desire to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria while freezing our stabilization assistance programs and closing doors to refugees are tactics without strategy that, taken together, amount to an abdication of U.S. leadership.  Over the past year, Bashar al-Assad facilitated the activities of violent extremists next door to Israel.  Iran is moving its proxies ever closer to Israel’s borders.  Lebanese Hezbollah is preparing for the next war.  And Russia has demonstrated neither the resolve nor the capability to curb Iran’s actions in Syria. And I hope you share Secretary Pompeo’s commitment—as expressed at his nomination hearing—to sustain programs that address conditions that give rise to transnational terrorist groups, including poor governance, lack of economic opportunity, corruption, and persistent human rights abuses. Finally, I am pleased the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for the Africa Bureau has an impressive record of service to this country. For decades, both Republican and Democratic Presidents, with the help of lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have undertaken an impressive set of initiatives over the years, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act, PEPFAR, MCC Compacts, and Power Africa.The Administration has given us little encouragement on continued cooperation, however.  The President’s unseemly comments about Africa and the steep budget cuts to the 150 account send an alarming signal.While the Administration’s National Security Strategy made lots of promises about its engagement with Africa, the budget requested would in no way facilitate that strategy or secure our interests in countering ISIS or Al-Queda affiliates.Perhaps most troubling, the Administration does not appear to have a whole-of-government approach towards Africa which places emphasis on all of the three D’s: Defense, Diplomacy and Development.  Take Niger: Niger is facing increasing security threats on three fronts. It is also ranked 187 out of 188 on the most recent Human Development Index. The U.S. military has over 800 soldiers deployed to Niger as part of our effort to help that government fight terrorism, four of whom have been killed.  We are building an airfield in Agadez. However we do not have a USAID mission in the country that could help support sustainable governance and economic growth.” ###Related IssuesForeign Relations

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-questions-secretary-yellen-about-impact-that-possible-roe-v-wade-repeal-could-have-on-womens-economic-opportunity,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, today questioned U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about the economic consequences of repealing Roe v. Wade for women and families across the country.“The ability to have full control over one’s reproductive health has real world economic consequences,” stated Sen. Menendez. “According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, current state-level abortion restrictions already cost the U.S. about $105 billion annually due to reduced earnings levels, increased job turnover, and time off for women…For half of the population in America, eliminating a right that has existed for half a century, particularly for low-income and minority women who have already shouldered much of the burden from the COVID pandemic would be a disaster.”In responding to Sen. Menendez, Sec. Yellen emphasized how overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating access to reproductive health care “would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.”The Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) estimated last year in a study that Mississippi, whose restrictive state abortion law is at the center of the Supreme Court’s leaked draft opinion indicating it is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, could suffer from just over $1 billion in economic losses due to its abortion law. According to the IWPR, 505,000 more women of reproductive age would be able to participate in the workforce and earn about $3 billion annually if all the current state-level abortion restrictions are eliminated.[WATCH FULL QUESTIONING HERE]Sen. Menendez also commented on how addressing the immigration visa backlog could help reduce labor shortages and shore up the nation’s supply chain. As of March 2022, there were two job openings for every unemployed American actively seeking work. The industries currently facing the worst labor shortages include construction; transportation and warehousing; accommodation and hospitality; and personal services businesses like salons, dry cleaners, repair services, and undertakers.“The Federal Reserve Chair, [Jerome] Powell, has acknowledged that part of the labor shortage is being fueled by an inordinately high number of retirements. And according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statics, there are now two job openings per unemployed worker in the country. In short, we just don’t have enough people to replace those who are leaving the labor force. Thankfully, there are thousands of hardworking immigrants who are willing to work in the United States if Congress would simply let them,” the Senator added. “…Even leading business groups agree that robust immigration reform is urgently needed to address our labor shortage.”The Senator lastly asked Sec. Yellen about how investing in child care can bolster the nation’s labor market and fuel greater economic recovery. The U.S. is facing an affordability crisis when it comes to the rising costs and inaccessibility of child care services. In 2020, the annual infant care cost in New Jersey was an average of $12,988, or approximately 14.6% of a families’ median income. Nationwide, childcare was one of the largest costs a family faced, averaging $12,300 a year across the country.###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-sherrill-and-lt-gov-oliver-join-with-reproductive-rights-organizations-advocates-and-students-in-rally-for-federal-abortion-rights,"NEWARK, N.J. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) were joined today by Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.-11), and several local and state elected officials, as well as reproductive rights advocates and students for a rally in support of federal abortion rights.Attending the rally were students from Rutgers University, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey, the American Civil Liberties of New Jersey and Garden State Equality. The rally was also attended by New Jersey Senate Majority Leader Teresa Ruiz and Assemblywoman Britnee Timberlake.The rally comes days ahead of a scheduled Senate vote this week to advance legislation that would codify into federal law the right to an abortion. Last week, a draft majority opinion from the Supreme Court was leaked and indicates that the Court is poised to overturn the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide.“Let us be abundantly and unapologetically clear. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land.  It is well-established precedent,” said Sen. Menendez.  “And if you’re the Supreme Court of the United States, the institution entrusted by the Constitution to interpret laws and rights for every person in this nation, you cannot strike down 49 years of precedent on a whim. Supreme Court Justices cannot draft a majority opinion, one that is filled with flawed justifications and racist and sexist assertions, and consider the matter settled. And they most certainly cannot strip the fundamental rights of half the American population without a fight.”CLICK TO VIEW SEN. MENENDEZ’S REMARKS “For decades, Republicans in state legislatures and Congress have proposed draconian abortion bans that seek to control, criminalize, and dehumanize Americans’ most personal health decisions,” said Sen. Booker. “With last week’s draft Supreme Court ruling, we are at a decisive moment in the fight to protect abortion rights. At today’s rally, I was proud to join with fellow New Jersey elected officials, activists, and students to call for the codification of Roe v. Wade into law so that a fundamental right of Americans is protected from ongoing, coordinated attacks.”“This absolute tragedy is the direct result of the continued radicalism of the Republican Party and its turn to the far right,” said Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr.  “Now, women across the country are in jeopardy of falling backwards to a dark past when access to a safe abortion procedure was difficult or impossible. I have always been a proud supporter of a woman’s right to choose because I know that we must trust women to make their own health care decisions rather than dictating to them. There is a solution to this urgent problem that must happen now. Last September, I joined Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in passing the Women’s Health Protection Act. This legislation would guarantee the legal right to an abortion for all women nationwide. The U.S. Senate must act now to pass this bill and, if necessary, Senate leaders must abolish the filibuster to allow an up or down vote to be held. There is no other action that would rise to the urgency of this moment than doing whatever it takes to pass this bill. The American people are watching and they are counting on us to act. We must not let them down.”""As the conservative activist judges of the Supreme Court move to strike down half a century of legal precedent, it is Congress’s responsibility to protect women’s autonomy. I proudly voted to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act in the House last September to ensure women have access to reproductive care without undue restrictions. We rallied here today to call on the Senate to do the same,” said Rep. Sherrill. “Congress works for the people and the vast majority of Americans know and believe in this constitutional right.”“We are at a crisis moment for abortion access in this country,” said Roslyn Rogers Collins, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey. “Today, what seemed to many as almost impossible is almost our reality. But, to be clear: Abortion is still legal in New Jersey and we intend to keep it that way. We must turn outrage into action…we are furious, and WE WILL FIGHT BACK.”“Reproductive freedom is a fundamental human right. Attacks seeking to restrict reproductive health care are rooted in systemic inequities that continue to have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown people. In this moment, when abortion rights are under threat nationwide, it’s as important as ever that states take the lead in ensuring that this right is not only protected, but accessible to all regardless of race, gender identity, income level or immigration status,” said Alejandra Sorto, an advocate with ACLU-NJ. “We look forward to working with Senator Menendez and New Jersey’s congressional delegation on federal protections, and with our state legislature in removing barriers to abortion access that remain in place and to make New Jersey a national leader for reproductive freedom.”""This moment indicates the end of a federal constitutional right to abortion and signals a radical erosion of much constitutional support underlying the rights many of us enjoy. We must be a strong united front because this is a battle for our collective lives and freedoms,"" said D Belinfanti of Garden State Equality. ""Power is not based on the strength of one but the strength of many. Justice is achieved through the resilience of many who’ve been disenfranchised. Our strength is in creating an equitable society. We must stand strong and united.""""As an OBGYN, abortion provider, and woman, I am incredibly worried about what the future for reproductive health care will look like now after the June SCOTUS ruling. This is not a drill - Roe is on the brink of being overturned. Regardless of where you live, this ruling impacts all women and people who can become pregnant,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, OBGYN and Family Planning Specialist. “It impacts all reproductive health providers, whose clinical spaces either may be shut down or overrun with people seeking care from other states. No matter what the Courts decide: abortion is safe, normal, essential health care.  As a physician it is my priority is to ensure that patients can get the timely, compassionate care that they need and deserve - and that will always include abortion care.""“We stand with our political leaders at this critical time,” said Rutgers Newark Chancellor Nancy Cantor. “Certainly this issue will impact our students who we count on to create justice in this world.”CLICK TO VIEW ENTIRE RALLYSens. Menendez and Booker have long been strong defenders of abortion rights. In February, the Senators voted in support of the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that they co-sponsored. Both Senators have long supported Roe in past cases where a challenge was made to weaken or repeal the right to an abortion.Sen. Menendez also signed onto the bicameral amicus brief that was submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court before the oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in support of Jackson Women’s Health Organization. This is the case currently being decided by the Supreme Court and it centers around a Mississippi state law banning abortions after 15 weeks. ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/video-release-menendez-reflects-on-somber-milestone-of-1-million-us-covid-deaths-urges-congress-to-pass-prevent-pandemics-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee that sets national health policy, reflected today on the somber milestone of the United States reaching one million COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic just over two years ago in March 2020. On Wednesday, the United States surpassed one million deaths attributable to COVID-19.“In just over two years, we have lost one million Americans to COVID-19. These were our friends, our family, our neighbors, and our colleagues,” said Sen. Menendez. “Today, we pause and reflect on each person lost to COVID and all those who won’t be able to hug their mother this Sunday, joke with their dads in June, or celebrate each of special moment with their loved one. Their loss is our nation’s loss and we will not let it be in vain.” “While we reflect on this unfathomable loss, we remain committed in our resolve to never let our nation face another pandemic unprepared and we will turn our pain into purpose,” the Senator added. Last week, Sen. Menendez joined with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee and author of the PREVENT Pandemics Act in honoring the 1 million Americans who have died from COVID-19. They also urged their colleagues to pass the emergency COVID funding package and called for a Senate vote on their bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act (S. 3799) to improve the nation’s pandemic preparedness. Joining the Senators were a network of COVID survivor groups, representing more than 350,000 COVID activists, as part of their National Week of COVID Remembrance and Action.   CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCEWhile drawing attention to the tragic milestone of 1 million U.S. COVID deaths, the Senators continued to push for critical emergency COVID funding. It is important to note that more Americans have died from COVID-19 than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined. At the same time, long-COVID symptoms affect as many as 23 million Americans with at least 1 million experiencing debilitating health consequences.The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which Sen. Murray passed out of the HELP committee by a wide bipartisan margin on March 15, addresses factors that hindered the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law would strengthen federal and state preparedness, improve public health response capacity, accelerate research, and combat shortages of lifesaving medical supplies. This legislation includes a provision modeled after Sen. Menendez’s National Coronavirus Commission Act that would create an independent COVID Task Force.See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-ruiz-chc-members-push-for-a-latino-to-fill-the-presidential-vacancy-at-the-federal-reserve-bank-of-dallas,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the highest-ranking Latino in Congress and a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Raul Ruiz, M.D. (D-Calif.-36), Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), led 20 of their CHC colleagues in urging the Federal Reserve Board and the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to prioritize the appointment of a Latino candidate as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas given the growing Latino population nationwide and particularly in the region.“As you know, increasing diversity and Latino representation throughout the Federal Reserve System and the federal government as a whole is critical to ensuring our public sector reflects our communities and the general population. We write to urge you to select one of the many highly qualified Latino candidates to fill the Dallas vacancy,” wrote the lawmakers to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Interim President Meredith Black, and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank Thomas Falk.The lawmakers noted the well-documented diversity problem at the Federal Reserve, citing a recent report to Congress that found that only five percent of the Federal Reserve’s 2021 overall workforce identifies as Hispanic or Latino and of the 274 directors at the Federal Reserve, only 29 identify as Hispanic or Latino. In its 108 years, the Federal Reserve has yet appoint a Latino Federal Reserve Bank president.“The U.S. Hispanic and Latino population, which grew 23% since 2010, accounts for 18.7% of the general population and is 62.1 million strong,” added the lawmakers. “As these trends are expected to continue, it is even more important that individuals in leadership level positions at the Federal Reserve reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our nation and understand how working families experience the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve has a key opportunity to help accomplish this in District 11, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ area of responsibility, which serves a population that is 40% Latino.”Joining Sen.

As you know, increasing diversity and Latino representation throughout the Federal Reserve System and the federal government as a whole is critical to ensuring our public sector reflects our communities and the general population. We write to urge you to select one of the many highly qualified Latino candidates to fill the Dallas vacancy. The Federal Reserve has a well-documented diversity problem. In the most recent report to the Congress on the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, only five percent of the Federal Reserve’s 2021 overall workforce identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Of the 274 directors at the Federal Reserve, only 29 identify as Hispanic or Latino. Finally, of the current ten presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks, there are only three women and two people of color. We recognize the significant progress the Federal Reserve has made in diversifying its leadership and workforce in recent years; however, there remains significant work ahead to ensure it reflects our nation’s communities. In its 108 years, the Federal Reserve has yet to appoint a Latino Federal Reserve Bank president.There is no doubt that the country is growing increasingly diverse. Overall, racial and ethnic diversity is growing, particularly in the Hispanic or Latino population. The U.S. Hispanic and Latino population, which grew 23% since 2010, accounts for 18.7% of the general population and is 62.1 million strong. As these trends are expected to continue, it is even more important that individuals in leadership level positions at the Federal Reserve reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our nation and understand how working families experience the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve has a key opportunity to help accomplish this in District 11, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ area of responsibility, which serves a population that is 40% Latino.In October 2021, we wrote to you urging the prioritization of identifying and selecting diverse candidates, particularly Latinos, for the presidential openings at the Boston and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks. We were glad to see that just two months ago, Susan Collins was selected to lead the Boston Federal Reserve Bank. She is now making history as the first Black woman to lead a Reserve Bank—a long-overdue milestone for the Federal Reserve System. The CHC celebrates this historic milestone.However, given the growing Latino population nationwide and in District 11 in particular, we urge you to strongly prioritize the appointment of a Latino candidate for the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank.Respectfully,###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-blasts-nras-continued-violation-of-laws-that-govern-tax-exempt-organizations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees national tax policy, blasted the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) for its continued and flagrant violation of the laws that govern tax-exempt organizations. At yesterday’s Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight entitled “Laws and Enforcement Governing the Political Activities of Tax Exempt Entities,” Sen. Menendez highlighted the organization’s failure to disclose transgressions on their annual filings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the agency’s failure to investigate the irregularities.“Despite the NRA’s stated primary mission to promote public safety, the organization has become a fearmongering political media company promoting a lifestyle of loving assault rifles equipped with high-capacity magazines and calling anyone who questions their practice as socialists who are just trying to ‘take them away’,” said Sen. Menendez. “The privileges of being a tax-exempt organization should not come without accountability. It’s time for the IRS to fully investigate the repeated and flagrant violation of the principles for being granted this tax-exempt status.”The Senator also questioned whether the NRA’s overvalued payments to its public relations firm or diverted millions of dollars from the NRA for its executives to: travel to Africa, Lake Como, the Bahamas, and Budapest; purchase designer suits; provide gifts to friends; purchase memberships at golf clubs; and arrange for golden parachute deals that included million-dollar mansions and seven-figure salaries that would warrant further examination by the IRS.Sen. Menendez has been a leader in the fight to hold the NRA accountable. In September 2020, and March 2021 he led the call for the NRA to be removed from the list of charities eligible to solicit and receive contributions from federal employees during the yearly Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). Sen. Menendez is also the author of the Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act, legislation what would end the NRA-backed ban on the preservation and disclosure of gun records. ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.). During the meeting they spoke about executive actions the Administration can take to immediately protect Dreamers, TPS holders, and hardworking immigrant families currently living in the United States. Sen. Menendez also commented on the leaked SCOTUS draft decision on Roe v. Wade and what would happen if the high court moves to strike down 50-years of legal precedent and strip women of their constitutional right to choose and access abortion care.[CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW]On Immigration Meeting with President Biden:“This was a meeting at the request of the four Senators who wanted to speak to the President about what we can do to provide relief to immigrant families here in the United States under existing law because we have been frustrated by our Republican colleagues unwilling to do anything about solving the overall immigration question. They want the issue more than they want a solution. And so without any Republican votes, whatsoever, we are left with the pathway of trying to find executive powers. So, there was a discussion about how do you look upon TPS, temporary protective status for certain groups that are in the country, and to look at reauthorizations of some and designations for others. How do you – we look at the rule-making that has been pending as it relates to DACA, the young people who have created an extraordinary future in this country but who don’t have status. Lastly, how do you use existing law as the President has used, for example, in the case of Ukrainians and others, for the purpose of looking at certain categories of immigrants who are producing a public health benefit to the United States, central food work, the food supply chain, central health care workers and others similarly situated. So, it was a positive conversation. I look forward to continue working with the Administration to see if we can make some of these things happen.”On Roe v. Wade:“What I’m saying is that, look, Republicans finally got what they’ve been advocating for. If this is the final decision of the court, then Republicans have been militating for decades to end a woman’s right to choose and the privacy basis under which a woman’s right to choose is determined for her own personal future as it relates to her body and the choices she will have to make. That has been the law for half a century. So, now Republicans, if you listen to them, you would think that all of those who were advocating for this result would be jumping for joy at the decision of the court. Instead, they want to run away from that decision. This is an example of the dog catching the bus. They got what they wanted and now they don’t want women in the nation to know that it is Republicans who are stripping away a woman’s right to choose. And for all of us beyond that, the fact that by undermining 50 years of precedent of a case that was decided, affirmed, and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, that ultimately if you can change 50 years of precedent, you can change 50 years of precedent on voting rights, civil rights, and any other right you think that we have as a country that has been assured.” ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-calls-on-department-of-education-to-step-up-oversight-of-student-loan-servicers,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee that oversees student loan services, today called on the Department of Education to step up its oversight of student loan servicers and put borrowers first. At the hearing entitled “Examining Student Loan Servicers and their Impact on Workers,” Sen. Menendez highlighted well-established and long-standing problems with student loan servicers, particularly in regard to public service forgiveness loans. “For years, I have watched and listened as my constituents and their families have suffered irreparable financial harm—at the hands of their student loan servicers.,” said Sen. Menendez. “Year-after-year, millions of borrowers are mistreated by their student loan servicers—who routinely provide inaccurate information, fail to disclose and explain fees that are charged to borrowers, and ultimately make it harder for borrowers to pay off their loans.” [WATCH FULL QUESTIONING HERE]The Senator added, “What’s upsetting to me, is that this current mess was preventable. The Department of Education has known about these systemic issues for years. Its own Inspector General found in 2019, that despite regularly identifying instances of servicers’ noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the loans, the Education Department did not track or analyze these failures, nor did they hold servicers accountable for their poor performance – especially servicers of loans in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That failure to act means added financial pain for the borrowers we’re talking about here today.”Last month during another Banking hearing, the Senator urged Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to better monitor student loan servicers in order to prevent future abuses by these large companies. Over the years, student loan servicing companies have been systematically driving borrowers into expensive forbearances instead of the income-based repayment options that may serve them better in the long term.Sen. Menendez has long advocated to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. He has also called for the Administration to further extend the student loan pause—beyond August 31st—to fix longstanding issues with income based repayment (IBR), public service loan forgiveness program (PSLF), and issues regarding federal student loan servicers. These changes would open the door of opportunity for millions of student borrowers who have previously postponed buying their first home, opening a small business, or even starting a family because of student debt.Earlier in 2020, Sen. Menendez authored the Student Loan Tax Relief Act, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), which exempts forgiven student loan debt from tax liability through 2026, and worked successfully to include it in the American Rescue Plan. As a result of those efforts, the average student loan borrower will now save $2,200 in taxes for every $10,000 of forgiven student loans. Last February, the Senator supported a bicameral resolution calling on the Biden Administration to use its authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for federal borrowers. Sen. Menendez also has long-advocated for reform of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which has faced scrutiny for mismanagement since its inception in 2007, with only 1 to 2 percent of PSLF applicants being approved each year prior to the Biden Administration proposing a sweeping overhaul of the PSLF Program.  ###See moreDecember 02, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/video-release-menendez-pushes-for-creation-of-inspector-general-at-the-office-of-the-united-states-trade-representative,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor calling for inclusion of his USTR Inspector General Act of 2021 to be included in the final version of the competition bill that ultimately gets passed by Congress. Sen. Menendez’s motion passed unanimously. Sen. Cornyn (R-TX) cosponsored the motion and is an original cosponsor of the legislation.Sen. Menendez’s legislation would establish an Inspector General (IG) for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) under the Inspector General Act of 1978, similar to IGs for the Departments of Commerce, Defense, State, Justice, and Treasury. The USTR IG would be responsible for performing independent, non-partisan oversight, increasing transparency and accountability, and cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. It would also require the president to appoint an individual to serve as USTR IG, subject to advice and consent of the Senate, not later than 120 days after enactment.In recent years, USTR has become even more influential over the American economy given the economic competition with nations such as China and the growing importance of trade policy following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, USTR is one of the only cabinet-level agencies without an inspector general, leading to a troubling lack of oversight. The previous administration’s opaque Section 301 China tariff exclusion process raised concerns that the process was nontransparent and plagued by inconsistent decision making and political favoritism. On June 14, 2020, Bloomberg reported that two USTR employees who helped negotiate US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) may have violated federal law barring conflicts of interest when they offered their services as private-sector advisers to future clients while still on the federal payroll. USTR additionally maintains tremendous leeway to choose whether and when to enforce trade law violations and the power to grant or deny individual companies in the automotive sector additional time to comply with the complex automotive rules of origin.[CLICK TO VIEW SENATOR’S FLOOR REMARKS]Floor remarks as prepared for delivery:M. President, I come to the floor today to call up my motion to instruct — which would establish an inspector general at the Office of the United States Trade Representative.As we have seen over the past several years, inspectors general are a key way that Congress conducts oversight over our federal government.Through these independent watchdogs, we prevent waste, fraud, and abuse — increasing transparency while ensuring that federal agencies remain accountable to the American people.It’s a model that most of the federal bureaucracy has adopted. Why? Because it works.However, when it comes to the Office of US Trade Representative, it remains an outlier — one of the only Cabinet-level agencies without this key oversight tool.M. President, let me say that again. An agency led by a Senate-confirmed appointee, tasked with carrying out decisions affecting every worker, business, and consumer in this country, is currently operating without one of the most effective guardrails we have against overreach.Installing an inspector general at the Office of the US Trade Representative is a common-sense measure to crack down on abuse and install independent oversight. The agency has proven that it needs it.Just a few years ago, Congress saw how two negotiators for USMCA were using their positions to solicit consulting work on the regulations they had written.We saw how the agency’s opaque tariff exclusion process was beset by inconsistent decision-making and political favoritism.And we’ve seen administrations of both parties struggle to consult with Congress while also failing to keep labor groups, business organizations, and other stakeholders informed on trade negotiations — as is required by law.Simply put, establishing an inspector general at USTR is a no-brainer. It is also a bipartisan effort, one that I’ve been proud to lead with Senator Cornyn and that has garnered the support of a majority of our colleagues in this chamber.My motion to instruct is very simple.It would urge Senate conferees to insist upon a bipartisan, common-sense section in the Senate-passed USICA bill that would establish an inspector general at USTR.This powerful fix would bring about a more transparent, accountable, and effective trade policy which I know that every single one of us supports.With that, M. President, I request a voice vote… ###See moreDecember 27, 2022

Of all cafeteria workers in federal buildings around Washington, D.C., Senate cafeteria workers are the least likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance or retirement—only 18 percent have employer-sponsored health insurance and none are enrolled in employer-sponsored pension benefits,” wrote the senators.“Now that the immediate threat of layoffs is behind us, we encourage the Architect of the Capitol to work with all stakeholders, including Restaurant Associates and UNITE HERE, to ensure that the Senate food services contract reflects a commitment to a collective bargaining agreement with quality pay and benefits for all workers,” added the senators in the letter.Workers at the Senate cafeteria proudly serve U.S. Senators and staffers every day at the Capitol. They are fighting for a union contract that will offer fair wages, affordable health insurance, a pension, and job security—the latter of which has become more urgent than ever. Currently, only 18% of workers are enrolled in health insurance through the company because it’s too expensive at their current wage scale.In 2008, the Senate privatized its dining operations, which changed the employment status of 45 Senate dining employees from federal employees to private contractor employees. In addition to changing the employment status of these workers, the 2008 law also froze their retirement benefits, which are based on workers’ pay, at 2008 wage levels. Even though workers’ pay increased in subsequent years, their retirement benefits stayed the same.Along with Sens. Menendez and Booker, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).You can read the full letter HERE or below. J.

As you know, the Architect of the Capitol has received funds to protect Senate food service workers’ jobs. This critical relief comes after Restaurant Associates, the contractor, announced a series of layoffs a few weeks ago, just as the Senate is taking steps to reopen to the public. After these dedicated employees faced down a violent insurrection at the Capitol and continued to serve through more than two years of a pandemic, layoffs should never have been on the table. We understand that the ongoing public health crisis and security measures have led to financial challenges in Senate restaurants. While steps to reopen the Capitol are already underway and additional measures are being considered subject to the approval of the Capitol Police Board, foot traffic in the Senate cafeteria has been a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic and catering operations have ceased. The timing of the announced layoffs was also concerning. The announcement was made after Senate food service workers obtained union recognition—represented by UNITE HERE Local 23 following a majority card count and voluntary recognition—but before they entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Restaurant Associates. Dozens of workers were scheduled to lose their jobs before they were protected by a collective bargaining agreement and just as the Capitol Complex was beginning to reopen, which will undoubtedly increase revenue for Senate restaurants.  The current pay and benefits available to Senate cafeteria workers are already shameful. Of all cafeteria workers in federal buildings around Washington, D.C., Senate cafeteria workers are the least likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance or retirement—only 18 percent have employer-sponsored health insurance and none are enrolled in employer-sponsored pension benefits. For these workers to be laid off after serving this body throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in these conditions would be a stain on our institution. On January 13, 2022, the Senate unanimously passed Resolution 490 honoring Capitol custodial and service workers for their bravery and service in the face of an attack by violent insurrectionists. The resolution specifically references Restaurant Associates and Sodexo staff in its findings and expresses gratitude for and provides support to Capitol personnel. The resolution also reaffirms a commitment to achieving “higher pay, collective bargaining rights, paid sick and vacation leave, and comprehensive health insurance with mental health resources” for personnel. We urge you to prioritize the needs of the essential workers of the United States Senate in line with the criteria set forth by the resolution. Now that the immediate threat of layoffs is behind us, we encourage the Architect of the Capitol to work with all stakeholders, including Restaurant Associates and UNITE HERE, to ensure that the Senate food services contract reflects a commitment to a collective bargaining agreement with quality pay and benefits for all workers. We thank you for working to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Sincerely,     See moreDecember 16, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-re-introduce-legislation-to-boost-teacher-compensation-by-up-to-15000-joins-senate-colleagues-to-introduce-resolution,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) introduced legislation today that would boost teacher compensation by putting tax money back in their pockets and help diversify the teaching workforce. The bill, called the Respect, Advancement, and Increasing Support for Educators (RAISE) Act, would provide educators with a minimum of $1000 in refundable tax credits and as much as $15,000. U.S. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA), Jahana Hayes (D-CT), John Larson (D-CT), and Mark Takano (D-CA) introduced companion legislation in the House.Currently, public elementary and secondary teachers earn about 20 percent less than similarly educated professions. Based on a worldwide comparison, the average salary gap between teachers and others with comparable educational backgrounds is greater in the U.S. than in any other OECD country with available data.Early childhood educators fare far worse, with a national median wage of $11.65 an hour, well below the national living wage threshold. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every state in the nation reported shortages of teachers in high-need subjects like science, math, special education, and English language development. Additionally, low income and students of color are the least likely to have access to a stable educator workforce, with nearly 50 percent higher teacher turnover rates in high-poverty schools.Through refundable tax credits, the RAISE Act will help boost the compensation of early childhood, elementary, and secondary school teachers. Depending on the level of poverty in the schools educators serve, public school teachers would be eligible for a tax credit up to $15,000. The bill would also double the educator tax deduction, which teachers can use to offset the cost of school supplies, and expand eligibility to early childhood educators.In April, Sens. Menendez and Booker joined a group of colleagues in introducing the Educators Expense Deduction Modernization Act of 2022. The legislation would quadruple the amount educators can deduct from their taxes for out-of-pocket classroom expenses from $250 to $1,000 per teacher and continue to index it to inflation. The current deduction for teachers is far less than most New Jersey teachers spend each year out of their own pocket on classroom supplies.“As we recognize teachers all across the nation who go above and beyond for their students this Teacher Appreciation Week, we must make sure our gratitude is paired with concrete action that will make a positive difference in their lives,” said Sen. Menendez. “That's why I am proud to support this long overdue investment in our nation's schools that will boost teacher compensation, diversify the teaching workforce, and level the playing field between teachers and other professionals.”“Educators are constantly asked to do more and more without any significant increase in their compensation, and often at their own expense,” said Senator Booker. “The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these hardships, leading many teachers to leave the profession. This legislation would help support educators by using the federal tax code to put more resources back in teachers’ pockets. It’s time to reward our society’s unsung heroes by increasing teachers’ take-home pay.”“There’s no greater investment we can make in supporting children and families than supporting the teachers who dedicate their lives to caring for and supporting students,” said Representative Schiff. “Teachers are the bedrock of our public education system – and they deserve fair compensation for the irreplaceable role they play in shaping America’s future. The RAISE Act would deliver long-overdue salary increases to early childhood, elementary, and secondary educators, helping ease the financial constraints that block quality teachers from entering and remaining in the profession. Educators hold the future of the nation in their hands, and it's past time we honored their service with the fair wages they deserve.”“This Teacher Appreciation Day, we recognize the remarkable public servants who work to inspire students across our country each and every day,” said Representative Hayes. “Teachers pour their hearts into educating the young minds that will lead our nation into a brighter tomorrow. Unfortunately, despite their incredible dedication to the profession, far too often educators are overwhelmed with financial burdens that force them to leave the classroom. Teacher pay has not kept pace with that of other professionals, leaving educators feeling woefully undervalued. From shrinking school budgets to overwhelming student debt, teachers are often faced with the difficult decision to leave a career they love just to pay their bills. The RAISE Act closes the wage gap for teachers and acknowledges them as the professionals they are. Supporting our teacher workforce makes our schools and communities stronger.”“As we recognize Teacher Appreciation Week, I am honored to introduce the RAISE Act alongside my colleagues today to increase teacher pay and do more to recruit and retain educators,” said Representative John B. Larson. “When I served as a public school teacher, it was not possible to make ends meet without working a second job. Today we are taking a step forward toward ensuring teachers are fairly paid for their work and contributions to society.”“As a former public school teacher for 24 years, I know what a tremendous impact educators have on the lives of their students,” said Representative Mark Takano. “Teachers lay the foundation for a child’s education, and they didn’t waver from that responsibility even in the midst of a pandemic. They deserve to be paid for it. I’m proud to be introducing the RAISE Act with my colleagues to boost teacher salaries, reduce the teacher wage gap, and ensure a high-quality education for students of all ages. Together, we can support our teachers so they can continue inspiring our next generation of leaders and changemakers.”Specifically, The RAISE Act would:The following Senators also co-sponsored the legislation: Blumenthal (D-CT), Brown (D-OH), Duckworth (D-IL), Heinrich (D- NM), Padilla (D-CA), Van Hollen (D-MD)“Educators are such vital members of the New Jersey PTA, and we are pleased to see that the Raise Act bill recognizes that our teachers have always gone above and beyond to advocate for our children by working extra hours in a day and reaching into their pockets to make sure their classroom is always well-stocked. This bill will help recruit and retain great teachers and motivate them to continue to educate our children, who are sure to be our future leaders,” said Candy Fredericks, NJPTA President.“Every child deserves access to a high-quality educator, yet our nation is facing crippling teaching shortages—broadly, but especially in schools serving students from low-income communities. The RAISE Act will help expand the teaching pipeline by attracting and retaining educators through fair compensation so that every child can benefit from an excellent teacher,” said Shavar Jeffries, President, Education Reform Now. “Teachers’ salaries are lower than those of other similarly educated professionals, making it difficult to recruit and retain diverse, highly qualified teachers. The RAISE Act is an important and exciting step to move us toward more equitable access to great teachers for all students,” said Roby Chatterji, Senior Policy Analyst, Center for American Progress.“Teachers—whether they’re early childhood, elementary, middle or high school educators—play a critical role in our kids’ development, helping set them up for social, emotional and academic success and providing a critical foundation for their future. But far too many earn near-poverty wages and often must work second and third jobs to support their own families. Teaching is a profession that needs more respect, more resources and better conditions, so people can stay in these jobs and can do them well. This Teacher Appreciation Week, let’s help boost the compensation of teachers through refundable tax credits and help offset the money these educators spend out of their own pockets. Let’s especially help support and retain educators at high-poverty schools through the tax credits outlined in the RAISE Act. In the midst of teacher shortages, burnout and ongoing political attacks, this bill sends a clear message (and follows it up with action): to value the teaching profession and give teachers the support they need to help their students,” said Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers.Supporting Organizations: Advance CTE, American Association of School Personnel Administrators, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Federation of Teachers of New Jersey (AFTNJ), Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), Bank Street College of Education, California Association for the Education of Young Children (CAEYC), California Federation of Teachers (CFT), California Teachers Association (CTA), Californians for Quality Early Learning (CQEL), Center for American Progress (CAP), Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Child Care Aware of New Jersey, Child Care Services Association, Council for Exceptional Children, Council of Administrators of Special Education (CASE), Deans for Impact, Early Edge California, Education Law Center (ELC), Education Reform Now, Every Child California, the Education Trust, First Five Years Fund, First Focus Campaign for Children, Head Start California, Joint National Committee for Languages, Latinos for Education (L4E), Learning Forward, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), National Board of Professional Teaching Standards, National Center for Teacher Residencies, National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), National Disability Rights Network (NDRN), National Education Association (NEA), National Network of State Teachers of the Year (NNSTOY), National Parent Teacher Association (PTA), National Rural Education Association (NREA), National Women's Law Center, National Writing Project, Network for Public Education (NPE), New Jersey Educators Association (NJEA), New Jersey Parent Teacher Association (NJPTA), New Leaders, New Teacher Project, Public Advocacy for Kids (PAK), San Diego Unified School District, Southern Education Foundation, T.E.A.C.H.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-joins-senate-colleagues-to-introduce-resolution-calling-on-congress-to-combat-illicit-trade-money-laundering-crimes,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues to introduce a resolution today urging Congress to combat international criminal organizations, illicit trade, and the use of trade-based money laundering (TBML), which pose a significant threat to U.S. national security.“Congress has a duty to work with our international partners and must leverage every available tool at our disposal to tackle trade-based money laundering (TBML) and other activities by transnational criminal organizations that pose a significant threat to the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies,” said Sen. Menendez. “I’m proud to be joining this bipartisan group of Senators committed to tackling TBML. I look forward to working with them to develop comprehensive solutions that will help bolster our economic interests, make it harder for counterfeiters to employ TBML to infiltrate our supply chains, and protect New Jersey businesses who have been affected by these practices.”Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is considered one of the most common forms of international money laundering as well as a known value transfer and reconciliation method used by terrorist organizations. TBML can have negative impacts on international commerce, government revenue, and legitimate domestic commerce. According to Homeland Security Investigations, transnational criminal organizations often deposit imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market just to expedite the money laundering process. The below-market pricing is a cost of doing business for the money launderer, however, it places legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage. This activity can create a barrier to entrepreneurship, pushing out legitimate economic activity. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Treasury, TBML also denies governments of tax revenue due to the sale of underpriced goods, and reduced duties collected on undervalued imports and fraudulent cargo manifests.Co-signers on the resolution, led by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), are Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).Read the full resolution HERE or below:Whereas trade-based money laundering is among the most widely used and least understood forms of money laundering, disguising proceeds of crime by moving value through international trade transactions in an attempt to legitimize illicit origins of money or products; Whereas the transnational nature and complexity of trade-based money laundering make detection and investigation exceedingly difficult;Whereas drug trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and other transnational criminal organizations have succeeded at trade-based money laundering despite the best efforts of United States law enforcement; Whereas trade-based money laundering includes other offenses such as tax evasion, disruption of markets, profit loss for businesses, and corruption of government officials, and constitutes a persistent threat to the economy and security of the United States;Whereas trade-based money laundering can result in the decreased collection of customs duties as a result of the undervaluation of imports and fraudulent cargo manifests;Whereas trade-based money laundering can decrease tax revenue collected as a result of the sale of underpriced goods in the marketplace;Whereas trade-based money laundering is one mechanism by which counterfeiters infiltrate supply chains, threatening the quality and safety of consumer, industrial, and military products;Whereas drug trafficking organizations collaborate with Chinese criminal networks to launder profits from drug trafficking through Chinese messaging applications;Whereas on March 16, 2021, the Commander of the United States Southern Command, Admiral Faller, testified to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that transnational criminal organizations “market in drugs and people and guns and illegal mining, and one of the prime sources that underwrites their efforts is Chinese money-laundering”;Whereas the deaths and violence associated with drug traffickers, the financing of terrorist organizations and other violent non-state actors, and the adulteration of supply chains with counterfeit goods showcase the danger trade-based money laundering poses to the United States;Whereas trade-based money laundering undermines national security and the rule of law in countries where it takes place;Whereas illicit profits for transnational criminal organizations and other criminal organizations can lead to instability globally;Whereas the United States is facing a drug use and overdose epidemic, as well as an increase in consumption of synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, which is often enabled by Chinese money laundering organizations operating in coordination with drug-trafficking organizations and transnational criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere that use trade-based money laundering to disguise the proceeds of drug trafficking; Whereas the presence of drug traffickers in the United States and their intrinsic connection to international threat networks, as well as the use of licit trade to further their motives, is a national security concern;Whereas drug-trafficking organizations frequently use the trade-based money laundering scheme known as the “Black Market Peso Exchange” to move their ill-gotten gains out of the United States and into Central and South America;Whereas United States ports and U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not have the capacity to properly examine the 60,000,000 shipping containers that pass through United States ports annually, with only 2 to 5 percent of that cargo actively inspected;Whereas trade-based money laundering can only be combated effectively if the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the private sector work together;Whereas drug-trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and other transnational criminal organizations disguise the proceeds of their illegal activities behind sophisticated mechanisms that operate seamlessly between licit and illicit trade and financial transactions, making it almost impossible to address without international cooperation; andWhereas the United States has established Trade Transparency Units with 18 partner countries, including with major drug-producing and transit countries, to facilitate the increased exchange of import-export data to combat trade-based money laundering: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that—(1) the activities of transnational criminal organizations and their networks, and the means by which such organizations and networks move and launder their ill-gotten gains, such as through the use of illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering, pose a threat to the national interests and national security of the United States and allies and partners of the United States around the world;(2) in addition to considering the countering of illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering as a national priority and committing to detect, address, and prevent such activities, the President should—(A) continue to assess, in the periodic national risk assessments on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing conducted by the Department of the Treasury, the ongoing risks of trade-based money laundering;(B) finalize the assessment described in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2020 (division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116–93)), which directs the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury to thoroughly assess the risk that trade-based money laundering and other forms of illicit finance pose to national security;(C) work expeditiously to develop, finalize, and execute a strategy, as described in section 6506 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (title LXV of division F of Public Law 116–283; 134 Stat. 4631), drawing on the multiple instruments of United States national power available, to counter—(i) the activities of transnational criminal organizations, including illicit trade and trade-based money laundering; and(ii) the illicit economies such organizations operate in;(D) coordinate with international partners to implement that strategy, exhorting those partners to strengthen their approaches to combating transnational criminal organizations; and(E) review that strategy on a biennial basis and improve it as needed in order to most effectively address illicit economies, illicit trade, and trade-based money laundering by exploring the use of emerging technologies and other new avenues for interrupting and putting an end to those activities; and (3) the Trade Transparency Unit program of the Department of Homeland Security should take steps to strengthen its work, including in countries that the Department of State has identified as major money laundering jurisdictions under section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291h).See moreDecember 09, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-payne-jr-and-baraka-join-nj-eda-in-small-business-walk-to-kick-off-national-small-business-week,"NEWARK, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. (D-N.J.-10) and Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka joined today with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) for a Small Business Walk along Newark’s Halsey Street to kick off National Small Business Week.“Anyone who has spent time in the halls of Congress has heard the common refrain: ‘small businesses are the backbone of our economy.’ It’s repeated so often because it’s true,” said Sen. Menendez. “Especially after the past two years, as small businesses across our state and across our country have had to overcome unprecedented challenges, it’s clear: Their success is our success. And it is why it’s so important that we advocate for them through legislation that allows them to adapt, to persist, and to thrive.”For more than 50 years, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has celebrated National Small Business Week during the first week of May. The week recognizes the critical contributions of America’s entrepreneurs and small business owners. Small Business Week 2022 celebrates the resiliency and tenacity of America’s entrepreneurs who are doing their part to power our nation’s historic economic comeback. In New Jersey, small businesses account for 99 percent of all businesses and employ over 1.9 million people, according to SBA statistics for 2021.Sen. Menendez has long been a champion of small businesses, fighting for increased access to capital, greater financial protections, and critical resources before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. CLICK TO VIEW SENATOR’S OPENING REMARKSTo assist small businesses during the pandemic, Sen. Menendez voted in support of $800 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program and for nearly $30 billion in the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. In New Jersey, over 300,000 PPP loans were approved and 90% of them have already been forgiven. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund helped over 3,000 restaurants across the state. Sen. Menendez is also a cosponsor of the $60 billion RRF Replenishment Act and the $30 billion GYMS Act, which provides direct assistance to impacted gyms and fitness centers.Last November, the Senator introduced The Small Business Lending Disclosure Act of 2021, to prevent small business owners from predatory lenders.  Along with Rep. Payne in the U.S. House of Representative, Sen. Menendez has sponsored and will re-introduce The Payment Choice Act which is aimed at providing consumers the freedom to choose how to pay for goods or services when they support small businesses. While many establishments moved to contactless payment during the pandemic, many New Jerseyans require the ability to pay for goods with cash.“I am always proud to visit the small businesses in the 10th district, especially during National Small Business Week,” said Rep. Donald M. Payne, Jr.  “The Halsey Street community has been a vital part of Newark since the city was founded and we must make sure the small businesses located there are supported.  That is why I have fought to provide them and all small businesses nationwide more access to capital and increased opportunities for them in our economy.  I helped secure billions of dollars in assistance to help our small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a recent bill that provides $42 billion for restaurants and other food service businesses to pay bills and their employees.  In addition, the bill includes $13 billion for small businesses that lost 40 percent or more of their revenue during this pandemic.  Small businesses are the foundation of our economy and we must help them thrive.”    “Small businesses have proven to be the backbone of our economy and Small Business Week is an opportune time for not only Newark, but across the state and country to support local businesses,” said Mayor Baraka. “I’m grateful for Senator Menendez, Congressman Payne Jr. and NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan taking the time to visit with some of our small businesses today, as I know that continued collaboration with our federal, state, and local partners will continue to help us restore our economy and recover from the effects of the pandemic.”The Small Business Walk included stops at The Walla, BrownMill, Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea, and Halsey Cleaners. Through programs like Sustain and Serve and the NJEDA COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Grant, both implemented during the pandemic to assist struggling small businesses, the NJEDA has provided crucial resources to New Jersey Small businesses including several in Newark including The Walla, Sweetwaters and Halsey Cleaners.“During National Small Business Week, we celebrate the resiliency and tenacity of New Jersey’s small businesses owners who are doing their part to power our country’s economic comeback in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “New Jersey’s economy thrives when our small businesses succeed, and today’s walk served as a testament to Governor Murphy’s efforts and the federal delegation’s commitment to ensuring our small businesses always have the tools and funding necessary to prosper. Through vital programs like Sustain and Serve and the COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Grant, NJEDA was able to help thousands of small businesses across New Jersey keep their lights on and doors open. Seeing NJEDA supported businesses like Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea, Halsey Street Cleaners and Burger Walla thriving showcased firsthand the resiliency of New Jersey’s entrepreneurs who are vital components of our state’s economic recovery.”Launched by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) in December 2020, Sustain & Serve NJ has provided eligible entities with grants to purchase meals from New Jersey-based restaurants that have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 and distribute the meals for free to the community. Through the first two phases of the program, the NJEDA awarded more than $34 million to 31 organizations across the state, purchasing nearly 3.5 million meals from more than 400 participating restaurants across nearly 150 municipalities in all 21 counties.  The Sustain & Serve NJ program was funded through the American Rescue Plan. ###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/chairman-menendez-introduces-economic-statecraft-for-the-twenty-first-century-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today introduced the Economic Statecraft for the Twenty-First Century Act, new comprehensive legislation creating a whole-of-government approach to recommit U.S. leadership in the global economy. The new initiative, which comes as the Senate and House of Representatives begin the formal conference process to reconcile different versions of U.S.-China competition legislation, complements and expands upon provisions being negotiated – including on China’s economic coercion, supply chains, global infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and economic resilience. “Twenty years ago, the common consensus was that by joining the international economic order, China would adopt principles of economic liberalization and personal freedom. But unfortunately, that hasn’t happened. Instead they are using their economic integration to pressure the developing world to choose between our system and our values of self-determination, respect for human rights, and openness – or theirs: of authoritarianism, repression, and censorship,” Chairman Menendez said. “It is time to have coordination. We need a new, whole-of-government approach. One rooted in the emerging geopolitical realities of a world more connected yet more complex than ever. And that’s exactly what my bill, the Economic Statecraft for the Twenty-First Century Act, will do.” Unveiled in a speech to the American Leadership Initiative, Chairman Menendez made the case for overhauling U.S. competitive economic diplomacy so the federal government can be better equipped to outcompete China in five strategic domains of the 21st century – infrastructure, energy, technology, international financial institutions, and global resilience.  CLICK HERE TO WATCH AMERICAN LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE SPEECH Menendez underscored the significant extent to which geo-economics plays a role in American national security and raised concerns that China’s brand of international economic diplomacy – or ‘manipulative investment’ – threatens global stability, the free flow of commerce, freedom of navigation, and the resolution of disputes consistent with international law. “To create, shape, and set standards for the twenty-first century, America and our allies must show up. If we don’t, we risk seeing the rule of law in these countries washed away in a flood of Chinese cash. It is not too late, but time is certainly running out,” Chairman Menendez added. “Revitalizing the rules-based order and institutions built for the 21st century means dealing with the challenges posed by technology and artificial intelligence. It means being honest about how these advances can also lead to oppression and economic displacement. It means reforming our institutions in a way that delivers economic prosperity for all of our people. Our best hope at establishing the rules of the road for the future of global commerce is to work together.” Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s full remarks HERE. Find a copy of the legislation HERE. Find a section-by-section summary of the legislation HERE.  The Economic Statecraft for the Twenty-First Century Act (ES21) See moreDecember 06, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/in-the-economist-op-ed-chairman-menendez-says-the-work-of-helping-ukraine-has-only-just-begun,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today published a guest essay in The Economist regarding the United States and international community’s support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign territory and confront the brutality of Russia’s war.  Find the op-ed in full HERE and below.   Senator Bob Menendez says that the work of helping Ukraine has only just begunVladimir Putin must be held accountable for victimising the Ukrainian people, argues the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee THE WORLD has witnessed the atrocities Russian forces have perpetrated in the town of Bucha. Bodies of local civilians were strewn across the streets, executed with their hands tied behind their backs. People returning home discovered mass graves of innocent civilians with shoes and hands sticking out of the mud. From the city of Mariupol, we have heard horrific stories of starving civilians and blocked humanitarian corridors. The Russian siege there has left a landscape of smoking rubble and charred apartment blocks. As reports that Vladimir Putin’s army is using sexual violence as a weapon of war proliferate, a massive refugee and food-security crisis continues to unfold. Meanwhile, a recalcitrant Mr Putin recently launched a full-scale attack in eastern Ukraine. America and the international community must continue to do everything possible to support President Volodymyr Zelensky and the democratically elected government of Ukraine as they defend their people and sovereign territory and confront the brutality of Russia’s war. This critical support starts with delivering arms that Ukraine needs right now, and can effectively use, while also planning for broader future needs to counter Russia’s changing strategies. Building and producing military equipment takes time, so we must also work to ensure we are well-stocked with the right weapons including, but not limited to, air defence, communication tools, and munitions to avoid supply-chain shocks and production bottlenecks for when emergency security needs arise, as they have in Ukraine. Russian airstrikes also threaten land- and air-supply routes, putting enormous pressure on our NATO partner, Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine and is the best option for sending assistance. We must continue our efforts to strengthen Polish defences as arms shipments and other support continue to be supplied to Ukraine. We must be united and resolute: if Russia directly attacks Poland, the Baltic States, or any other NATO member, we will stand firm in our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory, and our allies’ arms depots will need to be fully supplied to respond to attacks. Meanwhile, we must continue to apply additional pressure on Mr Putin where we can and fill in any gaps in sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other partners and allies around the world. We should target the assets of oligarchs and Kremlin officials and their family members that have not yet been frozen and close off avenues for Russian companies or banks that continue to generate revenue, particularly targeting funds that go to Russia’s military-industrial base. Similarly, we must scrutinise any individual, entity or country that seeks to help Mr Putin escape consequences by circumventing sanctions. They should face additional penalties. Russia has entrenched itself both in Europe’s economy and the broader global markets, and we must have a long-term strategy for sanctions enforcement that is co-ordinated with our allies and ensure we have alternative paths forward. Pursuing viable alternatives is especially important when it comes to energy security. As Europe tightens sanctions, America should look at rerouting emergency fuel supplies, like oil and liquefied natural gas, to help in the short term. We should also provide technical assistance for energy-infrastructure development in the years to come. That could include EU-Ukrainian-Moldovan grid synchronisation and expanding the Development Finance Corporation’s lending criteria to better counter Moscow’s aggression. In the long term, the best way for Europe to free itself from dependence on Russian energy supplies is to prioritise investments that advance Europe’s domestic energy resource-mobilisation and expedite the reduction (with the ultimate aim of elimination) of fossil-fuel consumption. To tackle the unfolding humanitarian crisis, we must continue to ramp up assistance inside Ukraine and ensure adequate resources for neighbouring countries that are hosting countless refugees. The Biden administration has signalled it will resettle 100,000 Ukrainians, particularly those hoping to reunite with family already in the United States. But we also need clear, well-funded pathways for vulnerable Ukrainians—including LGBTQI+ individuals—so they too can quickly find safe haven. America and the international community must strengthen our response to gender-based violence, integrating protection of women and girls into the broader international assistance both inside and outside Ukraine. That includes prevention of human trafficking, adequate maternal health care and other sexual and reproductive services, as well as psychosocial assistance for coping with traumas related to family separation, displacement and sexual assault. Beyond Ukraine’s borders, the dramatic increases in the prices of staple goods such as grain, fuel, and fertiliser mean we also need comprehensive legislation that lays out a global food-security strategy and addresses the secondary impacts of this crisis, including immediate relief efforts for some of the countries whose people will suffer most. Russia has obliterated Ukraine’s economic infrastructure because Mr Putin wants to wreck the country’s eligibility for EU integration and membership. That is why we should use every tool we have to help rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure and restart its economy. How do we pay for this? To start, Russia should not have access to its blocked assets until it reaches an agreement to pay for reconstruction of Ukraine. Additionally, financing mechanisms from organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should play a role with debt restructuring and payment deferrals, as well as emergency-liquidity financing and reform support. We must also provide assistance through our own institutions and agencies. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is already working to provide support to the agricultural sector. The Development Finance Corporation can provide immediate support to sectors of the Ukrainian economy that need it most. Finally, America must lead the international community in holding President Putin accountable for his brutal victimisation of the Ukrainian people. Delivering justice—collecting evidence, securing an indictment, holding a fair trial—is hard, time-consuming work. Despite these hurdles, we must hold Mr Putin and others responsible for these horrific war crimes. His autocratic regime cannot be allowed to destroy a democratic nation with impunity. Our work to help Ukraine has just begun. Bob Menendez, a Democrat, represents New Jersey in the U.S. Senate. He is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.See moreDecember 19, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-hirono-booker-lead-senate-colleagues-in-supporting-biden-admin-proposal-to-reverse-harmful-trump-immigration-rule,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) led 10 of their Senate colleagues in submitting comments in support of the Biden Administration’s proposal to better support immigrants by updating the “public charge” regulation. The Biden Administration’s proposed regulation would replace the public charge rule enacted by the Trump Administration in 2019, which made it significantly more difficult for many immigrants to become lawful permanent residents by lowering the threshold for a person becoming a “public charge.” In a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Senators also called on the Administration to take three additional steps to better support immigrants seeking permanent status in this country. “In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump Administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities,” wrote the Senators to Secretary Mayorkas and USCIS Director Jaddou. “While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.  The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.”In 2019, the Trump administration lowered the threshold for becoming a public charge, making it more difficult for many immigrants, including many with U.S. citizen children, to become lawful permanent residents. The Trump rule counted assistance from many more programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), housing and transportation benefits, most medical care and more. The Biden Administration’s updated regulation would roll back the Trump-era standards and exclude benefits related to public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to expressing their support for the overall proposed regulation, the Senators provided additional recommendations to help ensure the updated rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families.“Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system,” the Senators added. “We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families.”Sen. Menendez has been outspoken in his opposition to the Trump Administration’s discriminatory public charge rule. In 2019, he joined Sens. Hirono and Booker in introducing legislation to block implementation of the rule. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Sen. Menendez also joined more than 100 colleagues in the Senate and House urging the Trump Administration to modify immigrant policies like public charge that deter immigrant families from obtaining needed medical care.In addition to Sens. Menendez, Hirono, and Booker, the letter is also signed by Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).The full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Director Jaddou,We write to comment on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on implementing Section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, published on February 24, 2022. As Members of the United States Senate, we applaud the important steps this proposal takes to update the “public charge” law and urge you to make further commonsense changes to ensure fairness and simplify its application.The proposed regulation restores and improves upon the public charge field guidance that was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1999. This guidance was the first attempt to define public charge and provide standards for determining inadmissibility on such grounds, standards which remained in place for nearly 20 years. Consistent with the Immigration and Naturalization Act, case law, and agency practice, the guidance helped ensure that immigrant families, including many with U.S. citizen children, were not deterred from accessing critical resources. In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump Administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities. While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.[1] The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.President Biden’s Executive Order on Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans states that the Federal Government should eliminate “sources of fear and other barriers that prevent immigrants from accessing government services available to them.”[2] This proposed rule represents a clear step in that direction by replacing the harmful 2019 public charge rule with a new policy based on two decades of practice that also creates clarity for immigrant families, strengthens our immigration system, and ensures consistency in application of the law. Overall, we agree with DHS’s proposed improvements in this proposed regulation that build upon the original 1999 field guidance. The proposals in the NPRM are consistent with the will of Congress and will result in a clearer, more administrable public charge policy, including:We appreciate that this NPRM recognizes that the use of health care, nutrition and housing assistance should not be a barrier to obtaining permanent residence status in our country. Congress has put these tools in place to help families thrive when they fall on hard times, purposely setting eligibility rules for them, and this rule aligns with those intentions.  In addition to supporting the overall proposed regulation, we have provided key recommendations below to ensure the final rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families. The proposed rule should exclude institutionalization at government expense altogether from the definition of public charge. Including Medicaid coverage for long term institutional care causes confusion and contributes to individuals and families not enrolling in our nation’s most essential health coverage program.  By definition, long term institutionalization is used by individuals who are elderly or who have a disability–making this provision discriminatory. The proposed rule should exclude State, Tribal, territorial, and local benefits. A number of states and localities have enacted, or are considering, inclusive initiatives to support their residents. These programs are an exercise of state powers and we do not want to undermine state and local efforts to strengthen their communities.  Moreover, including non-federal benefits would unnecessarily complicate any public charge determination. Limiting consideration to federal benefits will result in a single, uniform, federal standard for all immigrants across the country. Finally, given Congress’ decision to require an affidavit of support from certain immigrants, and consistent with longstanding practice and policy, we recommend that DHS clarify that an affidavit of support is generally sufficient to overcome this ground of inadmissibility. In the absence of significant public charge concerns, an individual who signs an affidavit of support is legally responsible for providing the named immigrant with financial resources should it become necessary.Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system. We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families. Sincerely, ###See moreDecember 07, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-murray-covid-survivor-groups-honor-almost-1-million-lives-lost-to-covid-urge-congress-to-pass-prevent-pandemics-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee that sets national health policy, and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee and author of the PREVENT Pandemics Act, today honored the nearly 1 million Americans who have died from COVID-19. They also urged their colleagues to pass the emergency COVID funding package and called for a Senate vote on their bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act (S. 3799) to improve the nation’s pandemic preparedness. Joining the Senators were a network of COVID survivor groups, representing more than 350,000 COVID activists, as part of their National Week of COVID Remembrance and Action.The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which Sen. Murray passed out of the HELP committee by a wide bipartisan margin on March 15, addresses factors that hindered the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law would strengthen federal and state preparedness, improve public health response capacity, accelerate research, and combat shortages of lifesaving medical supplies. This legislation includes a provision modeled after Sen. Menendez’s National Coronavirus Commission Act that would create an independent COVID Task Force.“With this week of remembrance and action, we honor the memory of all the lives lost to COVID-19 in our nation and seek to turn our pain into purpose, our grief into growth,” said Sen. Menendez who has long championed the creation of a non-partisan, independent Coronavirus Commission. “We must honor the victims, learn from our nation’s response, and find ways to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. That’s why Congress should swiftly pass the PREVENT Pandemics Act that includes provisions modeled after my bipartisan National Coronavirus Commission Act to investigate what went wrong, how we can better prepare for the next pandemic, and give the millions of American families, including those here today in Washington, answers and some sense of closure.”“The pain the COVID-19 pandemic has caused has been unthinkable. Millions of people across the country have lost loved family members and cherished friends, and are grappling with a painful hole in their families or an empty chair at the dinner table,” said Chair Murray, author of the PREVENT Pandemics Act. “We’ve never been through something quite like this—and it’s clear to everyone we must never go through this again. That’s why I’m pushing hard for more COVID funding to make sure we continue to protect the progress we have made, why I drafted the bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act to learn from the lessons of this pandemic and strengthen our public health and preparedness system, and why I’m working so hard to get it signed into law as soon as possible.” CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCEWhile drawing attention to the tragic milestone of 1 million U.S. COVID deaths, the Senators continued to push for critical emergency COVID funding. It is important to note that more Americans have died from COVID-19 than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined. At the same time, long-COVID symptoms affect as many as 23 million Americans with at least 1 million experiencing debilitating health consequences.“My daughter Elsie recently celebrated her 4th birthday - her second without her dad. My heart breaks for my little girl, but survivors like me are doing all we can to make sure those we lost to COVID did not die in vain,” said Pamela Addison of New Jersey, who founded Young Widows and Widowers of Covid-19.  “I’m here for my husband Martin, for Elsie and my son Graeme, and for millions of families like mine to finally have some answers.”“We desperately need a national moment to pause, to honor those who died, and those who continue to suffer, and to reflect on our collective loss. The U.S. has suffered more COVID deaths than any other nation. Our shared grief is enormous; the scale of our loss is unimaginable. Yet because the pandemic has been politicized, those who have suffered the most feel as if they have been left behind – today that changes,” explains Sabila Khan, of New Jersey, co-founder of COVID-19 Loss Support for Family and Friends and a member of COVID Survivors for Change.“The National Week Of Covid Remembrance And Action raises a resounding call to action to address the enormous needs that remain, to care for those still suffering, and to take the necessary steps for our country to move forward together to heal and prevent another national tragedy,” said Chris Kocher, executive director of COVID Survivors for Change, a nationwide community of survivors fighting for a stronger pandemic response.More than 30 organizations are participating in this National Week of COVID Remembrance and Action, including: COVID Survivors for Change, COVID-19 Loss Support for Family & Friends, Young Widows and Widowers of COVID-19, Yellow Heart Memorial, Faces of COVID, Faces of COVID Victims, Make Good Together, Survivor Corps, The World Health Network, Be a Hero, Center for Popular Democracy-COVID Families, Coalition on Human Needs, Covid Wellness Clinic, COVID-19 Long-Haulers Discussion Group, Faith & Grief, Families USA, Health Care Voices, I Lost My Loves One(s) to COVID, In America: Remember, Justice in Aging, MaskTogetherAmerica, National Welfare Rights Union (NWRU), Paid Leave for All, Pandemic Action Network, Pandemic of Love, Parents Who Have Lost a Child to Covid-19, Protect Our Care, Public Health Solutions, R2H Action [Right to Health], STAR Program at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Staten Island Not For Profit Association / SI COAD, Unity Bands Inc., WAVE Educational Fund, and The WhoWeLost Project. ###See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/joint-statement-by-chairs-of-foreign-relations-committees-calling-for-the-immediate-release-of-vladimir-kara-murza,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today joined 20 of his European Foreign Relations Committee counterparts in releasing the below joint statement calling for the immediate release of Vladimir Kara-Murza:  “We, the Chairs of our respective national parliaments’ Foreign Affairs Committees, call on the Russian authorities to immediately release Vladimir Kara-Murza. He has been detained and is now charged under draconian laws that ban criticism of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. “On 11 April 2022, Russian activist, journalist and politician Vladimir Kara-Murza was arrested outside of his Moscow home following an interview on CNN where he criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The following day, he was sentenced to 15 days in prison for disobeying police orders.  “On 22 April 2022, a Russian court charged Vladimir Kara-Murza under Russia’s new law that bans the spreading of “false” information about the Russian military, and he could now face up to 15 years in prison. These latest charges against Vladimir Kara-Murza are a blatant fabrication meant to distract attention from Putin’s war crimes and deter other courageous Russians from speaking out against the Kremlin.  “In 2015 and 2017, Vladimir Kara-Murza survived two near-fatal poisonings, traced by investigative journalists to Russian authorities. Consequently, we are deeply concerned about Vladimir Kara Murza’s safety.  “Since Russia invaded Ukraine, over 15,000 Russians have been detained for criticizing or opposing the war, or peacefully demonstrating against it. In addition, hundreds of Russians have been charged under the same Orwellian law that Vladimir Kara-Murza is accused of contravening. Putin and his regime have shown themselves to be willing to break any law, domestic or international, to suppress political opposition at home and subjugate neighbouring countries. We call on all democratic nations and allies to oppose criminal behaviour like this to protect human rights in Russia and worldwide. Together with the free world, we stand in solidarity both with Ukraine and with Russian civil society in these difficult times.  “We condemn the Putin regime’s brutal repression of free speech and independent media in Russia and demand the immediate release of Vladimir Kara-Murza and all the prisoners of conscience whom the Russian government has detained.”  Bob MenendezSenate United StatesMarko MihkelsonRiigikoguEstonia Rihards Kols Saeima LatviaLaima AndrikienėSeimas LithuaniaMichael Roth BundestagGermany Marek ŽeníšekChamber of DeputiesCzech RepublicPavel FischerSenateCzech RepublicTom TugendhatHouse of CommonsUnited Kingdom Marek KuchcińskiSejmPolandBogdan KlichSenatePoland Oleksandr MerezhkoVerkhovna RadaUkraineMartin LidegaardFolketingetDenmarkKenneth G ForslundRiksdagSweden Jussi Halla-ahoEduskuntaFinlandBjarni JónssonAlthingiIcelandPiero FassinoCamera dei DeputatiItaly Pau Marí KloseCongress of DeputiesSpainJean-Louis BourlangesNational AssemblyFranceTitus CorlățeanSenateRomania Ine Eriksen SøreideStortingetNorwayDavid McAllisterEuropean ParliamentSee moreDecember 20, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-calls-for-greater-oversight-of-student-loan-servicers,"WASHIGNTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, today called on Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to better monitor student loan servicers in order to prevent future abuses by these large companies. Over the years, student loan servicing companies have been systematically driving borrowers into expensive forbearances instead of the income-based repayment options that may serve them better in the long term.During the oversight hearing to discuss the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Semi-Annual Report to Congress, Sen. Menendez highlighted the Navient settlement, which put the scope of these practices into perspective.“The Bureau stated that from January 2010 to March 2015, Navient—the nation’s largest student loan servicer—added up to $4 billion in interest charges to the principal balances of borrowers who were enrolled in multiple, consecutive forbearances, noting that a large portion of these charges could have been avoided had Navient followed the law,” said Sen. Menendez.CLICK TO VIEW ENTIRE EXCHANGEThe Senator also pushed the CFPB to look into whether student loan servicing companies were also driving borrowers into deferments, when they could have been placed into an income-based repayment plan, especially when their payment would have been $0 monthly.Sen. Menendez has long advocated for student loan borrowers and has led the call in Congress for President Biden to cancel up to $50,000 in student loans. The Senator has also called for reform of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which has faced scrutiny for mismanagement since its inception in 2007, with only 1 to 2 percent of PSLF applicants being approved each year. Last year, alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Menendez secured inclusion of a provision he authored in the American Rescue Plan to eliminate surprise tax payments on forgiven student debt. This removed a key barrier for President Bien to cancel student debt.Sen. Menendez also raised his concerns on the recent ramping up of money transfer apps that has affected nearly 18 million Americans. The Senator sent a letter today alongside Sen. Warren to probe the parent company of the transfer platform Zelle on the ongoing failure to address the scams and provide appropriate redress to defrauded consumers.See moreDecember 22, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/chairman-menendez-opening-remarks-at-committee-hearing-to-consider-fy-2023-state-department-budget-request,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered the following opening remarks at today’s full Committee hearing to review the State Department’s FY 2023 budget request. Testifying before the Committee was Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  CLICK TO WATCH “As we look around the world from Cuba to Mali to Iran to China, and of course Russia, authoritarians are crushing free speech, arresting dissidents, utilizing technology to control their citizens, relying on mercenaries and illicit weapons to target innocent civilians and topple governments. This is a confrontation between violent autocrats and those of us fighting for a rules-based international order, for democracy, human rights, and the cause of freedom around the world,” Chairman Menendez said. “Our diplomats and development professionals – and our budget for these efforts,  which we are examining today – are our front lines in this fight.” Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s remarks as delivered below.  “This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order. Mr. Secretary – welcome back to the Committee. We appreciate you being here with us today. As we look around the world from Cuba to Mali to Iran to China, and of course Russia, authoritarians are crushing free speech, arresting dissidents, utilizing technology to control their citizens, relying on mercenaries and illicit weapons to target innocent civilians and topple governments. This is a confrontation between violent autocrats and those of us fighting for a rules-based international order, for democracy, human rights, and the cause of freedom around the world. Our diplomats and development professionals – and our budget for these efforts, which we are examining today – are our front lines in this fight.  With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of our most pressing areas of concern.  I am sure members on both sides will want to talk about these and others.  In Europe we must ‘maintain absolute unity’ as President Biden has said. And I believe your recent trip to Kiev with Secretary Austin to show support for President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people, and to continue shining a light on the Russian military’s brazen abuse of civilians that certainly amount to war crimes, was a critical display of that unity. We salute you for that visit. More broadly, this means countering Russian aggression with security assistance that aligns with our foreign policy, combatting disinformation and election interference, delivering humanitarian relief, and helping neighboring countries with a huge influx of Ukrainian refugees fleeing violence.  We have a responsibility to the American people and to Ukrainians themselves to ensure we are effectively spending the $13.6 billion dollar package Congress approved in March. With only a minor increase in Foreign Military Financing funds, I would like to hear the Administration’s plans for countries in NATO’s Eastern Flank – and for Taiwan, which is facing a similar threat from China. Whether it is Japan, South Korea or Australia, when it comes to countering China, a strong alliance with our partners is vital.  Xi Jinping’s hyper-nationalism is more assertive around the globe than ever before.  The State Department must work on a pragmatic appraisal of how to best combat China’s predatory economic and trade practices so we have the ability to out-compete China in the generation ahead; bilaterally and through robust presence and action in regional and international institutions. Authoritarianism also threatens Latin America and the Caribbean, a part of the world hit hard by the COVID pandemic.  From Cuba to Venezuela and even Nicaragua – we’re seeing arbitrary detentions, the dismantling of civil society, and the weaponization of hunger and migration—all as Maduro carries out systematic extrajudicial executions.  On top of this, an epidemic of criminal violence stretching from Mexico to Haiti to El Salvador is fueling a serious refugee and migration crisis. The Americas now host more than 18.4 million displaced people.  This budget is a good down payment, but more will be needed to address these challenges across the hemisphere. Countering authoritarianism also requires serious investment across Africa where Moscow has reasserted itself over the past several years, and democracy seems on the retreat.  Civilians from the Central African Republic to Mali have paid a heavy price with Russian Wagner mercenaries reportedly committing human rights abuses.And despite concerted diplomatic efforts by the Administration, the democratic aspirations of the Ethiopian and Sudanese people have yet to be realized.  Looking further north, I am also expecting an update on what is happening with the JCPOA and negotiations with Iran. We were told that the end of February was the date in which we needed to conclude an agreement. It is going to be the end of April. We look forward to hearing about that as well as Iran’s malign actions across the region.  I am pleased that the security of our important ally Israel is fully funded in this request. And I am supportive of the funding request for Jordan. But I am concerned by cuts to security assistance in Iraq as we transition away from combat operations to bilateral diplomacy.  In Tunisia, we would love to hear a strategy confronting democratic backsliding. And in South and Central Asia we need clarity on whether the Administration will waive CAATSA sanctions for India’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system, and what role, if so, they are going to continue to play in the Quad.  Also, in the wake of the Taliban’s broken promise to allow girls to attend secondary school, their media crackdown and the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, we need a better sense of the Administration’s diplomatic strategy.  Around the globe today, we are facing multiple humanitarian challenges: refugee crises on several continents and one of the worst food insecurity crises we have seen in a generation. Considering all this, I do not think the Administration’s budget request to address humanitarian and resettlement needs reflects current global realities. The United States must elevate the needs of women, girls, and other at-risk populations. We must document war crimes.  Added to this, climate change is a force multiplier which will exacerbate humanitarian crises and conflicts around the world.  It requires us to rethink how we prepare for the future, from the energy security crisis in Europe and Ukraine, to increasing sea levels, severe weather, and drought, including working multilaterally to help partner countries advance clean, sustainable energy solutions. We must also think about how to better prevent, detect and respond to future pandemics.   I want to applaud the State Department’s push to modernize and increase diversity by adding paid internships, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officers across foreign affairs’ agencies, and equity strategies in our overseas policies and programs, including the Department’s high-level representative on Racial Equity.  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also taken steps to join in this effort.   Finally, I’d also like to congratulate the Department on launching the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, which will be essential in our diplomacy on cyber and technology issues. There is a lot here to discuss Mr. Secretary. We look forward to hearing your thoughts on how you see the State Department tackling the issues and challenges we face as a nation. I certainly want to say that we appreciate your service to our country. With that, let me turn to the distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Risch, for his opening remarks.”See moreNovember 23, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/senators-menendez-warren-blast-zelle-parent-company-on-failure-to-address-consumer-fraud-and-scams,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), sent a letter today to Zelle’s parent company, Early Warning Systems, LLC, regarding disturbing reports of a rise of fraud and scams on its money transfer platform Zelle and the ongoing failure by Zelle and the big banks that own the service to address the scams and provide appropriate redress to defrauded consumers. Early Warning Systems, LLC. is a company owned by seven of the U.S.’s largest banks including J.P. Morgan, Chase & Co., Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.“This ‘widespread fraud’ on money transfer apps has affected nearly 18 million Americans. Given the rise of increasingly sophisticated scams on your platform and the widely documented difficulties consumers have faced in seeking relief from banks, we seek to understand the extent to which Zelle allows fraud to flourish and the steps your company is taking to increase consumer protection and help users recover lost funds,” wrote the Senators to Early Warning Services CEO, Al Ko.Zelle was introduced in 2017 by a company made up of some of the U.S.’s largest banks. Given its connection to the banks, Zelle was able to quickly increase its volume, driving over $490 billion in transactions in 2021 and doubling its nearest competitor Venmo. However, Zelle’s immediacy made it a “preferred tool for grifters,” leading to widespread fraud and scams across the platform.The increased activity on Zelle is putting millions of consumers at risk as fraud flourishes: as The New York Times reported, “Police reports and dispatches from industry analysts make it clear that the network has become a preferred tool for grifters like romance scammers, cryptocurrency con artists, and those who prowl social media sites advertising concert tickets and purebred puppies — only to disappear with buyers’ cash after they pay.” Reports of consumers losing thousands of dollars have come out of California, Massachusetts, and Georgia. These scams, many of which involve a scammer creating a Zelle account linked to the consumer’s own phone number, have cost victims their life savings and robbed them of funds essential to their small businesses, further underscoring the consequences of this widespread fraud.“Alarmingly, both your company and the big banks who both own and partner with the platform have abdicated responsibility for fraudulent transactions, leaving consumers with no way to get back their funds. Zelle’s biggest draw – the immediacy of its transfers – also makes scams more effective and ‘a favorite of fraudsters,’ as consumers have no option to cancel a transaction even moments after authorizing it.” And banks have chosen to let consumers suffer, blaming them for authorizing fraudulent transactions,” continued the the Senators.According to Consumer Watchdog, banks were essentially “throw[ing] up their hands and saying ‘it’s not our problem because you authenticated it.’” A former executive at your company even argued that banks have not done enough to deter fraud on Zelle, warning that banks had not sufficiently educated consumers about the risks. One customer observed that “it’s like the banks have colluded with the sleazebags on the street to be able to steal.”The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the FDIC previously clarified that Regulation E of the Electronic Transfer Act protected victims of fraudulent money transfers, including those who were “induced” into transferring the money themselves, and the FDIC issued a report in March 2022 finding that the banks and the platform were both responsible for fraudulent electronic transfers through this regulation.Sen. Menendez has long been leading the charge in the Senate for consumer protections – ranging from banks, data breach protections for consumers, to cyber security, and more. In 2014, Sen. Menendez crafted legislation following the monumental Target data breach in 2013, where he called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect American consumers.A copy of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Mr. Ko, We write regarding disturbing reports of a rise in fraud and scams on your online peer-to-peer money transfer platform Zelle, and the ongoing failure by Zelle or the banks that own this service to address these scams and provide appropriate redress to defrauded consumers. This “widespread fraud” on money transfer apps has affected nearly 18 million Americans. Given the rise of increasingly sophisticated scams on your platform and the widely documented difficulties consumers have faced in seeking relief from banks, we seek to understand the extent to which Zelle allows fraud to flourish and the steps your company is taking to increase consumer protection and help users recover lost funds. After its introduction in 2017, Zelle exploded in popularity, in large part because its connections to large financial institutions allowed it to sell itself as “fast, free, and ubiquitous.” Your company, Early Warning Services, LLC is owned by seven of the country’s biggest banks, including JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, giving consumers the convenience of an integrated platform and providing an implicit promise that activity on the platform is as secure as activity at the bank teller window. In 2021, Zelle “drove $490 billion in transactions, more than double Venmo’s $230 P2P volume.”The increased activity on Zelle is putting millions of consumers at risk as fraud flourishes: Police reports and dispatches from industry analysts make it clear that the network has become a preferred tool for grifters like romance scammers, cryptocurrency con artists, and those who prowl social media sites advertising concert tickets and purebred puppies — only to disappear with buyers’ cash after they pay.Reports of consumers losing thousands of dollars have come out of California, Massachusetts, and Georgia. These scams, many of which involve a scammer creating a Zelle account linked to the consumer’s own phone number, have cost victims their life savings and robbed them of funds essential to their small businesses, further underscoring the consequences of this widespread fraud.Alarmingly, both your company and the big banks who both own and partner with the platform have abdicated responsibility for fraudulent transactions, leaving consumers with no way to get back their funds. Zelle’s biggest draw – the immediacy of its transfers – also makes scams more effective and “a favorite of fraudsters,” as consumers have no option to cancel a transaction even moments after authorizing it. And banks have chosen to let consumers suffer, blaming them for authorizing fraudulent transactions. According to Consumer Watchdog, banks were essentially “throw[ing] up their hands and say ‘it’s not our problem because you authenticated it.’” A former executive at your company even argued that banks have not done enough to deter fraud on Zelle, warning that banks had not sufficiently educated consumers about the risks. One customer observed that “it’s like the banks have colluded with the sleazebags on the street to be able to steal.”The policies of your company and the banks that own and operate on it create a confusing and unfair environment for consumers, who are already facing “rampant” and sophisticated threats from spammers on the platform. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau previously clarified that Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act protected victims of fraudulent money transfers, including those who were “induced” into transferring the money themselves, while the FDIC issued a report in March 2022 finding that both the banks and the platform – in this case Zelle – were held responsible for fraudulent electronic transfers through Regulation E. Given this regulatory landscape, your company and the banks have a clear responsibility to more aggressively protect consumers.In order to better understand how consumers have experienced fraud on your platform we ask that you provide answers to the following questions by May 10, 2022: 1.    What are the procedures for rooting out scams on the online platform Zelle, and how has your company adjusted those procedures in light of “rampant […] organized crime” on the platform?2.    What are Zelle’s policies for determining which consumers receive refunds for fraudulent claims?a.    Is this a joint process with the account holders’ bank? If so, are these procedures standardized across all banks and financial institutions using the platform?3.    Does Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfers Act apply to the scams seen regularly on Zelle, including those that involve consumers induced into authorizing fraudulent transfers?a.    Under Regulation E, would Early Warning Services, LLC or the account holders’ bank be responsible for refunding the funds?4.     How many reports of fraud from Zelle customers have Early Warning Services received for each of the last five full calendar years, and from January 1, 2022, to the present?  For each year, and for the period from January 1, 2022, to the present, please provide:a.    The total number of reported cases of fraud from Zelle customers.b.    The total dollar value of reported fraud.c.    The number of cases where Zelle provided refunds to customers.d.    The total value of these refunds.e.    The number of cases where Zelle referred fraud to law enforcement or to federal or state bank regulators, Thank you for your attention to this matter.   ### See moreDecember 27, 2022

Following remarks, Chairman Menendez and Ambassador Baki took questions from community leaders and St. Peter’s faculty members in attendance.     CLICK HERE FOR MORE PHOTOSCLICK HERE FOR VIDEO OF REMARKS “After a devastating pandemic, and in light of growing security and environmental threats, the people of Ecuador today face varied, pressing challenges,” Chairman Menendez said, describing how his legislation strengthens U.S.-Ecuador cooperation to foster inclusive economic development, address shared security challenges, and to support environmental conservation. “If passed, my bill will be a great step forward in our relationship with Ecuador. It will be a great step forward in advancing the democratic principles and values our nations share. And it would be a great step forward for Ecuadorians and Americans everywhere.” Chairman Menendez also applauded Ecuadorian-American diaspora of New Jersey’s efforts to keep the proud Ecuadorian heritage and culture alive and to assist, inform, and empower community members to confront shared challenges.  “Your efforts here in New Jersey not only strengthen the Ecuadorian diaspora community, but also the bond between the United States of America and the country of Ecuador,” Chairman Menendez added. “To those of you living here in New Jersey, we must keep pressing forward. To those confronting challenges almost three thousand miles away in Ecuador, know that you have our support. And to everyone who cares about the bond between our two countries, speak up. Because if we work together and stand up for our democratic principles, our partnership in the coming decades will be prosperous and full of potential.” Earlier this year, Chairman Menendez joined Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso in a virtual press conference held in celebration of this legislative effort.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-lujn-klobuchar-crdenas-urge-meta-to-combat-russian-media-spanish-language-disinformation-on-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), alongside U.S. Representative Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.-29), led 17 of their colleagues in sending a letter urging Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, formerly Facebook, to increase platform moderation of Spanish-language disinformation from Russian-owned media outlets on the war in Ukraine. “Since the beginning of the year, Russian state-controlled outlets have made a concentrated effort to target Spanish-speaking communities to spread false-narratives leading up to, and in the aftermath of, the invasion of Ukraine,” wrote the group of lawmakers to Zuckerberg. “The viral spread of these narratives stands in stark contrast to assurances that Meta made to the public and Members of Congress that it is prioritizing the pressing needs of Hispanic communities in the United States.”Russian-owned media outlets are increasingly publishing significantly more content referencing Ukraine in Spanish compared to many other leading Spanish language news sites. As a result, posts are spreading rapidly in the United States and across Latin America, causing many to believe Russia’s lies. RT en Español, a Russian-owned media outlet, misleads its more than 18 million Facebook followers with disinformation and propaganda claiming Putin’s false justification for his unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Meta has already banned RT in the European Union, but it remains active in North America. “These lies are designed to undermine a resolute global response necessary to stand against the Russian government’s aggression. Facebook has continuously failed to show it is adequately addressing this problem for Spanish-speaking communities, and the success of Russian-sponsored outlets in crowding out the information ecosystem for Spanish speakers serves as proof to this fact. The spread of these narratives demonstrate that Meta does not see the problem of Spanish-language disinformation in the United States as a critical priority for the health of our democracy. The lack of Meta’s action to swiftly address Spanish-language disinformation globally demonstrates the need for Congress to act to ensure Spanish-speaking communities have fair access to trustworthy information,” added the lawmakers.The letter was also signed by Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Alex Padilla (D-Calif), as well as Reps. James P. McGovern (D-Mass.-02), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.-03), Nydia M. Velázquez (D-N.Y.-07), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.-40), Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.-13), Lori Trahan (D-Mass.-03), Jim Costa (D-Calif.-16), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.-28), Joaquin Castro (D-Texas-20), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas-35), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.-07), Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.-38), and Sean Casten (D-Ill.-06).The letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,We write to you regarding our serious concern with Meta’s (formerly Facebook’s) lack of progress addressing the pressing issue of Spanish-language disinformation across its platforms. Since the beginning of the year, Russian state-controlled outlets have made a concentrated effort to target Spanish-speaking communities to spread false-narratives leading up to, and in the aftermath of, the invasion of Ukraine. The viral spread of these narratives stands in stark contrast to assurances that Meta made to the public and Members of Congress that it is prioritizing the pressing needs of Hispanic communities in the United States. In July, twenty-six members of Congress publicly asked Facebook to provide proof of investment in its efforts to combat Spanish and other non-English language misinformation and disinformation on the platform. Facebook did not directly answer the questions provided, and primarily attributed the increased rate of hate-speech takedown globally to “…a whole package of AI technologies [that] made leaps forward in the past year.” Despite your purported progress in combatting Spanish-language disinformation, “Kremlin-owned outlets are winning the information war with Spanish speakers.”   In the last week of February, the RT en Español Facebook page saw “nearly double the engagement than its daily average.”  According to research, Russian state-owned media outlets continue to publish significantly more content referencing Ukraine in Spanish compared to many other leading Spanish language news sites, resulting in 1,600 posts that referenced Ukraine.  Russian government outlets also saw their Spanish-language efforts outperform U.S. counterparts on audience engagement by a ratio of more than 3 to 1 in the last two weeks of January. RT en Español’s Spanish-language disinformation and propaganda misleads their more than 18 million Facebook followers. Following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, RT en Español’s articles spread inaccurate information by reporting Putin’s false justification for unwarranted acts of aggression against Ukraine to RT’s Spanish-speaking audience and downplayed the invasion as a “special military operation” with the intention to protect Ukrainians.  These lies are designed to undermine a resolute global response necessary to stand against the Russian government’s aggression. Facebook has continuously failed to show it is adequately addressing this problem for Spanish-speaking communities, and the success of Russian-sponsored outlets in crowding out the information ecosystem for Spanish speakers serves as proof to this fact. In addition, Spanish-language disinformation and propaganda regarding the invasion of Ukraine is not mentioned once in Facebook’s Quarterly Adversarial Threat Report released on April 7th, 2022 .The spread of these narratives demonstrate that Meta does not see the problem of Spanish-language disinformation in the United States as a critical priority for the health of our democracy. The lack of Meta’s action to swiftly address Spanish-language disinformation globally demonstrates the need for Congress to act to ensure Spanish-speaking communities have fair access to trustworthy information.  We request you answer the following questions to ensure Congress has the most relevant information while evaluating solutions to this pressing issue:We look forward to your prompt response and action.Sincerely,###See moreDecember 19, 2022

We deeply admire Australia’s own resistance to Chinese digital authoritarianism and applaud its decision to reject Huawei 5G, which serves as a powerful show of strength in the face of immense pressure and demonstrates the Australian government’s unwavering commitment to the security and prosperity of its people.”    Ukraine:“We express our deep appreciation for Australia’s provision of significant security assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles, to Ukraine’s courageous defenders. Australia plays a key role in the international coalition to hold Russia accountable, joining with like-minded democracies to impose devastating sanctions on the Putin regime. We will continue to work closely with Australia to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russian aggression.”See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-calls-on-biden-administration-to-protect-nj-seniors-from-medicaid-health-coverage-gaps,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) joined a group of colleagues in calling on the Biden Administration to ensure that seniors currently enrolled in Medicaid have a smooth path to health care coverage after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. The letter calls on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to establish a special enrollment period for these beneficiaries to sign up for coverage, and waive any related late-enrollment fees they may have accrued.“We appreciate the important services and supports that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has administered to help older Americans utilize telehealth, access COVID-19 testing, vaccines and treatment free of charge, and maintain comprehensive coverage,” wrote the Senators to Administrator Brooks-LaSure. “However, as the threat of the virus begins to subside and the Biden Administration considers terminating the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), we are concerned that the Medicare beneficiaries may experience avoidable gaps in coverage.”Provisions of the bipartisan Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) ensured that children, working adults and seniors alike could retain their health insurance coverage through the ensuing period of extreme economic uncertainty and volatility. Both the funding and coverage provisions of the FFCRA will expire upon termination of the PHE, at which point states will begin to remove ineligible individuals from their Medicaid programs.“We urge you to provide a smooth transition to Medicare coverage for these seniors through a special enrollment period, and to exempt them from any financial penalties that would otherwise be assessed for late enrollment,” the Senators continued. “CMS and stakeholder partners should conduct extensive outreach to raise awareness among seniors of this coverage change, and ensure they have the tools and information necessary to choose the Medicare coverage option that works best for them.”Joining Sen. Menendez in sending this letter were Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey, Jr. (D-Pa.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).The full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:Thank you for your work to keep seniors safe and healthy over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We appreciate the important services and supports that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has administered to help older Americans utilize telehealth, access COVID-19 testing, vaccines and treatment free of charge, and maintain comprehensive coverage. However, as the threat of the virus begins to subside and the Biden Administration considers terminating the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), we are concerned that the Medicare beneficiaries may experience avoidable gaps in coverage.At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress acted quickly to shore up federal health programs and protect access to affordable coverage for American families. In particular, the enhanced Medicaid funding and corresponding continuous eligibility provisions of the bipartisan Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) ensured that children, working adults and seniors alike could retain their health insurance coverage through the ensuing period of extreme economic uncertainty and volatility. Both the funding and coverage provisions of the FFCRA will expire upon termination of the PHE, at which point states will begin to remove ineligible individuals from their Medicaid programs. Included among these people are seniors who may have remained on Medicaid despite becoming eligible for Medicare over the course of the pandemic. This unprecedented transition could result in coverage losses for millions of Americans. Because CMS has never before faced a similar situation at this scale, we are concerned that current beneficiary enrollment processes do not provide adequate coverage options for this type of transition. Medicare-eligible individuals who lose Medicaid coverage outside of Medicare’s open enrollment period may be unable to elect Part B coverage. This will leave them without access to comprehensive care, and they may face fines for failing to get covered earlier. We urge you to provide a smooth transition to Medicare coverage for these seniors through a special enrollment period, and to exempt them from any financial penalties that would otherwise be assessed for late enrollment. CMS and stakeholder partners should conduct extensive outreach to raise awareness among seniors of this coverage change, and ensure they have the tools and information necessary to choose the Medicare coverage option that works best for them. COVID-19 has been especially difficult for older Americans, and we must do everything possible to support their needs as we emerge from the pandemic. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to working together on our shared goal of protecting access to quality health care for seniors. Sincerely,###See moreNovember 17, 2022

Since last year, I have been sounding the alarm alongside other colleagues urging the President to take actions including nominating a director to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (AFT) and finalizing the ghost guns rule, as well as pursuing additional executive actions on gun violence.“According to gun safety experts, finalizing this rule is the single most important thing we can do to shut down the ghost gun marketplace once and for all. Simply put, having this order in place will save American lives. I also look forward to fully reviewing President Biden’s nomination of Steve Dettelbach as ATF Director. The ATF needs strong, Senate-confirmed leadership in order to fulfill its mission of making our communities safer.” ###See moreNovember 23, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-introduce-resolution-recognizing-black-maternal-health-week,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) introduced a resolution recognizing Black Maternal Health Week “to bring national attention to the maternal health crisis in the United States and the importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women and birthing persons.” Black Maternal Health Week is observed from April 11 through April 17.The resolution underscores the disproportionate health complications suffered by Black birthing people during pregnancy who face maternal morbidities three times as often as their white counterparts due to structural racism and gender oppression in maternal health care experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequities, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that the maternal mortality rate for Black women has increased by 26% since the pandemic began. In order to reverse these alarming trends, the resolution calls on Congress to “support and encourage policies grounded in the human rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice frameworks that address Black maternal health inequity.”  “Before the pandemic, New Jersey had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country and alarming racial disparities in maternal health outcomes.  The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated barriers to equitable maternity care,” said Sen. Menendez. “I commit to working with my colleagues to ensure we finally address the racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes.”“Our nation is experiencing a maternal mortality crisis,” said Sen. Booker. “The United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates of any wealthy nation, which has rapidly increased during the past years and continues to disproportionately impact Black birthing people who more often encounter the systemic inequalities of our broken health care system. To improve Black maternal health outcomes, this resolution calls on Congress to implement a comprehensive approach that provides Black communities with economic support, environmental justice provisions, and access to high-quality, affordable health care. I am proud to once again work with Representatives Adams and Underwood on this resolution to address this urgent and critical issue.”“The Black Maternal Health field has expanded significantly since the first Black Maternal Health Week launched back in 2018. I am so proud of the work that BMMA, our partners, and collaborators have led to create a demonstrable impact on behalf of Black women and birthing people’s maternal and reproductive rights,” said Angela D. Aina, Executive Director of Black Mamas Matter Alliance. “Still, there is so much more to be done to address the startling statistics and realities facing Black expectant individuals. As we celebrate Black Maternal Health Week, and continue to champion the reproductive rights and health equity of all Black birthing people, we hope our collective efforts will create even more transformative change for generations to come.” “March of Dimes commends Representatives Alma Adams, Lauren Underwood and Senator Cory Booker for spearheading this year’s Black Maternal Health Week Resolution and their efforts to address the alarming state of Black maternal health,” said Stacey D. Stewart, President and CEO of the March of Dimes. “In the U.S., Black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes and 50 percent more likely to have a preterm birth as compared to White women. It is past time we address the structural racism and inequities in social determinants of health that contribute so significantly to the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women.” In addition to Sens. Menendez and Booker, the resolution is cosponsored by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.).A copy of the resolution can be found here.See moreDecember 09, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-pascrell-introduce-bill-to-protect-young-athletes,"JERSEY CITY, N.J. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee that sets national health policy, and Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. (N.J.-09) last week introduced bicameral legislation to improve sports safety and protect student athletes from cardiac arrest, concussions, heat-related illness and other on-field or on-court medical emergencies.“Young athletes and their parents must be assured that there are properly trained coaches, teachers, trainers and other personnel on the sidelines who are ready and equipped to respond to an injury or health emergency. Our SAFE PLAY Act will protect our kids and save lives by ensuring our schools have the resources and information they need to properly identify warning signs and respond in the event of a medical emergency during a game,” said Sen. Menendez. “Athletics are a key part of childhood and we want our children to participate in sports, compete, play and have fun, but we also want them to be safe.”“As our understanding of sports-related injuries improves, so too must our response. Cardiac arrest, concussions, and heat exhaustion are just three of the many threats to our young athletes. It is on all of us to protect and preserve their health, and we are proud to re-introduce this legislation today to shield student athletes,” said Rep. Pascrell, co-chair and founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force. “The SAFE Play Act will help ensure that coaches, trainers, parents, and athletes are equipped with the resources to help treat and prevent different sports-related injuries they encounter. I want to thank Senator Menendez for leading to protect our kids and we will work together in House and Senate to secure passage of this important bill.”The Supporting Athletes, Families, and Educators to Protect the Lives of Athletic Youth Act, or SAFE PLAY Act, is the most comprehensive federal legislation before Congress aimed at improving the safety of youth athletes and focuses on various sports safety issues, such as heat exposure, EMS training, cardiac conditions, concussion response, and energy drink consumption.The SAFE Play Act builds upon legislation Sen. Menendez and Rep. Pascrell first introduced in response to a spate of serious athletic injuries and deaths in New Jersey and across the country, and language they had inserted in the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act to allow federal funding to be used to help states and school districts develop and implement student-athlete safety plans.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 30 million children across the U.S. participate in organized sports, 12 percent of those under 14 have been treated for a sports-related injury and 40 percent of those ages five to 14 have been treated in hospitals for sports-related injuries. Tragically, young athletes have suffered preventable fatal head injuries, strokes and cardiac arrests sustained during games.The SAFE PLAY Act aims to prevent and improve the treatment of sports-related injuries and illnesses among youth athletes, including sudden cardiac arrest, heat stroke, and concussions by:""Passage of The SAFE PLAY Act puts safety at the forefront, assuring parents a peace of mind that allows more time for cheering and less time worrying about their child's health. Sports Fans Coalition thanks Senator Menendez for his leadership and advocacy for youth athletes,” said Sports Fans Coalition Deputy Director of Public Policy, Earl Ash.""The number of fatalities from cardiac arrest can be reduced if a potentially life-threatening heart condition, like cardiomyopathy, is detected early and treated appropriately. The SAFE PLAY Act addresses this very issue and includes preventive measures to safeguard at-risk children,"" said Lisa Yue, the Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation's founder and board president. Proper diagnosis and treatment for cardiomyopathy in youth are priorities for Ms. Yue, who lost two young children to the disease. “I am grateful we have congressional leaders like Senator Menendez working to prevent unnecessary deaths among young athletes on the playing field.""See moreDecember 27, 2022

John Cornyn (R-Texas) unveiled a bipartisan resolution recognizing the 30th anniversary since the founding of the Hispanic National Internship Program (HNIP), a seminal program of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) known for promoting and celebrating Latino excellence and creating greater career development opportunities for Latino and Hispanic students across the country.“As co-chair of the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Senate Caucus, I am proud to join my fellow co-chair Senator Padilla, as well as Senator Cornyn, in recognizing HACU’s Hispanic National Internship Program for 30 years of excellence and service to Latino and Hispanic students committed to pursuing a career in public service”, said Sen. Menendez. “Today, I recommit to finding more ways to provide greater resources to our Hispanic-serving institutions and bolster life-changing career development programs such as HNIP.”“I’m proud to join Senator Menendez in honoring 30 years of HACU’s work to ensure greater access to higher education for Latino students,” said Sen. Padilla. “As co-chairs of the Senate HSI caucus, we will continue working alongside HACU to ensure that HSIs have the resources they need to support our students and strengthen the communities that are uplifted by their success.”“It’s important that we celebrate not only Hispanic heritage, but also educational achievements and opportunities for Hispanic students,” said Sen. Cornyn. “We all know that education is the key to the American dream, but no one understands that aspirational goal better than our Hispanic populations in Texas. I’m glad to support this program that has provided real-world experience through internships for three decades.”For 30 years, HNIP has helped provide federal and private internship opportunities to Latinos and underrepresented students attending Hispanic-serving institutions and other institutions of higher education. Over 14,000 HNIP alumni now work in federal, state, or local government and across private industries, furthering HACU’s goal of increasing diversity in the federal government and the private sector. There are 569 Hispanic-Serving Institutions found in 185 congressional districts across 28 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.In 2021 and 2022, the following institutions of higher learning from New Jersey, California, and Texas were represented in the HNIP: Rutgers University, Newark Campus; Rutgers University, News Brunswick Campus; Montclair State University; Kean University; Hudson County Community College; California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; San Francisco State University; California State University, Long Beach; California State University, Fresno; Humboldt State University; University of California, Davis; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Irvine; University of California, Riverside; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, Merced; University of California, Santa Barbara; California Lutheran University; California State University, East Bay; Sacramento State University; California State University, San Bernardino; California State University, Fullerton; San Diego State University; University of Southern California; Riverside City College; San Jose State University; California State University, Monterey Bay; University of Texas at Arlington; Northeast Lakeview College; University of Texas at El Paso; University of the Incarnate Word; University of Houston-Downtown; San Antonio College; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; Texas A&M University; Texas A&M International University; St. Mary’s University; St. Philip’s College; St. Edward’s University; Texas Lutheran University; Northwest Vista College; Texas State University, and; University of Houston-Clear Lake.“The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities thanks the Senate for recognizing the 30-year milestone of the HACU National Internship Program that has opened doors for many colleges students and served as a resource to increasing workforce diversity nationwide in the Federal Government and the private sector,” said HACU President and CEO Antonio R. Flores. “We are grateful to all our federal and corporate partners who have given our interns from Hispanic-Serving Institutions and other colleges and universities invaluable opportunities to gain real world experience to help shape the future workforce of this nation.”Joining Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn in supporting the resolution are Sens.

In addition to commending Secretary Albright’s patriotism and public service in the pursuit of a more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative world order, the bipartisan resolution extends the Senate’s sincere condolences and sympathies to Secretary Albright’s family and friends in the wake of her passing. “With this bipartisan resolution, we honor Secretary Albright’s extraordinary contributions to our global community and her unparalleled dedication to serving others both as the first woman Secretary of State and throughout her tenure in public service,” Chairman Menendez said. “As a child, she fled fascism as a refugee, later becoming a leading voice for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. As in her life, Secretary Albright’s legacy will continue to shape American statecraft and to inspire foreign policy leaders and public servants for generations to come. She was a dear friend and mentor to me and to many, and she will be deeply missed.”  “Madeleine Albright, a giant in the field of foreign policy, was a fierce defender of democracy and internationally-recognized human rights across the globe,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This resolution honors the indispensable work she did on behalf of the United States and extends sincere condolences to Secretary Albright’s family and loved ones.”  Joining Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch in introducing the resolution were Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).  “Madeleine Albright embodied the ideals of America. She was a constant light in the struggle between freedom and oppression, relentlessly advocating for people to have rights she knew didn’t exist under authoritarian regimes. She broke the highest glass ceiling in her field, then spent the rest of her life fighting for opportunities for women. We’ll remember her as a diplomat and a trail blazer,” said Senator Schatz. “Secretary Albright was a friend, a dedicated public servant, and a true champion for democracy around the globe,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I was honored to work with her in our respective roles as Chairs of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Secretary Albright will be greatly missed, but her life and legacy—which began when she and her family fled Soviet communism as a young girl, and led her to the highest branches of government—will help ensure the light of freedom and liberty continues shining brightly for many years to come.” “Madeleine Albright will be remembered as a giant of American diplomacy,” said Senator Coons. “I had the blessing of knowing Secretary Albright’s humor, brilliance, talent, and remarkable insights into world affairs over many years, and I am pleased the Senate has taken a moment today to honor her immense contributions to our country and to our world. As a stateswoman and a fierce advocate for democracy and human rights, Madeleine Albright truly made a lifetime of difference.” “A refugee who went on to become the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright’s life story is one of resoluteness and a reflection of the bright promises of democracy,” said Senator Romney. “Her service to our country and mark on U.S. foreign policy will be felt for generations to come.” “Madeleine Albright was a Virginian, a tireless champion for democracy, and a dear friend. She represented the very best of America—an immigrant from Czechoslovakia who rose to the highest position in American diplomacy, paving the way for women around the world,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m glad the Senate passed a resolution today in her honor. I will miss her wise counsel.” “Madeleine Albright came to the United States as a child refugee from war-torn Europe, fleeing Nazi and Soviet persecution. She grew up to become the first female Secretary of State – our nation’s top diplomat – breaking down barriers for generations of women to follow in her footsteps and stand on her shoulders. I’m proud to be one of those women and I’m honored to join members of the Senate to honor Secretary Albright for her service to our nation and for forging a path in government service that created space and leadership for women,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we mourn her loss, we don’t look back, but forward, on the opportunities she created for women around the world to realize their full potential. I urge Senate leadership to swiftly pass this resolution.” “Secretary Madeleine Albright was a trailblazer, a leader, a seasoned diplomat, and a champion for all humankind. After arriving in the United States as a refugee, she always fought to give a voice to the voiceless. And she was a force to be reckoned with,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Her legacy will never be forgotten. This resolution is a fitting way to highlight her courage and leadership which will continue to serve as an example for generations to come.” “The United States and the free world lost a giant with the passing of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,” said Senator Cardin. “She was a champion for democratic values and institutions, as well as diplomat extraordinaire, best-selling author, long-time leader of the National Democratic Institute, trailblazing Ambassador to the United Nations and glass-ceiling breaking Secretary of State. Secretary Albright also was the mother of three remarkably successful daughters and a mentor and friend to countless other women. Her contributions to strengthening American diplomacy and standing up for democracy cannot be overstated. She was an incredible leader and a presence the world will not soon forget.” “Madeleine Albright was an accomplished diplomat, human rights champion, and trailblazer,” Senator Merkley said. “As the first woman to hold the position of Secretary of State, she broke barriers and has left a long lasting legacy of effective global diplomacy which will continue for years to come and serve as a model for future generations of diplomats.”   Find a copy of the resolution HERE.

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-statement-on-confirmation-of-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-the-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) issued the following statement on the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court:“With our vote today to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, not only has the U.S. Senate made history, it has also witnessed — in real time — the bending of the moral arc of the universe towards justice and proved to women and girls everywhere that they too can be one of the nine guardians entrusted by the Constitution to ensure equal justice under law for all people.“As only the second Supreme Court Justice ever to have served at all three levels of our federal judiciary, I have no doubt that, given her impeccable credentials and lived experiences, Justice Jackson will faithfully carry out the duties entrusted to her by the Constitution. Her extensive knowledge about what the law can do, what it can limit, and what it can unlock make her an outstanding Justice who will usher the highest court of the land to a new era — more clearly reflecting who we are as a nation and what we stand for as a fair, just, and hopeful people.“As I cast my ‘yes’ vote on behalf of New Jerseyans everywhere, I could not help but think of what this meant for the three angels in my life — my granddaughters, Evangelina, Ofelia, and Olivia. After today’s historic vote, they will grow up knowing that, thanks to trailblazers like Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, there isn’t a single thing they can’t accomplish.” ###See moreDecember 08, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-presses-irs-commissioner-on-massive-processing-backlogs-poor-customer-service,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee that oversees the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), today pressed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig about what progress the agency has made to address numerous problems affecting American taxpayers all across the country, improve its poor customer service, and clear the massive processing backlogs of more than 15 million unprocessed returns from previous tax filing seasons.During his questioning of Commissioner Rettig, Sen. Menendez pointed out that two of the primary issues contributing to the backlog at the IRS was issues with hiring workers to answer the phones and the lack of technology that would allow workers to process returns faster.“The IRS is stuck in the 1960s before the Information Age,” said Sen. Menendez when questioning IRS Commissioner Rettig during the Finance Committee hearing “Last year, IRS employees were expected to open more than 21 million paper returns that were filed. They were expected to manually process the returns…This all takes time and is a reason why the IRS is a year behind on working down the backlog.”[WATCH FULL QUESTIONING HERE]Sen. Menendez also pressed Commissioner Rettig about the agency’s continued use of ID.me – facial recognition software that stores an individual’s data and biometrics.“I am also extremely concerned about the amount of information ID.me collects and stores for every taxpayer that uses its website—as a matter of fact as ID.me tells me according to this California disclosure in its notice for residents includes things like, age, gender, military/veteran status, and the taxpayers’ location...where they access the ID.me website,” added Sen. Menendez. “Even though tax returns and tax identity information—including a taxpayers’ name, address, and taxpayer identification number—are protected from disclosure or potential disclosure by Internal Revenue Code section 6103, the information disclosed to ID.me is not protected.”Sen. Menendez has long been sounding the alarm about the IRS’s customer service performance and the agency’s massive processing backlogs. Last month, Sen. Menendez led more than 100 Senate and House colleagues in a bicameral, bipartisan effort to press Commissioner Rettig for the IRS’s lack of a comprehensive plan to remedy the numerous problems affecting taxpayers as this filing season is already well underway. In February, Sen. Menendez and Rep. Spanberger led a bicameral effort with 45 colleagues urging the IRS to take immediate actions to reduce its massive backlog and improve its customer service during the 2022 tax filing season. Shortly after sending out the letter, the IRS announced it would be putting together a second surge team to help address the massive backlogs and continue to improve customer service. The Senator also led a push for greater transparency on the IRS’s continued engagement with ID.me, an online identity network that taxpayers can use to access government services, given the disproportionate harm such facial recognition technology can have on minority and low-income communities. After weeks of waiting, the IRS finally provided a response to this letter just days before today’s hearing focused solely on the handling and protection of biometric information. However, the IRS has failed to address concerns about how other information, including demographic information (i.e., race, gender, age, or military/veteran status), collected by ID.me is ultimately protected when taxpayers interact with this system.In late January, Sens. Menendez and Cassidy, along several members of the House, led more than 200 colleagues in a bipartisan and bicameral letter calling on the IRS to provide penalty relief for taxpayers – spurring the agency to temporarily halt some, but not all of the penalty notifications. Sens. Menendez and Cassidy also used IRS Commissioner Rettig last year to keep phone lines open while addressing the unprecedented backlog of unprocessed returns and to take concrete steps that will allow them to perform basic functions well such as answering phones, providing quality online and in-person services, and processing returns in a timely manner. ###See moreDecember 19, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/menendez-booker-join-bicameral-push-to-increase-educator-tax-deductions-for-out-of-pocket-classroom-expenses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker (both D-N.J.) joined a group of colleagues in introducing the Educators Expense Deduction Modernization Act of 2022. The legislation would quadruple the amount educators can deduct from their taxes for out-of-pocket classroom expenses from $250 to $1,000 per teacher and continue to index it to inflation. The current deduction for teachers is far less than most New Jersey teachers spend each year out of their own pocket on classroom supplies. “We know how hard our teachers work to ensure that New Jersey children receive the best education possible,” said Sen. Menendez.  “I hear it all the time when I speak with teachers across our state about how they go above and beyond to provide resources and materials for their students – often times spending thousands of dollars of their own money each year. All of those expenses add up and this legislation will help put some of their hard-earned money back in their pockets.” “Teachers across the nation often have to dip into their own pockets to purchase vital educational resources used in the classroom to help our children learn,” said Sen. Booker. “Through a simple change in the tax code, we can ensure that our educators receive some of the hard-earned money they spend back during tax season. I am proud to introduce this legislation that will make this change and support our teachers who have gone above and beyond for our students, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Educators showed once again how indispensable they are to our communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Department of Education, 94 percent of public-school teachers reportedly paid for classroom supplies without reimbursement, with nearly 1 in 10 reportedly spending more than $1,000 each year. Teachers in high-poverty areas are also more likely to spend more on out-of-pocket classroom costs to make up for fewer resources afforded to their school districts.  Teachers are paid far too little -- on average 20 percent less than similarly-skilled professionals – and are also too often asked to cover classroom expenses. “If the tax deduction amount is raised to $1,000 for a teacher to use in the classroom, it is going back to the taxpayer, in a sense,” said Jill Wagner, an English teacher for Independence Local Schools. “Teachers are instinctually creative, and the extra money will be used to be more inventive as to how to positively influence and support students and their school community. Teachers do NOT enter the profession to get financially rich. We do not get financial perks. We enter the profession to help children learn to the best of their abilities, and out-of-pocket expenses to make that happen are costing us more every year.” State spending on education has plummeted in recent decades. Increasing this deduction recognizes the personal sacrifices so many educators make to ensure our children have the tools to learn. The Educators Expense Deduction Modernization Act of 2022 is endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), National Education Association (NEA), Ohio Education Association (OEA), and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).                                                                                              Joining Sens. Menendez and Booker in introducing the legislation are Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). House cosponsors include Reps. Anthony Brown (M.D.-04), Colin Allred (Texas-32), Karen Bass (Calif.-37), Suzanne Bonamici (Ore.-01), Shontel Brown (Ohio-11), André Carson (Ind.-07), Sean Casten (Ill.-06), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (Fla.-20), Jahana Hayes (Conn.-05), Jim Langevin (R.I.-02), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.-AL), Jimmy Panetta (Calif.-20), Katie Porter (Calif.-45), Jamie Raskin (Md.-08), Darren Soto (Fla.-09), Tom Suozzi (N.Y.-03), Bennie Thompson (Miss.-02) Juan Vargas (Calif.-51) and Frederica Wilson (Fla.-24). The full text of the legislation can be found HERE.See moreDecember 27, 2022

https://www.menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/chairman-menendez-urges-un-to-prioritize-the-needs-of-ukrainian-women-and-girls-and-address-rising-concerns-of-widespread-sexual-violence,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today is calling on the United Nations to take every possible measure to respond to mounting reports of Russia’s systematic use of gender-based violence (GBV) against Ukrainian women and girls and to take immediate action to address the disproportionate impact of the humanitarian crisis on women, girls, and other vulnerable groups. In a new letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Chairman Menendez underscored the importance of the United Nations integrating appropriate protection measures for women and girls into every aspect of the international response to Putin’s illegitimate war against Ukraine. “Without adequate protections and responses, more Ukrainian women and girls remain at grave risk of rape and sexual assault each passing day of this brutal war,” Chairman Menendez wrote. “In areas retaken from retreating Russian forces, the world has been given a glimpse into the horrifying war crimes committed against Ukrainians, including the use of rape and sexual assault. The United Nations must prioritize robust protection programming for Ukrainian women and girls and move to swiftly ensure effective independent investigations into war crimes committed in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.” With women and children comprising the majority of the more than four million people who have fled Ukraine, the Chairman emphasized the importance of a robust response to prevent human trafficking, exploitation, and abuse of displaced groups, as well as the need to safeguard access to lifesaving health services and protection both inside of Ukraine and in the neighboring countries.  “For too long, the needs of women and girls in conflict have been an afterthought in the international response to conflict and humanitarian emergencies, despite the clear systematic use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war and the disproportionate impact of humanitarian crises on women and girls,” the Chairman added, stressing the urgent need to prioritize adequate maternal health care and other sexual and reproductive services in addition to psychosocial assistance for coping with trauma associated with GBV, family separation, violence, and displacement. “As the leader of the international humanitarian response, the United Nations is also uniquely positioned to elevate the needs of women, girls, and other at-risk populations from Ukraine. I strongly urge the United Nations to immediately take steps to address these concerns in its response to the Ukraine conflict and humanitarian crisis.” In order to bridge significant gaps in protections for women, children, and other groups at risk, the Chairman urged the UN to immediately take the following steps:   Find a copy of Chairman Menendez’s letter HERE and below.  Dear Secretary-General Guterres: As reports emerge of the widespread and systematic use of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and girls by Russian soldiers, I urge the United Nations to take every possible measure to prevent and respond to gender-based violence (GBV) in this conflict and to hold perpetrators accountable. Without adequate protections and responses, more Ukrainian women and girls remain at grave risk of rape and sexual assault each passing day of this brutal war. In areas retaken from retreating Russian forces, the world has been given a glimpse into the horrifying war crimes committed against Ukrainians, including the use of rape and sexual assault. The United Nations must prioritize robust protection programming for Ukrainian women and girls and move to swiftly ensure effective independent investigations into war crimes committed in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.  Furthermore, I am writing to urge you to take immediate action to address the impact of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries on women, children, and other populations at particular risk. Women and children comprise the majority of the more than 4 million people who have fled Ukraine and the millions forcibly displaced within the country. Their unique needs in emergencies urgently require responses to prevent human trafficking and exploitation and ensure their access to lifesaving health services and protection. By upholding best practices and commitments to women and girls and addressing these concerns from the earliest stages, the United Nations can save lives and reduce suffering. Displaced women, girls, and unaccompanied children are particularly at risk of human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and abuse, within Ukraine, en route as they flee, and once they cross borders. In addition, women and girls are facing critical unmet health needs, especially as vital health infrastructure is destroyed. In the next three months, 80,000 Ukrainian women and girls are expected to give birth, and there is an urgent need to prioritize adequate maternal health care and other sexual and reproductive health services, both in Ukraine and in refugee hosting countries. Psychosocial assistance is also needed to cope with the trauma of GBV, family separation, violence, and displacement, particularly for the almost half a million children impacted by the conflict who are now facing grave risks to their wellbeing. The United Nations’ response so far has been insufficient to address these concerns. This is creating significant gaps in protection for women, children, and other groups at risk, which will only worsen as the crisis continues to escalate. As the United Nations responds to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian emergency, I call on the United Nations to swiftly take the following steps:      For too long, the needs of women and girls in conflict have been an afterthought in the international response to conflict and humanitarian emergencies, despite the clear systematic use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war and the disproportionate impact of humanitarian crises on women and girls. The international community must work to prevent ongoing war crimes in Ukraine and bring justice for the Ukrainian women and girls suffering at the hands of Russian forces. As the leader of the international humanitarian response, the United Nations is also uniquely positioned to elevate the needs of women, girls, and other at-risk populations from Ukraine. I strongly urge the United Nations to immediately take steps to address these concerns in its response to the Ukraine conflict and humanitarian crisis.  Sincerely,See moreDecember 09, 2022
