Clemson University and South Carolina State University, South Carolina’s land-grant institutions, have established strategic partnerships with 27 regional entities to establish a pilot project to provide incentives to peanut, vegetable, beef cattle, and forest product growers and landowners to implement climate-smart production practices. The statewide project will enroll hundreds of South Carolina farmers to ensure meaningful involvement of small and underserved producers.“I very much appreciate Secretary Vilsack awarding this grant to strengthen South Carolina’s agriculture economy,” said Graham. “The world is experiencing a food crisis, and Clemson University, South Carolina State University, and South Carolina farmers are on the forefront of increasing crop yields and helping poverty-stricken regions through cutting-edge research. Investing in research and development – particularly as it pertains to agriculture – is a no-brainer.  I was proud to be a partner in the efforts to get this done.”Graham wrote to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack this summer encouraging USDA to make this important investment.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-applauds-clemson-sc-state-university-funding-announcement2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

This designation would:“Putin has crossed every line of civilized norms during the war in Ukraine and years before,” said Senator Graham. “He has engaged in state-sponsored assassinations, the Wagner group supported by Russia terrorizes the world, and the war crimes being committed in Ukraine on a daily basis shock the conscious. If Putin’s regime is not a State Sponsor of Terrorism after all this, then the designation is meaningless. We believe that it is long past due to designate Putin’s Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and suffer the consequences thereof because he is a terrorist. Ukrainians have been asking for this designation, and we are listening. This will be a game changer in how we deal with terrorists worldwide.”“The events of these past days and weeks have shown more than ever that Russia should be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,” said Senator Blumenthal. “What has been revealed in Ukraine’s success on the battlefield is not only its military prowess and Russia’s weakness, but also Putin’s reliance on brutal atrocities, genocide, and war crimes against the people of Ukraine. Russia has more than earned the right to be among the club of pariah nations.”The full text of the legislation can be found here.Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-blumenthal-introduce-russian-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-bill2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

While we’ve had our disagreements, I’ve always respected his point of view. I have never respected Andy more than I do now.“Andy took time to actually read the legislation and better understand what we’re trying to accomplish, and I hope others follow suit.“The legislation we introduced today, with the support of America’s leading pro-life groups, is designed to create a minimum standard in America when it comes to the unborn.“I agree that abortion is now in the hands of the states, but it does not mean that Washington is closed for business when it comes to protecting the unborn. While I’m a strong believer in the Tenth Amendment, many abuses have been justified under the guise of states’ rights. I do not believe completely abandoning the unborn under the guise of states’ rights serves the conservative cause or makes us a better nation.“The radical Left recently pushed legislation in Washington – supported by nearly every Democrat – that will allow abortion up until the point of birth. Their legislation is well outside the mainstream of the world, and I have been working with pro-life groups to produce an alternative.“The Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act is a rational, scientifically sound answer to this emotional issue.“The legislation I introduced is in the mainstream of the developed world. 47 out of 50 European nations have abortion restrictions more protective than 15 weeks. France, Denmark, and Norway are at 12 weeks. Germany, Spain, and Belgium are 14 weeks. There are only 7 nations that allow abortion on demand up until the point of birth – North Korea and China among them.“I believe the Republican party should be the party of respecting the Tenth Amendment – but we’re also a nation greater than the sum of its parts. A great nation should not allow procedures – in any state – that will result in the dismemberment of a 15 week developed child unless there were extraordinary circumstances.“My bill explicitly says it will not preempt states that have more restrictive proposals on abortion.“We know from medical science that babies feel pain because their nerve endings are developed by 15 weeks. That is why health care professionals administer anesthesia when operating on a baby at 15 weeks.“It seems to me that prohibiting the dismemberment of a child at this point in time is the right answer for a great nation and places us in the mainstream of developed nations.“Finally, I appreciate Andy’s second look at the bill and look forward to working with him and others as we address the proper role of not only government but society when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us – the unborn.”#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-we-cannot-abandon-the-unborn2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

The legislation would set a federal minimum protection for unborn children that is in line with European limits and ban abortion after 15 weeks gestation when unborn children can feel pain.Graham noted that the current standard of medical care calls for unborn babies to receive pain medication during fetal surgery at 15 weeks gestation. Life-saving surgeries performed in utero, using pain medication, include treatment for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and spina bifida.“Working closely with the preeminent pro-life groups in the country, we are today introducing legislation to ban abortion at a time when unborn children can feel pain,” said Graham. “Our legislation, which bans abortion after 15 weeks gestation, will put the United States abortion policy in line with other developed nations such as France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and other European nations.”The Graham legislation:“After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Democrats in Congress have rallied behind pro-choice legislation which allows abortion right up until the moment of birth. I view the Democrat proposal as radical and one that Americans will ultimately reject. Our legislation is a responsible alternative as we provide exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life and physical health of the mother,” concluded Graham.Graham noted that over 55,000 abortions at 15 weeks gestation or later occur each year in the United States, and the most recent state-level data shows that the majority of late-term abortions are performed for elective reasons.  A majority of Americans – 72 percent – are in favor of limiting abortions after 15 weeks.The full text of the legislation can be found here.####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-introduces-legislation-to-protect-unborn-children-bring-u-s-abortion-policy-in-line-with-other-developed-nations2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

But where are we six months later?“In our recent visit to Ukraine, we witnessed with our own eyes the brutality of the Russian invaders and the determination of the Ukrainian people and their leaders to fight back against Putin’s unprovoked invasion.“With the support of the American people, our Allies and other partners throughout the world, Ukraine has taken the weapons provided and fought like tigers. This has been a disaster for Putin.“Six months after the invasion, NATO is on the verge of expanding to 32 countries, the Russian economy has been crippled, and the Russian military is breaking.“Thanks to the help of the United States and other western allies, Ukraine is attacking Russian forces throughout their country with weapons and assistance.“Six months later, Ukraine has been bloodied but unbowed and remains a vibrant, sovereign democratic nation. Putin is more isolated than ever, and the International Criminal Court is pressing on all fronts to hold Putin and his cronies accountable for their war crimes.  “We remain in awe of the determination of the Ukrainian people and leadership to fight against Putin in Ukraine. On this Ukrainian Independence Day, we recognize and celebrate the freedom which Ukraine is fighting so fervently to defend and we recommit ourselves to military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to ensure Ukraine remains free.“It is now time to deliver a decisive blow to the Putin regime by designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. This would be a decisive blow to Putin’s economy and make it more difficult for others to come to his aid.“The Senate unanimously adopted our resolution to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. We are hopeful that the Biden Administration and Secretary Blinken will act soon.

    Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, argues against the ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ and warns the bill will ‘make every problem worse.’It’s easier to believe the Taliban actually did not know al Qaeda Leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was living in Kabul in a home owned by a senior aide to the number two Taliban commander than it is to believe Democrats ""Inflation Reduction Act"" will actually reduce inflation. To say that I'm opposed to the most recent Manchin-Schumer tax-and-spend proposal is an understatement.My point is simple.  The American Rescue Plan, passed last year, did not rescue the economy. The Inflation Reduction Act, set to be passed and signed into law very soon, is not going to reduce inflation. GRAHAM TORCHES MANCHIN-SCHUMER INFLATION REDUCTION ACT: THIS IS A 'FRAUD,' WILL MAKE EVERYTHING WORSEIf you don’t believe me, listen to outside organizations like Penn Wharton and the Congressional Budget Office sound the alarm. This legislation is not only disingenuous, packed with flaws and bad for Americans – it is procedurally dangerous for the future of the United States Senate.According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model – a metric that Sen. Manchin previously stated he trusted – the bill increases inflation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the so-called ""Inflation Reduction Act"" would have a negligible effect on inflation, either good or bad.  Those are hardly ringing endorsements in the effort to sell the legislation as an inflation reducer.However, on tax increases, the record is very clear. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill includes billions of dollars in taxes that will be passed on to consumers. The legislation pulls money out of the pockets of Americans already struggling to make ends meet due to record Biden inflation, especially those who make well below $400,000 a year.MANCHIN CLAIMS DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL SPENDING AND TAX BILL IS FILLED WITH GOP PRIORITIESIn addition to passing increased costs along to the American consumer, the bill drives up gas prices by increasing gas taxes at a time when motorists can least afford it.  Under this proposal, the Democrats impose a 16.4 cent tax on a barrel of imported oil, resurrecting a tax that expired in 1995. Previously, the tax was 9.7 cents. It’s coming back at 16.4 cents, adding billions of dollars of increases to gasoline production. It’s not a good idea to raise gas taxes during a recession.I want to be on record and crystal clear that when it comes time to funding the government through a continuing resolution – I will gladly do so – but I will not support a continuing resolution that has political paybacks even on policies I agree with.The bill also includes a $27 billion ""green bank,"" money for the IRS to audit middle class Americans, tax hikes during a recession, ObamaCare subsidies for the wealthy, and increased costs for domestic energy production.This legislation is not only disingenuous, packed with flaws and bad for Americans – it is procedurally dangerous for the future of the United States Senate.MANCHIN-SCHUMER 'INFLATION REDUCTION ACT' IS REALLY THE MANUFACTURING REDUCTION ACTThe full Manchin-Schumer package is contained in two separate legislative vehicles – reconciliation and a future continuing resolution. Without getting too far into the weeds of the Senate’s procedures, most of the provisions backed by the liberal Left can pass through the Senate via reconciliation, an infrequently used process that only requires a majority vote of 50 Senators. If all Democrats hang together, which is likely, this reckless tax-and-spend bill will pass the Senate with only Democrats voting in favor.

      (The Associated Press)The second part of Manchin-Schumer is a side-deal to streamline permitting and opening certain oil and gas pipelines. It will be part of a continuing resolution which requires 60 votes to pass, meaning at least 10 Republicans will need to support. It appears Senate Democrats promised to complete the political deal with Sen. Manchin by placing all of the energy expansion and permitting initiatives in the continuing resolution since they couldn’t nest it cleanly in this budget bill.MANCHIN-SCHUMER SPENDING BILL COULD ELIMINATE 30,000 JOBS, NEW ANALYSIS SHOWSThink ""Cornhusker Kickback"" of ObamaCare on a continuing resolution. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it erodes minority rights.I want to be on record and crystal clear that when it comes time to funding the government through a continuing resolution – I will gladly do so – but I will not support a continuing resolution that has political paybacks even on policies I agree with.I would encourage all of my Republican colleagues to come up with energy production proposals specific to their states.  Challenge our Democratic colleagues that if we’re going to change energy policy in one area, let’s change it in all areas.  Every state should benefit.  All boats should rise, not just one or two. I doubt the radical left will allow or vote for meaningful energy production ideas like this. It is imperative that we not legitimize this process because there will be no end to it.The best way forward is for the government to be funded without strings attached and stop playing politics on continuing resolutions. If we legitimize this then over time reconciliation plus policy initiatives attached to government funding will do major damage to the rights of the minority.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERManchin-Schumer is bad policy and does enough damage on its own.  The last thing we should do is compound the problem which is exactly what this latest backdoor legislative maneuver seeks to do.  I personally like Senators Manchin and Sinema.  On occasion, both have stood up for the institution of the Senate, preserving the legislative filibuster under extreme pressure.

https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=0380E79C-3753-4E11-B9A8-55BE3524C359,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), along with Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), and Marco Rubio (R-Florida), today sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas seeking information on how the department plans to secure the border against terrorist infiltration in light of the assassination of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan.In the letter, the senators warn: “We have been sounding the alarm for several years about how our broken border is a ripe opportunity for terrorists to enter the homeland. With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, our border is not secure. We have lost complete operational control of the southern border, and it serves as a calling card for terrorists everywhere.”The senators noted:“The most devastating event would be an organized terrorist attack, originating from Afghanistan, against our homeland via our southern border,” they continued. “We are tremendously exposed, as the unrelenting surge of illegal immigration on our southern border is tying up resources, and taking our eye off the ball when it comes to terrorism, drugs, and crime. The Border Patrol union and others have raised concern regarding the diversion and misuse of resources at the border. We must not ignore their concerns.”The full text of the letter is below.#####Dear Secretary Mayorkas:We are sure you are well aware of the recent drone strike killing al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul, Afghanistan. While we applaud the operation that brought this despicable terrorist to justice, we are unnerved by what it means for the current threat level in Afghanistan. To have the leader of al-Qaeda staying in the home of a top aide to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of one of the largest terrorist networks in Afghanistan, is beyond brazen. A recent United Nations report indicates several thousand foreign terrorist fighters are flocking to Afghanistan following our withdrawal, and it is clear from this recent strike that al-Qaeda is out in the open, and welcomed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.Prior to his death, Zawahiri was publicly calling for and encouraging attacks on the American homeland. We have been sounding the alarm for several years about how our broken border is a ripe opportunity for terrorists to enter the homeland. With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, our border is not secure. We have lost complete operational control of the southern border, and it serves as a calling card for terrorists everywhere.Accordingly, it is imperative that you report to us about your plan to secure the border against terrorist infiltration. The presence of Zawahiri in Kabul in such a brazen fashion should be a “five alarm fire” for the Biden Administration. The refusal to fix our broken asylum system, the reimplementation of catch and release, the abandonment of Remain in Mexico, and other policy choices by the Biden Administration have acted as pull factors which directly led to a virtual invasion by illegal immigrants. It is only a matter of time until terrorists and other transnational criminal organizations take full advantage of these vulnerabilities.While this is dangerous for our country, the most devastating event would be an organized terrorist attack, originating from Afghanistan, against our homeland via our southern border. We are tremendously exposed, as the unrelenting surge of illegal immigration on our southern border is tying up resources, and taking our eye off the ball when it comes to terrorism, drugs, and crime. The Border Patrol union and others have raised concern regarding the diversion and misuse of resources at the border. We must not ignore their concerns.Because of the ever-unfolding chaos at our southern border, terrorist groups that have already found a foothold in Central and South America, including in the Tri-Border area and elsewhere, now have an opportunity to enter the United States by way of Mexico. In the past nine months, the Border Patrol has apprehended at least 56 individuals who were on the Terrorist Screening Database. Given the unprecedented number of “got-aways” – 500,000 that we know about since last October – it is a near certainty that other individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database have entered the United States undetected, via our open southern border.Mr. Secretary, you must reverse course on the policies that have caused a virtual invasion of our country via our southern border.  If the administration continues to stand by idly, over time, the biggest beneficiary of this debacle will be international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Within a year of the collapse of Afghanistan and return to Taliban control, we see proof positive through Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul that Afghanistan is once again a safe haven for terrorists. This view is not only reinforced by the presence of Zawahiri in Kabul, but the United Nations through numerous reports has shined a light upon this problem.There are al-Qaeda training camps emerging all over Afghanistan.

https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=3DAF9D27-76C0-4370-B958-4FD90773169A,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), John Thune (R-South Dakota), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) will today introduce the Let Experienced Pilots Fly Act to address airline flights cancellations caused by a shortage of pilots. The legislation:With baby boomers making up half of the airline pilot population, roughly 5,000 fully qualified pilots will be forced to retire within the next two years and the problem will grow even more acute in the following years. The wave of forced pilot retirements continues even as hundreds of flights are being canceled due to a shortage of available pilots and crews.In 2007, the retirement age for pilots in the United States was raised from 60 to 65 after medical reports concluded age had an ‘insignificant impact’ on performance in the cockpit and there were safety precautions already in place to prevent accidents in case of incapacitation. Nothing in this legislation changes current safety and proficiency procedures for commercial pilots. Pilots will continue to be held to an incredibly high standard to ensure passenger safety.“There is a severe and growing pilot shortage in the United States. Every air traveler sees and feels the impact when they go to the airport,” said Senator Graham. “One of the biggest causes of air delays is a lack of available crews.  This summer, if your plane actually leaves on time, you feel like you won the lottery.  My legislation extends the mandatory retirement age by two years and will make an immediate and appreciable difference in keeping highly-trained pilots on the job.  The traveling public deserves better than what they are currently getting.  Our bill moves the needle in the right direction to address the critical pilot shortage.”“Long delays and cancellations have become all too common in airports across the country, including in Iowa. Part of the reason is due to a shortage of pilots, which has unfortunately caused some airlines to cancel service to Iowa regional airports. By allowing healthy pilots to extend their careers if they choose, our proposal is one step we can take to ensure Iowans have better access to commercial air service, quickly alleviate airport congestion and get Americans to their destinations in a timely manner,” Senator Grassley said.“America is facing a pilot shortage,” said Senator Blackburn. “Current rules block experienced pilots from the workforce based solely on their age. This legislation will raise the maximum age to 67, helping to reduce the worker shortage, lower the number of canceled flights, and increase travel into states like Tennessee.”“Our nation’s air travel system is struggling with a pilot shortage. The lack of available pilots causes flight cancellations and service reductions. This hurts Nebraska airports that rely on the Essential Air Service to stay connected. Raising the retirement age is a common-sense solution that will help to alleviate this crisis,” said Senator Fischer.“Airline staffing challenges continue to result in cancellations and delays across the aviation system,” said Senator Thune. “Providing an opportunity for highly qualified, experienced pilots to continue flying past age 65 is a sensible way to alleviate these challenges while training programs recover from the effects of the pandemic.”  “People in Wyoming rely on small rural airports, and I constantly hear from my constituents about cancellations and delays plaguing rural air service, in large part due to a lack of pilots,” said Senator Lummis. “Raising the mandatory retirement age to allow pilots to fly for an additional two years would mitigate some of these shortages and help restore rural air service, while ensuring we still have qualified and capable pilots manning our aircraft.”Watch Graham’s press conference on the legislation here.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/graham-senators-legislation-addresses-pilot-shortage2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is imploring his colleagues and the Biden administration to pay attention to northeast Syria, even as Russia's war in Ukraine and the threat of China loom large in defense circles.Graham recently returned from a trip to the al-Hol refugee camp and Hasakah prison, both in northeast Syria. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 55,000, consisting mainly of the wives and children of the Islamic State fighters who are in the prison, both of which are rampant with radicalization.A possible new generation of radicalized jihadis, in addition to those currently housed in Hasakah prison, presents a chilling risk to U.S. national security, according to Graham, who detailed his trip to the Washington Examiner in an interview on Wednesday.""The reemergence of ISIS as a threat to the American homeland is increasing by the day,"" he stated. ""There's a perfect storm brewing in northeastern Syria, where we have a refugee camp full of ISIS wives and children mixed in with other populations. That's going to be an ISIS factory. ... The radical elements of the camp are taking over.""Graham stressed the importance of improving the lives of the people in the camp, which he described as ""a tent city with very draconian living conditions,"" and it's an issue he plans to address on Capitol Hill. Defense officials have also stressed the repatriation of foreign nationals who reside in the refugee camp.""Congress needs to understand that the American military presence in Syria and Iraq is vital to our homeland security. Congress needs to be pushing the State Department and Iraq, the government of Iraq, to reduce the number of refugees at al-Hol refugee camp. Congress needs to be working with the administration to find solutions to the 11,000 ISIS prisoners. Throwing them in jail and forgetting about them, that is not going to work. The international community does pretty well AWOL.""Graham will lead an effort to push the State Department to appoint a special envoy to focus on ""improving the living conditions of the camp and trying to get the radical elements out"" and plans to introduce proposals to the appropriations bill.Last week, Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, agreed with Graham's sentiment, saying, ""The most durable solution to the challenges of these detention centers and the displaced person camps is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and, where appropriate, prosecute their nationals residing in northeast Syria.""In late January, ISIS fighters launched a prison break on the Hasakah prison, and the fighting went on for days until the Syrian Democratic Forces and Coalition Forces were able to end it.Timothy Betts, the U.S special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, said last week, ""The detention facility [was] full of hardened fighters ... and so there, they are definitely capable people. But I don't have with me who amongst them may have been the most senior. I am not aware of any significant ISIS figures that were amongst those that are no longer there.""Betts also called the battle a ""wake-up"" because it ""demonstrated that the detention facilities were not as secure as we might have believed.""Graham thinks the United States should increase its military footprint in the region by ""a couple hundred more"" in order to ensure the security of the prison, and he said he spoke with a U.S. military officer, one of the last to leave Iraq, who told him, ""If we don't get a handle on this, everything we've done to destroy the caliphate will unravel.""""We're not talking about thousands, but a couple of hundred more. I think our military footprint in Syria is vital to keep ISIS from reemerging because if they come back, the first target they want to hit is the United States.""One reason Graham thinks more troops are necessary is that the SDF, he said, would not be able to fight against a Turkish invasion and continue maintaining security at the prison, which is a concern considering the bad relations between Turkey and the YPG, a Kurdish militia in Syria that Turkey considers a close ally of the PKK, an organization it considers a terrorist group.""The Syrian Democratic Forces, the commandos guarding the jail, told us that if Turkey goes back into northeastern Syria like they did in 2019, they will fight Turkey to protect their homeland and will not have the resources to guard the ISIS prisoners,"" he warned. ""The American military is very worried that we're gonna lose control of both the camp and the prison, and you could have a reemergence of ISIS just like in 2014.""#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/icymi-perfect-storm-brewing-for-reemergence-of-isis-in-syria-graham-warns2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

The report will outline critical findings, including but not limited to, Iran’s ballistic missile activities, weaponization activities, and clandestine nuclear research.“It is imperative the United States government stays focused on monitoring Iranian nuclear ambitions,” said Senator Graham. “This legislation requires reports to Congress from relevant agencies on the status of the nuclear desires of the Iranian regime in several key areas. The best way for American leaders to make sound judgments about Iran is to have the most current and reliable information available. Our legislation also requires our government to collaborate with regional allies like Israel. No matter what happens with the Iran nuclear negotiations, we must monitor the Iranian nuclear program like a hawk. I appreciate working with Senator Menendez on this legislation as he is a reliable and steadfast defender of Israel and an opponent of the Iranian regime.”“I am pleased to have worked with Senator Graham to introduce this bipartisan legislation in light of the dangerous advancements in Iran’s nuclear program,” said Chairman Menendez. “With Iran’s unrelenting support of terrorism, its overmatching missile programs, and defiance in the face of international censure, there is no reason why the U.S. Congress should not receive the most up to date information about Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile activities or the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the threats posed by them. That is exactly what this bill will do.”Additionally, the legislation requires that the Secretary of State submit an annual diplomatic strategy for engaging with partners and allies of the United States regarding the nuclear weapons and missile activities of Iran that will include:The full text of the legislation can be found here. Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/graham-menendez-introduce-bill-to-track-iran-nuclear-efforts2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

American military leaders have expressed concern it could become a breeding ground for “ISIS 2.0.”Graham also visited a detention facility in Hasaka where some of the adult men and teenage boys are housed. Earlier this year, ISIS staged a major attack and breakout attempt on the prison leading to a fierce two week battle with many fatalities.“Most people think the war with ISIS is over. They don’t think about how you repair the damage,” said Senator Graham. “What do you do with the prisoners? How do you give young people better options? That’s why they give wars numbers — they just keep repeating.""ISIS Fighters’ Children Are Growing Up in a Desert Camp. What Will They Become?By Charlie SavageJuly 19, 2022AL HOL, Syria — Viewed from a helicopter, this enormous camp that holds the wives and children of dead or captured Islamic State fighters was a sea of white tents against the desolate landscape of drought-stricken northeastern Syria.From the ground, the human dimension of this tragedy came into focus. As a convoy of armored vehicles made its way up a dusty road, children emerged to stand at the fence amid garbage. Some waved. One boy, in a faded “Star Wars” shirt, stood with hands clasped behind his back. Another, in an oversize polo shirt, held aloft a star folded from paper.Al Hol is a detention camp for people displaced by the ISIS war — guards do not let residents walk out its gates. About 93 percent of the 55,000 people here are women and children, about half under 12 years old. While most have Iraqi or Syrian mothers, thousands come from about 51 other countries, including European nations that have been reluctant to repatriate them.The world’s attention has largely moved on since the Islamic State’s last major enclave here crumbled in 2019. But left behind are tens of thousands of children growing up under brutal circumstances and intensely vulnerable to radicalization. They are surrounded by hard-line, militant women; as boys grow into teenagers, they are sometimes transferred to wartime prisons for fighters.“We’ve seen the violence, and we also know that we have a huge population of kids that are growing older,” said Daoud Ghaznawi, who oversees the administration of services in the camp by nongovernmental organizations alongside guards provided by a Kurdish-led militia that controls the region. “If this stays this way, nothing good can come out of it.”Rights groups and the military have been sounding the alarm about the dangers of leaving the detained children of ISIS members to languish in the desert: In addition to being cruel, the miserable conditions risk forging them into a network of extremists numbed to violence and angry at the world.The camp for women and children is part of a constellation of facilities in northeastern Syria overseen by the Kurdish-led militia that also includes nearly two dozen prisons holding some 10,000 adult men — suspected ISIS fighters who have proved even more difficult to repatriate and pose the risk of breaking out.In late 2018, Al Hol held about 10,000 refugees and others displaced by war. But early the next year, as the American-backed coalition laid siege to Baghuz, the remaining ISIS stronghold, women and children who fled or survived were separated from the men and sent to Al Hol. Its population ballooned sevenfold.For years, the State Department has urged countries to repatriate their citizens, as the United States did. Doing so is politically unpopular given the prisoners’ association with the Islamic State, and even their younger children are often stigmatized as dangerous. But trickles of women and children have left.Iraq, which has the most, is going slowly: Many Iraqis are hostile to allowing ISIS families to return. At a Middle East Institute conference last week, Timothy Betts, the State Department’s acting counterterrorism coordinator, said Iraq had repatriated about 600 ISIS fighters and 2,500 other people from Al Hol — about a tenth of its citizens here and at a smaller detention camp.This month, France repatriated 16 women and 35 children, including some orphans. About 165 French children and 65 women are said to remain. Many European countries are especially unwilling to take back men, fearing that under their legal systems, their incarceration would last only a few years.In the meantime, security is deteriorating inside Al Hol. There have been about 25 murders this year. While the available data is imprecise, the pace of the killings has increased since late spring, including a murder last week and a woman who was found beheaded last month. Hard-core ISIS women, self-appointed as religious police, are presumed responsible for many killings as retaliation for transgressions like talking to the camp authorities.A delegation on a fact-finding mission, led by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, visited the facilities in recent weeks, inviting a New York Times reporter on a rare tour by a senior American official.The situation here could soon get worse. Turkey considers the Kurdish-led militia that controls northeastern Syria to be intertwined with a separatist terrorist group. The militia, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, has been the United States’ main on-the-ground ally fighting ISIS in Syria.Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States, attacked the S.D.F. in 2019, destabilizing the fragile region; it has signaled an intention to do so again soon.Should there be another Turkish incursion, American officials believe hundreds of thousands of people living in the border region could be displaced, adding to the turmoil. They also fear that S.D.F. prison guards and a related internal security force at Al Hol would redeploy personnel to the front — as happened in 2019 — and could lose control of ISIS detainees.“If a Turkish attack in fact comes down, we’re going to potentially have ISIS 2.0,” Brig. Gen. Claude K. Tudor Jr. of the Air Force, the commander of the Special Operations task force working to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria, said during a helicopter flight accompanying Mr. Graham into Syria.Warning that militants could try to regroup via mass prison breakouts, he added, “We think ISIS is looking to attack another prison or do something in Al Hol.”The S.D.F.’s control is already tenuous. Standing in the sweltering sun on the rooftop of a prison administration building in nearby Hasaka, General Amuda, the head of an S.D.F. commando unit that is a designated partner force of the United States and who uses a pseudonym, described a notorious ISIS attack there in January.A two-week battle ensued, killing dozens of S.D.F. guards and hundreds of ISIS detainees and fighters. He relayed the assault in vivid detail, pointing to bullet-riddled buildings and a spot where he said militants had burned two guards alive.Afterward, as the American military sought to determine who had been killed or escaped, it became clear that the militia did not have comprehensive records about its detainees. The Hasaka inmates also included hundreds of teenage boys apparently culled from Al Hol as they grew up; other teens have been sent to rehabilitation centers said to lack sufficient capacity.“That the militia in control doesn’t have a particularly accurate picture of what is going on tells you what you need to know,” said Charles Lister, the director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism and Extremism programs at the Middle East Institute. “We are doing nothing to prevent the current generation of detainees from wanting to continue to fight if they get out, and creating a melting pot for the next generation.”Dr. Abdulkarim Omar, the regional administration’s foreign relations head, said indoctrinated children who reached 12 to 14 years old must be separated because they could pose threats or produce babies for ISIS. He denied that teenagers who were sent to prisons because there was no room at rehabilitation centers were housed with battle-hardened adults.Of the roughly 10,000 adult male detainees accused of fighting for ISIS, about 5,000 are Syrian; 3,000 are Iraqi; and 2,000 come from some 60 other countries, officials said.The majority of those 2,000 come from countries in the Middle East or North Africa, including Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia. About 300 are Russian, while more than 250 come from Western and European countries, officials said.Al Hol is similarly divided. The main camp holds about 47,000 Syrians and Iraqis. An annex holds 8,000 wives and children of ISIS fighters from other countries. About 66 babies were born each month last year, they said.In 2022, the United States military is set to spend $155 million in Syria to train and equip the S.D.F., along with related work like bolstering ISIS prisons. The State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development plan to spend $852 million on humanitarian assistance in Syria and support to refugees in nearby countries.Pentagon funds have helped pay for guards and infrastructure, including metal detectors at Al Hol, and internal fences are expected to be built this month to allow guards to close off areas in a riot or after raids to clear out smuggled weapons. The American military is also logging biometric data, like DNA, of the adult male prisoners.In Hasaka, Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan Jr., the commander of the anti-ISIS task force in Iraq and Syria, said that nations unwilling to repatriate their ISIS citizens should at least pay the S.D.F. for housing them.Mr. Graham also suggested that the United Nations could create an international tribunal to prosecute Syrian ISIS members; the breakaway region is not a recognized sovereign nation with a legal system. But he noted that people had floated the same ideas during a similar visit four years ago and compared the situation to false calm after World War I.“Most people think the war with ISIS is over,” Mr. Graham said. “They don’t think about how you repair the damage. What do you do with the prisoners? How do you give young people better options? That’s why they give wars numbers — they just keep repeating.”Most children at Al Hol do not attend school — there are not enough of them, and some women refuse to let their offspring go. Mr. Ghaznawi said two schools were recently forced to close; they had stopped hiring camp residents as support staff, he said, and were repeatedly attacked.Kathryn Achilles, the advocacy, media and communications director for Syria for Save the Children, said it operates six “temporary learning spaces” at Al Hol, including one it recently rebuilt after it was set on fire. They teach a basic curriculum of English, Arabic, math and science. But the growing violence, she said, is further traumatizing the children.“These kids didn’t choose to go to Syria or to be born there, and they are trapped in this cycle of violence that is punishing them for the sins, or perceived sins, of their fathers,” she said. “The S.D.F. has been left with the responsibility of holding these people. These children are caught in the system, but what they need is to be returned home.”Linking improved camp security to quality of life, Mr. Ghaznawi downplayed incidents in which children at Al Hol threw stones at reporters as restless children acting out, but added that it could become worse.“We have a young population that is going to grow older and older,” he said, “and going to go from having violent acts to eventually having more and more ideological affiliations with ISIS.”#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/icymi-graham-leads-fact-finding-trip-to-al-hol2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

We were honored to meet with President Zelenskyy and had a long, thorough and candid discussion about the way forward. Putin has made one of the most significant military blunders in modern Russian history and we cannot forgive or forget the atrocities the Russian armed forces, at his direction, have and are continuing to commit.”“We were struck by the resilience and determination of the Ukrainian people in the face of such unprovoked inhumanity. Kyiv is a thriving city whose people are returning. In the fall, their children will go back to school as fighting continues in the east and south. America must continue to stand with them by providing the advanced air defense, artillery, ammunition, anti-mine, and medical equipment they need. This material is a good investment, not only in Ukraine’s sovereignty and freedom, but in the national security of all freedom-loving nations across the globe.” “We must also continue to support and highlight the successful insurgency effort in the east. Walking the hallowed ground of Bucha, where there is still evidence of mass graves, it is clear as day that Putin will not stop with Ukraine but will seek to continue threatening western democracy and the free market world. We join with our European allies, and other democracies across the globe, and encourage further sanctions and economic embargoes to cut off Russia’s ability to wage this war.”“After our meeting with the Minister of Interior and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, we are more committed than ever to supporting the International Criminal Court and the Ukrainian justice system to prosecute the high numbers of war crimes. The rule of law must prevail here.”“The battlefield is just one element of the fight—we must go after Putin and his oligarchs for the war crimes and genocide committed in Ukraine. Designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism labels them as the pariah nation that they are – recognizing Putin’s inhumanity and giving sanctions real teeth.“Democrats and Republicans continue to stand with Ukraine and democracy.”During their visit to Kyiv, Blumenthal and Graham presented President Zelenskyy with a copy of the resolution they have introduced to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. They also visited Bucha, the Kyiv suburb where Russian forces reportedly killed hundreds of innocent civilians.    A readout of the meeting from President Zelenskyy’s office can be found here.

The legislation is not perfect, but we must not let the perfect become the enemy of the good.  That is why I hope it will pass the U.S. Senate in a strong bipartisan vote.”##### Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/graham-supports-bipartisan-safer-communities-act2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

The senators emphasized the importance of judicial independence and keeping Supreme Court deliberations free from influence outside the courtroom – including, but not limited to, harassment and intimidation outside of their homes.“The responsibility of a judge-or justice-is to follow and apply the law according to his or her judgment,” wrote the senators. “It is not to do so according to the judgment of their community, or the desires of their political party, or the will of the mob. It is only their judgment that counts. This is why they are given life tenure, so that external considerations-such as politics or public opinion-will not influence their constitutional duties. Given these important distinctions it is only fitting that Congress prohibited the parading and picketing of judges' houses in order to influence their decisions. It is a measure that preserves judicial independence.”The senators referenced last week’s assassination attempt of Justice Brett Kavanaugh as a primary example of the importance of this law. They note that the Washington Post reported that the perpetrator discovered where Justice Kavanaugh lived by watching videos of protests outside his house.The senators also noted that a number of letters were relayed to the Department of Justice on the subject of judicial security leading up to the assassination attempt. Those letters, including one sent by Graham, were largely left unanswered.“Somehow, the situation is only escalating,” wrote the senators. “Not only did the illegal picketing resume mere hours after the assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh, but reports are that those seeking to intimidate the Justices at their homes plan to expand their campaign of harassment to their children's schools. Enough.”“We want to know why you aren't prosecuting these Section 1507 violations. We are aware that President Biden has endorsed home protests for Justices, but as you told us repeatedly, your decisions whom to prosecute would not be decided by the White House. Is White House policy keeping you from bringing charges? If not, tell us. Or tell our staff. You can respond by letter or you can schedule a phone call or even a briefing. If there is a good reason why you aren't charging these obvious crimes, explain it to us. We want to understand. The situation is too dire and too important for more meaningless boilerplate about Justice Department policies,” concluded the senators.The full text of the letter is available here.##### Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/graham-to-doj-uphold-the-law-protect-supreme-court-justices2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/op-eds-columns?ContentRecord_id=10EF9CB5-EFB7-4A96-8197-987FDA2A457C,"There is an ongoing, vicious effort by a maniacal dictator to rewrite the map of Europe. Some American voices are saying ""stay out – what happens there doesn’t matter to us.""It all sounds too familiar. The last time this happened, it led to World War II. This time, the brave people of Ukraine and their incredible military are more than holding their own against Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to destroy Ukraine as an independent, sovereign democratic nation.The brutal invasion of Russia has devastated the Ukrainian economy, and Ukraine is unable to continue this fight without military aid. This Ukrainian victory over Russia would be priceless for the United States, because if Putin is not defeated in Ukraine he will continue to rewrite the map of Europe – his words, not mine.In the last century, the policy of appeasement and an isolationist fever allowed Hitler to gain strength and avoid being effectively stopped numerous times. The rest is history.Providing state-of-the-art weapons for the Ukrainian military helps the American economy by keeping the defense supply chain open and running. This type of military assistance will create jobs in America.The mistakes the world made in World War II need not be repeated in this conflict. Ukraine is not asking for American service members to fight – they're only asking for weapons and economic systems to continue the fight.I am certain this package could be improved and more efficient and $40 billion is a lot of money, but the sooner the Ukrainian military can receive more weapons and the Ukrainian people can receive much-needed economic humanitarian support, the better. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to defeat Putin's Russia, and the ripple effect would be enormous for U.S. national security interests. When it comes to Putin, either we pay now or we pay later.Congress has an opportunity to supply Ukraine with $40 billion worth of weapons and economic and humanitarian aid. Over half of this package would replenish U.S. weapons stocks and provide military weaponry to the Ukrainian forces who have shown an ability to use everything America has given them with amazing effectiveness. It is possible, in my view, for Ukraine to defeat the Russian army militarily.If Putin is stopped in Ukraine and eventually replaced, China will be far less likely to invade Taiwan. Having just returned from Taiwan, I can assure you that Asia is watching the fight between Russia and Ukraine.President Trump provided lethal aid to Ukraine on his watch, and that aid was used effectively. The Biden administration, while slow at first, is now working with our allies to supply Ukraine with weapons that are making a difference.I am in awe of and inspired by Ukraine’s ability to fight like tigers to push the Russians out of western Ukraine. Some estimate that up to one third of Russian military capability has been lost in Ukraine.The rumblings of discontent in Russia are growing, and the Russian military is realizing that this war in Ukraine is beyond devastating to them. We are at a decisive point in this conflict, and now is not the time to take our foot off the pedal.It is my hope and belief that there will be a large bipartisan vote in support of much-needed assistance to Ukraine with the understanding that Ukrainian victory over Russia is a victory for democracy itself.We’ve seen what happens when politicians talk about defunding the police. Denying Ukraine economic and military assistance at this crucial time would be equivalent to defunding the police in terms of world order. Putin would be emboldened if he believed America and our allies are backing off supporting Ukraine. As with defunding the police, there would be a breakdown in world order from China to Iran.Putin must see an unending commitment by the West to supply weapons to the Ukrainian military, and the Ukrainian people must see that the freedom-loving world is with them. The Russian people must understand that Putin’s misadventure in Ukraine will be a nightmare for the future of Russia.America is by nature a noninterventionist nation. However, America has historically been the arsenal of democracy and stood up for freedom when very few would. It is in our national security interest to stand up for freedom for the Ukrainian people and send a signal to other bad actors like Iran and China that we have the resolve necessary to push back against evil aggression.I believe the combination of a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and a weak approach to Putin's military buildup led to this invasion. It is now time to reset these mistakes by providing economic and military assistance to the Ukrainian people who are very much deserving of our support and respect.While we have many problems and challenges here at home – broken borders, a broken supply chain, rampant inflation, spiraling debt – none are made better by Putin winning in Ukraine. Quite the opposite – if Putin loses in Ukraine, the world will stabilize over time. A yes vote for Ukrainian assistance is a no vote to Putin’s barbaric evil war.Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/why-i-support-a-ukraine-aid-package-before-it-s-too-late2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

They would also have a federal takeover of our state election systems and undermine election integrity.  The radical Left is now calling for the end of the Senate filibuster as a response to the draft opinion being released publicly. This only compounds the problem.  Why destroy the Senate after this outrage against the Supreme Court’s deliberative process? When it comes to outcomes, the radical Left will do whatever they view as necessary – institutions be damned.“If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, which I believe was one of the largest power grabs in the history of the Court, it means that every state will decide if abortion is legal and on what terms.

A clear and concise strategy on how the world can ensure the sovereignty of Ukraine and hold Putin accountable includes:Expanded NATO membershipIf Finland and Sweden join NATO, they will make the alliance even stronger.  Additional members of the alliance would further expand the military capabilities of NATO, creating a stronger, more well-rounded force.Putin’s invasion has crystallized the need for NATO members to meet the 2% GDP spending obligation for defense. Increasing NATO’s presence on Putin’s doorstep would send a strong and clear message that the world will not tolerate his unprovoked invasion, and the freedom-loving world is prepared to curtail any further aggression.European oil and gas customers abandoning PutinThe effort by European countries to shed themselves of Russian oil and gas should accelerate and include a no-turning-back commitment to that goal.When this conflict ends and Putin has fewer European customers for his oil and gas, it will be a devastating blow to his ability to wage war. Other countries outside of Europe must also know that there will be consequences should they decide to replace his lost European customers.Accountability for Putin and his generals' war crimesThere must be an ongoing effort to hold Putin and the generals who carried out the attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians accountable as the war criminals they are.The international community should support the International Criminal Court’s investigation and other investigations that arise into his barbarity.Putin should be viewed as an outlaw and war criminal on the world stage.A ""forgive and forget"" approach to Putin and his war crimes will only set the stage for further aggression. If Putin winds up losing this conflict and is left isolated on the global stage, then the brave Ukrainians will not have died in vain.Continued sanctions punishing Putin’s regime for the invasion of UkraineEconomic sanctions should remain in full force as long as Putin and his cronies occupy one inch of Ukrainian territory. We must also maintain a firm and unequivocal commitment to keeping the crushing sanctions in place without any loopholes.Additional weapons support for UkraineA loss for Putin is possible if the freedom-loving world goes all-in for victory. All-in means providing the Ukrainian Armed Forces with additional lethal aid and capabilities such as larger Switchblade drones, fighter aircraft, more sophisticated missile defense systems, and tanks to take the fight to Putin.The Ukrainian military has proven to be a formidable foe and must have the continued ability to defend themselves far in the future. The more damage the Ukrainian military can do the sooner this conflict will end on favorable terms. Lethal assistance is critical to the ongoing fight.The Ukrainians are committed to victory on the battlefield. The United States and our allies must be as well.The Biden administration and the western world must not let Putin determine how we assist Ukraine in their fight for freedom.Zelenskyy’s continued leadership of UkraineLast but not least, a devastating loss for Putin would preserve the administration of President Zelenskyy.In order to ensure a sovereign Ukraine, security guarantees from Western nations like the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany and other nations will be needed. These guarantees must ensure the United States, and others, would come to Ukraine’s aid if there were a future invasion.It is critical that these new security guarantees be stronger than the Budapest Memorandum and reflect mutual defense agreements that the United States has with other nations outside of NATO like South Korea, Australia and Japan.For this war to end in a way that would deter future wars, Putin must be stopped and a democratic Ukraine must still remain standing.The world is watching. The strong actions we take today will impact bad actors in the future who may think twice before engaging in conflict. China is less likely to invade Taiwan, and Iran may have a different view of the Western world if we are successful in Ukraine.This is a historic moment in which we can reinforce all the values freedom-loving people hold near and dear. The best way to honor those killed in Ukraine who have fought valiantly for their freedom, who died at the hands of war criminals, is for Ukraine to be successful.Republican Lindsey Graham represents South Carolina in the United States Senate.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/victory-for-ukraine-defeat-for-russia-6-steps-to-holding-putin-accountable2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

She will not enhance a sentence based on the perpetrator’s use of a computer.“These decisions destroy deterrence in this area and show a lack of appreciation for how the internet has become the venue of choice for child pornographers.”Guantanamo Bay and the Law of War:GRAHAM: “My problem with Judge Jackson is not the fact that she represented Guantanamo detainees, but the fact that she exhibited an activist zeal in how she characterized the detainees and called the Bush Administration “war criminals” in legal briefs. This is the language of the Left.“Judge Jackson also advocated for ending Law of War indefinite detention of enemy combatants. Without this tool, many enemy combatants captured on the battlefield would be released from custody and return to the fight.”Activism on the Bench:GRAHAM: “No one wants a judge who ignores the law to achieve personal ends.”Double Standards on Conservative Judicial Nominees:GRAHAM: “My Democratic colleagues often note the historic nature of Judge Jackson's nomination as she would be the first African American female to serve on the Supreme Court.“I support the idea of making the Court more like America. However, the people celebrating this nomination are the same people who filibustered and blocked President George W. Bush's nominee Janice Rogers Brown, an African American member of the California Supreme Court, to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for two years. “It speaks volumes about their true desire. The true goal of Democrats is to make the Court liberal, not diverse.“Finally, when I hear comparisons of Judge Jackson’s hearing to that of then-Judge Kavanaugh, it reminds me how in-the-tank the media is for the liberal cause.“In the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Jackson was asked probative questions. However, no one withheld allegations from Judge Jackson or the committee, as was the case in Judge Kavanaugh’s hearings. Many Senate Democrats were willing to push false allegations against Judge Kavanaugh as if they were true. They were willing to push unsubstantiated allegations that defied scrutiny to keep Judge Kavanaugh off the Court. They wanted the pick to fill the seat to be made by a Democratic President. Nothing was off-limits or out of bounds.”In Conclusion:GRAHAM: “Judge Jackson’s hearing was challenging and informative, the nature of which you would expect for a lifetime appointment.“The refusal by Chairman Durbin to release the presentence reports, even in a confidential manner that would respect victims’ sensitive information about those sentenced by Judge Jackson in the area of child pornography is beyond unacceptable. Every senator deserves to know facts pertinent to the nominee’s record as a judge and the consequences of their decisions. These records shed light on whether or not there were indications of recidivism in the area of child pornography by those sentenced by Judge Jackson. Such information is being denied.“The White House, the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, and Judge Jackson herself are refusing to allow an appropriate, in-camera review of cases presided over by Judge Jackson. I can only imagine if the shoe were on the other foot.“It is well-known that I openly supported U.S. District Court Judge Michelle Childs from South Carolina for nomination to the Supreme Court. She is a well-respected African American District Court Judge in South Carolina, admired by all in our state.“When her name was mentioned as a potential nominee, the Radical Left declared war on her nomination and gave their full support to Judge Jackson. There's no doubt in my mind that Judge Childs would have been a reliable vote for the liberal bloc of the Court, but I do believe that she possesses the open mind and balance that all Americans are looking for. She would have received a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate.”#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/graham-opposes-jackson-nomination-to-the-supreme-court2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

I would if I were you.“I found it offensive when they said it about Judge Barrett. The reason I ask these questions is I have no doubt that your faith is important to you, and I have zero doubt that you can adjudicate people's cases fairly if they’re an atheist. If I had any doubt, I would say so.“The only reason I mention this, Judge, is you're reluctant to talk about it because it's uncomfortable. Just imagine what would happen if people on late night television called you an ‘f-ing nut’ speaking in tongues because you practice the Catholic faith in a way they couldn’t relate to or found uncomfortable.” https://youtu.be/4VapXt4RuTw?t=113Guantanamo Bay and the Detention of Enemy Combatants:GRAHAM: “Would you say that our system in terms of releasing people [from Gitmo] needs to be relooked at?”JACKSON: “Senator, what I’d say is that that's not a job for the courts in this way.”GRAHAM: “As an American does that bother you?”JACKSON: “Well, obviously Senator any repeated criminal behavior or repeated attacks, acts of war bother me as an American.”GRAHAM: “It bothers me. While I will not hold it against you, nor should I, the fact that you represented Gitmo detainees, I think it's time to look at this system of new folks. When 31% of people are going back to fight to kill Americans and now are running the Taliban government, we have gone wrong somewhere.” https://youtu.be/4VapXt4RuTw?t=735GRAHAM: “Do you support the idea, did you support then the idea, that indefinite detention of an enemy combatant is unlawful?”JACKSON: “Respectfully, Senator, when you are an attorney and you have clients who come to you, whether they pay or not, you represent their positions before the court.”GRAHAM: “I'm sure everybody at Gitmo wants out. No, I got that. This is an amicus brief, and I just don't understand what you're saying, quite frankly, I'm not holding it against you because you represented a legal position I disagree with. I mean, that happens all the time. I'm just trying to understand what made you join this cause. You say somebody hired you but did you feel okay in adopting that cause? I mean, when you signed onto the brief, were you not advocating that position to the court?”JACKSON: “Senator, as a judge now, in order to determine the lawfulness or unlawfulness of any particular issue I need to receive briefs and information making positions on all sides.”GRAHAM: “I get what a judge is all about. Listen, I'm not asking you to decide the case in front of me right here. I'm asking you to explain a position you took as a lawyer regarding the law of war, and I am beyond confused. I know what you said in your brief. Whether I agree with you or not is not the point. I just want you to understand that it's important for all of us to know where you were coming from.“If that brief had been accepted by the court, it would be impossible for us to fight this war because there's some people who are gonna die in jail in Gitmo and never go to trial for a lot of good reasons because the evidence against them is so sensitive we can't disclose it to the public. That we're not charging them with a crime.“What we're doing is saying that ‘you engaged in hostile activities against the United States, that you're an enemy combatant under our law, and you will never be released until the war is over or you're no longer a danger.’ That's the difference between fighting a crime and a war.” https://youtu.be/4VapXt4RuTw?t=1299Watch Full Remarks Here #####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/graham-questions-supreme-court-nominee2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

We have written letters. Now it’s time to take votes. If we had a vote on the resolution to supply the Ukrainian military with the MiG fighters and other air defense systems, it would be a shot in the arm to the Ukrainian people and their military. It would be a blow to Putin. If we do this soon, I think it really could help the outcome of this conflict.”The Graham resolution:The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), and James Lankford (R-Oklahoma).“Putin and his army continue to target innocent Ukrainian civilians, their public infrastructure, farms, hospitals, and even homes. The Ukrainian people, under President Zelenskyy, have fought back valiantly, but they need more support from the United States and our NATO allies. President Biden must act immediately to transfer MiGs and air defense systems to our allies and allow the Ukrainians to protect their people and their country. Every second counts,” said Senator Ernst. “The Administration should immediately expedite the transfer of MiG-29 aircraft and air systems, as well as additional support capabilities, to Ukraine,” said Senator Crapo. “We have to do more to defend the sovereignty of a free and democratic nation.”“I fully support the immediate transfer of MiG-29s and other air defense systems to Ukraine. President Zelensky has asked for these aircraft multiple times,” said Senator Cramer. “We should have green-lighted them from the beginning. It is our responsibility as leaders of the free world to give the independent people of Ukraine all the tools they need to protect themselves against Putin’s thuggery and aggression.”“President Biden’s continued blockage of planes going to Ukraine is heartless and unreasonable,” said Senator Rick Scott. “Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s unjust invasion is a fight for democracy and our security and I have been clear that the United States must lead the world in both supporting Ukraine and destroying Russia for its horrific attacks and war. Children are dying and the Ukrainian military needs planes to bring their fight to the skies and protect its people. The United States has the power to give Ukraine what it needs to win. We must use it.”“Vladimir Putin is at war with the entire free world, and President Biden has not yet done nearly enough to stop his invasion of Ukraine,” Senator Wicker said. “Our Ukrainian friends have asked for increased airpower and more air defense systems, and our Polish allies have expressed a willingness to help. We need to say less and do more, starting with transferring these vital defensive assets to Ukraine without delay.”“We must do everything in our power to help the people of Ukraine defend themselves against the monstrous actions of Vladimir Putin,” Senator Romney said. “That means getting them the capabilities they need—MiG-29 jets, air defense systems, anti-tank missiles, ammunition—to fight and keep their land and skies safe. America has a responsibility to defend freedom around the world, and we must not wait any longer—get Ukraine what they need now.”“The US has provided javelins, stingers, intelligence information, food, water, and medical supplies to Ukraine already,” said Senator Lankford. “If it’s within our power to do good, we should do good. The US has access to the MiG-29s jet fighter aircraft and we should not withhold from Ukraine. We have an opportunity to assist Ukraine to protect their nation and their people from Putin’s aggression. We can and we should step up.”The resolution text can be found here.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/graham-introduces-resolution-urging-mig-29-transfer-to-ukraine2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=6EBCCE73-65F3-4CC8-B816-E5D177E82D3A,"WASHINGTON – A group of Republican senators led by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) yesterday sent a letter to President Biden calling on him to reclaim American energy independence by approving the Keystone XL Pipeline and opening up federal lands to energy producers to increase domestic energy production in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine.“The world is in peril and we would like to work in a bipartisan manner to meet the challenges of our time,” wrote the senators. “In the area of energy independence, we have lost ground. Opening up American oil and gas deposits, and in particular approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, would benefit our allies suffering under Russian tyranny and American consumers facing steadily increasing prices at the pump.”The senators highlighted that, while domestic oil production doubled in the last decade, President Biden has taken actions that have backpedaled America’s energy independence. These actions include President Biden’s executive orders revoking a previously approved permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline and pausing new oil and natural gas leases on public lands and offshore water, resulting in the United States purchasing on average 670,000 barrels of Russian oil per day to meet our domestic needs. “Through smart energy production, we can fulfill our energy needs while simultaneously exporting oil and gas to our allies,” wrote the senators. “Low carbon technologies are worth investing in; however, the reality of the moment is that America is increasingly reliant on imports of foreign oil. The spike in oil price is a result of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine, which benefits the Putin regime and hurts American consumers.”“We urge you to lead the world in sanctioning Russia’s oil and gas sector, which makes up almost 40% of their revenue,” concluded the senators. “We must reverse course and hit Russia’s energy sector for Putin’s outrage against Ukraine and other atrocities. Further, we encourage you to reconsider the Keystone Pipeline and work with energy producers to responsibly increase oil and gas production at home. These actions will lessen the impact of increasing energy costs on American consumers and strike a blow against Putin.”Graham sent the letter with Senators Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), Todd Young (R-Indiana), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).The full text of the letter can be found here.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/senators-push-for-expanded-domestic-energy-production-in-letter-to-biden2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"
https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=DAC7B943-CC6F-4B89-AD93-23ECE8F37074,"WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of senators led by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) yesterday introduced a Senate resolution calling for Vladimir Putin and members of his regime to be held accountable for the numerous acts of war, aggression, and human rights abuses that have been conducted under his watch.The Graham resolution:“Dictators like Putin care only about themselves and their cronies,” said Senator Graham. “This resolution supports efforts to bring forward war crimes complaints against the Putin regime to the International Criminal Court and is a chance to stop Putin’s madness. The resolution supports the investigation of Putin as a war criminal and urges the ICC and ICJ to expand their investigation to include the Russian military and its commanders who are carrying out these war crimes. If the United States Senate supports efforts to hold Putin accountable, I believe other nations will join. It will be the first step in decades to make the consequences of his actions real to Putin.”The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons (D-Delaware), Ben Cardin (D-Maryland), Angus King (I-Maine), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Dianne Feinstein (D-California), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico), and Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi).  “It is already obvious to any observer that the wanton assaults on residential buildings, schools, synagogues and churches in various cities across Ukraine suggest that war crimes are being committed by the Russian military on the orders of Vladimir Putin,” said Senator Cardin. “An immediate start to investigations by the International Criminal Court is appropriate and necessary, as this bipartisan resolution makes clear.”“Vladimir Putin is an autocratic thug who is slaughtering innocent people and attempting to overrun a sovereign, freedom-loving nation, and partner of the United States. Thousands of men, women, and children are dying at the hands of his murderous regime—and he must be held accountable. The Senate, Iowa, America, and the western world stand with the people of Ukraine and condemn Putin and his cronies and I’m calling on the International Criminal Court to prosecute their war crimes,” said Senator Ernst.“Vladimir Putin’s heinous attack on a sovereign nation has ended decades of peace among the nations of Europe and created immense suffering across Ukraine and Russia,” said Senator King. “His thinly veiled attempt to reconstitute the Soviet Union will not be successful – instead, he has single-handedly devastated the Russian economy and rallied the Ukrainian people around their shared national identity. But as Putin’s grand ambitions stall, it’s clear he is ramping up his illegal assault, attacking innocent civilians, and willfully committing atrocities against Ukraine’s most vulnerable. The United States and our partners across the free world stand with the Ukrainian people and their brave leaders against these atrocities. This bipartisan resolution reaffirms that commitment; together, we will ensure that Russia feels the harsh consequences of Putin’s unprovoked invasion.”“Putin is a brutal dictator who has repeatedly violated international law since coming to power and he should be held accountable. This bipartisan Senate resolution stands with the Ukrainian people and supports Ukraine’s war crimes complaint to the International Criminal Court,” said Senator Baldwin. “It is important to support the investigation of Putin as a war criminal and hold him and those carrying out his attacks accountable for the tragic death, destruction and human rights abuses they are responsible for. I am proud to stand with my Senate colleagues in a bipartisan show of support to Ukraine and it people who only want peace and the freedom democracy brings.”“The appalling attacks on civilians in Ukraine are the latest in a long line of Vladimir Putin’s unjustifiable orders,” said Senator Moran. “From indiscriminate bombings in Chechnya and Syria to targeted assassinations in London and Berlin, Vladimir Putin and those who obey his commands are not just thugs, they are war criminals. The United States and international community should hold them accountable.”“Putin’s inhumane and unprovoked attack on Ukraine and its people can’t go unpunished, and neither should his dark history of jailing and even murdering dissidents. By holding Putin and his allies accountable for the innocent blood they have on their hands, we can ensure they’re brought to justice and prevent future atrocities,” Senator Grassley said.""Vladimir Putin's illegal and unjust war of choice against Ukraine and its people is an outrageous affront to peace and democracy,” said Senator Booker. “I unequivocally condemn this unprovoked invasion and support efforts to hold Putin and his enablers accountable for their ongoing abuses of the most fundamental human rights.""“The world has watched in horror as Putin has used brute military force in an attempt to subjugate the peaceful country of Ukraine, killing countless innocent civilians in his path,” said Senator Collins. “The resilience and determination of the Ukrainian people who are standing up to this ruthless autocrat to defend their democracy and their freedom are inspiring, but they need our continued support.  As we continue to assist the Ukrainians through the supply of weapons and humanitarian aid as well as the imposition of sanctions, this resolution calls for holding Putin accountable for the war crimes he has committed and will help pressure Russia to bring an end to this terrible war.”“Putin must be held accountable for his unprovoked attacks on the Ukrainian people. He has blood on his hands, and I join my colleagues today in standing with the people of Ukraine and calling for a thorough investigation into war crimes Putin and his military may have committed. We will not back down in our steadfast support for the territorial sovereignty and rights of the people of Ukraine,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has caused widespread destruction and substantial loss of life. The United States must stand with the people of Ukraine and hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his war crimes against innocent civilians,” said Senator Marshall.“Vladimir Putin is a cruel dictator and a war criminal,” Senator Wicker said. “It is time for the U.S. to call Putin what he is and condemn this Russian invasion in the strongest possible terms. I commend the International Criminal Court for their quick work to open an investigation into the blatant abuse of human rights and widespread crimes against the people of Ukraine.”“Russia’s unjustified, unprovoked aggression against Ukraine must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Vladimir Putin and his regime must be held accountable by the international community for their human rights abuses and their indefensible attack on the people and democracy of Ukraine,” said Senator Heinrich.The resolution can be found here.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/senators-introduce-resolution-calling-for-war-crimes-accountability2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=A11C0818-0C30-4E94-B0E6-D9C38FC71EFF,"WASHINGTON – Last week, a coalition of survivors, law enforcement leaders, and child safety advocates praised the Senate Judiciary Committee’s approval of the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT Act) at a press conference hosted by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). The bipartisan legislation would remove blanket immunity for violations of laws related to online child sexual abuse material (CSAM).Joining Graham and Blumenthal were representatives from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, Courtney’s House, Enough is Enough, the National District Attorneys Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and the Match Group.Yiota Souras, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) said: “Most importantly, this is a bill focused on the survivors. It enables survivor participation and best practices, provides survivors with their day in court against everyone who knowingly participates in distributing their images online, and it will finally catch the United States up to the rest of the world by calling this abuse what it is – not child pornography, but child sexual abuse material.”Samantha Cadet, Director of Federal Affairs, Appropriations, and National Coalitions for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) read an anonymous survivor statement that said: “My CSAM was tweeted online like baseball cards for pedophiles…We shouldn’t need accountability in tech, but these companies have lost all humanity and refuse to use technology that has existed for years to stop my exploitation. Survivors of CSAM struggle in the midst of healing and cannot always speak up as often as we would like because we avoid unwanted attention. But I refuse to be silent. We shouldn’t have to force companies to do the right thing, but they pretend to care, then use CDA 230 to shut the courtroom doors on us. The EARN IT Act of 2022 will help stop this endless invasion of my privacy that will otherwise continue for the rest of my life, even long after I’m gone. I never saw a solution before. If the EARN IT Act passes, then maybe the images of my childhood suffering will be offline by the time my own kids grow up.”Camille Cooper, Vice President of Public Policy for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) said: “Millions of images depicting the abuse of children are distributed across the internet every week. These are not images of simple nudity. According to Interpol, 84% of these images depict actual sexual abuse. 47% of these images depict sadistic abuse including bondage and torture. Children are seen in these images crying for daddy to stop, some of them are kept in dog cages. Most of these children are under the age of 12. Many of these children are infants and toddlers. Infants and toddlers…Technology companies allow these images to be distributed over and over and over again across their networks. Why? Because they have absolutely zero incentive to stop it.”Tina Frundt, Founder and Executive Director of Courtney’s House said: “It shouldn’t be ever put on a child to request that their videos and photos be taken off. Someone who is traumatized and cannot follow up on it…on Reddit right now…you can see children right now from a man who bought sex…putting their age, putting how much they bought for them, and where they live in the city. Imagine going to school and seeing these people and they’re confronting you and asking your price in person that they saw online. See, that’s what’s really going on and the tech world isn’t understanding the reality of what people see online. They see that in public, and they’re approaching these children not as children, but as people they want to buy sex from that’s online using those platforms. We cannot ignore that anymore. And this bill will not allow that to ignore any more.”Dawn Hawkins, CEO of the National Center of Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) said: “In August, in a case that NCOSE is involved with against Twitter for hosting CSAM, a judge ruled…that CDA 230 gives the company immunity. CSAM victims who made similar claims against Kik, Reddit, Omegle have had their cases dismissed on similar 230 grounds. Congress must clarify its intent. We need the EARN IT Act so survivors of these horrific crimes know where they stand and the courts have a clear understanding of Congressional intent, mainly that section 230 does not immunize knowing possession and distribution of CSAM.”Kathy Hatem, Director of Communications for Enough Is Enough said: “There needs to be a paradigm shift regarding Big Tech’s response to child online sexual exploitation. The EARN IT Act dismantles Big Tech’s unearned immunity for CSAM one bite at a time. Immunity must be earned through accountability. We urge all members of the Senate and the House to stand shoulder to shoulder and support the EARN IT Act for the sake of the children.”A coalition of 258 organizations representing survivors of child exploitation and sex trafficking from all 50 states and the District of Columbia also published a letter of support calling on Congress to pass the EARN IT Act. The full text of the letter is available here.The EARN IT Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Dianne Feinstein (D-California), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bob Casey (D-Pennsylvania), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada).U.S. Representatives Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) and Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/icymi-survivors-law-enforcement-leaders-and-child-safety-advocates-praise-committee-approval-of-earn-it-act2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"
https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=F548ECF5-DB43-43EE-849C-65A3AE7428E8,"WASHINGTON – Two major pieces of legislation pushed by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) moved forward today. One bill, which is now on the way to President Biden for his signature into law, gives victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment the chance to have their claims heard in court. It was unanimously passed by the United States Senate. The other will hold Big Tech companies accountable for the numerous cases of online child sexual exploitation which take place on their platforms. It unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee today. Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment ActThe Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, sponsored by Senator Graham and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) prevents perpetrators from being able to push survivors of sexual harassment and sexual assault into the secretive, and often biased process of forced arbitration.The legislation would invalidate existing forced arbitration clauses that prevent sexual assault and sexual harassment survivors from seeking justice and public accountability under the laws meant to protect them.Graham first introduced the bill in 2017 and reintroduced it last year alongside Senator Gillibrand. The legislation has now overwhelmingly passed Congress and will be sent to President Biden for signature into law.“I’m very pleased the Senate has now joined the House of Representatives in passing this important legislation and sending it to President Biden’s desk to sign into law,” said Senator Graham. “The days of sexual harassment and sexual assault cases being buried in unfair arbitration clauses are now over.  For far too long, many employment contracts required employees to submit to unfair arbitration procedures instead of allowing them the option of pursuing their day in court.  These types of agreements had the chilling effect of shielding misconduct from public scrutiny. Today, working side-by-side with my colleague Senator Gillibrand, who has been a tireless advocate for this important legislation, these types of unfair agreements come to an end.” Watch Full Forced Arbitration Press Conference Here EARN IT ActThe Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT Act) removes blanket immunity for violations of laws related to online child sexual abuse material (CSAM).The legislation unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee today and has wide bipartisan support in Congress. It also has the backing of more than 250 groups, survivors and stakeholders, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), Rights4Girls, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, National District Attorneys Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, International Justice Mission, and Major Cities Chiefs Association. The legislation:“There are tens of millions of photos and videos circulating throughout the internet, showing the most heinous acts of sexual abuse and torture of children,” said Senator Graham. “The EARN IT Act removes Section 230 blanket liability protection from service providers in the area of child sexual abuse material on their sites. To all the victim groups and law enforcement entities urging Congress to do something about the scourge of child sexual abuse material and the exploitation of children on the internet: we hear you. The days of children being exploited on the internet and their families being unable to do anything about it are coming to an end.  I am very pleased the committee passed this legislation and look forward to taking it up on the floor of the U.S. Senate.”Watch Full EARN IT Act Press Conference Here#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/one-down-one-to-go2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

Buck’s leadership style was always forward-looking, and South Carolina benefitted from his dedicated service. A successful businessman and great friend, Buck was a guy who could bring people together for the common good. “I know these are difficult days for his wonderful family. I hope they take comfort in knowing that Buck made a real difference and is now in a better place. My prayers remain with his entire family. We mourn the loss but also celebrate a life well-lived.”#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/graham-on-the-passing-of-buck-limehouse2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

I applaud the efforts of those involved who killed a vicious terrorist who threatened our nation and the world at large. “This operation again shows why forward-deployed American forces, working with allies and partners on the ground, must continue to exist in troubled regions. It is imperative we hit them before they hit us. “Unfortunately, the Biden Administration is deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to the growing radical Islamic threats emerging from Afghanistan and how a completely porous and unsecured southern border presents an opportunity for terrorism to make its way back to the United States. “While President Biden deserves credit for approving this counterterrorism raid in Syria, our southern border and the debacle in Afghanistan remain unaddressed and present credible national security threats to our nation.“President Biden has never been to the southern border, and it is past time he go. He should see the disaster he has created with his own eyes. “I fear that if we do not adjust our policies soon regarding Afghanistan and the southern border, a major terrorist threat is in the making. I will continue to speak out and work to address these matters.”  #####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/graham-on-u-s-raid-in-syria-national-security-threats2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"
https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=A610F593-90E6-402D-AB62-3E4B447E718A,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) today reintroduced bipartisan legislation to encourage the tech industry to take online child sexual exploitation seriously.The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT Act) removes blanket immunity for violations of laws related to online child sexual abuse material (CSAM).“There are tens of millions of photos and videos circulating throughout the internet, showing the most heinous acts of sexual abuse and torture of children,” said Senator Graham. “The EARN IT Act removes Section 230 blanket liability protection from service providers in the area of child sexual abuse material on their sites. To all the victim groups and law enforcement entities urging Congress to do something about the scourge of child sexual abuse material and the exploitation of children on the internet: we hear you. The days of children being exploited on the internet and their families being unable to do anything about it are coming to an end.”“The EARN IT Act is very simply about whether tech companies should be held responsible for their complicity in the sexual abuse and exploitation of children when they refuse to report or remove images of these crimes hosted on their platforms,” said Senator Blumenthal. “The modern internet is infested with stomach-churning images of children who have been brutally assaulted and exploited, and who are haunted by a lifetime of pain after these photographs and videos are circulated online. Tech companies have long had ready access to low-cost, or even free tools to combat the scourge of child sexual abuse material but have failed to act. Millions of these horrifying images go unidentified and unreported by the tech platforms that host them because there are so few consequences when these companies look the other way. That ends with the EARN IT Act.”Highlights of the EARN IT Act:Background on the EARN IT Act:The EARN IT Act is supported by more than 240 groups, survivors and stakeholders, including the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), Rights4Girls, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, National District Attorneys Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, International Justice Mission, and Major Cities Chiefs Association.The legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Dianne Feinstein (D-California), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bob Casey (D-Pennsylvania), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), and Mark Warner (D-Virginia).Representatives Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) and Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“There’s no reason Big Tech should be given special immunity from laws against child pornography,” said Senator Hawley. “This commonsense bill was approved unanimously in committee last Congress. Big Tech needs to be held responsible for their role in distributing child pornography.”“The exploitation of children online is beyond abhorrent, and tech companies must step up to combat the prevalent and growing problem of online child abuse,” said Senator Durbin. “The EARN IT Act - targeted, bipartisan legislation that addresses this urgent challenge - was voted unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee last Congress. I am pleased to support this bill again and will work to secure its swift passage.”“Online child sexual exploitation is an egregious and sickening crime. Unfortunately, the use of online platforms has increased the spread of child sexual abuse materials, with children across the U.S., including in Alaska, being groomed, enticed, exploited, trafficked, and abused through online platforms many Americans use every day. And, despite clear and demonstrated ramifications, online child sexual exploitation has not received a consistent and forceful response from the tech industry,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m glad to join in introducing legislation which will help put law enforcement, tech, and survivors at the same table to determine best methods for addressing online child sexual exploitation.”“Protecting our kids from sexual predators is something we can all agree on, and it’s long past time tech companies took the scourge of online child sexual exploitation seriously,” said Senator Ernst. “I’m proud to support this bipartisan effort that will help modernize our internet laws to combat the proliferation of child sexual abuse material online and encourage the tech industry to protect children from sexual exploitation on their platforms.”“Companies can’t simply ignore child exploitation on their online platforms,” said Senator Feinstein. “Companies that fail to take the necessary steps to prevent child exploitation shouldn’t be protected from lawsuits. I hope the Senate is able to act promptly to solve this growing problem.”“The online exploitation of children remains a serious and growing problem that must be addressed by Congress and Big Tech cooperatively. The EARN IT Act would set this serious effort in motion. The protection of children from predators, pornographers, and worse demands that we act,” said Senator Hyde-Smith.“We need to empower law enforcement with the resources they need to crack down on the trafficking and sexual abuse of children,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “As big technology companies evolve, we must make sure to protect our kids, who are too often left vulnerable to exploitation online. I will continue to work across the aisle to pass this legislation and keep children safe.”“No company should ever profit from the exploitation of a child, nor avoid legal responsibility in a court of law,” said Senator Portman. “That is why I am pleased to co-sponsor this important legislation to remove tech companies’ blanket immunity afforded by Section 230 from Federal and State child sexual abuse material laws. This legislation ensures that online platforms will now be treated like everyone else in our efforts to combat child sexual exploitation online.”“I’m proud to join my colleagues on this important piece of legislation that would protect children from exploitation and make needed reforms to Section 230,” said Senator Warner.“Far too many children across the nation are at risk of exploitation online. In order to strengthen safeguards, we must ensure that our laws keep up with constantly evolving technology,” said Senator Collins. “I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that would spur tech companies to step up their efforts to protect children. ”“Technology companies have a responsibility to crack down on child sexual abuse material on their platforms, and we must hold the predators who engage in these horrific crimes accountable,” said Senator Hassan. “This bipartisan bill will pressure tech companies to work to protect children and address these crimes with the seriousness and urgency that they deserve.”#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/graham-blumenthal-introduce-earn-it-act-to-encourage-tech-industry-to-take-online-child-sexual-exploitation-seriously2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"

However, this hearing and the answers provided are further examples of the Biden Administration being deaf, dumb and blind to the national security threats we face. Whether it is the collapse of Afghanistan where the Taliban now reign or a completely broken southern border that could be easily penetrated by international terrorists, the Biden Administration is failing. “It is unacceptable that the National Security Division of the Department of Justice did not know the number of border crossings – which is in the thousands – from special interest countries designated as such because of their ties to terrorism. In addition, dozens of individuals have been apprehended at the southern border who are on terrorist watch lists. Only God knows how many have come across undetected.“It is imperative that the Biden Administration quickly up its game when it comes to the lethal combination of rising radical Islamic terrorism spawned by the debacle in Afghanistan and a completely unsecured southern border. In my view, it is only a matter of time before international terrorists are able to strike our homeland by penetrating a completely porous southern border.“I would urge the National Security Division of the Department of Justice to go to the border, coordinate closely with the DHS officials in charge of securing our border, and change the dynamic on the ground before it is too late.”Watch Graham’s Full Remarks#####Share This: https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/graham-responds-to-shocking-admission-by-doj-national-security-leadership2 West Washington Street, Suite 808Greenville, SC 29601 Main: (864) 250-1417Fax: (864) 250-43222142 Boyce Street, Suite 404Columbia, SC 29201(803) 933-0112 office(803) 933-0957 fax4 Carriage Lane, Suite 401Charleston, SC 29407Main: (843) 849-3887Fax: (843) 971-3669"
