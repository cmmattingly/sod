For decades, Medicare reimbursement has not been sufficient to cover the cost of the care provided. The compounded impact of this disparity has created financial pressures that are unsustainable. Our hospitals have survived as a result of reserves, cost-cutting measures, staff reductions, and the elimination of services, but these options have been exhausted. If nothing changes, more hospitals across our states will be forced to make difficult decisions about the services and jobs they provide, and with some potentially even closing.” In addition to Shelby and Blackburn, the bipartisan letter was signed by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Shelley Moore Capito (R. W.Va.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Bill Hagerty (R. Tenn.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Rafael Warnock (D-Ga.). The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure, On behalf of the hospitals we represent and the patients they care for, we would like to commend you for taking steps to reduce the disparity in Medicare reimbursement created by the Medicare hospital area wage index (AWI) by proposing to continue the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy in the FY2023 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) proposed rule.  The continuation of this critical policy will allow our hospitals, many of which are in rural and underserved areas, to recruit and retain desperately needed healthcare staff. By continuing this policy for another year, you are putting patients first.   As you know, Congress gave broad discretion to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a hospital reimbursement system that accounted for geographic differences in wages. The Secretary is required to adjust the “proportion” of Medicare hospital inpatient payment attributable to “wages and wage-related costs” for “area differences in hospital wage levels.”  HHS has consistently taken a broad view of its statutory authority when adjusting the AWI through notice and comment rulemaking to address concerns of hospitals in certain states, including the creation of the imputed rural floor in order to benefit hospitals in states without statewide rural areas.  This administrative policy was in effect for almost a decade before being codified in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.  The Low Wage Index Hospital Policy, which provides relief to hospitals in the bottom quartile of AWI levels, is consistent with these prior agency policy changes.        In our states, the flawed AWI methodology has continued to negatively impact Medicare reimbursement. For decades, Medicare reimbursement has not been sufficient to cover the cost of the care provided. The compounded impact of this disparity has created financial pressures that are unsustainable. Our hospitals have survived as a result of reserves, cost-cutting measures, staff reductions, and the elimination of services, but these options have been exhausted. If nothing changes, more hospitals across our states will be forced to make difficult decisions about the services and jobs they provide, and with some potentially even closing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognized the importance of the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy and the need to ensure that every American has equal access to care and is not to be disadvantaged for living in a majority rural state. CMS noted when it implemented this policy that “rural areas have experienced more than 100 hospital closures since 2010 and continue to face limited access to specialty care,” stressing that this policy adjustment would “help low-wage hospitals attract and maintain a highly-skilled workforce, which will strengthen competition and lead to greater choice for patients in rural areas.”   Discontinuing the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy will ultimately lead to more closures, reducing access to care for the most vulnerable patients. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic created a skewed labor market that will only further disrupt the AWI. In fact, we have not had the opportunity to see the true impact of the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy envisioned by CMS because of disruptions to the marketplace caused by the pandemic. Continuing the policy in FY2023, and extending it for years beyond that will allow hospitals and the agency to understand the true impact in a somewhat more normal environment.   We understand that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia recently ruled that CMS exceeded its statutory authority when it finalized the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy in the FY2020 IPPS final rule.  We adamantly disagree with this decision and encourage the agency to appeal and finalize its proposal to continue the policy in FY2023. There is clear evidence that CMS has the authority to implement the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy. If this policy were to end, the adverse impact on health care access would be dire and deal a tremendous blow to health care. We look forward to working with you to ensure that hospitals are no longer penalized for being located in rural areas and patients have access to health care no matter where they are located. ###  Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/senators-encourage-cms-to-appeal-district-court-ruling-continue-low-wage-index-hospital-policy"

https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=8904248C-D9C6-4380-A7C1-04774A8102E1,"WASHINGTON, DC – Led by U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), all nine members of the United States congressional delegation from Alabama on Monday evening sent a letter to Cynthia Brown, Chief of the Section of Administration at the Surface Transportation Board, discouraging a decision that would mandate Amtrak service along the Gulf Coast without a needed feasibility study, which would measure potential consequences for the national rail network and supply chain. The letter also cites a number of infrastructure improvements that would be necessary to mitigate the effects of passenger rail service on the Port of Mobile’s operations and related freight rail traffic. The letter reads in part, “As proposals to initiate passenger rail service in the Gulf Coast have been discussed, multiple entities have understandably expressed concern about the impact such service would have on commerce in and around Mobile, including federal and state government officials, freight operators, the Alabama State Port Authority, and several of the Port of Mobile’s customers. In response to these concerns, Amtrak, in conjunction with CSX and Norfolk Southern, agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study to determine the impact passenger rail service would have on freight operation in Mobile. … Despite this agreement among all parties, Amtrak announced plans to begin passenger rail service without completing the ongoing study.” The members continued, “As a delegation, we are particularly concerned about the effects of Gulf Coast passenger rail service on the Port of Mobile, which in recent years has experienced tremendous growth. … In sum, a decision by the Board to mandate Amtrak service in this case will have significant consequences for the national rail network and supply chain, as well as set a precedent for expansion of Amtrak service. We urge you to uphold the Board’s long-standing commitment to an efficient and reliable rail network.” The congressional delegation letter was signed by U.S. Senators Richard Shelby and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), along with U.S. Representatives Robert Aderholt (R-Ala), Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), Gary Palmer (R-Ala.), Jerry Carl (R-Ala.), and Barry Moore (R-Ala.). The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Ms. Brown: We, members of the Alabama congressional delegation, write in regard to matters under consideration in Docket No. FD 36496, Application of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation Under 49 U.S.C. § 24308(e)—CSX Transportation, Inc., and Norfolk Southern Railway Company. For the first time, the Surface Transportation Board (the Board) is holding a hearing under the authority granted to it by Congress, codified at 49 U.S.C. § 24308, which allows the Board to order a rail carrier to provide for the operation of additional Amtrak trains.  To underscore the significance of what the Board will be deciding, if the agency were to mandate Amtrak service in this case, it would be the first time doing so since Amtrak’s inception in 1971, outside of an emergency situation or an explicit directive from Congress. As proposals to initiate passenger rail service in the Gulf Coast have been discussed, multiple entities have understandably expressed concern about the impact such service would have on commerce in and around Mobile, including federal and state government officials, freight operators, the Alabama State Port Authority, and several of the Port of Mobile’s customers. In response to these concerns, Amtrak, in conjunction with CSX and Norfolk Southern, agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study to determine the impact passenger rail service would have on freight operation in Mobile. Although Mississippi and Louisiana dedicated state funding for the project, Alabama’s commitment of funds was specifically contingent on the completion of the study. Despite this agreement among all parties, Amtrak announced plans to begin passenger rail service without completing the ongoing study. In March and April 2021, members of the Alabama congressional delegation wrote to request that the Board require the completion of the feasibility study. As we stated then, any decision to initiate passenger rail service should be guided by the best available data and information. Although the previously agreed to study was not completed, CSX and Norfolk Southern have submitted into the record a Rail Traffic Controller (RTC) model and report that confirms the reasonableness of our concerns. Notably, it demonstrates that the introduction of passenger trains would cause a 20 percent increase in delay, as well as cause delays in future years without additional freight capacity. The need for a feasibility study is further underscored by the potential precedential value of this case. Amtrak has publicly released its “Corridor Vision,” which seeks to add 39 new passenger rail routes across the country. At the same time, the Board considers this case during the strain of supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks, which have affected consumers, through longer wait times, scarcity of products, and increased costs. This national crisis materialized in large part due to unprecedented consumer demand and workforce shortages associated with the pandemic. During these disruptions, our freight railroads and ports have doubled their efforts to deliver essential goods and supplies. Without a feasibility study, the Board would be deciding this case without knowing the full consequences of its decision on freight rail or ports. Moreover, it would provide Amtrak the ability to initiate many more passenger rail routes throughout the country without understanding the impact on the fluidity of our nation’s freight and intermodal rail network. As a delegation, we are particularly concerned about the effects of Gulf Coast passenger rail service on the Port of Mobile, which in recent years has experienced tremendous growth. Since 2015, the Port of Mobile’s container volume has grown by 120 percent, making it one of the fastest growing container ports in the United States. This critical gateway has successfully managed permanent supply chain shifts into the Port of Mobile to keep up with shipper and consumer demand. At a time when the United States is experiencing significant supply chain challenges, potential delays or congestion created in the Port of Mobile threaten to worsen existing supply chain issues across the country. The continued growth and success of the Port of Mobile will serve an important role in economic development and investments along the Gulf Coast. Thus, if the Board decides to order Amtrak service, it should require Amtrak to pay for and make the necessary operational and infrastructure investments needed to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate passenger, freight, and intermodal rail service, as well as facilitate uninterrupted service into and out of the Port of Mobile. To mitigate the effects of Amtrak service on the Port of Mobile’s operations and related freight rail traffic, the following operational and capital mitigation measures are critically important:  In contrast, a passenger station in downtown Mobile is unworkable because Amtrak’s operations would be in a mainline corridor, thereby blocking freight trains from crossing between the Interchange Yard and Riverfront Yard and impairing access to McDuffie Island.  Additionally, a station in downtown Mobile will block access to the Intermodal Container Transfer Facility located at the container complex, noted as one of the fastest growing container ports in North America.  Amtrak should incur the costs of the passenger station at the Brookley Aeroplex and pay for corresponding infrastructure investments that are needed to facilitate the continued operation of freight traffic.    We believe that Amtrak has access to sufficient funding to provide for these necessary infrastructure improvements. The recently-passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58) provided historic funding of $66 billion in direct appropriations for rail programs.  Over the next five years, this law specifically provides $22 billion in direct funding to Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor and National Network, $36 billion for the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grants, $5 billion for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program, and $3 billion for the Railroad Crossing Elimination Program. If the Board mandates service, it should ensure that this unprecedented level of funding is used by Amtrak to pay for the necessary infrastructure improvements to support its proposed service and that shippers and entities who rely on the freight and intermodal rail network are made whole. Our ports and shippers should not have to bear the cost of facilitating Amtrak’s passenger rail service expansion, and the Board should ensure any decision sets a precedent of safeguarding our country’s shippers and ports. In sum, a decision by the Board to mandate Amtrak service in this case will have significant consequences for the national rail network and supply chain, as well as set a precedent for expansion of Amtrak service.  We urge you to uphold the Board’s long-standing commitment to an efficient and reliable rail network.  Thank you for your diligent consideration of this matter. ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/alabama-delegation-urges-stb-caution-on-amtrak-gulf-coast-decision"

Resolution 29, Senator Mike Braun’s (R-Ind.) Congressional Review Act (CRA), to overturn President Biden’s vaccine mandate, which passed the Senate by a vote of 52-48. “As I’ve said before, President Biden’s vaccine mandate violates our constitutional liberties and is federal overreach at its finest. Today I was proud to vote for Senator Braun’s CRA to overturn that mandate. While I urge people to consult with their doctor about getting vaccinated, I believe our individual freedoms and rights are of the utmost importance,” stated Senator Shelby. The CRA would provide fast-track procedures for Congress to consider a joint resolution to overturn an agency’s rule. In this case, S.J. Resolution 29 would repeal the Occupational Safety and Health Administration emergency temporary standard mandating that private sector employers with 100 or more employees receive a vaccine for COVID-19 or implement weekly testing of unvaccinated workers. ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/shelby-statement-on-congressional-review-act-vote-to-overturn-biden-s-vaccine-mandate"

I am proud to join many of my conservative colleagues in the fight to keep this deeply-flawed proposal from becoming law.”  “The Democrats’ plan to allow the IRS to spy on the bank accounts of nearly every person in this country, even those below the poverty line, should be deeply concerning to anyone who values privacy and economic inclusion,” said Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.). “Of the more than 7 million American households that are currently unbanked, the majority are low-income, rural, and minority Americans. Implementing the Biden reporting scheme will disproportionately harm those who need greater access to our financial institutions and people living paycheck to paycheck. My colleagues and I will not stop fighting the Democrats’ wrong-headed proposal to implement more federal government intrusion into our lives.”  “Every American should be wary of giving the IRS more power and more tentacles into private financial transactions,” said Senator Crapo (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. “The IRS bank reporting proposal is one of the biggest expansions of the agency’s authority we’ve ever seen, and is fundamentally flawed. I’m proud to support Senator Scott’s legislation to stop this proposal in its tracks and protect Americans’ personal, private financial information.”   “The Biden administration’s plan to allow the IRS to monitor Americans' bank accounts is a dangerous idea that will only prove to be worse over time,” said Senator Toomey (R-Penn.), ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. “Today the administration wants to know your annual account inflows and outflows. What will they demand access to tomorrow? I’m glad to join Senator Scott and Senator Crapo in working to ensure this terribly flawed proposal never sees the light of day.”  In addition to Senators Shelby, Scott, Crapo, and Toomey, the bill is co-sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), and Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).

A total of $25 billion — nearly half of the funding provided by this amendment — would support critical shipbuilding infrastructure. This includes $21 billion for the Navy’s public shipyards, $4 billion for private construction and repair yards, and $350 million for Coast Guard shipyard. These facilities are in Virginia, Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Washington, Hawaii, Connecticut, Mississippi and Alabama. This is nearly identical to the SHIPYARD Act, which has bipartisan support, including more than 10 Democrat cosponsors. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday called shipyard modernization a “once-in-a-century investment.” Among other things, this spending would drastically improve the ability of America’s shipyards to get the most out of our existing fleet and reduce stress on our sailors. Test Ranges - $4 billionOne reason the U.S. military is able to stay ahead of our competitors is because of investments in innovative research, development, testing and evaluation that have maintained our technological advantage for decades. But now, as competitors like China seek to catch up and invest heavily in their own technologies, we risk falling behind — and in some cases we already have. By modernizing our test facilities and ranges, we will be ready for the next-generation of equipment and munitions that will deter any enemy. The amendment supports modernization priorities at all test and training ranges, including the following:-       Redstone (Ala.)-       Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex (Alaska)-       Ft. Huachuca (Ariz.)-       Yuma Proving Ground (Ariz.)-       Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu (Calif.)-       Eglin (Fla.)-       Pacific Missile Range Facility (Hawaii)-       Aberdeen Test Center (Md.)-       Naval Air Warfare Center, Pax River (Md.)-       Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport (R.I.)-       Nevada Test and Training Range (Nev.)-       White Sands Missile Range (N.M.)-       Dugway Proving Ground (Utah) Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (FSRM) - $4 billionOur military’s facilities maintenance deficit is nearly $135 billion, and growing each year. More than any other area of the defense budget, FSRM has suffered mightily in the sequestration era. The funding in this amendment would address the most critical maintenance and repairs needed at Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense-wide facilities in every state of the U.S. and abroad, from simple HVAC repairs to addressing structural failings in buildings.  Depot Modernization - $4.5 billionOur nation’s military depots are responsible for the manufacture, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of military weapons and equipment — yet most of these facilities date back to World War II. At risk is not only the military’s ability to meet the demands of current missions, but also its capacity to surge and confront any future threat. This funding supports much-needed modernization at all depots, including the following:-       Anniston Army Depot (Ala.)-       Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 309 AMARG (Ari.)-       Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (Ga.)-       Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (Okla.)-       Tobyhanna and Letterkenny Army Depots (Pennsylvania)-       Corpus Christi and Red River Army Depots (Texas)-       Ogden Air Logistics Complex (Utah)-       Navy North Island (Calif.)-       Navy Norfolk (Va.) Army Ammunition Plants - $2.5 billionAlthough the Army is investing heavily in ammunition, the nation’s Army ammunition plants, most of which were built in the 1940s, are struggling to keep up with demand. The Army still needs $14-16 billion to fully modernize these plants and make them safer, more capable, and more sustainable, Army officials told Congress late last year. This funding supports modernization efforts at all of the nation’s Army ammunition plants, including:-       Iowa (Iowa)-       Lake City (Mo.)-       Scranton (Pa.)-       Holston (Tenn.)-       Radford (Va.) DOE/NNSA Facilities and Maintenance - $3.850 billionThe National Nuclear Security Administration’s facilities, which support our nuclear deterrent, are crumbling and are unable to meet future needs of our nuclear security enterprise. This funding would support the key NNSA facilities that enable the U.S. to support its nuclear requirements, as well as create good-paying jobs immediately. These priorities include:-       $1.4 billion for the NNSA’s nationwide deferred maintenance backlog;-       $500 million to modernize NNSA’s aging and deteriorating mission-enabling infrastructure that supports R&D and manufacturing capabilities in New Mexico, Nevada, South Carolina and Tennessee, and Texas;-       $400 million for the safe demolition of contaminated equipment at the MOX facility in South Carolina, which will allow for the new construction of pit production lines necessary for America’s nuclear security;-       $250 million to construct mission-enabling facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to support additional pit production;-       $600 million to construct facilities and infrastructure at a training facility for workforces that will support both Los Alamos in New Mexico and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina;-       $500 million to safely remove and dispose of equipment in PF-4 in New Mexico to allow for new construction of pit production lines; and-       $200 million for NNSA’s lithium and tritium facilities. High-priority Military Construction Projects - $2 billionLike FSRM, military construction was deprioritized in the sequestration as Department of Defense leadership tried to manage the strategy-resources mismatch. The military has a long list of deferred military construction projects both at home and abroad that could be executed efficiently and effectively over the next several years — from new training ranges and munitions storage igloos to improved barracks and modernized family housing.  5G Rollout - $2.5 billionThis funding would support the rollout of secure 5G infrastructure to military bases across the country. 5G technologies are critical to the interconnection of the joint force and provide our warfighters with access to more advanced technologies, real-time data and greater efficiency on the battlefield. Without additional bandwidth, technologies like advanced command-and-control systems and artificial intelligence (AI) applications for maintenance will struggle. PFAS Remediation - $1.5 billionAddressing the environmental and health impacts of the previous use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by the military has long been a bipartisan priority. This funding would accelerate the cleanup of sites across the country contaminated by PFAS. Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/8/shelby-inhofe-wicker-offer-budget-amendment-to-modernize-aging-defense-infrastructure"
https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=C8B9C7C1-B9FE-4FBE-9B6B-32A1F997CDAF,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and its subcommittee on defense, was joined by Senate Armed Services Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Ranking Member Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today in highlighting their concerns with the lack of resources for military infrastructure in H.R.3684, the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” which includes hundreds of billions of dollars to address critical infrastructure needs throughout the nation.  The senators last week filed Amendment 2535 to include defense infrastructure funding in the comprehensive bill, but members were not given the opportunity to vote on the proposal. “It is shameful that this massive infrastructure legislation contains not one dime for our military’s vast infrastructure needs.  Not only that, Senate Democrats blocked every attempt to fix this glaring omission.  This comes on the heels of legislation they claim will combat Chinese aggression but also includes nothing for our military.  And now the Democrats are turning to a $3.5 trillion budget that will finance their liberal wish list but drastically shortchange our military once again.  “There is a clear and dangerous pattern here.  The recklessness of the Democrats’ domestic spending spree is matched only by their neglect for America’s military.  It must stop.  For America to remain strong and prosperous, we must balance funding for the domestic and defense priorities of this nation,” stated Vice Chairman Shelby. “A rushed bill outside of the legislative process is always going to be flawed, and this was no exception.  It added too much that wasn’t real infrastructure – and left out genuine, needed military infrastructure across every state in this nation.  Our amendment sought to right that imbalance, but Majority Leader Schumer was too worried it might pass, so he wouldn’t allow it to come for a vote.  Between President Biden’s woefully inadequate budget request that we had to fix on a bipartisan basis in the NDAA and Senate Democrats’ new $3.5 trillion budget boondoggle that completely ignores national defense, it’s clear Democrats have no interest in addressing the very real threats coming from China and other adversaries, and protecting American families.  We are going to continue to try to fix Democrats’ dangerous mistake,” said Ranking Member Inhofe. “I am disappointed that we could not come to an agreement to provide resources for our national security infrastructure in this bipartisan infrastructure package,” Ranking Member Wicker said.  “This bill will help improve our country’s road, bridges, ports, and broadband, but will do nothing for our national defense.  Our defense infrastructure has been crumbling for years, and once again Congress has failed to act.  I will continue to fight alongside my colleagues to ensure the needs of our military are not ignored.” The senators’ amendment would have created a Defense Infrastructure Fund containing $50.2 billion, including the following: $25.35 billion for shipyards; $4 billion for test and training ranges; $2 billion for high priority military construction projects; $1.5 billion for PFAS remediation; $4 billion for Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization; $3.85 billion for Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration infrastructure; $4.5 billion for military depots; $2.5 billion for ammunition plants; and $2.5 billion for 5G rollout to military bases. ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/8/shelby-inhofe-wicker-defense-infrastructure-needs-ignored-in-massive-infrastructure-bill"

Nahom, Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs for the Air Force. Senator Shelby’s remarks, as prepared, are as follows: “Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Vice Admiral Crites, Vice Admiral Kilby, Lieutenant General Nahom, welcome and thank you for being here. “I look forward to hearing about the Navy and Air Force plans for divestment of weapon systems in fiscal year 2022 and how those plans better position our forces to deter and, if necessary, win in a near peer fight.  “The proposal for divestments this year totals $1.37 billion for the Air Force and $1.26 billion for the Navy.  “The Department’s stated purpose for the divestments is to retire vulnerable systems and programs that no longer meet security needs, freeing resources to invest in higher priority items. “While this seems like a straight forward framework for divestment decision making, I would like to better understand how the budget topline impacted these decisions.  “Of the Navy’s $1.26 billion fiscal year 2022 divestment recommendation, $930 million is from divestment of ships. These include cruisers, littoral combat ships, riverine craft, and dock landing ships. “Given the Navy’s stated priority of increasing fleet size to compete in the Indo- Pacific, I would expect to see those savings used to increase shipbuilding and ship operations. “However, the fiscal year 2022 budget request only includes a $300 million increase in ship operations that is accompanied by a $700 million decrease in shipbuilding. “The Air Force is divesting fighters, tankers, logistics aircraft, command and control, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms. I think we can all agree that some of these aircraft have been in service longer than originally envisioned and many would be at significant risk operating in an anti-access and area denial environment. “That said, I want to understand how the loss of these aircraft will be fully mitigated by the introduction of new aircraft or by increasing the pace of procurement of aircraft currently in production. “I appreciate the complexity of the decisions the Department has to make to balance near term capabilities with future technologies and maintaining readiness across the force structure. “And, I believe it is important that we have a better understanding how that is being accomplished with this proposal. “Additionally, I would like to know what the plan is for the items that are divested. “A very conservative estimate of the initial investment in the procurement of the items the Air Force and Navy would like to divest is $14 billion. “This is a significant investment that we must be thoughtful about at the end of life. “I raise this issue because this proposal includes divestments of naval vessels that entered service less than five years ago with a price tag around $520 million each. “It also includes unmanned ISR platforms that we just finished procuring. “It is important that we understand what consideration the Services have made for other uses of the equipment or other ways to gain back some of the investment that has been made in the equipment. “Finally, understanding how the Services are filling the operational gaps that will be left upon divestment of this equipment is key to this conversation today. “For example, the cruisers that the Navy wants to divest have a Vertical Launch System that can carry up to 122 missiles each. “I recognize that the cost to maintain and operate the aging fleet of Arleigh Burke-class cruisers is driving some of the divestment decisions, but I would like to understand how the Navy plans to fill the missile gap and what consideration has been given to the cost of any new platforms that will fill that gap. “This is an important conversation, and I look forward to getting the answers to these questions today.  Thank you.” ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/7/shelby-highlights-importance-of-military-readiness-amid-administration-s-effort-to-cut-defense-spending"

Harker, Admiral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, and General David H. Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps. Senator Shelby’s remarks, as prepared, are as follows: “Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Secretary Harker, Admiral Gilday, and General Berger, welcome and thank you for being here.  I look forward to hearing about the Navy and Marine Corps budget proposal for fiscal year 2022. “This discussion is particularly important because the Navy’s budget proposal reflects a meager 1.8 percent increase from fiscal year 2021, while reducing end strength and procurement investments. “The reductions are proposed despite the need to maintain readiness and make progress on key modernization priorities like the Navy’s leg of the nuclear triad and the introduction of new weapon systems. “In addition to other deficiencies in the Navy’s budget proposal, this budget fails to include funding to support the multi-year procurement contract for the DDG-51, which reflects poorly on the Department’s view of its commitments to congress and its long-term shipbuilding plans. “It also calls into question the seriousness with which this Administration approaches defense-related funding decisions given that the DDG-51 appears as the Navy’s top priority on its unfunded requirements list. “You all are very well aware that our adversaries, including China and Russia, pose new and increasing threats.

for a procedure at the hospital; to purchase over-the-counter sinus medication and certain prescriptions; to open an account at the bank; to apply for a mortgage; to drive, buy, or rent a car; to get married; to purchase a gun; to rent a hotel room; to donate blood; to obtain a passport; and to pick up packages at the U.S. Post Office. “This legislation would permanently tip the scales in favor of Democrats by politicizing the Federal Election Commission, pouring federal tax dollars into campaigns, and chilling free speech. “Do Americans really want their taxes going toward a federal campaign fund that would finance the expenses of all candidates running for Congress? “S.1 would reverse the years of improvements that have been made in many states – improvements that protect the security, integrity, and credibility of our elections. “Each state should be left with the freedom and flexibility to administer their own respective elections, without interference from the federal government. “S.1 mandates ballot drop boxes – which increase the risk of fraud by allowing people other than the voter to drop off marked ballots outside of the view of election officials. “As I mentioned before, this bill provides government funding for campaigns.  It provides $6 of federal funding for every $1 raised from small donors.  This essentially forces Americans to fund candidates they don’t agree with and support attack ads against those they do. “It federalizes redistricting, putting in place one set of federal rules for redrawing congressional districts – something that has traditionally been a role for each state. “Lastly, S.1 requires states to give felons the right to vote once they’re out of prison. “While this is a bad bill all around, I believe that these are the top worst provisions – and the provisions the American people oppose the most: gutting state voter ID laws, spending taxpayer dollars on political campaigns, allowing unlimited ballot harvesting, and turning the Federal Election Commission into a partisan operation. “This bill is nothing but a partisan effort by the majority to take over all American elections at the federal level.  “The American people do not want this, and they do not deserve to be the recipients of such harmful policy. “I do not support this bill and more importantly, I am concerned for the future of our country should it receive the support of the Senate. “With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.” ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/6/shelby-opposes-liberal-one-size-fits-all-election-bill"

McConville, Army Chief of Staff, testified before the subcommittee. Senator Shelby’s remarks, as prepared, are as follows: “Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Secretary Wormuth, welcome to your first hearing before our subcommittee in your new role.  General McConville, thank you for being here. “I look forward to hearing about the Army’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2022. “This discussion is particularly important because the Army’s budget proposal reflects a two percent reduction from fiscal year 2021. “The reduction is proposed despite the need to maintain readiness and make progress on key modernization priorities like the long range hypersonic missile and improved lethality capabilities. “You are both very well aware that our adversaries, including China and Russia, pose new and increasing threats that erode our traditional technological and battlefield advantages. “They are making unprecedented investments in their capability and capacity, and China, specifically, has a stated objective of surpassing us by the middle of the Century.   “Given that the overall funding request for the Department of Defense does not keep pace with inflation and the Army budget proposal reflects a decrease from last year, I am concerned that we are sending the wrong message to both our allies and our adversaries. “I look forward to hearing how your fiscal year 2022 budget request fully meets the needs of the Army and maintains our advantage over our adversaries.  Thank you.” ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/6/shelby-reviews-army-budget-request-highlights-concerns-surrounding-decreased-funding"

Thank you for being here today. “The world is a complex and dangerous place and I know that you both understand the magnitude of the challenges we face from our near peer adversaries who seek to undermine the United States’ position as a world leader and dominant military power. “China and Russia are formidable adversaries and China, as you have acknowledged Secretary Austin, is proving to be a true pacing threat. “China seeks hegemony – militarily, technologically, economically, and geopolitically – and is making unprecedented investments to see that to fruition. “Meanwhile, Russia is nearing the end of a massive military modernization program that saw its defense spending increase 30 percent in real dollars over the last 10 years. “The National Defense Strategy provides a road map for what the Department of Defense needs – at a minimum – to meet the challenges posed by a re-emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. “Anything less jeopardizes readiness, the recapitalization of capital assets, and necessary investments in new and emerging technologies. “Yet, the budget we are discussing today does just that – proposing what is effectively a cut to defense spending for FY22. “That is not a plan I can get behind and it’s not a plan that sends the right message to our adversaries or to our men and women in uniform who are asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. “In years past, we have made the investments necessary to ensure that we have the best trained, best prepared, best equipped fighting force in the world. “But this year, the budget proposal signals to the world that this administration is not committed to investing in readiness, training, state of the art equipment, and technological overmatch. “With military investments in China and Russia continuing to outpace U.S. investments, I find it hard to believe that the requirements outlined by General Dunford just four years ago are no longer instructive. “If anything, I believe it has likely increased. “Competition with China requires whole of government investments.  “We saw the Senate make those investments on the non-defense side last week and we must ensure investments in our military are just as robust. “I look forward to hearing from each of you today about the budget proposal and, in particular, about how you plan to keep pace and to counter the threats from Russia and China while simultaneously cutting investments in defense, thank you.” ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/6/shelby-cutting-defense-spending-will-jeopardize-national-security"

Roth, Acting Air Force Secretary; General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., Air Force Chief of Staff; and General John W.

Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau; Lieutenant General Jody J. Daniels, Chief of the Army Reserve; Vice Admiral John B. Mustin, Chief of the Navy Reserve; Lieutenant General David G. Bellon, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve; and Lieutenant General Richard W. Scobee, Chief of the Air Force Reserve. Senator Shelby raised concerns regarding the “enduring costs” the National Guard has incurred as a result of its presence on Capitol Hill since the insurrection on January 6, 2021, to which General Hokanson noted the accumulation amounted to roughly $521 million.  Additionally, in light of the recent rise in cyber-attacks, Senator Shelby asked General Hokanson about the National Guard’s role in defending the homeland from cyber-attacks and whether or not it has the resources and personnel needed.  General Hokanson highlighted the increasing capabilities of the National Guard’s cyber units as it relates to addressing and mitigating these attacks. Vice Chairman Shelby’s opening remarks, as prepared, are as follows: “Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I want to welcome our witnesses.  Thank you for being here today and providing your testimony.  “Our National Guard and Reserves perform a vast and critical role in our national defense. “Their call to respond to natural disasters, homeland security threats, and overseas contingencies is constant.  “Their unwavering commitment has been particularly evident over the last year as thousands have been deployed at unprecedented rates to provide medical care and administer vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. “On behalf of my colleagues I want to thank those men and women who have stepped away from their civilian jobs to provide this essential support, and we thank each of you before us today for your continued leadership in those efforts.  “I would also like to thank those men and women currently deployed to assist state and local law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security to mitigate the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border.  “As near-peer competitors are modernizing and developing their military capabilities at alarming rates, we want to ensure your Departments receive the necessary resources to remain a ready and lethal force.  “I recognize that we will not receive the budget until May 27th and as a result our conversations about specific funding items may be limited.  “That said, I look forward to hearing from each of you about the on-going efforts to sufficiently recruit, train, and equip our Reserve forces, especially in light of setbacks due to the pandemic.  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for calling this hearing.” ###

Amtrak recently announced that the new service would begin irrespective of the unfinished data-driven study. Senator Shelby stated in the letter, “I believe that initiating new Gulf Coast passenger rail service should be guided by the best available data and information. As one of the largest growing seaports in the United States, the Port of Mobile serves as an essential economic driver for the state of Alabama and region. …  As such, prior to establishing passenger rail service in Mobile, I believe it is essential that a comprehensive analysis be completed that definitively determines the impact such service would have on existing freight rail service and the Port of Mobile. It is my hope that all parties involved can come to an amicable solution to ensure the study is completed.”  Senator Shelby also highlighted that the decision to forgo the planned study goes against a well-instituted process of completing a comprehensive analysis of the possible effects that new passenger rail service could have on existing freight operation – prior to beginning service. “The completion of a comprehensive study prior to initiating passenger rail service is not unique to the Gulf Coast line. It is my understanding that there is a well-established process recognized by Amtrak and the freight industries whenever passenger rail service is introduced on freight rail lines. Notably, that process has included the completion of a data-driven study identifying what additional infrastructure is necessary to prevent any potential impact on existing freight rail operation,” wrote Senator Shelby. As noted in the letter, the Alabama Port Authority’s annual economic value contributions total over 150,000 jobs and $25.4 billion. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Mr. Flynn, Mr. Foote, Mr. Squires, and Mr. Oberman: I write in regard to recent efforts to initiate new passenger rail service in the Gulf Coast. Prior to 2005, passenger rail service ran from Louisiana to Florida, with stops in Alabama and Mississippi. However, since Hurricane Katrina, Amtrak discontinued the service through Mobile.  In recent years, ongoing discussions have occurred about the possibility of new passenger rail service in the Gulf Coast through a line connecting New Orleans, Louisiana, to Mobile, Alabama, with stops in Mississippi. As proposals were presented, multiple entities – such as freight operators, the Alabama State Port Authority, several of the Port of Mobile’s customers, and local government officials – voiced concern about the potential effect that passenger rail service could have on economic growth and commerce in the region.   To alleviate such concerns, Amtrak, in cooperation with CSX and Norfolk Southern, agreed to conduct a study to determine how passenger rail service would affect freight operation in Mobile. The study and the supplemental engineering and cost analysis was scheduled to be completed prior to the start of any service. Additionally, although Mississippi and Louisiana dedicated state funding for the project, Alabama’s commitment of funds was contingent on the completion of the study.  The completion of a comprehensive study prior to initiating passenger rail service is not unique to the Gulf Coast line. It is my understanding that there is a well-established process recognized by Amtrak and the freight industries whenever passenger rail service is introduced on freight rail lines. Notably, that process has included the completion of a data-driven study identifying what additional infrastructure is necessary to prevent any potential impact on existing freight rail operation.  Last month, Amtrak announced that it planned to begin passenger rail service from New Orleans to Mobile starting in January 2022. Amtrak also announced that it had no plans to complete the ongoing study, which included the route’s impact on Mobile.  I believe that initiating new Gulf Coast passenger rail service should be guided by the best available data and information. As one of the largest growing seaports in the United States, the Port of Mobile serves as an essential economic driver for the state of Alabama and region. To date, the Alabama Port Authority’s annual economic value contributions total over 150,000 jobs and $25.4 billion. Since 2005, when passenger rail service was last active, the Port of Mobile has experienced significant growth that has led to increased economic development and investments in the area.   As such, prior to establishing passenger rail service in Mobile, I believe it is essential that a comprehensive analysis be completed that definitively determines the impact such service would have on existing freight rail service and the Port of Mobile.

https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=DCF150A9-AA84-4939-8C4E-287117D902E8,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today re-introduced legislation proposing a constitutional amendment that would require Congress to have a balanced budget in an effort to reduce our nation’s increasing debt, which has surpassed $28 trillion.  Having sponsored similar legislation each Congress since joining the Senate, this marks Senator Shelby’s eighteenth time to introduce the measure. “While our national debt continues to climb, it is more apparent now than ever that the federal government should be required to do what hardworking Americans do every day – balance a budget,” said Senator Shelby.  “I have long believed that our Constitution lacks proper constraint on government spending.  If we continue in this unsustainable direction, the burden will land on our children and our grandchildren.  That is why I am, once again, urging Congress to adopt this common-sense amendment that would improve our spending of taxpayer dollars, restore confidence in our economy, and help protect the well-being of our country for future generations.” If passed by Congress and subsequently ratified by three-fourths of the states, this Constitutional amendment would require that the total amount of money spent by the United States during any fiscal year, except during times of war, not exceed the amount of revenue received by the country during the same fiscal year, and not exceed 20 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States during the previous calendar year.  ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/shelby-proposes-balanced-budget-amendment"
https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=79D8CAD6-5339-46E9-AE66-E9EF38ACCEBA,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, today announced that the Consortium for Alabama Rural Water and Wastewater Management – led by the University of South Alabama (USA) in partnership with the University of Alabama, Auburn University, and the Alabama Department of Public Health – has been granted the Rural Water Consortium Award by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The $4.85 million grant will allow the Consortium to establish a technical assistance and training program and develop construction-ready plans for innovative rural wastewater treatment solutions in Alabama’s Black Belt region. “I am pleased that Alabama has been selected for this rural wastewater infrastructure grant.  This is excellent news for everyone involved.  I believe the project will serve an important role in strengthening wastewater treatment to improve the public health and economic development of rural communities in the Black Belt.  I look forward to working with the Consortium to ensure that innovative solutions are identified and a more resilient and sustainable wastewater infrastructure is constructed throughout the region,” said Senator Shelby. “The Consortium partners at USA, the University of Alabama, Auburn University, and the Alabama Department of Public Health have been working to find appropriate solutions to difficult wastewater issues in the rural Black Belt of Alabama.  This award will tremendously further this effort by allowing broader training, community outreach, and innovative wastewater solutions to rural areas that will improve public health, quality of life, and allow for needed economic development in these underserved communities,” said Dr. Kevin White, who leads the Consortium and is the chair of the Department of Civil, Coastal, and Environmental Engineering at the University of South Alabama. The USDA award, which is a Technical Assistance and Training for Innovative Regional Wastewater Treatment Solutions (TAT/RWTS) grant, aims to provide alternative wastewater treatment solutions for underserved, low-income communities and works to implement them in a manner that is achievable and sustainable.  At select pilot sites, the project will install and test new clustered and decentralized wastewater treatment systems, connecting neighboring infrastructure in a single system that will collect, treat, and reuse water – effectively reducing maintenance costs.  It will also provide a model for transitioning other areas to the improved infrastructure, which could eventually be deployed throughout the state.  The project ultimately strives to supply historically disenfranchised communities, such as the Alabama Black Belt, access to safely treated wastewater. The Alabama Black Belt is known for its dark, rich soil, which also contains high concentrations of clay soils that cause water drainage issues.  As a result, the region has long suffered from ineffective traditional onsite wastewater systems.  The project will include guidance and training for rural communities in the Black Belt region, such as performing county-need assessments, evaluating and testing wastewater treatment options, defining workable funding mechanisms, and developing appropriate technical, management, and regulatory direction. The funding for this TAT/RWTS grant was provided through a pilot program in the Fiscal Year 2020 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which was authored and advanced by Senator Shelby, then-Appropriations Committee Chairman. ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/shelby-alabama-consortium-receives-rural-water-and-wastewater-treatment-award"
https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/newsreleases?ContentRecord_id=FF94505F-F429-4969-8FFB-9B7ED9167070,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today released the following statement regarding H.R.1319, the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion pandemic spending bill: “I voted against this bill today because it could further wreck the economy and ignite inflation.  This legislation includes a host of non-COVID-related left-wing policies.  Not only does it cost the American taxpayers $1.9 trillion, but only nine percent of the funding in the bill goes toward the immediate fight against COVID and one percent toward vaccines.  The bill does nothing to get kids back in classrooms and, instead, includes a massive cash bailout for some mismanaged states and local governments.  Democrats are forcing a liberal wish list of pet projects through Congress that’s masked as a pandemic rescue package.  I am disappointed that we were blocked at every turn from engaging and passing real COVID relief in a bipartisan, targeted manner, just like the Senate did five times last year.” The $1.9 trillion emergency COVID bill, which Democrats forced through the Senate by a vote of 50-49, includes liberal provisions including the expansion of Obamacare subsidies, harmful economic policies, and funding for blue state bailouts, Planned Parenthood, union pensions, and other items unrelated to the pandemic.  The legislation includes $350 billion to bail out long-mismanaged state and local governments, multiple times the amount experts estimate needed to address COVID needs.  Only five percent of the funding included for K-12 schools would be spent during the current fiscal year, with 95 percent instead spent over the next seven years.  Additionally, agriculture-related funds in the bill would be spent over the next decade. House and Senate Democrats have used the budget reconciliation process to consider this legislation, which has allowed them to pass the legislation without bipartisan cooperation.  Reconciliation bills only require a simple majority for final passage. ###Share This: https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/shelby-votes-against-democrats-massive-unrelated-covid-bill"
