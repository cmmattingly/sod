http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/ri-delegation-announces-major-825-million-grant-to-upgrade-iconic-pell-bridge,"Providence, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced an $82.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s INFRA Grant Program to upgrade the iconic Pell Bridge that connects Newport and Jamestown.  Planned improvements to the deck, suspension system, and towers will extend the life of New England’s longest suspension bridge by an additional 50 to 75 years.“The Newport Pell Bridge is a critical asset that gets a lot of wear and tear from traffic and the elements.  We must take proper care of it and that means proactive planning and maintenance.  I was pleased to help kick-start the bridge ramp realignment project with a $20 million federal grant in 2018.  This new INFRA grant will support RITBA’s efforts to properly maintain the bridge, improve safety, and extend its lifespan,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) who worked with his colleagues to include $7.25 billion for competitive INFRA grants and $7.5 billion for competitive Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“I helped create the INFRA program to meet the need for major, once-in-a-generation investments like rebuilding the Pell Bridge,” said Whitehouse, who authored the INFRA Program in 2015 to help meet Rhode Island’s need for large-scale infrastructure investments.  “The Pell Bridge is the Ocean State’s most iconic landmark, and we will be able to keep it that way for at least an additional half century thanks to this enormous federal grant.  There is much to be done to bring the bridge into the twenty-first century.” “The Pell Bridge is one of Rhode Island’s most iconic landmarks, and it’s also an integral piece of our infrastructure. Connecting Aquidneck and Conanicut Islands, the bridge carries tens of thousands of passengers over Narragansett Bay each day.  It’s critical that Rhode Islanders and tourists alike can make that journey safely and efficiently,” said Congressman Langevin.  “I am thrilled that funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will allow us to keep the Pell Bridge in pristine condition.”“The Pell Bridge isn’t just critical infrastructure for Rhode Islanders, it’s an icon that has earned its place on the National Register of Historic Places,” said Congressman Cicilline.  “To ensure that this resource is available to Rhode Islanders and visitors for years to come, we need to invest in and modernize the bridge now so that we can return it to a state of good repair while reducing long-term costs and improving safety.  The Pell Bridge is a prime example of the types of projects that the bipartisan infrastructure law was designed to support and fund.  I’m looking forward to an extended, long life for this Rhode Island icon.”The project will include a partial depth replacement and rehabilitation of the bridge deck in the main suspended and west approach spans.  Climate change has led to more severe storms and more frequent use of salt and other treatments to make the road safe for travel, accelerating the loss of pavement quality.  The new pavement will be made of a denser material that is more resistant to the effects of chemical deterioration.Increased humidity from climate change is also accelerating the need to repair the main cables, suspenders, and other elements of the suspension system.  While the cables and suspenders are currently safe, inspection data points to an accelerating pace of deterioration.  The funding will be used to install a de-humidification system to reduce moisture levels within the cables and anchorages, and halt the corrosion process.  The suspender ropes and other elements will be replaced when needed, helping preserve the main cable for an additional 75 years of useful life.Funding will also be used to repair the tower elevators, replace the finger joints that accommodate movement in the bridge, and repaint the towers.  Acoustic monitoring will provide data on the bridge’s condition and additional cameras and sensors will provide greater physical security.“The Newport Pell Bridge serves as a vital connector for health care services, education, mutual aid among public safety departments, access to jobs, work sites and housing, and as a connector for commuters between the Greater Providence area and Newport County,” said Governor Dan McKee.  “This critical grant will help us protect the iconic Newport Pell Bridge from climate change while the completion of the bridge decking and painting of the towers will return the bridge to a state of good repair – bettering the lives of Rhode Islanders and the industries that support our state.  I thank our Congressional Delegation for securing this funding from the Biden Administration.”The Pell Bridge opened in 1969 and was dedicated in honor of the late U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell.  The bridge, which carries four lanes of traffic across Narragansett Bay, is operated by the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority. “Governor McKee and his administration have coordinated the state’s approach to infrastructure, which puts Rhode Island in a strong place to compete for significant federal grants like this INFRA grant.  Our Congressional Delegation has shown once again that Rhode Island punches well above its weight,” said Lori Caron Silveira, Executive Director of the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority.  “This investment from the U.S. Department of Transportation will accelerate and expand planned maintenance and extend the life of the iconic Newport Pell Bridge by an additional 50 to 75 years.  With collaboration across state government, leadership from our federal team, and support from private sector partners and organized labor, we are confident that this is only the beginning.”In 2018, the delegation secured $20 million in federal funding to upgrade the ramps leading from Aquidneck Island to the Pell Bridge.The bipartisan infrastructure law passed late last year included $7.25 billion for the INFRA program over five years.  First authorized in 2015 as the FASTLANE grant program, the INFRA discretionary grant program provides funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation for large-scale highway and multimodal projects that might otherwise stall without additional federal support.  Rhode Island previously received a $60.3 million INFRA grant to rebuild the Northbound Providence Viaduct and a $65 million INFRA grant to overhaul Route 146.Chip Unruh (Reed), (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294Matt Fidel (Langevin), (202) 631-1010Jennifer Bell (Cicilline), (202) 365-0827"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-grassley-lead-senate-caucus-in-issuing-report-on-strategies-to-combat-money-laundering-by-drug-cartels,"Washington, DC – Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, today released a bipartisan report entitled: Strengthening U.S. Efforts to Attack the Financial Networks of Cartels.  The report offers recommendations for Congress and the Biden administration to reduce the supply of illicit drugs by closing loopholes in the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) framework that enable narcotics traffickers to obscure and access their illicit proceeds. “Drug traffickers exploit weaknesses in our laws to run multi-billion dollar criminal enterprises that have caused hundreds of thousands of American drug overdose deaths and immense pain in Rhode Island and across the nation,” said Whitehouse.  “Our report outlines necessary reforms to crack down on the financial trickery that cartels and other criminals engage in.  When implemented, these reforms will reduce the supply of illicit narcotics by better enabling the U.S. to attack the sophisticated financial networks that allow drug cartels to thrive.”“Drug cartels are exploiting our borders to flood the nation with deadly drugs, and they’re reaping huge profits on the pain and suffering they inflict.  Our report examines how the federal government can better target and dismantle the flow of their ill-gotten gains.  Reducing the financial incentive for drug traffickers to operate in the United States is an important step in our effort to crack down on the illicit drug epidemic and fight addiction.  As the report highlights, a key component in that fight is enacting the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2022 that Senator Whitehouse and I sponsored,” Grassley said.Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control members Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and James E. Risch (R-ID) have also endorsed the report, which includes the following recommendations:The report further includes additional views from Chairman Whitehouse, which detail additional actions the Biden administration should take to close regulatory loopholes.  Specifically, Whitehouse recommends that the administration bolster AML safeguards in the U.S. property market and extend strong AML reporting requirements to gatekeepers of the U.S. financial system by:The Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control has a long history of working on a bipartisan basis to crack down on illicit drug trafficking globally, while expanding addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services at home.  As Chairman of the Caucus, Whitehouse has held hearings to examine: the role of the federal government in attacking the financial networks of cartels; corruption associated with the illicit drug trade; and how drug cartels have adapted their production, trafficking, and finance schemes for the 21st Century.A PDF of the full report is available here.  Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294Taylor Foy (Grassley), 202-224-6708"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/with-reed-and-whitehouses-backing-us-senate-confirms-lara-montecalvo-for-1st-circuit-court-of-appeals,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate confirmed Lara E. Montecalvo’s nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit by a bipartisan vote of 52-47. Montecalvo, who has led the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender since 2020, was nominated by President Joe Biden in April to fill the vacancy created by Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announcing her plan to assume “senior status,” which means she will soon begin hearing cases on a more limited basis. Montecalvo’s nomination received strong backing from U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, who advocated for her confirmation on the Senate floor.“As the state’s public defender, Lara Montecalvo served the people of Rhode Island well.  I am confident she will continue to do so on the federal bench.  She has dedicated her legal career to public service and we are fortunate to have a judge with her expertise and background on one of our nation’s most important courts,” said Senator Reed.“Congratulations to soon-to-be Judge Montecalvo on earning bipartisan approval from the Senate.   She is extremely well-respected in Rhode Island’s legal and law enforcement communities.  I know she will be a strong voice for justice and fairness on the First Circuit,” said Senator Whitehouse, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is based in Boston.  Judges have court chambers in different states and Montecalvo’s chambers will be in Providence, Rhode Island.  The First Circuit hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  The First Circuit is one of thirteen federal appellate courts that sit one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court. Montecalvo has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal level.  A Swarthmore College graduate who went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice for almost four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Before being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.Now that Montecalvo has been confirmed by the full U.S. Senate, she must be sworn in and take the oath of office before she can begin hearing cases.  Once she is sworn in, she will become the First Circuit’s tenth judge, and third Rhode Islander – joining both Bruce M. Selya, who assumed senior status in 2006, and O. Rogeriee Thompson. The other judges on the First Circuit are: David J. Barron (chief judge), Norman H. Stahl, Sandra L. Lynch, Kermit V. Lipez, Jeffrey R. Howard, William J. Kayatta, Jr., and Gustavo A. Gelpí.Chip Unruh (Reed), 202-224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), 401-453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/scheme-18_leonard-leos-16-billion-payday,"This is the 18th time that I have come to the floor to expose the dark money scheme that has captured and controlled our Supreme Court. Over the last 2 years, I have, over and over, exposed how dark money operatives, working from the shadows, have installed Supreme Court Justices handpicked—handpicked—by the minions of far-right donors. I have exposed the key front groups through which this Court-packing operation is driven and the tactics that the schemers have used to hide the dark money donors who pull its strings. And when you take a close look at the scheme, the little spider that you find at the center of the dark money web behind it is a character named Leonard Leo.From his perch at the dark money-funded Federalist Society, Leo crafted a reputation as the Court-capture scheme’s puppet master. The key to his craft is an armada of phony front groups that shuffle dark money back and forth, around and amongst each other, to deploy as spin, as propaganda, as political ads, or as hidden campaign funding.During Donald Trump’s time in office, Leonard Leo brokered the scheme to have the Federalist Society or— more accurately—the big secret donors behind the Federalist Society handpick Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. Remember that list we all heard about? Leo coordinated the dark money propaganda machine that kept the heat on Senate Republicans to confirm those nominees, and he supported the big donors’ doctrine factories where donor-approved fringe legal doctrines are concocted for the anointed judges to weaponize from the Bench. Look no further than the recent West Virginia v. EPA decision weaponizing the doctrine factory-concocted major questions’ doctrine. And this was no small scheme. The latest estimate from earlier this year is that these big donors put $580 million, more than half a billion dollars, into Leo’s network of Court-capture front groups.Well, little did we know, that was just the beginning.Last month, ProPublica and the New York Times broke the news that a reclusive, far-right billionaire supercharged Leo’s dark money operation with a $1.6 billion donation to a Leo front group. You heard that right, $1.6 billion into this dark money operation.The man behind this new slush fund is a billionaire named Barre Seid, and even the way the donation was made was creepy and clandestine. Seid and Leo devised a plan to transfer all the shares in an electronics company to Leo’s front group, on the way to selling that company. So when that company sold for $1.6 billion, it all went straight to Leo’s group and, by the way, helped Seid avoid what would have been roughly $400 million in taxes. Seid has a long history of funding far-right front groups. Here is how ProPublica characterized what Seid calls his ‘‘attack philanthropy:’’“Seid has funded climate denialism as well as a national network of state-level think tanks that promote business deregulation and fight Medicaid expansion. He’s also supported efforts to remake the higher education system in a conservative mold, including to turn one of the nation’s most politically influential law schools into a training ground for future generations of rightwing judges and justices.”So let’s unpack all of that, starting with the climate denialism. The ‘‘climate denialism’’ that they are referencing came from a group that he funded called the Heartland Institute. I have talked about the Heartland Institute on the floor before in my ‘‘Web of Denial’’ speeches. Heartland is a dark money disinformation mouthpiece for fossil fuel interests. In 2012, Heartland compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. So you can see it is a classy bunch. According to one of Seid’s advisers, he was Heartland’s major patron, and he even convinced his business’s chief financial officer to join Heartland’s board of directors.If that isn’t creepy enough for you, we move on to the national network of state-level think tanks that promote business deregulation and fight Medicaid expansion. That is a reference to the State Policy Network, a web of dark money front groups that pump into State legislatures the propaganda and legislation designed by fossil fuel and other corporate interests. The State Policy Network has also received millions from Donors Trust, which has been called the ‘‘dark money ATM of the right,’’ a central node of the rightwing Koch dark money network.The service that DonorsTrust provides is to scrub the identities of actual donors. It creates dark money. Anonymity is key for these donors, many of whom have financial interests behind their political schemes that they really don’t want disclosed. If a fossil fuel billionaire, say, wants to run ads against me in Rhode Island—folks will get the joke. So the real donor’s identity gets laundered through groups like DonorsTrust and comes out under other groups with names like—I am making this one up, but they sound this way ‘‘Rhode Islanders for Peace and Puppies and Prosperity.’’ All of that, of course, leaves citizens in the dark about both the actors and the plot in the politics in which they are supposed to be active participants.And that brings us to Seid’s project to ‘‘turn one of the nation’s most politically influential law schools into a training ground for future generations of right-wing judges and justices.’’ That is a reference to Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, a central cog in the right-wing doctrine factory.The cog was not always named Antonin Scalia Law School. In 2016, George Mason received $10 million from the Charles Koch Foundation, plus another $20 million from an anonymous donor, orchestrated by that same Leonard Leo, and one of the strings attached was that George Mason rename its law school after Scalia.When folks at George Mason University, a public university, pushed for answers about all of this, the university, after a legal battle, had to disclose that renaming the law school wasn’t the only string attached to that $20 million donation. Leo and his donor wanted input over faculty hiring. And that legal battle also unearthed the name of the anonymous donor: Barre Seid.And all of that brings us back to Seid’s $1.6 billion to the Leonard Leo dark money apparatus. Remember that with $0.6 billion, Leo was able to orchestrate a dark money takeover of our Supreme Court, stacking it with far-right Justices, who have already delivered massive victories for their donors: overturning Roe v. Wade, undermining the government’s power to combat climate change, throwing out century-old commonsense gun regulations. If he can do that with $0.6 billion, imagine what kind of damage he will be able to do with $1.6 billion to squirt out as dark money through his armada of phony front groups.Leo’s already dispensed $153 million to Rule of Law Trust, which appears to exist solely to funnel money to other dark money groups and another $16.5 million to his own Concord Fund. If you have been watching these ‘‘Scheme’’ speeches, you will remember that the last time I addressed the scheme in this Chamber, I laid out how the Concord Fund and its corporate twin, the 85 Fund, are the central nodes in a collection of phony front groups that deploy fictitious names, fictitious names to mask their connections. The coordinated and colocated front groups, Concord Fund and 85 Fund, operate through the fictitious names Judicial Crisis Network and Honest Elections Project, among other fictitious names. So, yes, you have got this right. In this dark money netherworld, the front groups have front groups.With this new billion-dollar slush fund, Leo can take those efforts to entirely new levels: more voter suppression, which is the job of Honest Elections Project; more abortion bans, which was the accomplishment of Dobbs; more climate denial, which was powered by West Virginia v. EPA and the earlier EPA decision by the Supreme Court about the Clean Power Plan; more power for corporations, which is, of course, the constant goal of this dark money operation; more disinformation; and more dirty dark money in politics—sluiced around inside this covert apparatus until it gets squirted out through even more phony front groups.This dark money slime will ooze everywhere. With pivotal elections coming up this fall, this slime will ooze out through your television sets, through your mailboxes, through your telephone, all of it designed to smear and lie to benefit far-right donor interests. The phony front group squirting out the slime will have innocuous-sounding names, but make no mistake, hiding behind many of them will be Leo and his secretive billionaire backers.While this tactic isn’t new, it has been perfected by the rightwing. It began with the Koch brothers, who spent the last decade pumping dark money into our politics, producing a decade of successful climate obstruction, until finally we got the Inflation Reduction Act passed with the first real climate measures Congress has ever passed, but because of the Koch brothers’ pressure, we had to rely entirely on Democrats to get that bill passed. We did not get one Republican vote in the Senate. We did not get one Republican vote in the House.Constant assaults on workers’ rights, endless attacks on the Affordable Care Act, and, of course, the rightwing billionaires own big payoff, big tax cuts for billionaires—it is probable that for all of the money that got thrown into this dark money apparatus by rightwing billionaires, some of them probably made more money than that back from the tax cuts that were delivered for them under the Trump administration. This is a it-pays-to-play dark money operation. And the result is that all this dark money has reduced the once Grand Old Party to the political operation of a handful of extremist megadonors.The dark money assault on our democracy is not over. Right now, Leonard Leo, his rightwing donors, and their dark money apparatus are devising the next phases of the scheme. They have already captured the highest Court in the land, but they will not stop until they have enacted their entire radical agenda. They will turn their sights on State courts, on city councils, on local school boards—anywhere they can find a way to subvert democracy with dark money.So now is the time to fight back, and the first step is to pass the DISCLOSE Act. It is way long past time that we shine the light on the dark money schemers. You may recall that in the Citizens United decision, by a vote of 8 to 1, even that Court said that dark money is corrupting. That is an established principle of the Citizens United decision. Well, if it is corrupting, we ought to get rid of it, because the American people deserve to know who captured their Supreme Court and who keeps flooding our politics with dark money. When you spend that kind of money, there is a motivation, and voters, citizens, deserve to know.To be continued."

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-joins-president-biden-for-ceremonial-inflation-reduction-act-bill-signing,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse today joined President Joe Biden at the White House to take part in a ceremonial bill signing for the Inflation Reduction Act, landmark legislation that will lower energy and health care costs for Rhode Islanders, and drive down the emissions causing the climate crisis.  All 50 Senate Democrats and Vice President Harris voted last month to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.“I’m thrilled to join President Biden for this historic occasion.  Our Inflation Reduction Act will lower Rhode Islanders’ energy and health care bills and create good jobs in the Ocean State.  With this new law, Democrats have allowed Medicare to finally begin negotiating drug prices, and we’ve gotten billionaires and the wealthiest corporations to start paying a fairer share,” said Whitehouse.  “I worked tirelessly to help shape major climate components of the bill, which are expected to significantly increase the rate of emissions reductions.  While there’s still much more to do to lead the planet to safety in the race against climate change, momentum is on our side today.”The major climate provisions developed by Whitehouse or modeled after legislation he authored include a suite of clean energy programs that Whitehouse helped shape in the Finance Committee, including the provision to incentivize the production of sustainable aviation fuel and the provision to increase the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration.  The legislation also contains other major climate provisions modeled on legislation authored by Whitehouse, including grant programs inspired by the Senator’s Clean Industrial Technology Act to decarbonize emissions-heavy sectors and a methane reduction program for oil and gas facilities that grew out of Whitehouse’s methane fee proposal.From capped prescription drug costs for seniors to substantial rebates for efficient home appliances and retrofits to lower health insurance premiums, Rhode Islanders will soon see the results of the Inflation Reduction Act up close.  By insulating consumers from volatile fossil fuel prices, the average household is expected to see $170-$220 in annual savings from reduced electricity costs.  Households that take advantage of the various tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act will see even larger savings, as their heating and transportation costs decline.Whitehouse-backed measures in the bill include: Health CareEnergy Transportation Progressive Tax ReformsEnvironment and Environmental JusticePresident Biden officially signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law on August 16.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

                "
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/time-to-wake-up-285-executive-beast-mode,"Mr. President, I will proceed with my trusty, battered ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ chart and my—I don’t know—280-something speech. For once, I can start with some good news, which is that the Democrats, at last, passed a climate-focused reconciliation bill this year.This is a huge step and essential, given the cascade of harms climate change is already inflicting: wildfire in Yosemite National Park, billions of dollars in flood damage; Europe broils in heat wave; extreme heat led to ‘‘brutal’’ rise in sea temperatures; dangerous heat hits United States; emissions rising of methane, glacier tragedies; Houston slogs through brutal heat; climate change is forcing massive wildlife migration. Wherever you look, you see the news of what is happening—heat waves, droughts, wildfires, collapsing glaciers, rising seas, record carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the atmosphere.It is a bombardment of hard evidence that the Earth is fast becoming less hospitable for human life. The costs of our political negligence are high and rising.My friends across the aisle like to fixate on the price of gasoline, which undeniably affects family budgets. But climate change imposes costs on American families much worse than gasoline prices. Climate change causes effects that raise insurance premiums, snarl supply chains, reduce crop yields, sicken people, and damage cars, homes, and businesses.A lot of thoughtful groups have quantified this damage. The International Monetary Fund estimates this ‘‘climate tax’’ on American families at over $5,000 per year based on their calculation that we subsidize fossil fuel by allowing them to get away with doing all this pollution and harm for free to the tune of $660 billion every year. That is the International Monetary Fund—5,000 bucks per family from climate change harms.They are not alone, of course. Resources for the Future, which is a well-regarded, well-trusted calculation shop, has just looked at what the social cost of carbon should be, and they pegged it at $185 per ton of carbon emissions. Right now, the nominal social cost of carbon left over from the Obama administration is $51 per ton. Resources for the Future has done a more rigorous calculation and puts it at $185 in harm per ton of carbon emitted.What does this all add up to? Well, you can go to corporate consulting firm Deloitte, which is a corporate consulting firm. We are not talking about, you know, Green New Deal folks here. This is a corporate consultancy. They say that inaction on climate change could cost the world’s economy $178 trillion over the next 50 years.Now, the bad news is climate change harms could cost $178 trillion. The good news is if we got after this and behaved responsibly, you could gain $43 trillion in economic development in that same time period. So if you put the two together, that is a $220 trillion swing depending on decisions that we make today. So it kind of matters to getting this right, and we are not yet getting this right.The reconciliation bill, good as it is, won’t decarbonize our economy in time without a lot more action. The bill likely takes expected emissions reduction from around 25 percent, which we are assuming right there—that is our baked-in number—and it raises it to about 40 percent. So it is a 15-percent increase in emissions reduction, from 25 percent to 40 percent. So that is good.That is good, but it still leaves much to do, because, remember, net zero is the target, and if you have reduced by 40 percent, that still leaves 60 percent that is work to be done. So soon we are going to need another bill, and the contours of such a bill, if it is going to be effective, are pretty clear. There is bipartisan interest in a carbon border adjustment, which would make American manufacturing more competitive and reduce carbon pollution worldwide. We export pressure against carbon pollution with a carbon border tariff.There is also bipartisan interest in commonsense permitting reform to safely and quickly build out the clean energy infrastructure of the future. My coastal State needs it for offshore wind. The Presiding Officer’s Mountain State needs it for transmission lines to connect to the grid the capacity we have for solar and wind.And the fossil fuel industry at least pretends to be interested in a price on carbon emissions. Now, that is just pretense. They put their whole political operation into effect to make sure none of that happens, but it is a good sign. It is a step on the path when they have to pretend to support a price on emissions. That is a step on the way to actually supporting a price on carbon emissions.I will do everything in my power to do all of those things. But let’s be clear. It would be much easier if corporate America were not a wall of opposition to serious climate bills. And it is not just the fossil fuel industry. Banking, insurance, retail, tech—pick your industrial sector. You name it—in this building, useless on climate. Or worse, there is a huge spread between what they tell their shareholders and their customers and the public and what they send their emissaries into Congress to tell us. And until that is solved, until corporate America aligns what it is telling the public with what it is doing in Congress, legislation is going to be tough to do.So that leaves the executive branch, and that is what brings me to the floor today, because there is a lot that the executive branch can do under existing executive authorities.And in this recent article, the White House said they were going to get started: Biden Prepares More Actions to Cut Emissions. Regulations from the E.P.A. and elsewhere will help the president meet his aggressive climate goals. ‘‘The president has not chosen to just look at Congress, he’s chosen to recognize that he has presidential authorities and responsibilities under the law to keep moving this forward.’’ Well, he sure does, and there is plenty of room to do different things and new things.So what can be done by executive action? Let’s go through the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions since that is our target. The No. 1 source—by the way, these 11 sources of carbon pollution amount to almost 70 percent of our carbon emissions. So if we can tackle these, we are making a big dent in that remaining 60 percent left undone.So cars and light trucks is the largest category. It generates almost a fifth of total U.S. carbon pollution. The EPA and DOT restored Obama-era greenhouse gas emission standards. So now go further, as California has. Start with model year 2027 and begin a ramp-up to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles by 2035. There is authority for this under the Clean Air Act and the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. And, by the way, when you double your car’s energy efficiency, doubling your fuel economy is exactly the same thing as cutting oil prices and gasoline prices in half.So push in that direction. And, by the way, getting off of fossil fuel for cars and light trucks will help us get off the Big Oil treadmill of cartel prices that are set with the help of foreign despots in Russia, in Saudi Arabia, in Venezuela, outside the rule of American law.But Americans have to pay because our oil industry goes along with the international cartel instead of charging market-based prices. We just saw them do that and reap record profits. So there is a lot to be done on cars and light trucks.Coal-fired power plants is the next biggest one. Coal-fired power plants belch carbon pollution, but also a lot of other pollutants. So if you regulate for health against those other pollutants, you get a lot of co-benefits with carbon pollution.Among the worst is fine particulate matter, which is also known as soot or, more technically, PM 2.5. It is the leading cause of the estimated 100,000 to 200,000 air pollution-related premature deaths each year. So it is causing real harm. And then you add in coal ash, which is the toxic sludge left after you burn coal, loaded with arsenic, mercury, lead, and uranium, and often stored in lagoons which sometimes burst, just as you see in this picture, not only swamping this farmhouse but also poisoning rivers and ground water. This should be a ‘‘never event.’’ This should be a ‘‘never event,’’ but it is not. It is all too frequent, and poor communities often take the hit.EPA regulations can eliminate these threats and produce carbon reduction co-benefits. Nothing in the recent West Virginia v. EPA decision prevents EPA from requiring that coal-fired power plants install carbon capture technology. And carbon capture technology can eliminate up to 95 percent of the carbon pollution. Add EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to regulate fine particulate matter and coal ash, and you can make real progress.That brings us, then, to gas-fired power plants, the next category. They are big carbon polluters, and they are still being built. EPA regulations for new and existing gas-fired plants can limit their carbon pollution the same way. Carbon capture can be one option. Co-firing with zero carbon hydrogen could be another option.Next on the list is heavy-duty vehicles, trucks, and buses. Now EPA has a proposed rule, and that proposed rule on trucks and buses does nothing to reduce carbon pollution. EPA and DOT have ample authority here, and they should use it. California has its own ‘‘advanced clean trucks rule’’ requiring increased zero emission heavy-duty vehicles. If EPA can’t do any better, then follow California’s lead.Next comes methane, spewing from oil and gas facilities as leaks, vents, or flares. EPA has a proposed rule—no actual rule yet—but even the proposed rule has flaws. First, it doesn’t cover low-producing wells. A low-producing well can be a very high-leaking well. So whether it is high or low producing should matter less than whether it is a big leaker. Second, the rule does little for venting and flaring, which are major pollution sources.Now one development is that satellites can now very precisely locate methane leaks. So we can aggressively pursue and punish big methane polluters, and we should do that. Set up a task force. Have people go hunting for the big methane leaks. Find who is responsible and get after them.If you do all that, it would cover more than half of gross carbon emissions in the United States. So let’s do it. No more complaining about not enough staff. EPA has more employees than all of Congress combined. If you don’t have enough staff, then detail folks in from the regional offices, borrow from your State counterparts. Do what it takes to get after this like you mean it, because we need to.There is a list that I tweeted out of things that the administration could be doing within its existing executive authorities.Within the White House, OMB, or the Office of Management and Budget, 18 months in, needs to finalize its social cost of carbon, the costs and the harms from each ton of carbon pollution emitted. That is the number that I mentioned earlier that Resources for the Future just calculated at $185 per ton. OMB needs to finalize the social cost of carbon, set the number, and require its use throughout government decision making.All the regulatory agencies should use it, even the quasi-independents. And you can add in procurement decisions. The Federal Government contracts for over $600 billion in goods and services every year. We buy buildings, vehicles, planes, cement, steel, appliances. You name it, the government buys it. Plug the social cost of carbon into procurement, as many private companies do, and you engage the power of government contracting against the climate threat. And when you do that, that then drives economies of scale that make those low-carbon projects and products cheaper for everyone else, not just the government buyer.The social cost of carbon should drive Department of Interior fossil fuel royalty rates for oil, gas, and coal produced on Federal lands and waters. Those rates right now are so low that we lose money on royalties compared to the costs that those fossil fuels impose on all of us. That is just dumb and also unfair. So let’s fix that flagrant imbalance by putting the social cost of carbon into the fees and royalties.I would add that the Department of Justice has a role to play here. Years ago, under the Clinton administration, the Department of Justice sued Big Tobacco for decades of misrepresentations about the harms of its product. Well, DOJ won that lawsuit, and they won big, and they got a court order requiring Big Tobacco to quit lying.Well, like Big Tobacco, Big Oil has spent decades misrepresenting the dangers associated with its product. The Department of Justice is way overdue to take a serious look at fossil fuel lies. As they look around the country, they see States and municipalities and counties bringing lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry. It is happening out there.It is incumbent on the Department of Justice to advise the President on what the Department of Justice should be doing. To turn a blind eye to all that litigation, to ignore its own victory in the tobacco case, to refuse to recommend to the President any course of action or to take any course of action is just not an acceptable way of going forward. If the DOJ took an honest look, I bet they would find the case against Big Oil every bit as solid as the case they won against Big Tobacco.And while we are at it, there is the bully pulpit. The administration should use the bully pulpit to call out the dark money, the lies, the fake science, the phony front groups, the spin doctors, the co-opted lobby groups, the dirty political spending, the whole apparatus, the whole machinery that the fossil fuel industry has used to corrupt Congress and obstruct progress. Calling out crooks is the right thing to do, and the public deserves to know that there is a villain here who has blocked progress on purpose and what that villain is up to.There is a lot that the Biden administration can and should be doing. Yes, it is good to declare a climate emergency. It is better to act like it is a climate emergency and deploy your Executive authorities accordingly.That means the sort of regulatory surge I have just outlined—no waffling, no excuses. A winning strategy ultimately includes regulation, litigation, legislation, acquisition, and communication.Across those five fronts, the Biden administration should have a plan to move forward in each and every one. It needs the kind of leadership that Eisenhower gave to the Normandy landing and the invasion that followed. By the way, while you are organizing it that way, do it with gusto. This is a fight that is worth having. It is not just that the planet depends on it; it is not just that our international credibility depends on it; it is not just cleaning out this place from rotten fossil fuel industry depends on it; it is the right thing to do.The American public will stand behind a President who stands up against lies and dark money and the schemes to blockade climate safety.So I will close by saying that whether there was ever a time for half-hearted, half-baked, and halfway measures, it is done. We need to build on the success of the Inflation Reduction Act. We need to take that as a launch pad, a first chapter, not a last chapter. And on this fight, it is all in or lose because our adversaries are determined. They are just wrong, but they are determined.So it is all in or lose. By the way, if we lose this race, the laws of chemistry and physics are going to be unforgiving. I yield the floor"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/us-senate-poised-to-confirm-ris-montecalvo-to-seat-on-influential-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-first-circuit,"WASHINGTON, DC – Lara E. Montecalvo’s nomination to serve on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit cleared a key Senate hurdle today.  In a Senate procedure known as a ‘cloture vote,’ which is a preliminary vote necessary to end debate before final confirmation, Montecalvo received the backing of a majority of the U.S. Senate.Now, Montecalvo, who currently leads the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender, is slated to get confirmed this week to serve as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  The First Circuit, based in Boston, hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  The First Circuit is one of thirteen federal appellate courts that sit one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, who strongly backed President Biden’s nomination of Lara Montecalvo, say she is expected to get a final confirmation vote by the full U.S. Senate this week and expect her to be confirmed.“Lara Montecalvo is an extremely talented public servant and she will be an outstanding, fair-minded judge.  She has practiced law in every court in Rhode Island and earned high marks for her sound judgement and legal expertise.  She deserves to be confirmed because she is exceptionally well-qualified and will strengthen the court by bringing a diversity of experience to the First Circuit,” said Reed and Whitehouse in a joint statement.Montecalvo has extensive trial and appellate experience handling criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts.Montecalvo, who moved to Rhode Island with her family when she was in the fourth grade, currently serves as the state’s chief public defender and is tasked with providing high-quality legal representation for Rhode Islanders who cannot afford to hire an attorney in criminal, juvenile, and parental rights cases.  Montecalvo has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal level.  She and her husband, Craig, have a son.Montecalvo earned a bachelor of arts degree from Swarthmore College and went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000.After graduating from law school, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC for four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Before being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.If confirmed by the full U.S. Senate, Montecalvo will fill the vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that was created by Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announcing her plan to take senior status.  Once a successor is confirmed, Judge Thompson will continue hearing cases, but on a more limited basis.So far during the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress, the U.S. Senate has confirmed 81 federal judges, including 22 circuit court nominees, 59 district court nominees, and the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court.  When it comes to increasing diversity on the federal bench, the Biden Administration has nominated and the Senate has confirmed the most diverse slate of judges of any U.S. Congress in history, including a record number of nominees with experience serving not only as prosecutors, but also as public defenders, voting rights experts, and civil rights attorneys.  Of the 22 circuit judges confirmed by the U.S. Senate Democrats, 17 are women and 14 are people of color.  Of the 59 district judges, 43 are women.Now that cloture has been invoked on Montecalvo’s nomination, it sets up a period of up to 30 hours of post-cloture debate followed by a final vote on confirmation, which requires a simple majority of the U.S. Senate.  A vote on final confirmation is expected as soon as tomorrow, depending on other U.S. Senate business.Chip Unruh (Reed), 202-224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), 401-453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/ri-fire-departments-receive-additional-21m-for-training-and-equipment,"Pawtucket, RI – Seven fire departments throughout Rhode Island have been awarded new federal grants to bolster training, acquire equipment, and increase safety in the latest round of funding made available through the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program and the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program.   Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline announced $2,128,490 in new federal funding for fire departments across the state, building on  $2.1 million in earlier rounds of AFG grants that were announced last month.   More than $1.76 million in AFG funding is going to the Smithfield Fire Department, Lime Rock Fire District, Tiverton Fire Department, Western Coventry Fire District, Cumberland EMS, and Exeter Fire Department, Division of EMS.  Additionally, the North Kingstown Fire Department will receive $360,000 through the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program.   “These federal funds will help provide our firefighters with vital equipment and training to improve public safety.  Our firefighters put their lives on the line and are on the frontlines every day responding to a range of emergencies, whether it’s a fire, medical emergency, or some other incident.  These grants will help ensure they are prepared and protected and can do their jobs safely and effectively,” said Reed, Whitehouse, Langevin and Cicilline in a joint statement.   The $2,128,490 is awarded to: Congress provided a total of $360 million for the AFG program in the fiscal 2022 appropriations law as well as $360 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grants (SAFER) program, which provides grants directly to fire departments and volunteer fire fighter interest organizations to help them increase or maintain the number of trained, “frontline” firefighters available in their communities.  It also made $46 million available for fire departments and non-profit organizations to strengthen community fire prevention programs and improve firefighter health through the Fire Prevention and Safety Program.   ###"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-outlines-next-steps-to-lower-emissions-after-passage-of-landmark-climate-bill,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse this evening took to the Senate floor to outline next steps for tackling climate change in his first climate speech after Democrats passed the historic Inflation Reduction Act – the most expansive climate bill ever signed into law.  The speech was Whitehouse’s 285th in the Time to Wake Up series.In the speech, Whitehouse called for passage of additional legislation, including a carbon border adjustment.  In June, Whitehouse introduced the Clean Competition Act, legislation to create a border adjustment mechanism that would make American companies more competitive in the global marketplace and tackle major sources of emissions.  Whitehouse also called on the Biden administration to marshal the full strength of the executive branch and the bully pulpit to tackle climate change.“A winning strategy ultimately includes regulation, litigation, acquisition, communication and legislation,” said Whitehouse.  “It includes leadership, like Eisenhower over the Normandy landing.  And it includes getting it done with gusto.  Have a damned fight.  It’s worth it.  The time for half-hearted, half-baked, halfway measures is done.  It’s all in or lose, and if we lose this race, the laws of chemistry and physics are unforgiving.”Video of Whitehouse’s speech is here and his as-prepared remarks are below. Well, Democrats at last passed a climate-focused reconciliation bill this year.  This is a huge step, and essential given the cascade of harms climate change is already inflicting.Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, collapsing glaciers, rising seas, record carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the atmosphere – a bombardment of hard evidence that the earth is fast becoming less hospitable for human life.  The costs of our negligence are high and rising.My friends across the aisle like to fixate on the price of gasoline, which undeniably affects family budgets.  But climate change imposes costs on American families much worse than gasoline prices.  Climate change causes effects that raise insurance premiums, snarl supply chains, reduce crop yields, sicken people, and damage homes, cars, and businesses.  The International Monetary Fund estimates this “climate tax” on American families at over $5,000 per family per year.Resources for the Future just put it at $185 per emitted ton of carbon dioxide.  Deloitte, the corporate consulting firm, predicts that climate harms will cost $178 trillion over the next 50 years, versus decarbonizing our economy which would add $43 trillion in economic growth.That’s a $220 trillion swing, depending on what we choose.  The choice is stark.  The reconciliation bill, good as it is, won’t decarbonize our economy in time, without a lot more action.  The bill likely takes expected emissions reduction from around 25% up to around 40%, but that still leaves much to do.Soon, we will need another bill.  The contours of such a bill are pretty clear.  There is bipartisan interest in a carbon border adjustment, which would make American manufacturing more competitive, and reduce carbon pollution worldwide.  There is bipartisan interest in common-sense permitting reform, to safely and quickly build out the clean energy infrastructure of the future.  And the fossil fuel industry at least pretends to be interested in a price on carbon emissions.  I will do everything in my power to do all this, but let’s be clear — it would be much easier if corporate America were not a wall of opposition to serious climate bills.  Banking, insurance, retail, tech, you name it — in this building, useless on climate, or worse. That leaves the executive branch.  There is lots that they can do.  And in this recent article, the White House said they’d get started.What can be done by executive action?  Look at the largest sources of carbon pollution.These 11 sources of carbon pollution account for almost 70 percent of all U.S. emissions.Cars and light trucks, the largest category, generate almost a fifth of total U.S. carbon pollution.  EPA and DOT restored Obama-era greenhouse-gas emission standards; now go further, as California has.  Start with model year 2027, and begin a ramp-up to 100 percent zero-emission vehicles by 2035.  There’s authority for this under the Clean Air Act and the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act.  By the way, doubling your car’s fuel economy is like cutting the price of gasoline in half.  And getting off fossil fuel gets us off the Big Oil treadmill of cartel price-gouging set by foreign despots in Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.Next, coal-fired power plants.  Coal-fired power plants belch carbon pollution, but other pollutants too.  Among the worst: fine particulate matter, also known as soot or PM 2.5; it’s the leading cause of the estimated 100,000 and 200,000 air pollution-related premature deaths each year. Add coal ash, the toxic sludge left after you burn coal, loaded with arsenic, mercury, lead, and uranium;

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/ri-delegation-announces-11m-to-support-survivors-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault,"WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to provide essential services to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and strengthen the state’s support systems for people who have experienced abuse, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline announced nearly $1.1 million in new federal funding to help victims and hold perpetrators accountable.The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is receiving a $550,000 federal grant under the Justice for Families Program to help provide targeted services for families impacted by sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, or in cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse.The Rhode Island Department of Public Safety is receiving $546,294 through the Sexual Assault Services (SAS) Grant Program, which provides dedicated funding to support rape crisis centers and organizations that provide services, direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual violence and non-offending family and household members of victims, and those collaterally affected by the sexual assault.Both grants are administered by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) and were funded in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law.“Survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence face immense challenges and this federal funding will help people who’ve been through traumatic crisis get the help they need.  It provides survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence with critical support to navigate the justice system and move forward with their healing.  From providing victims with counseling and legal services to safe, secure, temporary housing, this federal funding helps make a meaningful difference for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse,” said Senator Reed.“The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety do heroic work to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in their darkest hour,” said Whitehouse.  “After years prosecuting domestic violence, I’m glad to have helped secure these federal funds to boost the services offered to survivors and help ensure those who need support are able to find a lifeline in a moment of crisis.”“Survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence do incredible work to reclaim their lives after traumatic experiences. The recovery process sometimes includes setbacks, but a lack of targeted, community-based services should never be one of them,” said Congressman Jim Langevin. “I am proud to deliver funding to ensure that survivors have the resources they need to heal on their own terms, and I have every confidence that the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety will help them do just that.”“Far too many victims of domestic violence and sexual assault do not have access to the resources they need and deserve – for themselves and their families,” said Congressman Cicilline. “This funding, and the work and programs it will support at the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, will help countless Rhode Islanders get help and heal after experiencing trauma. These types of programs are exactly why we must continue to renew and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and prevent it from lapsing ever again.”Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence Executive Director Lucy Rios said: “We are tremendously fortunate to receive this essential funding that will better protect the safety of Rhode Islanders impacted by abuse and stalking, particularly communities that are underserved and at high risk for interpersonal violence – including communities of color, immigrants and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.”“We celebrate the establishment of child-friendly safe visitation centers that will be managed by the RICADV’s member agencies, which will keep survivors of violence safe from the abuse they often experience during court-ordered child visitation exchanges with an abusive co-parent. This funding supports our work to expand life-saving services to make this possible, and strengthens the safety net Rhode Island victims and their children rely on,” she continued.The Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations law, passed earlier this year, also included the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization Act, which was supported by all four members of Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation.  The law modernizes and reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act, which supports survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking by providing federal resources and technical support for programs that help victims.Chip Unruh (Reed), 202-224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), 401-453-5294Matt Fidel (Langevin), (202) 631-1010Jennifer Bell (Cicilline), (202) 365-0827"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-announces-funding-to-support-safe-housing-for-victims-of-abuse-in-rhode-island,"Providence, RI – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse joined Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, Rhode Island Secretary of Housing Josh Saal, and representatives of Sojourner House this morning to announce $850,000 in federal funding for the agency to support safe housing for victims of abuse in Rhode Island.“Survivors and advocates have made it clear that access to safe housing saves lives in a moment of crisis,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “Sojourner House provides many Rhode Island victims and families with shelter and helps them reclaim their lives from abuse.  I’m thrilled to have delivered this federal funding that will go toward increasing the safe housing inventory in our state.”With this federal funding, Sojourner House will be able to expand its residential housing portfolio by purchasing an additional building that will be rehabilitated and eventually leased to families who have experienced abuse.  The funding will also allow Sojourner House to provide supportive services to the clients who lease these safe, confidential apartments, which includes individual case management, clinical counseling, immigration advocacy, youth programming, and more.""Sojourner House is extremely grateful to Senator Whitehouse and the entire RI delegation for their on-going support of our work to provide safe, secure housing to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking.  This generous appropriation will allow us to expand our housing portfolio to secure additional properties that we eventually will be able to lease as permanent housing to families impacted by abuse,"" said Sojourner House's executive director, Vanessa Volz.  ""Due to our work, we are too familiar with the fact that safe, secure housing is often a barrier for a victim to flee from an abusive situation.  The more stable, permanent housing options we can provide for families to rebuild their lives, the more successful we can become in breaking the cycle of abuse that often forces victims to return to an abusive situation.""""Providence has made significant investments to tackle our housing crisis from every direction, including prevention, rapid rehousing, emergency services, and long term supports,"" said Mayor Jorge O. Elorza.  ""We know that housing insecurity is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires our community to come together with solutions that are creative and compassionate.  I thank Senator Whitehouse for always working hard to identify funds to support this work, and Sojourner House for leading efforts to increase the stock of affordable housing options in the City, including for survivors of abuse.""Increasing the inventory of safe housing is one of the most pressing needs for domestic violence survivors in Rhode Island and across the nation.  The National Network to End Domestic Violence reported that, on any given day in 2020, nearly 10,000 requests for services went unmet, and of those unmet requests, 64 percent were for safe housing.  For those individuals who are not able to find safe housing, the consequences can be dire, including continued exposure to life-threatening violence or homelessness.“Domestic violence and abuse are one of the leading causes of homelessness,” said Secretary of Housing Josh Saal.  “Our office is proud to partner with Sojourner House, local municipalities and other agencies to create more equitable housing options that enable survivors of domestic violence to find a safe and permanent home while receiving the support they need to piece their lives back together.”As a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Whitehouse has led the charge in Washington to strengthen federal support and funding for programs designed to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Whitehouse was a cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, which was passed in March alongside the FY22 government funding package.  Among other provisions, the bill strengthens rape prevention and education efforts; expands and authorizes programs to serve survivors requiring culturally specific services, LGBT survivors, and survivors who seek voluntary, community-based restorative practice services; supports legal services funding and trauma-informed law enforcement responses; and improves responses to sexual violence, including through grants to promote the training of sexual assault forensic examiners.  Whitehouse was also an original cosponsor of the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021, which redirects monetary penalties from federal deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements into the Crime Victims Fund.  This fix authorized an additional estimated $4-7 billion in non-taxpayer money for victim compensation and assistance programs in Rhode Island and across the country. Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/ri-delegation-calls-for-additional-support-for-local-restaurants,"Providence, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline are calling on the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide additional support to Rhode Island restaurants that are still dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been shut out of the Restaurant Revitalization Program.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund still has $180 million in unobligated funds, which the four members of Rhode Island’s delegation contend should be distributed in another funding round that would prioritize Ocean State establishments.“While we are disappointed that congressional Republicans have prevented Congress from sufficiently funding RRF, we understand SBA still has $180 million in unobligated program funds.  Even with some set aside for litigation or required to be sent to the Department of the Treasury, awards on that scale could make a transformative difference for the numerous restaurants still struggling with aftershocks from the pandemic’s economic crash,” wrote Rhode Island’s congressional delegation.In a letter to SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman, the delegation requested that the SBA use those remaining program dollars to prioritize restaurants in states with the lowest percentage of funded eligible applicants to ensure program funds are distributed in a geographically equitable manner, which would provide significant relief to eligible Rhode Island food businesses.Only 30 percent of Rhode Island restaurants that applied to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund received relief – the lowest rate in the country and more than 10 percentage points lower than any other New England state.  Applications were considered on a first-come, first-served basis and many smaller restaurants with fewer resources were not able to file fast enough.Democrats created the Restaurant Revitalization Fund through the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law in March 2021.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund provided grants to restaurants dealing with COVID-19 for payroll, mortgage and rent payments, business debt service, utilities, maintenance, outdoor seating, business supplies, food and beverage costs, certain supplier costs, and other operating expenses.  A total of 446 Rhode Island restaurant operators received over $106 million in aid from the program.Senate Republicans blocked bipartisan legislation in May that would have appropriated an additional $40 billion for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund—enough to provide all RRF applicants that had not received any assistance with full grants.  The bill failed to receive the necessary 60 votes after all but five Republicans voted against considering the measure.Full text of the letter is available here.Chip Unruh, (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294Matt Fidel (Langevin), (202) 631-1010Jennifer Bell (Cicilline), (202) 365-0827"

Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). In reaction to the Senators’ letter, David C. Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, stated: “The nation’s sexual health clinics have been managing frontline testing, treatment, and vaccination for monkeypox without adequate resources, staffing, or supplies, blunting the impact of federal efforts to address the outbreak.  The success of the national response hinges on whether these clinics get the resources they need to help patients access expanded testing, treatment, and vaccines.” A PDF of the letter can be found here.  Full text of the letter is below.  Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell: We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care. As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.1  MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents. We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities. Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern. Chip Unruh (Reed), (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294"

Soon enough, all public buses operating on Aquidneck Island will be fully electric, and they’ll have the electric charging infrastructure needed to support them,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “I’m proud that these federal dollars will be used to help Rhode Island meet the threat of climate change head on, so the Ocean State can continue leading the charge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from dirty, fossil fuels.”“This significant federal investment in electric buses will help Rhode Island continue to lead the way in green energy innovation. This RAISE grant funding will help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, advance RIPTA’s ongoing efforts to make their fleet more environmentally sustainable, and combat climate change right here at home,” said Congressman Cicilline.“We are grateful for Senator Reed and the entire Congressional delegation’s steadfast support of public transportation, including their commitment to new battery-powered buses with zero emissions,” said Scott Avedisian, RIPTA CEO. “Their help in securing this most recent funding makes it possible for us to continue to move forward with our plan to electrify bus service on Aquidneck Island and our overall goal to improve air quality in our state.”RAISE grants support transportation planning and capital projects that have a significant local or regional impact, particularly in underserved communities.This new federal grant is about increasing opportunity, connecting communities, and preparing for the future. It will help RIPTA advance a major part of the Rhode Island Transit Master Plan.All four members of the delegation voted to include $7.5 billion over five years for RAISE grants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that was signed into law last year by President Biden.Since 2010, Rhode Island has been awarded over $208 million in competitive RAISE/TIGER/BUILD grants.With this latest grant, RIPTA has now been awarded over $62 million in federal competitive grants since 2018 for capital investments, such as purchasing electric buses, rehabbing its maintenance facilities, and building new bus hubs.Chip Unruh, (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), 401-453-5294Matt Fidel (Langevin), (202) 631-1010Jennifer Bell (Cicilline), (202) 365-0827"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/fbi-director-confirms-agency-sent-tips-from-kavanaugh-tip-line-to-trump-white-house-without-investigation,"Washington, DC – In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today received confirmation from FBI Director Christopher Wray that the FBI sent tips that the agency had collected about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Trump White House without investigation.  The tips were collected through the FBI’s existing tip line as part of a supplemental background investigation after allegations of sexual misconduct emerged during Justice Kavanaugh’s 2018 confirmation process.  Wray also confirmed that the Trump White House directed which witnesses the FBI was permitted to interview.“You reviewed them for purposes of separating from tip line traffic but did not further investigate the ones that related to Kavanaugh, correct?” Whitehouse asked in reference to the more than 4,500 tips collected by the FBI.Director Wray responded, “Correct.”When asked by Whitehouse whether the FBI took direction from the Trump White House as to whom the FBI could question, Wray responded that the agency did take direction from the White House since it was the requesting entity.Following the exchange, Whitehouse posted to Twitter, “Here’s a thought:  nothing prevented Trump White House from using FBI tip line information to direct FBI investigation away from percipient or corroborating witnesses.”For years since Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation, Whitehouse has doggedly sought answers from the FBI about its treatment of information submitted through the tip line.  The FBI has provided delayed and incomplete information in response to the Senator’s oversight inquiries.  In today’s hearing, Whitehouse pledged to submit a report to the Judiciary Committee outlining the FBI’s handling of the tip line.  The FBI’s process for such investigations remains highly relevant because the Senate relies on the results of the FBI’s investigations to carry out its advice and consent duties for nominations.Watch the full questioning here.Whitehouse initially questioned Director Wray about the inadequate supplemental background investigation in a Judiciary Committee hearing in July 2019.  Whitehouse noted that the only conduit for information potentially relevant to the allegations was the tip line, the product of which was apparently never pursued by the Bureau.  During that hearing, Wray echoed Republican claims that the FBI conducted the investigation “by the book,” while asserting that supplemental background investigations are less rigorous than criminal and counterintelligence investigations.The following month, Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) and Whitehouse wrote to Wray asking for a complete picture of how the FBI handled the supplemental background investigation of Kavanaugh.  They asked why the FBI failed to contact witnesses whose names were provided to the FBI as possessing “highly relevant” information; how involved the Trump White House was in narrowing the scope of the investigation; whether the FBI had used a tip line in previous background investigations to manage incoming allegations and information regarding a nominee; and more.Nearly two years later and after repeated follow-up requests, the FBI finally responded to the Senators’ questions. The June 2021 letter from the FBI Office of Congressional Affairs revealed new information on the Kavanaugh investigation, including that the tip line received “over 4,500 tips, including phone calls and electronic submissions.”  By the FBI’s own account, it merely “provided all relevant tips” to Trump’s Office of White House Counsel, the very office that had constrained and directed the limited investigation.Last summer, Whitehouse and a number of colleagues wrote to Director Wray requesting additional information on the FBI’s supplemental background investigation of Justice Kavanaugh. “If the FBI was not authorized to or did not follow up on any of the tips that it received from the tip line, it is difficult to understand the point of having a tip line at all,” the Senators wrote at the time.Earlier this year, Whitehouse and his colleagues wrote again to Director Wray, Attorney General Garland, and the White House Counsel’s Office requesting answers to the Senators’ remaining outstanding questions, and providing an overview of what the Senators have learned to date.  The Senators have not yet received any responses.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-cheers-senate-passage-of-bipartisan-law-enforcement-de-escalation-training-act-,"Washington, DC – The U.S. Senate this week unanimously passed the bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act co-authored by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and John Cornyn (R-TX) to improve training for police officers who interact with individuals dealing with mental health, behavioral health, and substance use issues.  “Police officers serve on the frontlines in their communities, and we must ensure they have the training to handle situations involving complex mental and behavioral health issues safely and with compassion.  This robust training can boost public safety and prevent the kinds of encounters that too often lead to tragedy,” said Senator Whitehouse, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  “I’m grateful to Senator Cornyn for his partnership, and I urge the House to take up this important bill that will save lives in communities across the country.”“By providing funding for law enforcement agencies to train their officers in de-escalation tactics, this bill will give law enforcement better tools to support those experiencing mental health crises,” said Senator Cornyn.  “I applaud the Senate for moving this legislation forward and urge my colleagues in the House to do the same.”Underfunded and overworked mental and behavioral health systems often leave police to intervene with people who urgently need mental or behavioral health care.  But many police departments lack resources to train officers on how to deal with such situations, leading to encounters that are dangerous for everyone involved.The senators’ bill would help law enforcement personnel respond more effectively to people suffering mental or behavioral health crises, including using alternatives to force and de-escalation tactics and working with mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams.  It would empower police and the mental health professionals working with them to connect individuals to mental and behavioral health services in their community to create better public safety outcomes.  In addition to protecting officers and communities, these programs reduce arrests and prison time for people in need of mental or behavioral health treatment. The bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act:Last month, Whitehouse and U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) announced $1.2 million in federal funding to support Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for police departments across Rhode Island.  As part of the program expansion, Thundermist Health Center, in partnership with the Rhode Island Police Chief’s Association, will equip local police departments with the tools to divert people in crisis away from the justice system and connect them with the mental and behavioral health resources they need.  Thundermist will also help create workflows for 911 and local dispatchers to ensure CIT-trained officers and, if appropriate, an embedded police clinician are sent to calls on an as-needed basis.“A call to 911 is the often the first step toward treatment and recovery.  Law enforcement and first responders deserve the tools and training they need to safely and effectively de-escalate people experiencing a crisis,” said Liz Gledhill, Rhode Island statewide CIT coordinator and CIT-RI project manager at Thundermist Health Center.  “Without Senator Whitehouse’s unwavering leadership, we would not have a statewide Crisis Intervention Team program in Rhode Island.  As a result of this important work, thousands of Rhode Islanders who’ve encountered police during a crisis have avoided arrest.  People living with mental illness deserve access to high quality mental health care and with this legislation law enforcement can play a critical role in making sure these folks have access to treatment.”“Now more than ever, there is a demand for mental health treatment, crisis mitigation, and substance abuse recovery services in every community throughout the country.  We must be proactive in offering a wide variety of social services rather than respond after a tragic event or wait until a situation escalates that threatens the health and well-being of those who are affected.  Law enforcement officers are sworn to protect and serve and are often the first to interact with individuals who face mental illness, homelessness, and opioid addiction, among many societal challenges.  Increased awareness and training will allow Officers to better respond to and assist those who need our help.  We recognize that to be effective, we must leverage our partnerships with local mental health and social service providers and address challenges through collaboration and teamwork.  In the short time the Cranston Police Department Crisis Intervention Team has been in place, we have achieved great success thanks to our community outreach efforts with Gateway Mental Health and the Cranston Comprehensive Community Action Program.  We have connected many people with vital services while reducing the need for Officers to respond to repetitive calls at the same addresses,” said Colonel Michael J. Winquist, Chief of Police for the Cranston Police Department.  “I thank Senator Whitehouse for being at the forefront of recognizing the need for increased law enforcement training in responding to mental health issues, including forming Crisis Intervention Teams and creating partnerships between law enforcement and behavioral health experts.  The passage of this bipartisan legislation will have a tremendous impact on public safety.”Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Coons (D-DE), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and Jon Tester (D-MT) joined Whitehouse and Cornyn as cosponsors of the bill, which was first introduced in April.  The bill passed the Judiciary Committee by voice vote in May during Police Week.The bill is endorsed by the American Psychological Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Fraternal Order of Police, Major County Sheriffs of America, Major Cities Chiefs Association, National Criminal Justice Association, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD, National Association of Counties, American Counseling Association, National Register of Health Service Psychologists, American Association of Suicidology, College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists, American Association on Health and Disability, Lakeshore Foundation, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, National Association for Rural Mental Health, National Federation of Families, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, the Niskanen Center, Right on Crime, Prison Fellowship, Faith and Freedom, Peace Officers Research Association of California, National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, and National Latino Evangelical Coalition.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-illuminates-dark-money-networks-project-to-undermine-democracy,"Washington, DC – In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday on the intensifying harassment of election workers, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) shone a floodlight on the right-wing dark-money network seeking to undermine the future of democratic elections in the United States.“There is nothing about this, Mr. Chairman, that is random,” said Whitehouse.  “I hope that there will be investigations that are done, either civilly or otherwise, to connect these obvious dots: that there is a fraudulent lie, that it is deliberately propagated, that the propagation of that lie is intended to cause harassment and threats to election officials, which in turn is designed to cause vacancies in the legitimate election official ranks that can then be filled with election denier cohorts.”Whitehouse described how interconnected organizations in a dark-money network appear to be fraudulently sowing doubt about the integrity of elections in order to whip up anger towards honest, hardworking election officials.  The network employs many of the same associates of former President Trump who attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.  Across the country, many election officials have stepped down from their posts since the election due to harassment, leaving key vacancies that can be filled by extremist election deniers.Video of Whitehouse’s remarks is here and a full transcript is below. Thanks, Chairman.  Those of you who have election integrity responsibilities in your testimony that I related to Mr. Polite have made the case that there is a link between the large and fraudulent scheme to spread lies about the election, and the threats and harassment that you and your colleagues have experienced.  I think that’s a very important point that you made.  I want to highlight it, and I want to thank you for it.I also want to flag that this appears to be happening, not just at random – there seems to be organizational support for this.  I’ll bring up a group called the Conservative Partnership Institute that has been described as a “dark-money MAGA hub” and a “full-service shop for pro-Trump Republicans.”  This group is part of a network of, at this point it’s been determined, eleven other groups that all are closely associated with one another – sharing addresses, sharing staff, on each other’s incorporation papers, and also, it involves a lot of the refugees from the Trump election insurrection effort.So you have Jeffrey Clark at one of these groups, the Center for Preserving America.  As we all know, his role was bad enough that the FBI did a raid at his home to seize his electronics.  Kash Patel was at the Department of Defense, and we just know that on its way out, the Trump Defense Department wiped the phones of individuals who might have been texting about the January 6th insurrection effort.  You’ve got Mark Meadows, who participated in the pressuring of Georgia officials and has now ceased cooperation with the January 6 panel.You’ve got Stephen Miller, who likely wrote President Trump’s speech January 6th, inciting the mob to go to the Capitol and attack their nation’s Capitol.  And you have the lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who was on the phone with Trump for the Georgia call to the Secretary of State, where Trump pressured the Georgia Secretary of State to go out and find the right number of votes to flip the election.  And the likely coordination of that effort with Jeffrey Clark’s effort out of the Department of Justice is pretty obvious.So this is not happening in a vacuum.  In fact, it’s not even happening.  It’s being done.  The sooner we can draw attention to those who are doing it and why it’s being done, the better.In essence, this is a giant pea and shell game with a dozen shells that can be pushed out to engage with the media or to engage politically, but all, it would appear, commonly controlled.  All with funders who are kept secret, and all with murky relationships with one another and with the efforts to lead an insurrection against the popular vote in the last election.And where it comes to bear in this hearing is particularly with respect to Cleta Mitchell, and her Election Integrity Network.  Because if what we are seeing is a deliberate strategy of fraudulent lying, designed to whip up earnest and sincere popular antagonism – and by the way, if you're an American, and you think that your American democracy has been stolen from you, that is something to get mad about.  So if that’s the lie that you’re propagating, you’ve got a vulnerable population of people who don’t want to believe that that happened and who would be angry if you can convince them that that happened, and then you turn them loose on the election officials.And guess what?  If you can drive election officials out of their jobs, if you can drive election volunteers away from the polls, you then have vacancies.  Vacancies that Cleta Mitchell is training to fill right now to pursue the interference with American elections that the January 6th riot kicked off.There is nothing about this, Mr. Chairman, that is random.  I hope that there will be investigations that are done, either civilly or otherwise, to connect these obvious dots: that there is a fraudulent lie, that it is deliberately propagated, that the propagation of that lie is intended to cause harassment and threats to election officials, which in turn is designed to cause vacancies in the legitimate election official ranks that can then be filled with election denier cohorts.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-cheers-final-passage-of-bill-to-provide-va-care-for-veterans-exposed-to-toxins,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse today voted to pass the Honoring Our PACT Act, which will greatly expand eligibility for VA health care to veterans who have health problems due to exposure to toxins ranging from burn pits to Agent Orange.  The legislation passed with bipartisan support after being voted down by Senate Republicans last week.“The Honoring Our PACT Act will allow veterans in Rhode Island to breathe a sigh of relief,” said Whitehouse.  “We have a sacred commitment to treat our heroes with dignity and gratitude, and I will continue to do everything in my power to honor that.  Veterans’ health care should never be used as a bargaining chip, and I am glad Republicans have come around.”The PACT Act also extends VA healthcare for combat veterans to ten years after they separate from service, and adds new presumptive service-connected conditions eligible for compensation benefits.  The legislation equips the VA with significant resources to meet the new demands.Since 9/11, as many as 3.5 million veterans – including tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders – have been exposed to toxins in the line of duty.  Many have been denied VA benefits due to outdated rules and bureaucratic red tape.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-booker-blumenthal-schatz-hirono-introduce-term-limit-measure-to-restore-balance-fairness-to-supreme-court-,"Washington, DC – In an effort to restore balance and fairness to the nation’s highest court, U.S Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) today introduced the Supreme Court Tenure Establishment and Retirement Modernization (TERM) Act, which would establish term limits for Supreme Court justices while preserving constitutional protections for judicial independence in decision-making.  Under the TERM Act, a new justice would take the bench every two years and spend 18 years in active service.“Term limits need to be one part of the conversation about reforming the Supreme Court, which has been captured by big special interests,” said Senator Whitehouse, Chairman of Senate Judiciary Courts Subcommittee.  “Our legislation is a starting point for a national conversation about how best to fix a captive institution and make it more accountable to the people it is supposed to serve.”“The Supreme Court is facing a crisis of legitimacy.  This crisis is the result of radical rulings that discard years of legal precedent and that are at odds with the views of the American people, ethical lapses, and the politicization of the Supreme Court confirmation process by Senate Republicans intent on using raw political power to transform the Court,” said Senator Booker.  “The American people have lost confidence in our nation’s Highest Court and, in turn, our democracy.  Fundamental changes are urgently needed to restore trust in the institution.  Setting term limits would create predictability and lower the stakes of future confirmation proceedings, de-politicizing the Court.  I’m proud to partner with Senators Whitehouse, Blumenthal, Schatz, and Hirono to introduce this bill.”“Term limits will help restore credibility and trust to our nation’s highest court,” said Senator Blumenthal.  “Detached from the public and more politicized than ever, the Supreme Court will continue to face a crisis of legitimacy without fundamental reform.” The Supreme Court TERM Act would:Far-right special interests have spent decades building a secretive network to pack the federal courts with judges selected to greenlight donor-friendly policies, and to run multi-million-dollar ad campaigns to keep those confirmations on track.  One estimate by investigative journalists valued this operation to capture our judiciary at more than $580 million.The American people strongly sense that the Supreme Court needs to be reformed.  A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 67 percent of Americans support term limits for Supreme Court justices.Fix the Court executive director Gabe Roth said: “Ending life tenure at the Supreme Court might be the only thing that Senator Whitehouse and the co-founder of the Federalist Society agree on.  That alone would make the policy worth a second look, but when you consider that term limits would reduce the Court’s currently unchecked power and mean a more predictable confirmation process, and that it's already backed by the vast majority of the country, that makes it worthy of serious consideration.  I'm pleased to lend my support to the TERM Act, and I appreciate the Senators’ leadership in introducing the Senate's first-ever SCOTUS term limits bill.”America is alone among modern constitutional democracies in allowing its high-court justices to serve for decades without term or age limits, resulting in some Presidents appointing no justices and others appointing as much as a third of the Court.  Regularizing appointments every two years will ensure a Supreme Court that is more representative of the nation, reflecting the choices of recently elected Presidents and Senators.The Supreme Court TERM Act would build on the existing retirement system for Article III judges, which the Court has repeatedly upheld as constitutional.  The bill would also preserve judicial independence by ensuring that Supreme Court justices who assume senior status remain fully compensated members of the federal judiciary for life, capable of exercising official duties on and off the bench for as long as they choose.Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA-04) introduced the legislation last week in the House of Representatives.Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294Maya Krishna-Rogers (Booker), (301) 580-7614Maria McElwain (Blumenthal), (202) 224-6452"

Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with Representatives Steve Cohen (TN-09), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (IL-04), and Jamie Raskin (MD-08), today introduced the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act, which would provide consumers an enforceable right to a full cash refund for flight and ticket cancellations. The bill codifies the Department of Transportation rule requiring major airlines to offer consumers a cash refund if the airline cancels or significantly delays a flight, and provides consumers a new right to a cash refund if they cancel their ticket up until 48 hours of the flight’s scheduled departure.The lawmakers are introducing the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act amid months of nightmarish air travel issues and the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few months, flight cancellations and delays have skyrocketed, far exceeding the number before the pandemic and leading to an avalanche of consumer complaints. While federal law requires airlines to provide cash refunds when they cancel a flight, most airlines only offer to rebook passengers or provide a voucher as the default option instead, forcing customers to jump through hoops to claim their rightful refund. At the same time, with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, consumer travel plans continue to be unpredictable. In this age of increased travel uncertainty, passengers should not be forced to choose between their money and their health. The Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act corrects this problem by giving consumers an enforceable right to a cash refund for flights cancelled by the airline or tickets cancelled by the passenger.“Enough is enough: Travelers are sick of wasting their valuable time fighting the airlines to receive their legally-required cash refunds,” said Senator Markey. “And they are tired of making flight reservations months in advance, only to face a health scare that forces them to choose between cancelling a nonrefundable flight, or traveling and risking the health of their fellow passengers. Just as hotels often allow consumers to cancel their reservation and receive a full refund, the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act would extend a similar requirement for air travel. These airlines must get their heads out of the clouds and deliver the effective and accountable service that travelers deserve.”“This bill is a common-sense step to lighten the burden on air passengers who have faced particularly stressful travel conditions since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Whitehouse. “It’s bad enough to miss out on vacation time when your flight gets cancelled or an emergency pops up. You shouldn’t also have to fight tooth and nail with an airline for your legally required cash refund.” “Flight cancellations are happening all too frequently,” said Rep. Cohen. “My flight was canceled just last week. The flying public does not expect or want to get credits when the airlines are the cause of the cancellation, especially when they already benefited from a multibillion-dollar bailout from American taxpayers. Our bill remedies this situation and restores some needed consumer protections for air travelers.”   “This measure will put money back into the pockets of consumers suffering from airline travel chaos,” said Senator Blumenthal. “Faced with record delays and cancellations, travelers deserve their money back in cash—not airline vouchers—when their plans are unexpectedly upended. By requiring full cash refunds, our legislation is an important first-step towards airline accountability and restoring reliability and fairness to Americans’ air travel experiences.”“It’s time to hold the airlines accountable, because travelers shouldn’t pay the price for flight delays and cancellations. Customers should be able to receive cash refunds instead of company credit or miles they may not be able to use, and this bill is about ensuring they get what they are owed without spending hours in line or on the phone,” said Congressman García. “ As travelers face increasing uncertainty at the airport, this bill will add much needed accountability for airlines and peace of mind for customers.”“After receiving a historic pandemic bailout in 2020, the airline industry has repaid a lot of consumers and taxpayers with ruined vacation plans and demeaning customer service standards,” said Rep. Raskin. “I’m thankful to my colleagues in both the House and the Senate for joining me to introduce this much-needed legislation to guarantee that consumers can receive a cash refund for flight cancellations or delays. Our bill also provides new flexibilities to travelers by guaranteeing them a cash refund for any flights they choose to cancel, within two days of departure. We need to restore efficiency, civility and decency to interstate travel, and the airline industry should strive to provide effective, reliable service to the American people. This legislation is a crucial step in ensuring that airlines hold up their end of the bargain.”   A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.Specifically, the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act would:The following House members also co-sponsored the Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act: André Carson (IN-07), Bobby Rush (IL-01), Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC), Henry C.

Lynch (MA-08), Tim Ryan (OH-13).The Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act is endorsed by the American Economic Liberties Project, the Consumer Federation of America, and the National Consumers League.“For more than two years now, the US airline industry has been sitting on more than $10 billion in unpaid flight refunds to consumers who were unable to fly during Covid-19,” said William J. McGee, Senior Fellow for Aviation at the American Economic Liberties Project. “We applaud Sen. Markey and Rep. Cohen for fighting for the millions of air travelers who have been inconvenienced while their hard-earned money earns interest for the airlines. The Cash Refunds for Flight Cancellations Act will ensure that an industry that has failed to respond to the needs of their customers while generating record numbers of consumer complaints with the DOT will be forced to provide refunds—and in cash, not in vouchers that are likely to expire. This has become even more critical in 2022, as industry meltdowns have led to operational chaos with tens of thousands of lengthy flight delays and cancellations.”“CFA supports Senator Markey’s dedication to strengthening consumer protections in the air travel marketplace,” said Erin E. Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America. “His bill presents a straightforward resolution to the time-consuming and costly problems that consumers face when airlines cancel flights. Congress needs to act quickly and decisively to provide consumers with some protections from the airline industry, and this proposed legislation is a solid step in that direction.”“This summer’s air travel meltdown has left far too many consumers stranded and frustrated,” said John Breyault, Vice President of Public Policy, Telecommunications, and Fraud at the National Consumers League. “This bill gives power back to the flying public, allowing them to obtain cash refunds when carriers fail to deliver the service they promised or when plans change and vacations have to be delayed or canceled.” "
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/reed-and-whitehouse-visit-pace-ri-to-celebrate-300000-earmark_discuss-efforts-to-support-ri-seniors,"EAST PROVIDENCE – Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse visited PACE Rhode Island’s flagship center in East Providence to meet with seniors and joined East Providence Mayor Roberto DaSilva and officials from PACE-RI to celebrate a $300,000 earmark that the Senators included in the Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations law to help renovate and equip PACE-RI’s new health clinic and adult day care center.PACE-RI is a non-profit health plan that helps nursing-home-eligible older individuals with complex medical needs maintain a more independent life at home in the community while also accessing needed services. Last year PACE-RI opened its adult day center with state-of-the-art clinical facilities and expanded rehabilitation services and amenities at 10 Tripps Lane.  The building includes a commercial kitchen for PACE-RI to provide healthy meals tailored to its diverse participant population.“PACE-RI offers a range of coordinated, integrated services.  But what it really does is simple: It increases independence for seniors and builds community and connection for them while improving wellness and health outcomes.  It also provides good value for taxpayers because it reduces the need for emergency health costs, lengthy hospital stays, and nursing home care.  So this is a smart investment in our seniors, the community, and in ensuring this facility has the right infrastructure, equipment, and amenities to serve participants,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.“PACE’s new center provides a safe, welcoming place for seniors to spend their days, allowing them to continue to live independently and with dignity at home,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “Senator Reed and I were pleased to deliver $300,000 to support the completion of this facility.  When we head back to Washington this week, we’re going to be doing even more for Rhode Island seniors – voting to finally lower prescription drug prices.”“We purchased and completely renovated an older building to meet the needs of the growing number of elders we serve,” said Joan Kwiatkowski, CEO for PACE-RI. “Unfortunately, the winter showed us our existing roof was more porous than anticipated.

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/reed-and-whitehouse-urge-biden-to-continue-pause-on-student-loan-payments,"Providence, RI – Ahead of the federal student loan payment pause set to expire at the end of next month, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse have joined a bicameral group colleagues in the Senate and House in urging the Biden Administration to extend the student loan payment pause beyond August 31, 2022.  This effort comes on the heels of several news reports that the Biden Administration has not made a final decision about whether to extend the student loan payment pause – a decision that will affect more than 100,000 student loan borrowers in Rhode Island.“For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.,” wrote more than 100 lawmakers to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.  “For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.”Reed and Whitehouse emphasized how resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide.“Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs.  Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.  We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels,” the lawmakers added.  “Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.”The lawmakers concluded by pointing out how resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway at the U.S. Department of Education.  All federal student loan borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department of Education or their federal student loan servicer.Find a copy of the letter here and below.Dear President Biden and Secretary Cardona,In roughly 35 days, on September 1, 2022, tens of millions of federal student loan borrowers are scheduled to resume payments. Despite repeated reports and surveys concerning whether borrowers will be able to pay,1 we understand the Administration is considering restarting student loan payments at the end of August.2 We write today to urge you to extend the pause on student loan payments, given the numerous economic issues facing borrowers across the nation, as well as administrative actions in process by the Department of Education.For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.3 For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.4Resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their federal student loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide. Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs.5 Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.6 We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels.7 Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.8Moreover, resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway or contemplated by the Department—which could contribute to unnecessary confusion for borrowers in the upcoming months. Currently, many borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department or their federal student loan servicer—either through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver or through the one-time account adjustments announced by Ed on April 19, 2022 that would count past periods of forbearance or deferment.9Accordingly, we ask that the Administration continue to keep federal student loan payments paused.###Chip Unruh (Reed), (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/reed-and-whitehouse-cheer-senate-passage-of-bipartisan-water-resources-bill,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse applauded the passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022, which authorizes improvements to our nation’s harbors and waterways, invests in coastal resiliency efforts, and supports U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects nationwide.  The Senate cleared the bill by a vote of 92 to 2.  Reed and Whitehouse secured several key provisions benefitting Rhode Island in the comprehensive bill, which now heads to conference with the House version of the bill.“From protecting against flooding and coastal storms to maintaining our ports and shipping channels, the Army Corps plays an important role in protecting communities and keeping our economy running.  This bill will help the federal government make smart investments to modernize our water infrastructure, protect the environment, and support local resiliency projects and initiatives.  I urge the House and Senate negotiators to complete work on this bipartisan bill as quickly as possible,” said Senator Reed, who serves on the Appropriations Committee.“Today’s bipartisan passage of WRDA has some big wins for Rhode Island.  U.S. Army Corps investments can go a long way toward protecting coastal economies from climate change, but, for years, the Corps has been unable to explain why its funding for coastal projects has been significantly lower than for inland projects.  I was glad to see our provision mandating a report on this discrepancy included in the bill, alongside a host of other provisions that will strengthen the environment and boost the economy of our Ocean State,” said Whitehouse, who helped draft the bill as a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Senators Reed and Whitehouse secured inclusion of a provision that would improve fish passage and habitat restoration on the Lower Blackstone River.  Since the 1800s, the Blackstone has been closed off to shad, herring, Atlantic salmon, and other fish that spend most of their lives in the sea but must migrate to fresh water to spawn.  The return of these species would bring substantial ecological and economic benefits for the River.Reed and Whitehouse also included a provision mandating a report from the Government Accountability Office on the disparity between coastal and inland U.S. Army Corps projects.  For years, Whitehouse has called out the disproportionate gap in funding, noting in a 2019 letter that the Corps has spent between 19 and 120 times more on inland versus coastal funding.  In light of the sea level rise caused by climate change, the senators’ provision would call attention to the funding gap that impedes coastal resiliency efforts in the Ocean State.  The bill also contains a new Reed-Whitehouse supported provision that would amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to create a nationwide inventory of low-head dams, which can be a safety hazard for kayakers and swimmers.The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 also:Congress first enacted the Water Resources Development Act in 1974 to establish and improve water-related programs and authorize the Army Corps to assist with flood protection, ecosystem restoration, and navigation to facilitate the flow of commerce in U.S. waterways.  By law, the statute must be periodically renewed by Congress.###Chip Unruh (Reed), (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-cortez-masto-propose-congressional-check-on-supreme-court-decisions,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) today unveiled the Supreme Court Review Act, a new bill to revitalize Congress’s ability to legislate in response to Supreme Court decisions that interpret federal statutes or roll back constitutional rights.  The Senators’ bill would help ensure that the constitutionally delegated power to make policy remains with Congress, not the Court, by creating streamlined procedures through which Congress can exercise its existing power to amend statutes or create federal statutory rights.“Six radical justices enacted a bonanza of right-wing policies during the last term, reshaping American life in wildly unpopular ways over just a matter of days.  The American people are fed up with policymaking by unaccountable Supreme Court justices, and we have a solution,” said Whitehouse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Courts Subcommittee.  “This important good-government reform would check the activist Court’s rogue decisions by ensuring policymaking stays where the Constitution delegated it: in the hands of the American people and their elected representatives.”“I’ve always said that the most important quality in a Supreme Court Justice is their ability to understand the impact their decisions will have on everyday Americans.  In the face of an increasingly extreme Supreme Court, the American people deserve accountability and responsiveness from all three branches of government,” said Cortez Masto.  “This bill would allow Congress to more efficiently exercise its existing power to respond when the Court misinterprets Congressional intent or strips Americans of fundamental rights.”The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).  Congressman Hank Johnson (D-GA), Chairman of the House Judiciary Courts Subcommittee, is leading the introduction of the bill in the House.  The bill is supported by People for the American Way, Public Citizen, the Project on Government Oversight, the Niskanen Center, Common Cause, Fix the Court, the Center for Biological Diversity, and Evergreen Action.Congress has similar processes for expeditiously considering other important matters, including by responding to “major” agency rules under the Congressional Review Act.  The bill would apply that same framework to Supreme Court decisions.  This bill:“People For the American Way strongly supports the Supreme Court Review Act of 2022,” said Ben Jealous, president of People For the American Way.  “When fundamental constitutional or statutory rights are erroneously or deliberately stripped away by Supreme Court rulings, Congress has the authority and the responsibility to legislate to protect those rights.  And right now, we have a Supreme Court driven by a partisan political agenda that has set its sights on overturning numerous longstanding rights and freedoms.  The Court has already overturned the right to abortion, and we know that contraception, marriage equality and same-sex intimate relationships are on the chopping block next.  This legislation meets the urgency of this moment by providing a clear path for Congress to act quickly when the law, the Constitution and the people’s rights must be upheld.”“The Supreme Court Review Act of 2022 is an important step towards limiting damage from Supreme Court rulings revoking constitutional rights and curtailing federal authority to protect health and safety, such as we have seen recently in Dobbs and West Virginia,” said Jenn Danis, senior attorney at the Niskanen Center.“Without serious reforms, the Supreme Court’s disastrous decision in West Virginia v. EPA will be just the first smash of the wrecking ball to all of our environmental laws,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.  “The conservatives on the court have stacked the deck completely on the side of powerful corporations and polluters.  It is critical that these ideologues are reined in and Senator Whitehouse’s legislation would do just that.”Gabe Roth, executive director of nonpartisan judicial watchdog group Fix the Court, said: “There’s no question that in recent years the Supreme Court has become the nation’s most powerful, least accountable institution — one that our founders would barely recognize.  So it’s critical that the people, through our representatives in Congress, find creative, constitutional ways to reclaim that power.  That’s why I support Sens. Whitehouse and Cortez Masto’s Supreme Court Review Act, which would eliminate a host of unwieldy and redundant legislative processes to help lawmakers respond promptly when nine lawyers on First Street unduly set national policy.”“The Supreme Court Review Act would provide an important procedural path for Congress to fulfill its responsibilities as a co-equal branch of government.  It would allow Congress to respond in a timely way to Supreme Court decisions that affect our constitutional rights and statutory law.  This most recent Supreme Court term demonstrated just how much is at stake, including its decisions to overturn Roe v. Wade and limit the EPA’s authority to respond to the existential threat of climate change.  We commend Senators Whitehouse, Cortez Masto, and Representative Hank Johnson for proposing this legislation, because if enacted, it will mark an important step toward responsive government,” said Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause.Revitalizing our system of check and balances is essential to restoring Americans’ faith in government.  A Gallup poll taken in late June – before the Court overturned Roe v. Wade, curtailed the EPA’s ability to fight climate change, and threw out centuries-old gun safety regulations – found that only 25 percent of Americans had a “great deal of confidence” in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court Review Act would help restore the American people’s trust in government by improving Congress’s ability to check harmful and unpopular Supreme Court decisions.The Supreme Court Review Act would add to a growing number of good-government reform bills introduced by Whitehouse to restore Americans’ trust in government.  The Senator’s DISCLOSE Act, which received a hearing before the Senate Rules Committee last week, would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors, allowing the American people to see who is attempting to sway their elections and gain control over their government.  His Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act would promote accountability and increases transparency in the federal judiciary by addressing lax recusal standards for judges, weak disclosure rules for special interests filing documents with the courts, poor reporting of travel and hospitality for judges, and the absence of a code of ethics for the Supreme Court.Full text of the bill is available here and a summary of the bill is here.  Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294Lauren Wodarski (Cortez Masto), (202) 821-6169"

RettigCommissionerInternal Revenue Service1111 Constitution Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20224Dear Commissioner Rettig,We write to express our concern about the unprocessed tax return backlog, ongoing customer service challenges, and the effect of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) budget constraints on the agency’s ability to serve taxpayers.  While the vast majority of taxpayers, who were able to file electronically, received the refunds they were owed,[1] delayed refunds can pose a significant hardship for the millions caught in the backlog.   The Treasury Department warned in January that the IRS would face “enormous challenges” this tax-filing season and that it would be a “frustrating” time for taxpayers.[2]  The reasons for these challenges are well-known.  Budget cuts that have shrunk the agency’s funding by 20 percent since 2010.[3]  In turn, overall staffing declined by 17 percent over the same period and customer service representatives, in particular, by more than 25 percent.[4]  Meanwhile, the number of individual tax filers has grown by 19 percent.[5] COVID-19 exacerbated these existing challenges.  The IRS temporarily shut down its facilities to protect the health and safety of IRS employees, slowing tax return processing.  Simultaneously, Congressional actions to provide financial relief to American families and businesses placed new demands on the IRS.[6]  These combined challenges have led to a tax return backlog, which affects millions of Americans and small businesses.In March 2022, the IRS announced a plan to tackle the tax return backlog.[7]  The plan included hiring 10,000 new IRS employees, creating a 700-person surge team to process returns, requiring mandatory paid overtime for employees processing returns, and pursuing additional support from contractors to speed IRS operations.  The plan also included proactive taxpayer outreach to improve tax return accuracy and expanded in-person and online taxpayer assistance throughout the filing season. You reported in March that the IRS was well-positioned to begin 2023 with near-normal inventory levels.  To support these efforts, Congress provided the IRS with $12.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2022, an increase of $675 million over 2021, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022.  This legislation also provided the IRS with new hiring authorities to help the agency scale staffing to meet these urgent challenges.  We know that these limited resources, for just FY 2022, are not sufficient for the agency to provide taxpayers the service they deserve.  We remain committed to working to secure stable, multi-year funding for the IRS going forward to support the critical work that you do on behalf of American taxpayers. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the IRS’s resource constraints, the National Taxpayer Advocate’s recent Objectives Report to Congress, found that millions of taxpayers continue experiencing lengthy refund delays and IRS customer service challenges.  The report found that at the end of May 2022, “the IRS had a larger backlog of paper tax returns than it did a year ago,” and the pace of processing paper tax returns was “slowing.”[8] The report also highlights ongoing customer service challenges.  For instance, the agency’s incoming call volume decreased by more than half compared to last filing season, but  just ten percent of calls were answered – up only one percent from last year.  Additionally, customer service wait times increased over the past year from 20 to 29 minutes.[9]  We have heard concerns from our constituents about how these processing delays affect their families and small businesses.  As the National Taxpayer Advocate notes, many of these issues “snowball,” further exacerbating inventory issues and processing delays.  When taxpayers are required to send additional correspondence, whether to fix errors or verify their identity, it must usually be by mail, leading to additional refund delays and a larger backlog.Given the National Taxpayer Advocate’s findings, we write to check on the status of IRS efforts to address the paper tax return backlog and improve taxpayer services, and to inquire how additional funding could avoid these problems in the future.  We request written answers to the following questions by August 5, 2022:We are grateful for the IRS’s continued efforts to address the tax return backlog and for providing Americans with timely financial assistance during this unprecedented time.  We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure the IRS has the necessary resources and authorities to ensure taxpayers receive the service they deserve.We appreciate your attention to this matter. Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/before-rules-committee-whitehouse-calls-for-passage-of-disclose-act-to-fight-tsunami-of-unlimited-anonymous-money-in-politics-,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse today delivered testimony in the Senate Rules Committee calling for passage of the DISCLOSE Act to combat the flood of anonymous special interest spending corrupting American politics and to restore power to regular citizens.“I submit to you that the distress in our Republic has much to do with corrupting political influence acquired via unlimited anonymous dark money.  That dark-money influence has created a disconnect between what Americans want their government to do and what it actually does,” said Whitehouse.Citizens United and subsequent Supreme Court rulings permit super PACs and certain types of tax-exempt groups, such as 501(c)(4) nonprofits, to spend unlimited sums in elections.  Many of those groups are not required to disclose their donors, allowing wealthy corporations and individuals to spend unlimited, undisclosed – or “dark” – money without being tied to the television attack ads and other electioneering activity the groups carry out.  Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, spending by corporations, ultra-rich ideologues, and secretive front groups has exploded.  Dark money in particular has skyrocketed, even though the Supreme Court has long upheld disclosure requirements as a means for citizens and shareholders to hold elected officials and corporate spenders accountable—including by an 8 to 1 margin in Citizens United itself.The DISCLOSE Act requires organizations spending money in elections – including super PACs and 501(c)(4) dark money groups – to promptly disclose donors who have given $10,000 or more during an election cycle.  In addition to election disclosure requirements, the bill requires groups that spend money on ads supporting or opposing judicial nominees to disclose their donors.“If we get rid of the damned stuff, this horrible decade of dark-money corruption can come to an end, and Congress can begin to serve America again,” concluded Whitehouse.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) first introduced the DISCLOSE Act in the wake of Citizens United in 2010, and Whitehouse has introduced the legislation in every subsequent Congress.  Majority Leader Schumer also spoke in support of the DISLCOSE Act in today’s hearing.“So why are we here today? Because across our democracy the disease of dark money has spread unchecked like a cancer,” Schumer said before the Committee.  “Today I’m proud to join with my colleagues to support the DISCLOSE Act, which I’ve long championed and I’ve promised to bring on the floor for a vote.  In free and fair elections – one person, one vote – American voters alone should have the power to determine our nation’s leaders, without fear that their voices will be drowned out by powerful elites or special interests.”Below is the text of Whitehouse’s as-delivered testimony.  Watch the full clip here. Thank you Chair Klobuchar and Ranking Member Hagerty for inviting me to testify on the DISCLOSE Act. Twelve years after Citizens United, Americans know something is deeply amiss in our democracy.  Huge majorities see America headed in the wrong direction.  Fifty-eight percent of voters say our government needs major reforms or a complete overhaul.  Only 25 percent of Americans say they have confidence in the Supreme Court.  They see government actually erasing rights on which generations of Americans relied.Is all of this some weird collective phase we’re going through, or are the people actually right that something is wrong?I submit to you that the distress in our Republic has much to do with corrupting political influence acquired via unlimited anonymous dark money.  That dark-money influence has created a disconnect between what Americans want their government to do and what it actually does.Dark money by design can be impossible to trace.  But people instinctively know it when their voices are being drowned out and big corporations always seem to come out on top.  They can tell when the ad on their television was put up by some fake front group they’ve never heard of.Floods of dark money caused this mess, so we can fix it.  The DISCLOSE Act, first introduced by Leader Schumer in 2010 and reintroduced by me in every Congress since, will fix this. Even the Citizens United justices recognized that unlimited political spending without transparency would be corrupting.  That they got right:  we’ve seen a tsunami of slime distort our politics and corrode our democracy since.  What the justices got wrong — indisputably, factually wrong — is their unlimited-money tsunami being either transparent or independent. The wreckage from the dark-money aftermath of Citizens United is staggering. Dark money political spending went from under $5 million in 2006 to more than $1 billion in 2020.  Megadonors and special interests had a bonanza.  Billionaire political spending increased by a factor of 70, from $17 million for the 2008 election to $1.2 billion for 2020.  In 2018, super PACs and other dark-money groups collectively outspent even candidates’ own campaigns in 16 federal races. If you think things are different – well, they are.  Academic studies found that economic elites and business interests have huge influence on government policy, while average citizens have little or none.  Whatever the American people want, the big donor interests now win nearly every time.  Look at climate change.  Before Citizens United, there was a steady heartbeat in the Senate of bipartisan climate bills.  John McCain ran for President with a solid climate platform.  With Citizens United, that heartbeat flatlined.  The fossil fuel industry used its unlimited dark-money weaponry to stamp out bipartisanship, creating a lost decade of legislative failure, for which I fear we will pay very dearly.Far-right special interests even turned their dark-money guns on the federal judiciary.  They funded a $580 million secretive network to pack the courts with judges selected to greenlight donor-friendly policies, and to run multi-million-dollar ad campaigns to keep those confirmations on track.  This network involves dozens of front groups, some of which are mere “fictitious names” for other secretive front groups. Now, we have a Court gone wild.  In a matter of days, the newly-radicalized Court overturned Roe v. Wade, manufactured new polluter-friendly legal doctrines, and threw out centuries-old gun safety regulations—all of it wildly unpopular with most people. Dark-money groups funded and organized the rally before the January 6 attack on the Capitol, and perpetuate the Big Lie today.  Bad enough.  But behind and beside the Trump mob’s violent insurrection attempt, has run a slow-motion coup d’etat by secretive special interests surreptitiously, incrementally, taking over government power.  Madame Chair, left to fester, dark money will rot the very foundation of our Republic.  Remember, justices who signed off on Citizens United conceded dark money was corrupting.  That part was 8-1.We need to pass the DISCLOSE Act so citizens can see who is spending the big money in politics — donors who spend over $10,000.  Even foreign enemies can now try to corrupt us through dark money channels — after all, secret is secret.And by the way, the American people love this idea.  Poll after poll shows Americans overwhelmingly, by margins of 85 to 90 percent, want this.  Even Republicans criticize dark money.  Well, Republicans should have a chance to join us in ending it.  If we get rid of the damned stuff, this horrible decade of dark-money corruption can come to an end, and Congress can begin to serve America again. Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

thanking Chair Durbin for his invaluable support for today’s hearing on how we can use asset forfeiture of Russian oligarchs’ assets to aid Ukraine, and for his efforts to hold Russia accountable for its crimes against Ukraine and humanity.  Thank you also to Ranking Member Grassley for your leadership and efforts to root out corruption, fraud, and abuse at home and abroad.  And I’ve been honored to work with Senator Graham and Senator Bennet on this draft bill that we’re working on.  So, Lindsey in particular, thank you for your tireless efforts and insights.  A lot of this began during CODEL

economy that enables international corruption is a national security threat to the United States of America.  From drug trafficking to the arms trade to terrorism, the international dark economy supports it all.Vladimir Putin’s brutal, unjustified, and illegal invasion of Ukraine launched a campaign of destruction, subjecting civilians in once-vibrant cities to hellish shelling and war crimes like rape and extrajudicial killing.Democracies across the world are answering Ukraine’s call for aid.  Arms are pouring into the country to help Ukraine force out the invaders, and later rebuild.  Congress has passed over $50 billion in defense assistance and humanitarian aid.  But in this era of hybrid threats – where state and non-state actors merge, and enemies deploy armies of lawyers and shell companies in addition to guns and bombs – traditional tools of deterrence are no longer enough. Key to this deterrence effort is sanctions to punish those who give aid and comfort to the Putin regime.Russia’s policies are inextricably linked to the interests of its corrupt billionaire oligarchs.  Vladimir Putin – much like a mob boss – props up these criminals in exchange for support and

international partners have created new, agile task forces to target corrupt oligarchs.    One of those bodies, Task Force KleptoCapture, is run by veteran organized-crime prosecutor Andrew Adams,

enough to allow us to respond effectively to the crisis in Ukraine.  For instance, we have no dedicated mechanism to transfer the proceeds of seized oligarch assets to the Ukrainian people.  Administrative forfeiture is limited to assets valued at $500,000 or less.  Sanctions authorities like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act allow the government only to freeze, and not seize, assets unless the U.S. is engaged in armed conflict.So we’re working on a  bipartisan basis to grant the Justice Department needed in rem administrative forfeiture authorities, and the ability to transfer assets into a Ukrainian Relief Fund, all within a sound constitutional and legal framework. As a former U.S. Attorney, I get that due process protections are important but they exist on a spectrum – on one end, foreign enemy combatants during wartime have few rights, and on the other end, American criminal defendants in U.S. courts have robust rights.  Our framework lands in a responsible place between the two, putting the onus on criminal foreign oligarchs to show up in court to challenge administrative forfeitures, but providing innocent owners a defense and due process protections that the Supreme Court has long held pass muster even in purely domestic applications.  And it sunsets after three years, to provide a trial period.I am proud of this bill and I hope we can see it through to provide our government the tools it needs to go after oligarchs’ ill-gotten assets and use the proceeds to help the Ukrainian people."

March, the Biden administration released a proposal to boost the federal government’s authority to hold Vladimir Putin, the Russian government, and Russian oligarchs accountable for the unprovoked war

forfeiture authority for the seizure of ill-gotten oligarch assets and the ability to use proceeds from the sale of those assets to help Ukraine.[WATCH: Whitehouse questions Task Force KleptoCapture

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/the-scheme-16_-the-hothouse-and-west-virginia-v-epa-pt-2,"Mdm. President, I rise today now for the 16th time to call out the dark-money Scheme to capture and control our Supreme Court.  The last time I rose to shine a light on this Scheme, I sounded a warning about a case then pending at the Supreme Court called West Virginia v. EPA.  I discussed how The Court That Dark Money Built was primed to smash through precedent and weaponize fringe legal theories to deliver for the Scheme’s big donors.I am sorry, but not surprised, to report that the Supreme Court’s Federalist Society Six did exactly what the polluters asked.  Not only did the Court deliver for polluters, it delivered big.Before we dive into that, let’s recap what we knew going into this case.  First, the case never should’ve made it this far in the first place.  A handful of Republican states with fossil fuel funded attorneys general, and an armada of right-wing front groups propped up by dark money from the fossil fuel industry, asked the Supreme Court to strike down an EPA rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants.  The problem was:  that rule no longer existed.  So, there wasn’t actually an operating EPA rule to challenge, meaning there was no constitutional “case or controversy,” and no reason for a legitimate Court to entertain the industry’s invitation.But this is The Court That Dark Money Built, and it wasn’t going to let this constitutional guardrail stand in its way to pleasing the big donors who packed the Court.Supreme Court precedent had repeatedly rejected the polluters’ arguments outright.  The polluters argued that Congress, not the EPA and the so-called “administrative state,” needed to do the regulating here.  But it’s a matter of common sense that Congress delegates authorities to the EPA.  And It’s also well known that polluters want to knock questions away from expert regulators and to Congress, where their dark money political power — also a creature of The Court That Dark Money Built — can be brought to bear to buy delay and obstruction. The power of Congress to legislate broadly and let agency experts fill in the gaps has been upheld for decades, against persistent attacks from regulated industries.  Well, no more.No matters of law or fact changed since the last time similar questions came before the Court.  The thing that changed is who is on the Court:  a majority selected by polluters using hundreds of millions in dark money.Which brings us to the decision itself.  There’s good news, and there’s very, very bad news.The good news is that the Court’s ruling is actually very narrow as to EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases in the power sector. It’s limited to deliberate generation-shifting.  So, there is lots left to work with and EPA needs to pull up its socks and get to work on regulating carbon emissions and other forms of air pollution.  So far, in eighteen months of the Biden administration, EPA has managed to produce one carbon emissions regulation, and not a very strong one at that.  EPA needs to move now as fast as possible.  There is not a second to waste.The bad news, however, is grim.   The Federalist Society justices loaded up their opinions with polluter talking points and hothouse-grown polluter legal doctrines, paving the way for polluters to block or delay regulations for years to come.Start with the polluter talking points, rife throughout Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence, which spends twenty pages decrying the dangers of government regulation. He calls regulators a “ruling class of largely unaccountable ‘ministers.’”   That is not even remotely true.  If there’s an unaccountable ruling class in America right now, it’s The Court That Dark Money Built, and the dark money forces behind it.  Compare that to EPA:   EPA leadership is selected by the president, approved by the Senate, and can be fired at will should they deviate from the elected president’s priorities.  They are all directly accountable.  And the White House’s Office of Management and Budget also reviews every EPA regulation to make sure it’s consistent with the president’s agenda.Congress retains complete control of the EPA’s funding, and has entire committees dedicated to oversight.  It’s Congress that provided EPA with its instructions, through laws like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.  Congress also created the Administrative Procedure Act, to assure that agencies like EPA carry out their duties fairly, according to the facts, according to proper procedure, and under rigorous judicial supervision; and passed the Congressional Review Act, so Congress is able swiftly undo any rules it doesn’t like.In actuality, in the real world, there is direct accountability and oversight over EPA by all three branches – all three branches -- over this supposedly unaccountable “ruling class.”  By comparison, Justice Gorsuch and his colleagues wield their unaccountable power without even the bare minimum of an enforceable ethics code. This argument by Justice Gorsuch may not be founded in fact, but it has a foundation.  The idea that the biggest threat to freedom is an “administrative state” full of unaccountable bureaucrats is a longstanding talking point of the fossil fuel industry, constantly trotted out by Republican politicians and fossil fuel front groups.  Here’s just a taste of what I mean:The Heritage Foundation, a key fossil fuel front group:  “[T]he administrative state’s functionaries are powerful . . . .  They are unelected, unknown, and, for all practical purposes often unaccountable.”  Sound familiar?Here’s the Minority Leader, responding to a speech by a Republican senator decrying “unelected bureaucrats”:  the Minority Leader called this “the single biggest problem confronting our country . . . the single biggest thing holding this country back from reaching its potential.”  And in the wake of this very decision, he went to their go-to talking point, “unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.”  It just is not true. The foundation of Gorsuch’s screed is not fact, it’s political fossil fuel talking points.  And we should not be surprised that those talking points made their way into an opinion by a Supreme Court justice — that is exactly what The Court That Dark Money Built was built for.Aside from the talking points are legal doctrines hatched in polluter-funded hothouse doctrine factories, a web of phony think tanks, Scheme-friendly “scholars,” and conservative conferences designed to cultivate and legitimize fringe legal theories -- reverse engineered to produce the results polluter wants. One is the so-called “major questions” doctrine, which, guess what, makes its maiden appearance in West Virginia v. EPA.Let’s look at how the “major questions” doctrine traveled from the doctrine factory into a Supreme Court decision. The Trump administration, fully in tow to the fossil fuel industry, took this rare specimen of legal theory and pumped it up into a powerful weapon against the functioning of the federal government.  From Day One, Trump’s top advisor Steve Bannon vowed that the Trump administration would carry out the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”  Trump’s White House Counsel Don McGahn—the same Don McGahn who oversaw the confirmation of the Scheme’s handpicked justices—admitted this, I’m quoting him here  “the judicial selection and the deregulation effort are really the flip side of the same coin.”  Think about that, in his words, the Trump White House had a “larger plan” to wipe out government regulations using judges.For four years, Trump lawyers argued in court for this “major questions” doctrine, previously unmentioned in any Supreme Court decision.  The Trump team urged courts to deploy the doctrine to strike down agency laws—including in this case, West Virginia v. EPA.  Now, while the Court had never mentioned the doctrine, it had been mentioned. Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit did, while he was  auditioning himself for a seat on the Supreme Court, to catch the eye of Scheme donors, and to telegraph to them how eager he would be to do their bidding.  Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in a case about “net neutrality,” a case with many of the Scheme’s dark-money front groups — Cato, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Pacific Legal Foundation — present as amici.  They were the right audience for Kavanaugh’s “major questions” audition tape, and he aimed to please.And the payday for Scheme donors came in West Virginia v. EPA. At least fourteen polluter front-group amici showed up to push in chorus for their “major questions” doctrine — the usual suspects, funded by fossil fuel dark money, like Cato, the Koch flagship Americans for Prosperity, and Competitive Enterprise Institute.Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence is rife with citations legitimizing doctrine factory “scholarship.”  He cites articles written by the founder and president of the Free State Foundation, a member of the dark-money State Policy Network; by a member of the dark-money Federalist Society’s Administrative Law Group executive committee; and by the former president of the Koch-funded American Enterprise Institute.The Scheme is all about boosting corporate power and rolling back government regulations.  It’s not just about building a Dark Money Court; it’s about front groups by the dozen, which operate in coordinated flotillas; it’s about faux scholarship, reverse-engineered in a parallel universe of faux academia, to give polluters power over government; and it’s about more than half a billion dollars in dark money spent to set up and run the whole sham enterprise.The attack on regulation began with an effort to revive the so-called “nondelegation doctrine,” discarded by the Supreme Court almost one hundred years ago.  Like the “major questions” doctrine, the “nondelegation doctrine” allowed courts to strike down agency rules when Congress wasn’t explicit enough in delegating power.   Polluters loved it.  Scheme front groups like the Cato Institute—propped up by dark-money from the fossil fuel billionaire Koch family and companies like Exxon Mobil—sponsored “research” that argued for reviving the “nondelegation doctrine.” They organized conferences and seminars, lobbied legislators, and funded law groups designed to spread the idea far and wide. But “major questions” had one advantage:  years ago, on the D.C. Court of Appeals, Justice Breyer had used those two words once, in passing, in a lengthy law review article.  They could seize that camouflage.   And guess what?   “Major questions” is just “nondelegation” in disguise.  If you don’t believe me, let’s go back to Justice Gorsuch, in a concurrence from another case earlier this year, I quote:“[T]he major questions doctrine is closely related to what is sometimes called the nondelegation doctrine.  Indeed, for decades courts have cited the nondelegation doctrine as a reason to apply the major questions doctrine.  . . . Whichever the doctrine, the point is the same.”Indeed.   The point is that a Court captured by polluter interests will find any way it can to import polluter doctrine, cooked up in polluter-funded doctrine factories, into the law of the land.  And that’s just what they just did in West Virginia v. EPA.  For the polluters, mission accomplished. The Court That Dark Money Built had already wreaked havoc in our law.  Even before they got to six, they had run up eighty 5-4 partisan decisions benefiting big Republican donor interests. Eighty 5-4 partisan decisions benefiting big Republican donor interests. Now with six, they have set about destroying precedent left and right, taking away the constitutional right of women to control their own reproductive decisions, blocking efforts to reduce gun violence, and now adopting new theories to empower polluters against public health regulation.  The FedSoc Six’s hatred for regulation isn’t shared much outside the polluter-funded parallel universe.  Most Americans appreciate regulations – they appreciate regulations that help make sure food and water are safe, air is clean, medicines actually work, markets are honest, investors have real information, and car seats protect you in a car wreck.  The American people are right to sense that something is deeply amiss at the United States Supreme Court. A captured Court presents an unprecedented challenge to the other branches, but we aren’t helpless. First is we need to telling the truth about what is going on.  The pattern is unmistakable.  People need to understand.We can pass laws like my DISCLOSE Act to shine light on the dark-money donors who captured our Court in a long scheme. We can require real ethics requirements for Supreme Court justices, just like all other federal judges already have.  Remember the ongoing ethics investigations against Judge Kavanaugh they were dropped, not because they were resolved, not because they ended, not because he was found not culpable, hey were dropped against Judge Kavanaugh because he escaped to the Supreme Court, where ethics investigations don’t exist. That’s a terrible single.We can require justices to report gifts and hospitality, as all other judges do and all senior government officials do in the executive and legislative branches. There are many ways to push back against the new “ruling class” of “unaccountable ministers” on the captured Court, and assure that fairness and justice, and not the Court’s deep-pocketed special interest friends, are what drive Court decisions.  There’s a lot to be done and we need to begin.To be continued."

Shea, Block Island, Exeter West Greenwich, and Warwick Career and Technical High Schools.  Building on its experience implementing WindWinRI, the Chamber plans to develop a new offshore wind energy CTE program that will be available to any interested school in Rhode Island.  Students will have access to an offshore wind energy education and work-based learning opportunities to gain transferrable skill sets and ultimately, a CTE certification.“Based on our experience in designing, building, and implementing the nation’s first offshore wind energy high school program certification, we thank Senator Whitehouse for awarding the North Kingstown Chamber of Commerce a Congressionally Directed Spending project.  We look forward to working with our industry and educational partners to establish an offshore wind energy Rhode Island Department of Education-approved CTE program.  This will provide the state of Rhode Island a robust talent pipeline starting with high school graduates.  Additionally, this supports Rhode Island’s Blue Economy initiative,” said Kristin Urbach, Executive Director of the North Kingstown Chamber of Commerce and WindWinRI.The primary federal law relating to CTE, the Perkins Act, provides annual funding to RIDE for approved CTE programs.  The North Kingstown Chamber of Commerce is working with RIDE and the State CTE Board to establish the offshore wind CTE program for Rhode Island secondary schools.  Additionally, the Chamber plans to design new offshore wind-related programming for middle and elementary school students.“RIDE is deeply committed to career and technical education because it helps prepare our students for rewarding careers of the future,” said Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green.  “It is hard to think of a future career path with more growth potential for Rhode Islanders than wind energy and the blue economy.  We’re excited about building more wind energy programs in our schools through this investment made possible with the leadership of Senator Whitehouse.”A curriculum for the CTE program will be developed with input from offshore wind industry partners to ensure graduates are equipped with in-demand skills. “The creation of a new offshore wind energy Career and Technical Education certification program is a critical milestone as we prepare the next generation of offshore wind energy workers,” said David Ortiz, Head of Northeast Government Affairs and Market Strategy, Ørsted.  “We’re grateful to the Biden-Harris Administration and for Senator Whitehouse’s bipartisan leadership.  Through this program, high school students can take advantage of hands-on training that will translate directly to careers in an American industry that started in Rhode Island and is rapidly-growing across the United States.”In 2016, Rhode Island became home to America’s first offshore wind farm, which is now operated by Ørsted.  The offshore wind industry is expected to grow rapidly over the coming years, as the Biden administration has set a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

CIT increases diversion to treatment and recovery, reduces use of force, and improves officer wellness and safety.  We are so grateful to Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse for their longstanding support of this effort.  Thundermist is proud to support this work.  We recognize, as a community health center, that health is determined by community outcomes as well as high quality healthcare.  CIT will improve the health and mental health outcomes in the communities we serve and beyond,” said Susan Jacobsen, senior director of health equity initiatives, Thundermist Health Center.“We are at a point in time that we rely on our law enforcement officers to provide services to our communities like never before, and none of those services are more important than when an individual or a family finds themselves in a behavioral health crisis.  We know our officers are not trained to make medical evaluations, but they are most often the first responders to provide assistance.  We have worked with Thundermist to provide training to not just our officers but also dispatchers in the Memphis Model Crisis Intervention Team program and believe teaming those officers with embedded clinicians helps to provide a safer and more effective outcomes for those in need as well as to those responding.  The Rhode Island Police Chiefs’ Association applauds the efforts of Senators Reed and Whitehouse for their continued support in this area.  These federal funds will expand our ability to train more officers and supporting personnel,” said Sidney Wordell, Executive Director of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs’ Association.The initiative will include 24 training academies over four years, including specialized academies on communicating with youth about mental health and dealing with trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in first responders.  The expansion will launch in the fall.Chip Unruh (Reed), (202) 224-4642Meaghan McCabe (Whitehouse), (401) 453-5294"

EPA, which undermines the EPA’s power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants:“The fossil fuel industry’s Republican lackeys challenged an EPA rule that does not exist, meaning there was no ‘case or controversy’ to consider.  But Republican justices threw precedent to the wind and pounced on this challenge.“It was easy to see this decision coming.  The fossil fuel industry helped to select, vet, and install the FedSoc Six.  They know a Court they can control offers the chance to hobble the EPA, and they know a hobbled EPA is a ticket to pollute.  This decision handed them that ticket.“Today’s decision also offered what Justice Sotomayor calls the ‘restless and newly constituted’ Republican supermajority an opportunity to smuggle the so-called ‘major questions doctrine,’ a fringe legal theory, into the Court’s jurisprudence.   Tellingly, this very doctrine was invented and pushed by the same right-wing donor interests that built the current supermajority.  As Justice Kagan notes in her dissent, the Court has never even used the term ‘major questions doctrine’ before.  In adopting this right-wing whim whole cloth, the Court opens the door to other challenges by big regulated industries to rules that get in their way, and it saps regulatory agencies of their power to hold corporations accountable for the harms they inflict.  Exactly as intended by the donors who built – and now own – this Court.“While this ruling does not entirely foreclose EPA from regulating greenhouse gases in the power sector – and indeed, I redouble my calls for EPA to move at warp speed to do exactly that – it is a cause for alarm for all Americans who are rightly concerned about clean air and water and safe medicines, food, consumer products, and working conditions.  Taken to its (il)logical conclusion by a captured Court, ‘major questions doctrine’ can be used to gut almost any regulation right-wing donor interests don’t like. “The Court That Dark Money Built has delivered another win for its benefactors – at the potential expense of a livable climate and the basic functioning of our government.”Whitehouse led colleagues in filing an amicus curiae brief in the case with counsel of record University of California, Berkeley School of Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.  Read the brief here.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"

Cicilline (RI-01) applauded the Biden Administration’s extension and expansion of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) and employment authorization for Liberians who have long called the United States home.Under the President’s memorandum, “the removal of any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who is present in the United States and who was under a grant of DED as of June 30, 2022, as well as any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who has been continuously physically present in the United States since May 20, 2017” will be delayed through June 30, 2024.In their letter to President Biden earlier this year, Senators Reed and Whitehouse and Congressman Cicilline urged the Administration to provide this extension, noting that previous DED extension have been a “vital lifeline” for the Liberian community and backlogs at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would put those who have already applied for lawful permanent status at risk of having their DED run out before their applications could be processed.“Congress acted in 2019 to provide Liberians with DED status a pathway to citizenship.  Today’s action by the Biden Administration ensures that people who have built a life here, put down roots, and contributed to our communities have a fair opportunity to apply to become American citizens,” said Reed, Whitehouse and Cicilline in a joint statement.Senator Reed and Congressman Cicilline are the leading sponsors of the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, which became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92). This created a pathway to citizenship for the thousands of Liberians who have called the U.S. home for years – contributing to our workforce, paying taxes, and become integral members of our communities."

Wade rightly held the Constitution’s guarantee of individual liberty protects such private decisions against government interference.  Now, Roe’s privacy protection is gone and legislatures can meddle freely in these intimate and difficult decisions.  The consequences for millions of women are immediate, as an array of antiquated anti-abortion laws snap back into place.“The public could not be clearer on this issue.  Large majorities of Americans support upholding Roe.  That’s why right-wing special interests turned to the life-tenured justices they helped install on the bench to achieve their extremist goal.  This decision represents another win for those right-wing donor interests at regular Americans’ expense – another win from the Court That Dark Money Built.“This is one of the most smug, arrogant, and untethered decisions in the Court’s history.  We must find a way to reverse the damage wrought today.”Rich Davidson (202) 228-6291 (press office)"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/time-to-wake-up-284_-a-carbon-border-adjustment,"Mr. President, I rise now for the 284th time with my increasingly tattered and battered ‘‘Time to Wake up’’ poster to urge this Chamber to wake up on the issue of climate change.Human beings dumped 36.3 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere last year—last year. After all our big talk, after all the plans and the COPS and the commitments, 36.3 billion tons. That is the highest total ever recorded. We are not doing any better. We continue to do worse, and here in Congress, we continue to do nothing. We have seen this coming for many years. And even with all that warning, nothing. NOAA reports there is currently more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any time during the last 4 million years.Humankind has never experienced what we are putting ourselves through. Here is a look at it. Over centuries, wobbling, wobbling, back and forth quite steadily. And now—whoops—and all the way up to where we are, out of the historic range of this planet back into geological time.All that carbon pollution has us hurtling toward climate catastrophe. With every ton of carbon dioxide we add, comes a higher risk of destructive changes to our world: ever-stronger hurricanes, rising seas, severe droughts, flooding, heat waves, disease, hunger, and more. We have a simple choice: We act swiftly to address the carbon pollution scorching our planet or we tip our climate over the edge into a cycle of destruction mankind cannot halt.As we disrupt essential planetary operating systems, we face another problem: American deindustrialization and the offshoring of jobs in much of our manufacturing base.After China joined the World Trade Organization back here in 2001, the United States lost almost 6 million manufacturing jobs. It was a complete bloodbath. Communities across America were hollowed out as factories closed and workers were laid off losing union jobs that helped workers support their families and enjoy a good wage and a decent standard of living.Our trade deficit blew up, especially for manufactured goods. In 2001, our trade deficit in manufactured goods topped $250 billion. By 2020, it had more than tripled to almost $900 billion.Then came the COVID–19 pandemic and exposed the fact that we no longer make so much upon which modern life depends. First it was the masks and the protective gear for medical professionals on the frontlines; then shortages came to everything from patio furniture to auto computer chips, bicycles, garage doors, and much more.Well, what if—what if—it turned out there was a solution to both problems, a policy that would simultaneously drive down carbon pollution worldwide and help reshore American manufacturing? Well, it turns out there is such a solution, and it is called a carbon border adjustment. With Senators Coons, Schatz, and Heinrich, I have introduced one here in the Senate.The fact is that American manufacturers are way less carbon-intensive than other competitors. On average, we are nearly 50-percent less carbon-intensive than our trading partners. Here is a list of some of our majors: China, 3.2 times more efficient; Mexico, 1.4 times more efficient; India, 3.8 times more efficient. So if we level the playing field about carbon emissions economy to economy, we win against carbon-intensive nations like China and India. And that is fair. A steel plant in Shanghai shouldn’t be able to pollute for free and undercut plants in Pittsburgh that make better steel with less pollution.My border adjustment fixes that problem. Carbon-polluting goods from abroad, fossil fuels, refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, fertilizer, cement, steel would be tariffed on the carbon intensity of their industries. This means that if you are a carbon-intensive cement factory in Mexico, you pay or you invest in technologies to lower your carbon intensity to match that cleaner plant across the border in Texas. That is a powerful incentive to reduce global emissions and a big boost to U.S. companies competing against foreign climate cheaters.The tariff revenues fund a competitive grant program for carbon-emitting U.S. industries to help them invest in the new technologies necessary to reduce their own carbon intensities.Developing countries didn’t get us into this mess, and they are getting clobbered by climate change, so we also direct some revenue to the State Department to support decarbonization projects in those countries.To make this work, we need to hold American companies to the same standard as we do overseas, so we the standard at our U.S. average emissions for the industry. So all you have to do to pay nothing is be better than average. And if you are below average, all you have to do to pay nothing is to clean up your act to where half your industry already is. We also give clear targets to industries for future baseline carbon intensity because that is what industry wants—clarity, certainty to know where the goalposts are.Look at an example. Under my bill, the average or better American steel mill would pay no charge at all because it is better than average. The below average steel mill might pay $5 to $10 per ton of steel produced, a $5 to $10 per ton incentive to clean up its mill. But here is the really good part: Imports from a Chinese steel mill, more like $110 per ton. The below average U.S. steel mill, $5 to $10; the Chinese, $110. That will make Americans feel more competitive compared to polluting Chinese imports, and then buyers will beat a path to our door.We might as well get ready with a U.S. carbon border adjustment because the European Union Parliament is passing a carbon border adjustment of its own. Member states will vote on that proposal later this year. When it takes effect, American companies will pay a carbon tariff to European governments—unless we have one of our own.Now, where we want to be is for the EU, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Japan, perhaps South Korea, all with common carbon border adjustments, creating a common carbon pricing platform across all those major economies so that we move toward decarbonization, and more importantly, the rest of the world that wants to trade with the United States, with the UK, with the EU, has to clean up its act. They would need to decarbonize and fast to have any hope of competing.Trying to convince Chinese manufacturers to clean up their act out of the goodness of their hearts, perhaps, is a bit of a fool’s errand. Putting a tariff on their goods so that they have to pay if they don’t clean up their act? Now, that is how you get things going.Unfortunately, this is on us now—on Democrats. There are too many Republicans who are just in tow to the fossil fuel industry to help. And, of course, you can’t talk about anything having to do with climate change without the dark money scoundrels, propped up by the fossil fuel industry, to come and cause mischief.They are even advertising against my bill. Here is an advertisement against it paid for by AG Conservatives—AG Conservatives. Well, assume that this is a real organization, which it isn’t. It is a front group paid for by dark money that hides who the real donors are— just a mouthpiece for somebody who doesn’t want to identify themselves.But why would an agriculture group want to hurt manufacturing? It doesn’t make any sense. Why would they not want American manufacturing to have that advantage against their Chinese competition? Why would they be asking people to vote no on a carbon border adjustment?And by the way, there are a lot of products where agricultural products form the feedstock for a later manufacturing product. And if we are bringing manufacturing to the United States because we are favored versus dirty polluting foreign manufacturers, why would they not want that to happen? And where is agriculture in this fight anyway when this is mostly about manufacturing? Where, for American agriculture, is the downside?If you think it through, it actually doesn’t exist, which helps confirm to me that behind this phony front group is probably the fossil fuel industry pretending that it is some agriculture group. If that were agriculture, that was agriculture from millions of years ago before it all went down to the bottom and got compressed and rotted and turned, after millions of years, into oil. That is the agriculture. So that is what we are up against.That is why Democrats are going to have to do this. The fossil fuel money that is driving the other party makes it impossible for bipartisanship to work.We have a shot in reconciliation to pass a serious climate bill—a real one— and we should make a carbon border adjustment a central component of that bill. It is a win-win-win. We compete on a playing field with a huge built-in advantage for American manufacturing; we spare ourselves carbon tariffs from the EU; and we relentlessly, with economic pressure and power, drive down carbon pollution across the biggest polluters around the globe—a win-win-win.The choice is clear. Let’s win.I yield the floor"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-makes-the-case-for-boosting-retirement-savings,"Today, the Senate Finance Committee held a markup of the Enhancing American Retirement Now (EARN) Act, which would improve the U.S. retirement system.  The Committee approved the bill on a unanimous, 28-0 vote.  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) delivered the following remarks at today’s Committee markup about his proposal to boost retirement savings for American workers:“Nearly half of American workers have no personal retirement savings at all.  Given workers’ stagnant wages in this country, that should come as no surprise.  Wages have grown at a snail’s pace, while CEO pay and corporate profits grew leaps and bounds.  It’s no surprise that half of Americans said in a recent survey that they couldn’t afford a $500 emergency medical expense, let alone save in a retirement account. “This legislation offers some modest measures to help more people save, but ultimately, we should reform what is an upside-down system that benefits the wealthy more than hard-working Americans.“It leaves out, unfortunately, Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady’s commonsense, bipartisan auto-enrollment provision.  Even those with access to a retirement plan through their employer often struggle to build a nest egg that can maintain their standard of living in retirement.  Auto-enrollment would be a big boost in participation.“Auto-enrollment would increase participation in 401(k) plans by 80%, and increase contributions by 50%.  It especially boosts participation among low-wage workers, and can nearly eliminate the racial gap in participation rates.  Despite all of those values, only 1/3 of employers currently offer auto-enrollment. “So, I have legislation to require all employers to offer auto-enrollment.  The bipartisan provision advanced by our House colleagues, which I will offer and withdraw as an amendment, would take an important step in that direction.“I am disappointed also that the package doesn’t include the Brown-Portman proposal to raise the outdated Supplemental Security Income asset limits.  That change would remove the biggest barrier to saving for the nearly 8 million elderly and disabled Americans—including over 31,000 Rhode Islanders—with very low-incomes and limited resources who currently receive SSI. “I would urge that these provisions be included in the final legislation.  The auto-enrollment expansion was voted unanimously out of the House Ways and Means Committee and cleared the House 414 to 5.  It’s a priority for AARP, and has found support at the American Enterprise Institute.  It is clearly broadly supported.  I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo to ensure that these important measures are included in the final bill.”Senator Whitehouse filed an amendment at today’s markup that aims to help America’s seniors prepare for financial security during retirement.  Whitehouse’s amendment would require companies that adopt new 401(k) plans to auto-enroll their employees at a 3% contribution level and automatically increase that by a percentage point each year up to a maximum of 10%, unless the employee opts out.  This bipartisan measure was included in the House’s Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, which passed the House in March on a 414 to 5 vote.Whitehouse’s amendment is based on his Automatic IRA Act, which is a common-sense solution to expand Americans’ retirement savings.  The legislation would require employers who do not provide another qualified retirement plan and who have more than 10 employees to enroll workers automatically in an automatic Individual Retirement Account (IRA) unless the employee opts out. At the markup, Chairman Wyden expressed his full support for the amendment and committed to working with Whitehouse to include the auto-enrollment amendment in the final legislative package.Video of the Senator’s remarks can be found here.Rich Davidson, 202-228-6291 (Press Office)"

Whitehouse to streamline the bankruptcy process for small businesses by eliminating onerous paperwork requirements designed for major corporations,” said Grassley.“Too many mom-and-pop shops are getting caught up in a complicated bankruptcy system while working to get back on their feet,” said Durbin. “At the same time, many families are struggling with overwhelming levels of debt.  This bipartisan bill brings relief to both.  I’m grateful to my Senate colleagues for their partnership on this critical legislation, and applaud President Biden for acting swiftly to sign this into law—a testament to this Congress’s, and this Administration’s, commitment to supporting American businesses and families.”“For small businesses and families who fought their way through the pandemic and are now facing economic hardship, our complicated bankruptcy process can be another barrier to survival,” said Cornyn.  “I’m glad we could come together on this reprieve from burdensome requirements, especially given record-high inflation and rising interest rates.”Whitehouse and Grassley passed the Small Business Reorganization Act in 2019 to establish streamlined bankruptcy procedures that help small business owners keep their companies afloat and preserve jobs.  The CARES Act of 2020 temporarily allowed more small businesses to qualify for those streamlined procedures by increasing the upper debt limit for small businesses from $2.7 million to $7.5 million.  That increase expired on March 27, 2022. The legislation provides a two-year extension to the CARES Act increase to $7.5 million, and makes minor technical fixes to the Small Business Reorganization Act.  It also increases the debt limit for individuals to qualify for Chapter 13 bankruptcy for two years, allowing more individuals the opportunity to try to save their homes from foreclosure.  This increase addresses the concern that rising home prices and exploding student loan debt will push increasing numbers of individuals over the debt limit to qualify for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Rich Davidson (Whitehouse), 202-228-6291Taylor Foy (Grassley), 202-224-6708Jenna Valle-Riestra (Durbin), 202-819-3335Natalie Yezbick (Cornyn), 202-224-0704"

http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-and-colleagues-raise-concerns-about-cryptominings-heavy-toll-on-environment,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA) have sent a letter to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy raising concerns that energy-intensive cryptomining is taking a heavy toll on the environment and threatens to pull the nation further off track from meeting its climate commitments.  The Senators propose requiring that cryptominers use verified new zero-carbon energy sources and improve transparency around the industry’s carbon footprint.“The continued use of proof-of-work cryptomining directly threatens the United States’ ability to meet its climate goals,” wrote the Senators.The United States is now the most popular country for cryptomining, with an estimated 35 percent of global mining taking place here.  The annual global electricity consumption associated with mining two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, is estimated to be around 300 terawatt-hours of energy, which is comparable to the consumption of the United Kingdom.  It is estimated that the carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining negated the global emissions reductions from the uptake of electric vehicles last year.  In addition to exacerbating climate change, cryptomining’s huge appetite for electricity has also raised retail electricity prices in certain communities while creating few jobs and spurring little in the way of economic development.“We recommend that the United States restrict energy use for cryptomining to verified new, zero-carbon sources and to increase transparency on energy usage,” they added.The full text of the letter is available here and below. Office of Science and Technology Policy Executive Office of the President Eisenhower Executive Office Building 1650 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, D.C. 20504Dear Dr. Nelson,We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Request for Information (RFI) on the Climate and Energy Implications of Digital Assets.  As noted in the RFI, addressing the climate crisis is a key priority for policymakers.  We applaud the administration’s commitment to meeting our nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 and thereby mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  In order to do so, we must consider the carbon footprint of emerging technologies and work proactively to mitigate their emissions.The continued use of proof-of-work cryptomining directly threatens the United States’ ability to meet its climate goals.  In preparing this comment, our staff interviewed over a dozen experts in computational science and other relevant fields.  Based on these conversations and additional research, we feel confident in stating up front that we have been unable to ascertain a single climate benefit from cryptocurrencies.  While we can estimate the emissions from cryptomining, these estimates are hindered by cryptomining companies’ failure to disclose their energy usage and sources.  In this letter, we discuss the growing energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies and their negative effects on retail and consumer electricity prices.  We recommend that the United States restrict energy use for cryptomining to verified new, zero carbon sources and to increase transparency on energy usage.Energy ConsumptionProof-of-work mining is an increasingly energy-intensive process and is used by the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum.  “Miners” are given rewards in the form of coins based on “proof-of-work,” or demonstration of resources put towards solving increasingly difficult computing problems.  The annual global electricity consumption associated with mining Bitcoin and Ethereum is estimated to be around 300 TWh[1], which is comparable to the consumption of the United Kingdom.[2]  After China’s ban on cryptomining in 2021, cryptomining operations moved to other jurisdictions, and carbon emissions are estimated to have increased by 17%.[3]  In order to provide an idea of the size of these emissions, it is estimated that the carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining in 2021 negated the global emissions reductions from the uptake of electric vehicles.[4]  If nothing changes, and cryptocurrency mining continues to increase, we run the risk that the emissions associated with this mining negate our transition to a clean energy future.The United States is now the most popular country for cryptomining.  The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which is based on voluntary disclosures from four mining pools representing less than half of the network’s activity, now estimates that 35% of global mining is in the United States compared with 4% in August 2020.[5] The need for inexpensive, reliable energy to power cryptomining facilities had led to the revival of fossil fuel plants, making it harder to reach our climate goals.  In one case, a coal-fired power plant located in Dresden, New York was slated for closure, but was then purchased and converted to natural gas which now powers Bitcoin mining.[6]  A draft report by the New York State Climate Action Council, a committee that was established to develop a scoping plan and recommendations that are to be incorporated into the state energy plan, states that using fossil fuels and the additional electricity load to power cryptomining “could make it more difficult to meet [New York State’s] Climate Act’s zero carbon electricity requirement by 2040.”[7]Cryptomining also increases the stress on the electricity grid.  Cryptocurrency boosters typically argue that cryptocurrency mining rigs, the computing system used for mining, can be considered a battery and help stabilize the grid.  This is a deeply flawed analogy in that a true battery stores and releases energy rather than increasing the demand on the grid itself.  In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) introduced a new interim large load interconnection process[8] for new load interconnection requests, mainly applicable to cryptominers seeking to bring their facilities online before Bitcoin halves the reward value for mining in 2024.  ERCOT expects electricity demand to increase by 6 GW, the equivalent of powering every home in Houston, within the next 12 to 15 months.[9] They’ve received inquiries from cryptominers seeking to join the grid whose projects would consume 17 GW by 2026, or the equivalent of two and a half New York Cities.  While some cryptocurrency mining operations have started to enroll in flexible load programs, agreeing to curtail operations as directed by ERCOT, this does not address the burden of significant additional load on an already stressed grid. Inadequate transparencyCryptocurrency mining companies currently do not disclose detailed information about their energy usage, inhibiting a thorough assessment of their carbon footprint.  While the Bitcoin Mining Council’s reports emphasize their use of renewables, as of Q4 2021, the Council does not represent a majority of global mining efforts.[10]  The April 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Working Group III underscores “considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the energy use” and “while it is clear that the energy requirements of global Bitcoin mining have grown significantly since 2017, recent literature indicates a wide range of estimates for 2020 (47 TWh to 125 TWh) due to data gaps and differences in modelling approaches.”[11]  The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance relies on voluntary disclosures from four mining groups.  This includes Foundry USA, which provides some public data but represent less than 20% of the estimated hashrate, a measure of the computational power per second, in the United States. While it is in the interest of cryptominers to brand themselves as “green” and “eco-friendly” in appealing to a broader consumer base, these claims cannot be verified due to lack of transparency that characterizes most cryptocurrency mining companies.  They are also at odds with abundant anecdotal evidence suggesting that many cryptocurrency mining operations in the U.S. and overseas are powered by electricity produced from combusting fossil fuels.  For example, Sierra Club researchers could not find any cryptomining contracts for renewable energy, instead the publicly available documents were all for carbon intensive energy sources.[12]Effects on consumer and retail ratesThe increased electricity demand associated with cryptocurrency mining is already negatively affecting consumers, who must pay higher energy prices.  Following the arrival of cryptomining operations in upstate New York, small businesses and local residents paid $79 million and $165 million extra annually for electricity, respectively.[13]  Although local governments could generate some increased tax revenue from cryptocurrency mining operations, this increased revenue only equals 15% of the increased electricity costs to local businesses and residents.  Moreover, some state and local governments are providing tax incentives to lure cryptocurrency mining operations.  For example, tax incentives could cost Kentucky taxpayers $9 million annually in foregone revenue.[14] While cryptocurrency mining companies promise jobs, these benefits have not manifested.[15]  In January 2022, Fitch Ratings Inc., one of the “Big Three” credit rating systems, stated that cryptocurrency mining operations “typically bring in very little additional economic benefits…to a local economy.”[16] Outlook and policy recommendationsProof-of-work cryptocurrencies’ reliance on carbon intensive energy sources is a global problem.  Miners can simply move to a different jurisdiction to avoid a particular country’s regulations.  As illustrated by the consequences of China’s ban, some of these displaced cryptocurrency mining operations may wind up being powered by more carbon intensive sources of electricity.  At the same time, our electricity grid and local communities are already facing significant negative consequences from cryptocurrency mining operations. Alternative validation mechanisms, including proof-of-stake, are estimated to greatly reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency.  While many newer cryptocurrencies are using proof-of-stake, proof-of-work cryptocurrencies still dominate the marketplace.  There may be technical challenges in adapting a cryptocurrency’s codebase to a new validation mechanism cannot be underestimated.[17]  Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has been promised for over six years, and in April 2022, it was again delayed by several months.[18]  Bitcoin has made no indication it has serious plans to do so and mining groups consider the energy consumption is “a feature” that “produce[s] valuable attributes.”[19]  There is uncertainty in relying on an oft-promised and long-delayed transition to proof-of-stake to address the climate impacts of cryptocurrency and the United States should pursue policy in the near term.To mitigate the negative environmental effects of proof-of-work mining, the United States should implement policies that drastically reduce if not eliminate emissions from this sector and require transparency from this sector.  There are several options to achieve this goal, and we urge you to consider all of them.  For example, the federal government could establish a national registry of United States-based cryptomining plants.  It could mandate increased transparency and regular disclosures from all cryptomining facilities with respect to their energy sources, emissions, and metering agreements with local utilities.  Another option would be to introduce energy efficiency standard for cryptomining facilities.  The United States could direct all domestic cryptomining operations be powered exclusively by verified new, zero-carbon sources of energy or solely rely on excess renewables from extant sources, and partner with other nations to do the same.  Engaging with Regional Transmission Operators/Independent System Operators, local public utility companies, and electricity providers to minimize cryptomining’s repercussions on the electrical grid should be explored. We thank OSTP for their attention to this matter and look forward to your next steps.Sincerely,[1] https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption and

This rule will crack down on corporate greenwashing by holding registrants accountable for their stated climate goals, and it will give investors reliable data to evaluate their portfolio risk exposure.”“The SEC’s proposed climate disclosure rule is powerfully important, providing consumers and investors with more knowledge about environmental risks and fossil fuel emissions,” said Senator Warren. “But the rule must be strong enough to produce full and transparent disclosures, and we’re urging the SEC to make improvements and preserve key elements in the final rule.”The comment letter focuses on several areas for improvement that would strengthen the final rule:The comment also highlights several key elements of the proposed rule that the Commission should preserve in their entirety in the final rule:The full text of the comment letter is available here.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/senate-judiciary-committee-gives-bipartisan-approval-to-1st-circuit-nominee-montecalvo,"Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse today announced that a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee has backed the nomination of Lara E. Montecalvo to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  In a 12-10 vote, the Committee voted this morning to send the nomination to the full Senate for final confirmation, which requires approval by a simple majority.Montecalvo’s nomination was announced by the White House in April after Whitehouse and U.S. Senator Jack Reed jointly made their recommendations for the seat to the President.  Montecalvo currently leads the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender. “In a testament to Ms. Montecalvo’s exceptional credentials, she earned bipartisan support from members of the Judiciary Committee.  She is extremely well-respected in Rhode Island, and we know she will be a fair and impartial judge.  We look forward to a swift confirmation by the full Senate,” said Senators Whitehouse and Reed in a joint statement.Montecalvo’s nomination has earned widespread support from Rhode Island’s judicial and law enforcement communities.  Local police leaders, former prosecutors, and current and retired members of the Rhode Island Supreme Court and the Rhode Island Superior Court strongly advocated for her confirmation in letters submitted to the Judiciary Committee last month.Montecalvo has extensive litigation and appellate experience handling both criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts.  She has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal levels.A resident of Barrington who moved to Rhode Island with her family when she was in the fourth grade, Montecalvo serves as the state’s chief Public Defender.  In that role, she provides high-quality legal representation for Rhode Islanders who cannot afford to hire an attorney in criminal, juvenile, and parental rights cases.Montecalvo earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Swarthmore College and went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000.  She and her husband, Craig, have a son.After graduating from law school, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC for four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Prior to being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.If confirmed by the full Senate, Montecalvo will fill the vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that was created when Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announced her plan to take senior status. The First Circuit, based in Boston, hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico. The First Circuit is one of thirteen appellate courts that sit one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court.Meaghan McCabe, (401) 453-5294"
http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-grassley-and-colleagues-mark-international-day-against-drug-abuse_trafficking-with-bipartisan-resolution,"Washington, DC – This week, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), co-Chairs of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, led a bipartisan group of their colleagues, including all Caucus members, in introducing a resolution recognizing June 26, 2022 as the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.  This day has been observed by the United Nations since 1987 to raise awareness about the dangers of the illicit narcotics trade and the dark economy supporting it.  The resolution calls attention to the drug use epidemic ravaging communities across the U.S., the danger the drug trade poses to the rule of law, and the need for greater access to prevention, treatment, and recovery programs, among other issues.  Representatives Kathleen Rice (D-NY) and John Katko (R-NY) led a bipartisan companion resolution in the House.“We must shine light on the dark forces driving our addiction and overdose crisis, and recommit ourselves to supporting those fighting their own personal battle against substance use,” said Whitehouse.  “This measure recognizes that we must care for those in our own communities through prevention, treatment, and recovery, while continuing to work with our international partners to address the origins of illicit drugs.  As Chair of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I look forward to leading the charge in the Senate to combat the addiction epidemic and the criminals driving it.”“Deadly substances, like fentanyl, continue to claim tens of thousands of lives and destroy countless families in this country each year.  Much of this poison flows into our country from overseas.  It’s critical that we work together with our international partners to crack down on drug trafficking organizations and raise awareness about prevention, treatment and recovery programs,” said Grassley.“This awareness day will help shine a light on the drug use epidemic that continues to harm so many Americans and their families.  By bringing awareness to this important issue, we can destigmatize the conversation and focus on ending the importation of illegal drugs and creating support systems for those battling substance abuse,” said Rice.“I am proud to introduce this measure to recognize the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking along with my colleagues,” said Katko.  “Substance use disorder and overdose deaths have risen at an astronomical rate in the past few years, translating to immeasurable human suffering in communities across the country.  As Ranking Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security, I deeply understand the need to recognize the implications of this crisis and promote a strong response at the national level.  By raising awareness, we can end the stigma associated with substance use disorders, encourage those who need help to seek it out, and support our law enforcement as they work to combat international drug trafficking.”In 2019, an estimated 275 million people worldwide used illicit drugs and an estimated 36.3 million people suffered from substance use disorders, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  According to the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention, more than 107,000 individuals died from drug overdoses in 2021.  The National Institute of Drug Abuse projects illicit drugs cost the U.S. $193 billion annually in healthcare costs, crime, and lost productivity.The Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control has a long history of working on a bipartisan basis to crack down on illicit drug trafficking globally, while expanding addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services at home.  As Chairman of the Caucus, Whitehouse has held hearings that examined the federal response to the drug overdose epidemic, the role and effectiveness of U.S. drug control agencies in addressing corruption associated with the illicit drug trade, and how drug cartels have adapted their production, trafficking, and finance schemes for the 21st Century.  This week, the Caucus also held an oversight hearing of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and its 2022 National Drug Control Strategy.The full resolution is available here.Rich Davidson (Whitehouse), (202) 228-6291Taylor Foy (Grassley), (202) 224-3744"
