https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-introduces-bill-to-remove-obstacle-to-mental-telehealth-services-for-seniors,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today introduced legislation to permanently waive a federal provision requiring seniors who are seeking mental health services to have an in-person visit before receiving services virtually. The Trump administration waived this requirement during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the declaration of a public health emergency (PHE). Without legislative action, these flexibilities will end when the federal PHE ends.“Just like the ‘originating site’ requirement my FRONTIER Community Act eliminated in 2020, this one-size-fits-all federal rule does not work for Alaska seniors and has proven to be an obstacle to tackling our country’s worsening mental health crisis,” said Sen. Sullivan. “With lives on the line, our priority must be connecting patients with services, even if they live hundreds of miles from a provider. I urge my colleagues to recognize how unworkable this rule is for millions of rural Americans and help me get this legislation to the President’s desk.”Sen. Sullivan has been a champion of improving mental health services and expanding access through telehealth delivery. Sullivan’s FRONTIER Community Act, signed into law in December 2020, removed the federal rule requiring patients to travel to a pre-approved “originating site”—which can be hundreds of miles from a patient’s home—in order to receive mental telehealth services. Sullivan has also cosponsored the CONNECT for Health Act and the Telehealth Modernization Act to make telehealth flexibilities permanent.Congressmen Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), John Curtis (R-Utah) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) have introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives, which passed the body in July. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-united-in-urging-president-biden-to-waive-states-cost-share-for-western-alaska-disaster,"WASHINGTON—Following last week’s federal major disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery from the impact of Typhoon Merbok, U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska), and Governor Mike Dunleavy (R-Alaska) are urging President Biden to waive 100 percent of the state’s cost share for federal individual and public assistance for recovery efforts for 30 days, citing the fact that the cost is too great to cover with currently available resources. This would mirror the FEMA arrangement for the ongoing disaster in Puerto Rico.“Following last week’s historic storm, I knew I needed to be boots on the ground with Alaskans to survey the damage and to learn more about what I can do to support recovery efforts. I visited a number of the impacted communities over the weekend, including Nome, Elim, Golovin, Hooper Bay and Chevak. Throughout my visits, I spent time talking with Tribal leaders, community members, the National Guard, and more, who showed me firsthand the severity of the damage and how much work lies ahead in their road to recovery. We recognize the cost that comes with the destruction to key infrastructure, but we must also consider the challenges that don’t immediately meet the eye—slow moving disasters such as water damage and the loss of cultural and subsistence tools. The financial needs to replace such substantial loss is far too great without additional assistance,” said Senator Murkowski. “This waiver will go a long way in helping repair the storm’s damage to bridges, roads, water treatment plants, homes, airstrips, and more. Rural communities prior to the storm were already challenged, and it’s imperative that we help them get back on their feet and are able to return to their homes and meet basic needs like running water.”  “We're tough in Alaska. But every now and then—in the aftermath of earthquakes, wildfires, typhoons, and tsunamis —we're going to need federal help. Now is that time,” said Senator Sullivan. “Just like our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, Alaskans are racing to repair homes, foundations, seawalls, airports and other critical pieces of infrastructure. We are also contending with another complication—freeze-up—which leaves a very narrow window to get cash out the door and make these communities whole by winter. Now that FEMA has decided it will cover one-hundred percent of the recovery costs for one month for victims of Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico, FEMA needs to do the same for those recovering from Typhoon Merbok in Western Alaska, where we have some of the most impoverished communities in the country. I reiterate my call on the Biden administration to treat Alaskans fairly and approve this commonsense accommodation for my constituents. I have written to the FEMA Administrator, spoke on the Senate floor about this, and twice talked directly with the Secretary of Homeland Security who told me he would address this matter.”“Having just visited Nome and other communities impacted by Typhoon Merbok over the weekend, I’ve now had the chance to speak directly with state and local officials and see the destruction first-hand,” said Representative Peltola. “I am extremely grateful that President Biden so quickly approved Governor Dunleavy’s federal disaster declaration, however, I wish to strongly reiterate my call for FEMA to waive the State of Alaska’s cost share for federal individual and public assistance for recovery efforts. This 100% federal cost share is essential to the timely cleanup efforts that are ongoing.” “After living and working in rural Alaska for 20 years, I know the next few weeks will be critical to getting essential infrastructure, homes and businesses back on their feet before winter takes over in western Alaska,” said Governor Mike Dunleavy. “Lifting the cost share for both individual and public assistance means we can address the needs of these communities immediately, and prevent any further hardships for those Alaskan families that have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the storm.”On September 16, remnants of Typhoon Merbok produced widespread damage to communities in Western Alaska—flooding to homes and businesses; damage to infrastructure for power and water as well as roads and bridges; and impacts to approximately 1,000 miles of coastline. On September 20, Governor Dunleavy requested a federal disaster declaration which was immediately followed by a letter from the Alaska congressional delegation urging President Biden to expeditiously approve his request. On September 23, the President issued a major disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery. In Governor Dunleavy’s Major Disaster request, he requested a federal waiver for the State of Alaska’s cost share for individual and public assistance recovery efforts in western Alaska, which was followed by a letter from the Alaska congressional delegation urging FEMA to approve Governor Dunleavy’s request.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-applauds-approval-of-major-disaster-declaration-for-western-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska) today welcomed an announcement that President Joe Biden approved Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy’s (R-Alaska) request for a major disaster declaration to support Western Alaska’s recovery from the impact of Typhoon Merbok on Alaskan families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure. This announcement comes just two days after the delegation sent a letter urging the President for his approval.   “Typhoon Merbok was the strongest storm Alaska has experienced in seventy years, leaving a wake of destruction covering over 1,000 miles of coastline. I am grateful that no casualties and no serious injuries have been reported, but the impact on homes and infrastructure are extensive. So many communities throughout Western Alaska have been devastated and are in dire need of federal support. I appreciate the President for listening to us and recognizing the urgency of this situation. With winter weather looming, this federal assistance can’t come soon enough,” said Senator Murkowski. “I am on the ground in the region today and throughout the weekend traveling to the impacted communities. It is so important to see the needs firsthand and hear directly from residents as this helps guide how I can best assist them. I will be there for Alaskans through the recovery and rebuilding process by doing all I can in my role to help ensure that they have the support necessary to do so.”“I appreciate the quick response from the Biden Administration approving Governor Dunleavy’s request for a Major Disaster declaration to support Alaska’s recovery from the impacts of Typhoon Merbok on Alaska families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure,” said Senator Sullivan. “My team and I continue to work closely with our partners in the federal, state, and local governments to ensure communities in Western Alaska are fully restored following this fierce storm. And I reiterate the arguments I recently made to the Secretary of Homeland Security and FEMA Administrator—that if other communities that have been impacted by natural disasters, like Puerto Rico, get 100 percent federal reimbursement, then so should Alaska.”“I am grateful that President Biden understood how urgent the need for federal assistance was to the people of Western Alaska and thank him for swiftly approving the governor’s request for a disaster declaration,” said Representative Peltola. “Over the next couple of days, I will be visiting areas impacted by this storm to see the destruction first-hand. My office and I will continue to work with state and local officials to provide any assistance that we can.” To read the delegation’s full letter, click here.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/63-million-in-broadband-investments-announced-for-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) today announced that communities on the North Slope and in Southeast Alaska will receive a total of $63 million for high-speed internet network buildout / deployment projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ReConnect Program grants, awarded to the Alaska Telephone Company and Arctic Slope Telephone, will help improve broadband access, including its affordability, for rural communities. “Having reliable internet has become a basic service that many in urban areas take for granted. In far too many remote communities in Alaska, I’ve seen and heard firsthand accounts of the unreliability and high cost of internet, with some households paying upwards of $300 a month alone for an unstable service. Connectivity means so much—for telehealth, education, our economy and so much more. That’s why I led the infrastructure bill and why I’ve made it a priority to expand broadband infrastructure and accessibility for unserved and underserved areas,” Senator Murkowski said. “I’m pleased to see these grants for Alaska and what it will mean to so many of these rural communities for years to come.”“It’s great to see the USDA continuing to award significant resources to assist with delivering high-speed internet access to rural Alaska—an essential component of 21st century infrastructure,” Senator Sullivan said. “Last month, I hosted a broadband summit in Anchorage with critical stakeholders from federal agencies, including from USDA, state and local governments, Alaska Native communities, industry, and other key partners as Alaska prepares to receive significant funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law. As these federal funds from various agencies come to Alaska, it is critical that all Alaskan stakeholders are coordinated in their response. If we coordinate well and work together, we have the potential to connect every community across our state.” GRANT RECIPIENTS [provided by USDA]:# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-calls-for-quick-equitable-federal-assistance-for-alaskans-recovering-from-typhoon-merbok,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) spoke on the Senate floor today about the importance of federal disaster relief funds for communities that were recently hit by Typhoon Merbok, one of the strongest storms in Alaska’s history. Preliminary assessments show extensive damage to structures and essential infrastructure throughout the region. The Alaska congressional delegation sent a letter Tuesday to President Biden, urging him to immediately approve a federal disaster declaration request from Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, which the president is expected to do. On Thursday, the delegation sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell asking her to approve Governor Dunleavy’s request to waive the State of Alaska’s cost share for federal individual and public assistance for the typhoon recovery efforts. The request follows a similar request by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for Puerto Rico’s recovery from Hurricane Fiona. Further, Sen. Sullivan raised this issue with the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Alejandro Mayorkas, today. FEMA is a subsidiary agency of DHS.“Whenever there is a bill dealing with disaster relief, regardless of what part of the country it is, I always vote for it,” said Sen. Sullivan. “The reason I do that is because I come from a state that has earthquakes, wildfires, typhoons, and a lot of cold weather. We're tough in Alaska, but every now and then, we're going to need federal help—and now is the time we do.“I'm putting down a marker to make sure we have fairness as it relates to my constituents. The Majority Leader (Chuck Schumer) was here on the floor recently talking about the impact that Hurricane Fiona was having on Puerto Rico, and we're all thinking about Puerto Rico as well. We want to make sure they're all safe. If that's going to happen at the request of the majority leader, here's what else needs to happen—FEMA must pay 100 percent of the costs in Western Alaska too. “So we're all going to work together here in the Senate—whether it is Puerto Rico or Kentucky or Western Alaska. I just want to make sure my constituents know, we have your back here in D.C. We thank you for your resiliency, toughness, and everybody coming together. We'll make sure that whatever the results are in any of these other natural disasters, that Alaska is going to get the same result as well.”# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-strengthens-alaskas-wildfire-resilience,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) today announced the Department of the Interior (DOI) is investing over $3.3 million in funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to bolster wildfire resilience on nearly 8,000 acres of land across Alaska. These wildland fire management investments will increase fuels treatments in “high wildfire hazard potential” areas, which will help protect homes, businesses, and other critical infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contained significant funding to reduce catastrophic wildfires on federal lands through mechanical thinning, controlled burns, fuel breaks and other activities. The infrastructure law also featured funding to improve workforce training for firefighting and vegetation management, which specifically includes Alaska Native village fire crews. “Every year, Alaska’s wildfire season impacts communities and regions across our state—with more than three million acres burned this season, alone. I recognize the devastation that causes, so as we developed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I prioritized greater funding and new tools to accelerate thinning and fuel break work,” Senator Murkowski said. “I’m pleased to now see that benefitting Alaska through investments that will protect our lands and communities by reducing fire risks, ensuring we are better equipped to fight fires that do occur, and helping to restore affected ecosystems.” “Wildfires burn millions of acres in Alaska every year—sometimes as much or more than the combined acreage burned in the rest of the country. Our state clearly has a disproportionate need for the tools and federal resources that protect lives, homes and critical infrastructure from these natural disasters,” said Senator Sullivan. “I’m glad to see these significant federal funds coming to our state that Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young and I were able to secure in the bipartisan infrastructure bill. These federal resources will help our brave firefighters prepare for upcoming wildfire seasons, prevent out-of-control burns, and ultimately keep Alaskans safe.”Background: The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law on November 15, 2021. The law provides historic investments into roads, bridges, ports, airports, broadband, ferries, water and wastewater, resilience, and energy projects—modernizing and upgrading the nation’s core infrastructure. Senator Murkowski was a lead author and negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, which also garnered support from Senator Sullivan and the late Congressman Don Young. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-joe-biden-must-stop-using-our-military-to-push-political-agendas,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) gave a speech on the Senate floor yesterday condemning President Biden for advancing policies that weaken America’s military and distract from the military’s core mission of lethality. As Senator Sullivan noted, the president has continually proposed cuts to the defense budget, while American soldiers are advised to use food stamps, and attempted to politicize America’s armed forces by ordering Marines to stand as props in a partisan speech in Philadelphia. Further, Sen. Sullivan criticized the president for breaking precedent and firing appointees to the nation’s military academy boards, and establishing an unnecessary committee in the Pentagon to search out extremism. Senator Sullivan delivered his remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday.HIGHLIGHTS FROM HIS REMARKS: ON JOE BIDEN CALLING FOR A 5% REAL CUT TO THE MILITARY: “We've had a war in Ukraine. We've had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary of Defense testify in front of the Armed Services Committee that we're probably seeing the most dangerous time globally in any time in the last 40 years. “So what about the Biden budget this year? Mr. President, he did it again. This is actually [the] EPA, a 25% increase. . . You get down to the Department of Defense with now the nine percent Bidenflation. We're talking a five percent real cut to our military. So that is not prioritizing our military.”ON THE ARMY ADVISING SOLDIERS TO GO ON FOOD STAMPS AMID RECORD BIDENFLATION:“And Mr. President, you're starting to see how this inflation and other things are really impacting our troops. The Army last week in an article suggested that the American military members who are having trouble meeting ends meet because of high levels of inflation should go on food stamps. “Yeah you heard that correct: We're gonna give the EPA a 25% raise. We're gonna cut defense spending by a five percent real cut, and if you're a soldier struggling because of high inflation to actually put food on the table, you can go get food stamps. That's the perfect example of not prioritizing our military. . . But the President finds it absolutely essential to forgive $560 billion dollars in student loan debt just a couple of weeks ago? Who are the preponderance of Americans that will benefit from that lawless bailout? High-earning Americans, the elite White House staffers certainly. They're going to get a half-a-trillion dollar bailout and our troops are being told to go on food stamps. This should shock every single American.” ON JOE BIDEN USING THE MILITARY AS POLITICAL PROPS:“I don't think it's wise for every president to give the kind of partisan speech that President Biden gave on September 1 in Philadelphia, in which he vilified millions, tens of millions of his fellow Americans who don't agree with his administration's policies. Some of you may have seen that speech. The President told the country that many of his fellow Americans, all of whom are Republican, don't ‘respect the Constitution’ ‘are destroying American democracy. . .“He did all this, a clearly partisan speech, while being flanked by two active duty Marines as his political props. “Look at that. In my view, a sickening abuse of authority from a commander in chief who's never served in the military. I think he got five Vietnam deferments and knows nothing about the Marine Corps’ ethos of honor, courage, commitment. . .“The presence of these Marines was meant to politicize the president's speech and politically benefit from the honor and respect the few and the proud have earned in the hearts of Americans over decades, over millennium. This should disturb every single American, whether you're a Democrat or Republican. This was just wrong.”ON JOE BIDEN BREAKING PRECEDENT AND FIRING BOARD MEMBERS OF MILITARY ACADEMIES: “When President Biden came into office, he looked at West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy, and somebody said to him, you know what Mr. President, let's fire all the Trump appointees, let's fire them right now, all 18 of them, to clearly politicize the service academies of America. So that's what they did. Something that had never been done before by any president in the history of the country and they did it regardless of the qualifications of the current members serving on these boards.“Let me give you some examples: Retired Army Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster was fired off the West Point board. Ironically,the same day he was fired by President Biden’s White House, he was honored by the West Point Association of graduates as the distinguished graduate of the year of West Point. So one president fires him and West Point gives them a great honor. General Jack Keane, a former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army fired from the West Point Board. Retired Army Colonel Douglas MacGregor an Afghanistan war veteran, clinical psychologist Meaghan Mobbs, a Bronze Star recipient, businessman David Urban, and a retired Army Lieutenant General, Guy Swan.“18 qualified people, all fired. The politicization of the service academies of America was undertaken by this administration. First president, first White House ever to do it – all fired by Joe Biden and not allowed to fill their terms.” FULL REMARKS:Mr. President, there's been much made in the Biden administration about the value of diversity, and I agree that having diversity in any organization, it's positive. You get different viewpoints, but diversity encompasses much more than race or gender or religious orientation. Those are all important. Diversity actually means having people around you with varied experiences. And as I mentioned, in my mind that's certainly important, but it's particularly important in the Oval Office. It's particularly important in the White House. It's particularly important in the leadership of our federal government. Let's take the example of military experience in this administration. You think that the Biden administration would think it's important to have members in his cabinet or senior White House officials who have served in the military. After all, he's the Commander-in-Chief, very important part of his responsibilities, but in fact, Mr. President, virtually no one in this administration, with the exception of Secretary Austin at the highest levels, cabinet officials, senior White House officials have any significant military experience at all. Why does this matter? The President doesn't have it of course, the secretary of the V.A., chief of staff, national security adviser – just go down the list. Nobody has any experience. In the federal government of the United States. Why does this matter? It matters, Mr. President because it's obvious by the people this President surrounds himself, the people who are giving him advice on big decisions for America that this president doesn't prioritize military, our national defense, and our troops and their families. And this manifests itself in many, many ways.First, most importantly, it matters in how we fund our national defense. Now, I was on the floor last week, speaking about this very topic. This is President Biden's first budget. If you can see this here, that he proposed, it has the increases to every federal agency. This is a multi-trillion dollar budget and it says this is what we're prioritizing in the Biden administration. And you see heck, double-digit, that's education, commerce, E.P.A over 20%, interior over 15%, on and on and on, all the green. Just a massive expansion of federal agencies, except two agencies: Department of Defense and Homeland Security. The two agencies that actually protect Americans.If you look for this line of inflation, which when the Biden administration put out their budget last year was about 4.5%. These are actual inflation-adjusted real cuts by about two to three percent to our military. That was the Biden budget, not prioritizing our troops, our national security at all. My view is that's the number one job of this government. Not the President's view, not his team's view.Okay, so in the interim, that was last year's budget. We've had a war in Ukraine. We've had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Defense testify in front of the Armed Services Committee that we're probably seeing the most dangerous time globally in any time in the last 40 years.So what about the Biden budget this year? Mr. President, he did it again. This is actually EPA, a 25% increase, wow okay, but here we go, all the big double-digit increases. You get down to the Department of Defense with now the nine percent Bidenflation. We're talking a five percent real cut to our military. So that is not prioritizing our military. And Mr. President, you're starting to see how this inflation and other things are really impacting our troops. The Army last week in an article suggested that the American military members who are having trouble meeting ends meet because of high levels of inflation should go on food stamps.Yeah you heard that correct: We're gonna give the EPA a 25% raise. We're gonna cut defense spending by a five percent real cut, and if you're a soldier struggling because of high inflation to actually put food on the table, you can go get food stamps. That's the perfect example of not prioritizing our military and I want to unpack this further, Mr. President. The Army is saying that our troops don't have enough food to eat – they should look at going on food stamps. But the President finds it absolutely essential to forgive $560 billion dollars in student loan debt just a couple of weeks ago.Who are the preponderance of Americans that will benefit from that lawless bailout? High-earning Americans, the elite White House staffers certainly. They're going to get a half a trillion dollar bailout and our troops are being told to go on food stamps. This should shock every single American. So we know the President and his team don't prioritize the military. Look at these budgets for our troops or our national security, but that doesn't mean they don't find the military useful. Now. Mr. President, I'm gonna put up a picture of a recent speech that I will tell you, every time I look at it, my blood boils and so should every American’s blood boil. It's this picture. Now, Mr. President, every president gives partisan speeches. Now, I don't think it's wise for every president to give the kind of partisan speech that President Biden gave on September 1 in Philadelphia, in which he vilified millions, tens of millions of his fellow Americans who don't agree with his administration's policies. Some of you may have seen that speech. The President told the country that many of his fellow Americans, all of whom are Republican, don't “respect the Constitution” “are destroying American democracy.”He gave this speech against a blood-red backdrop fists clenched. Look at him, yelling that millions of his fellow Americans embrace anger while he embraced anger in his speech and chaos. This President who continually issues lawless executive orders like shutting down ANWR in my state, his half a trillion dollar student loan bailout, then says that Republicans are quote against the rule of law. He went on and on, the insults, very partisan, somewhat deranged, attacking tens of millions of his fellow Americans.Now look, Presidents do that. I don't think it's a good idea. But here's the thing about this speech, Mr. President. To make matters worse. Look at this. He did all this, a clearly partisan speech, while being flanked by two active duty Marines as his political props. Look at that. In my view, a sickening abuse of authority from a commander in chief who's never served in the military. I think he got five Vietnam deferments and knows nothing about the Marine Corps’ ethos of honor, courage, commitment.Remember, when General Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and was Chairman under President Trump as well, released a video where he apologized for standing beside the President, then President Trump, when that could have been perceived as political. This is what General Milley said: “I should have not been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military being involved in domestic politics.”I thought that was a good speech by General Milley. He made a mistake. He apologized and that was the right thing to do. Mr. President. This is much worse. This is much worse, these Marines, unlike General Milley, they're being ordered to stand next to the President of the United States while he rants against millions of his own fellow Americans and the President certainly didn't apologize for this speech.In fact, when criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for the politicization of the military with these Marines propped up next to him, the Biden administration actually doubled down in terms of their use of these two active duty Marines as political props in a very partisan speech. Here's what the spokesperson at the White House said, “the presence of the Marines at that speech was intended to demonstrate the deep abiding respect the President has for these service members to the ideals in the unique role of our independent military plays in defending our democracy no matter who is in power.”This is Orwellian doublespeak. What a bunch of nonsense. Here's the fact, Mr. President. The presence of these Marines was meant to politicize the President's speech and politically benefit from the honor and respect the few and the proud have earned in the hearts of Americans over decades, over millennium. This should disturb every single American, whether you're a Democrat or Republican. This was just wrong. Let me provide another example of the politicization of our military by the Biden administration. Now, this is something hasn't gotten a lot of attention, some people like hey, it wasn't really a big deal. I actually think it was a big deal.We have some of the best service academies in the world. They are the best in the world, the U.S. Naval Academy, West Point, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy. Each of our military services’ academies has board members, some of whom are appointed by the President of the United States for three-year terms. Now I am honored to serve on the U. S. Naval Academy Board. I was appointed as a member of the Armed Services Committee.Here's the tradition in our country that every single president has abided by when they come into office: They let the board members finish out their terms. So for example, when President Trump was elected, the Obama administration officials who are President Obama's appointees, finished out their terms on the Naval Academy board, The West Point Board, the Air Force Academy Board. That's what we do. The point is not to politicize the service academies. That has always been the tradition. Every single president except for Joe Biden.When President Biden came into office, he looked at West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy, and somebody said to him, you know what Mr. President, let's fire all the Trump appointees, let's fire them right now, all 18 of them, to clearly politicize the service academies of America. So that's what they did. Something that had never been done before by any president in the history of the country and they did it regardless of the qualifications of the current members serving on these boards.Let me give you some examples. Retired Army Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster was fired off the West Point board ironically the same day he was fired by President Biden’s White House, he was honored by the West Point Association of graduates as the distinguished graduate of the year of West Point. So one president fires him and West Point gives them a great honor. General Jack Keane, a former Vice Chief of staff of the Army fired from the West Point Board. Retired Army Colonel Douglas MacGregor an Afghanistan war veteran, clinical psychologist Meaghan Mobbs, a Bronze Star recipient, and businessman David Urban, a retired Army Lieutenant General, Guy Swan.18 qualified people, all fired. The politicization of the service academies of America was undertaken by this administration. First president, first White House ever to do it – all fired by Joe Biden and not allowed to fill their terms.And of course, Mr. President, the Biden administration loves to use our military to push other agendas that have nothing to do with lethality in winning our nation's wars. Many, many examples. Let me give you just a couple from the beginning, issuing executive orders, not focused on how we have a stronger military but using taxpayer dollars to establish a committee within the Pentagon to do what ended up being witch hunts on so-called extremists in the military, of which, when they came back with their report, they said they had actions of .005%. They also issued executive orders to use taxpayer dollars to mandate transgender transition surgeries for active duty soldiers. Importantly, they become non deployable when that happens. So, Mr. President, back to my original point. No one in senior positions in the White House or the cabinet with the exception of Secretary Austin has significant military experience. And on so many of these issues there's no adult in the room. Think about these White House conversations where they're talking about, hey, let's cut the Defense budget and will grow the E.P.A. by 25%. That's a great idea, Mr. President. Let's make sure we give a partisan speech at Independence Hall and oh yeah, let's grab a couple of active duty Marines and stand right next to the President as his props. That's a great idea, Mr. President. Let's come in and politicize the service academies and fire all the Trump administration appointees, even American heroes like H. R. McMaster, General Keane, despite the fact that no president had ever done that before. Great idea, Mr. President. This is really problematic what we're seeing right now in that lack of prioritization extends here in the U.S. Senate. Unfortunately, as it relates to our military, as we know with regard to Defense budget cuts.In the 2020 NDAA, we had a debate right here on the Senate floor, where my colleague, the junior senator from Vermont proposed an amendment to dramatically cut our military – almost by 15% across the board cuts. He even actually wrote an op-ed in Politico, remember this is when the Democrats were pushing defund the police.Here's the op-ed. It actually is called “Defund the Pentagon: the Liberal Case.” I'd like to submit this for the record. The junior Senator from Vermont wrote that. The Majority Leader put out a tweet saying he was a proud supporter of the defund the Pentagon amendment. That's right here on the Senate floor.And of course, Mr. President, there's the National Defense Authorization Act, The number one bill that focuses on national defense for our nation, that passed out of committee, the Armed Services Committee in June, in a very strong bipartisan vote, 23-3, passed the House in July, will have pay raises for our troops so the Army doesn't have to tell them to go line up for food stamps because they're hungry and we need to bring it to the floor right here.So what are we doing? As far as I can tell, the Majority Leader doesn't want to bring up the Defense Authorization Act until December. That's why I joined a letter led by Senator Tuberville who I serve on the Armed Services Committee with, signed by twenty of my colleagues to say to the majority leader, Mr. Majority Leader, we have a dangerous world right now. Bring the NDAA to the floor. It's gonna pass. It's got great support. By the way, Mr. President. I know that Democrat senators feel this way too on this topic.So we need to get this body back to what's important for our country, bolstering our economy, fighting inflation, bringing down energy costs, unleashing American energy, and definitely passing the legislation that funds our military that provides pay raises for our troops during this very dangerous time. So I ask the Majority Leader to bring the NDAA to the floor. We need it, and I call on the President and his administration, the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, to truly prioritize our military and their families. And that begins with putting an end to using them in a disgraceful way as political props for your partisan agenda. I yield the floor.###"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-press-biden-administration-to-quickly-re-approve-ambler-road-project,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, recently sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland reiterating their strong support for the Ambler Access Project (Ambler Road).The senators called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to promptly complete its work to re-approve the Ambler Road following DOI’s request for a voluntary remand of the project’s Record of Decision (ROD). Murkowski and Sullivan specifically urged DOI to commit to a concrete timeline, allow the project proponent to continue important baseline scientific work, and allow geotechnical drilling to proceed.The Senators also reiterated that failure to satisfy the court’s remand order in a timely and narrow manner would defy federal law, prevent hard-working Alaskans from accessing jobs that support their families at a time of painfully high inflation, and worsen projected shortfalls of strategic minerals and metals that are crucial to clean energy and many other technologies.“This Congressionally-mandated access is essential to ensuring the economic stability of both Alaska and the nation. In Alaska alone, the Project has the potential to facilitate over 8,700 direct, indirect, and induced construction and operation jobs and nearly $700 million in annual wages. That would be top of an annual average of 360 direct jobs over the road’s construction period, and up to 81 direct annual jobs for road operations and maintenance over the life of the road.”…“Given assurances that the remand would be “timely” and given the importance of the Project to Alaska and national security, we are concerned that DOI’s first status report, filed with the Court on July 18, 2022, indicated the Department was “not yet able to identify a timeframe for completion of a draft and final supplemental environmental impact statement.” We anecdotally understand that the timeframe could be up to three years, which is categorically unacceptable and deeply contrary to every reasonable expectation for how the voluntary remand would proceed.… “Given the seven years of cooperation between all applicable federal agencies, the comprehensive [Joint Record of Decision], and the Congressionally-recognized importance of completing the Project on an expedited basis, we urge you to take the necessary steps to move the Project forward and complete the voluntary remand in a timely, workable, and definitive timeframe. Otherwise, DOI will jeopardize economic and national security by increasing our reliance on adversaries like China for those strategic minerals necessary for our defense, competitiveness, and future prosperity.”The Ambler Road would provide access to the mining district and facilitate the responsible development of high-grade mineral deposits—including copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, and other metals—in northwest Alaska. A right-of-way across federal land is guaranteed by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). These critical minerals are crucial to all aspects of modern technology and national security and will help prevent the shortfalls that S&P Global, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and others have forecast in recent months.  The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) initially submitted its application to develop the 211-mile Ambler Road project in November 2015, making this the seventh full year of federal regulatory review. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a draft EIS on August 30, 2019 and held 22 public meetings in local communities, Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Washington, D.C. prior to issuing a favorable ROD in July 2020. Despite that, the Biden administration sought and won approval to voluntarily remand the ROD on February 22, 2022. With no apparent sense of irony, President Biden held a roundtable on “Securing Critical Minerals for a Future Made in America” that very same day—failing to recognize that the Ambler Mining District is one of the nation’s best options to produce them.On Tuesday, September 20, 2022, BLM initiated a 45-day public scoping process for a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the Ambler Road project. BLM’s notice of intent states that the agency will evaluate a “range of alternatives” related to a range of topics but provides no timeframe for the completion of this additional review.  To read the senators’ full letter regarding the Ambler Road, click here.  # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-senate-demand-un-end-chinas-charade-as-a-developing-nation,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. Senate today voted unanimously in favor of an amendment offered by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) conditioning the Senate’s ratification of updates to the Montreal Protocol (known as the Kigali Amendment) on the U.S. taking action to remove China’s designation as a “developing nation.” In his remarks on the Senate floor prior to the amendment vote, Sen. Sullivan argued that China, by any fair measure, is not a “developing nation,” and should no longer be able to exploit UN concessions and aid–often funded by U.S. taxpayers—to comply with international agreements, like the Montreal Protocol. Sullivan said the larger, unfair, non-reciprocal relationship between the United States and China must change.“There is an element of this treaty that raises a principle that is at stake right now that is so important with regard to China, the United States, and the rest of the world,” said Sen. Sullivan. “This treaty continues to classify China as a ‘developing country.’ Why does that matter? It’s a facade. China is not a developing country. China is the second largest economy in the world. China is one of the most industrialized countries in the world. China has one of the biggest militaries in the world. The World Bank now even considers China to be an ‘upper middle income’ country. But what China keeps trying to do in international organizations and in international treaties is continue to get the same benefits afforded to truly developing countries. “In this treaty, the developing country ‘annex’ gives developing nations much more time to implement the treaty as well as funding from the U.N. to implement the treaty. Where does that funding come from? Most of it comes from the United States. So, in essence, right now, the way the treaty is organized, the United States gives the U.N. money to help implement the treaty, and a lot of that money is going to go to China. Does anyone in the U.S. Senate think that makes sense. Does anyone in America think that makes sense. It does not.” The updates to the Montreal Protocol, known as the “Kigali Amendment,” seek to completely phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), substances found in many household products that studies have shown erode the Earth’s ozone layer and contribute to an increase in global temperatures. The Kigali Amendment was ratified by the Senate on a vote of 69 to 27. Sen. Sullivan ultimately voted against ratification because the treaty abdicates U.S. sovereignty over environmental regulations to the U.N., and would increase costs for American consumers with negligible potential impacts on global climate. # # #"

Approximately one thousand miles of coastline were impacted. Residents are experiencing widespread flooding; power, water, and communication disruption; severe damage to private homes, personal property, and businesses…“Because very cold weather and freeze-up in many parts of our state are a few weeks away, it is crucial that Alaska has the resources necessary to provide heating fuel for winter and to quickly continue the process of rebuilding.”The full letter can be found here and below:Dear Mr. President:We write to urge your immediate consideration of Governor Michael Dunleavy’s request for a Major Disaster declaration under Section 401  of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to support Alaska’s recovery from the impact of Typhoon Merbok on Alaskan families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure. This was the strongest storm in seventy years to impact our state. The damage to Western Alaska is extensive and federal assistance is essential to help Alaskans recover in the wake of this destructive event and mitigate against future severe weather events.On September 16 to 18, 2022, remnants of Typhoon Merbok produced widespread destruction and severe damage to Western Alaska. Approximately one thousand miles of coastline were impacted. Residents are experiencing widespread flooding; power, water, and communication disruption; severe damage to private homes, personal property, and businesses.Alaskans are resilient. Nowhere was this more evident than in the actions of our state and local emergency management teams, as well as the first responder and public works personnel in the hours leading up to the storm’s landfall and now following the storm. Our State emergency response team members are working day and night to ensure that our communities are safe and that utilities, services, and major infrastructure are operational as soon as possible. Alaska’s public servants are instrumental in mitigating the immediate impact of the storm in Western Alaska. However, much more needs to be done. Governor Dunleavy indicated in his request that the damage was of such severity and scale that additional federal assistance is necessary to supplement the actions of our State agencies. Because very cold weather and freeze-up in many parts of our state are a few weeks away, it is crucial that Alaska has the resources necessary to provide heating fuel for winter and to quickly continue the process of rebuilding.Typhoon Merbok affected more than infrastructure: it is affecting Alaska’s people – especially those in rural communities that, for example, did not have broadband access or easy access to supplies pre-storm, or for that matter any roads to their communities. Some Alaskans have lost their homes while others have lost vehicles essential to survival in rural communities and other personal property. We are appreciative for the prompt attention your Administration and the Region 10 FEMA team have provided to the state during and immediately following the storm. We write with urgency to seek your quick approval of Governor Dunleavy’s request given the scope of the damage, fast approaching winter weather, and overall impact on Alaskans. Thank you for your attention to this emergency matter."

In their letter, the Alaska congressional delegation noted that the project has been developed under the strictest environmental standards in the world and is strongly supported by Alaska Native leaders, labor leaders, the State of Alaska, legislators from both parties, and President Joe Biden.“The expeditious approval of this crucial project would greatly benefit Alaska, our nation, and the world, while demonstrating the Administration’s commitment to addressing inflation, high energy costs, the need for greater energy security, and environmental justice initiatives,” the delegation wrote. “After years of study and review, both the Administration and Alaskans can feel confident that the Project will abide by the strictest environmental considerations in the world, while being constructed and operated by a company with an impressive record of safe and responsible development on the North Slope. “We believe the final SEIS should identify the preferred alternative; appropriately weight the purpose of energy production in the NPR-A; and recognize the public interest in supporting energy security and responsible resource development. The permitting process must be completed by the end of 2022 at very latest so the project’s proponent can make a final investment decision and hire Alaskans in time for the winter construction season.

Sen. Sullivan championed an increase in appropriation levels that will enable the Coast Guard to carry out vessel capitalization and infrastructure development, particularly in the Arctic and Alaska, and support its wide range of missions, including stopping the movement of drugs and illegal migrants, enforcing U.S. laws at sea, combatting illegal fishing, and protecting the nation’s borders. The authorization also provides significant support for Coast Guardsmen and their families through pay and benefits improvements, providing service members with greater peace of mind as they fulfill their duties to the country.“The service and sacrifice of our brave Coast Guardsmen are just as important to our country as our other uniformed military members. My Commerce colleagues and I have crafted a bill that makes great strides in fulfilling our commitment to this branch of the U.S. military with the support, funding and attention the U.S. Coast Guard deserves,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Our authorization will ensure America’s Coast Guardsmen have the most advanced and robust fleet of vessels and shore-side infrastructure to continue successfully executing their wide array of critical missions in defense of our nation.” Major authorizations in the 2022 Coast Guard Authorization Act include:Arctic and Alaska Focus “As the state with America’s only Arctic territory and the largest Coast Guard base in the country, Alaska is a critical focus of the U.S. Coast Guard,” said Sen.

Those investments include fully funding the third Polar Security Cutter and creating a program office to begin work on the next class of icebreakers, which we will need to deter our adversaries and secure America’s interests in the Arctic. Also important for our state, this legislation will improve the communication systems mariners rely on to stay safe and alert on the high seas—a key concern of Alaska fishermen in the wake of the Russian naval exercises off of our coastline in 2020.” Sen.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-criticizes-biden-and-schumer-for-failing-to-prioritize-national-defense,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), yesterday criticized President Joe Biden for again proposing an inflation-adjusted cut to the Department of Defense, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for failing to quickly bring the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to the floor for a vote. Sen. Sullivan’s remarks on the Senate floor followed a letter he sent with Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and 21 other senators calling on Sen. Schumer not to delay the NDAA any further given the myriad of national security crises facing the country. Sen. Sullivan and a bipartisan majority of his SASC colleagues passed the FY 2023 NDAA out of committee in June with a $45 billion higher top-line than President Biden’s defense proposal. In his remarks, Sen. Sullivan noted that General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has testified recently that the current period involves “the greatest threat to peace and security” in the world in his entire career. But Majority Leader Schumer is reportedly pushing consideration of the NDAA, the bill responsible for authorizing programs and resources necessary to respond to national security threats, back to December. Sen. Sullivan said the delay of this legislation, like President Biden’s proposed inflation-adjusted cut to critical defense funding, underscores Sen. Schumer and the Biden administration’s “perilous priorities” that will only embolden America’s adversaries.TranscriptMadam President, my colleague from Tennessee was just talking about priorities of this administration and this Senate, and I want to continue on that area of focus, relating to what many of us believe is probably the most important priority we have in the U.S. Senate, and that is defending our Nation.Budgets are a reflection of an administration's values and an administration's priorities. And as I mentioned, many of us--and I believe on both sides of the aisle--see that the No. 1 priority we should have in the U.S. Senate is making sure we are a strong nation, to defend this great country of ours and to make sure we have the most lethal, well-trained military anywhere in the world, and that we take care of our troops and their families. But this is not what this administration--the Biden administration--believes at all. In fact, President Biden's budgets clearly not only do not prioritize our military; they put them consistently last. And that is not a one-time thing. This is a pattern with this administration.Here was the President's proposed budget last year. Take a look at it. We all know it was trillions and trillions. Department of Commerce, 28 percent increase. EPA, 21 percent. Interior, 16 percent--on and on. There are double-digit increases everywhere except--except--in the two Agencies that actually protect the Nation: the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.Last year, the Biden budget put forward a budget that, if it was adjusted for inflation, was almost a 3-percent cut to the Department of Defense. Priorities matter. This administration has not prioritized our military at all.Guess who was really pleased by that budget, by the way? The dictator in Beijing and the dictator in Moscow. No doubt when they saw that, they loved it. Thankfully, the Armed Services Committee, on which I sit, said: Do you know what, Mr. President? With all due respect, this is nuts. We are not going to stand for this. We put forward in the National Defense Authorization Act last year a 3-percent real increase to the Department of Defense budget. It was very bipartisan in the committee, a complete rebuke to the President of the United States, saying: We don't believe in cuts. We are going to increase. The appropriators, thankfully, did the same. So that was the Biden administration's prioritization of our military last year. Now, what happened between last year and this year, when the most recent budget came out? Well, I think a lot of us know, but I am going to talk a little bit about it.Russia invaded Ukraine, and at an April Armed Services hearing, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, said that the invasion was ``the greatest threat to the peace and security of Europe and perhaps the world in any of my time of 42 years in uniform.''So this is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying we are likely seeing one of the most dangerous periods anywhere in the world in terms of national security in the last four decades. That was testimony from the President's own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.That is Russia. And, of course, their ally China is also taking incredibly aggressive actions all around the world. They are beginning to outcompete our country on many fronts--critical minerals, energy, technology. Certainly, Xi Jinping, the dictator of Beijing, has increased China's aggression all around the world--in India, threatening to invade Taiwan, economic aggression toward Australia, snuffing out liberty in Hong Kong. What else has China done? It is dramatically increasing its defense spending--more than 7 percent this year--increasing a navy that is almost becoming larger than ours.This is how General Milley, again, put it in a hearing last April: We are now facing two global powers, China and Russia, each with significant military capabilities, both of whom intend to fundamentally change the current rules-based global order. We are entering a world that is becoming more unstable and the potential for significant international conflict between great powers is increasing, not decreasing. So that is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, again.Now, what do you think the President did, seeing we had this incredibly dangerous period internationally, with his next budget? Last year, as I mentioned, he cut the Pentagon defense budget by almost 3 percent and dead last with Homeland Security in terms of Agencies.So did he listen to his Chairman? Does he really think it is that dangerous? Let's see.This is this year's defense budget and other priorities from this administration's multitrillion dollar budget, and, once again, you see the EPA coming in at a 24-percent increase. Commerce, HHS, and Labor are all double-digit--Interior, DOJ.What about the Department of Defense? It is a 4-percent increase with almost 9-percent inflation. We are talking close to a 5-percent real cut to the Department of Defense. This is outrageous. Last year, the President put forward almost a 4-percent cut to defense spending. In the interim period, we had one of the most dangerous wars that has happened--certainly in Europe and maybe in the world--in a generation. The President's own Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff come before the Senate Armed Services Committee and say it is an incredibly dangerous time--a period, maybe, in almost 50 years in which we haven't seen so many threats to the international order. And the President does what? He, once again, prioritizes our defense almost dead last--almost dead last. Adjusted for inflation, it is a 5-percent cut. Now, with this posture hearing for the Secretary of Defense and Chairman Milley, I asked the question: Gentlemen, with all due respect, you just said it is the most dangerous period in almost the last 50 years. How can you come before this committee and put forward a budget that is almost a 5-percent cut to the Department of Defense and our troops?They didn't have a good answer. The truth of the matter is, I am quite certain that the uniformed military and probably even Secretary Austin do not support this budget, but they are good soldiers. They had to salute the Commander in Chief and try to support it. But we don't have to support it, and I know the American people certainly don't support it. Once again, I do know two people who support it. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping look at this, and this is something they are very pleased with.Once again, the Armed Services Committee, when we met to mark up the NDAA, voted in an overwhelming bipartisan fashion--23 to 3--to, once again, dramatically rebuke the President in a bipartisan way and significantly increase the top line for the Department of Defense to make sure we have a strong nation and that our troops are taken care of and their families by almost $45 billion over what the President requested. It was a bipartisan rebuke, once again, of this administration that won't prioritize our national security and that keeps putting forward budgets that prioritize the defense of our Nation last.We also started in this NDAA to course-correct, which we need to do dramatically at the Pentagon. We have had civilian leadership, primarily driven by the Biden administration's far-left nominees, who have not been focusing the Pentagon on its top priority, which is to win our Nation's wars and to make sure we have the most lethal military of any country in the world. So I was able in this NDAA to put forward some amendments that I was glad to get bipartisan support on, that are in the current NDAA, to start a course correction.First, one of my amendments directs the Pentagon to discontinue any further investment in the DOD-wide effort to root out so-called extremism within the ranks. This has been an obsession of the civilian leadership at the Pentagon, many of whom know nothing about the military. It is an obsession, given the incredibly low rate of extremist activity in our military as determined by the Secretary of Defense's own working group on this topic.The press didn't write about that because they love to kind of weave into the story that somehow our military is full of extremists. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle play that up too. One Senator, at one point, said 10 percent of the military might be extremist--a ridiculous besmirching of the men and women in our armed services. The actual report from the Secretary of Defense's office found fewer than 100 cases of extremist activity in a total military force of over 2 million people. When you do the math, that is less than .005 percent. So let me be clear: Extremism has no place in our military and must be rooted out when discovered, but these numbers simply don't warrant the time and investment that our senior military has put into this issue. So, in the NDAA, we have said we are not funding it anymore. There is a second issue in the NDAA for which I was able to put forward an amendment. The Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force, according to press reports, were starting to devise a policy that would allow each servicemember to veto their duty assignment if they disagreed with the laws and regulations in a State or in a community where they were going to be assigned by the military.Could you imagine the chaos that would result if every soldier, marine, sailor, or airman could say: ``You know, I don't want to go to California; its regulations on the Second Amendment are overly burdensome on my Second Amendment right,'' or for any other reason? So we said, in the NDAA, a policy that gives service men and women the ability to veto their assignments based on whether they want to go somewhere or not is not the way our military is going to operate. That has been nipped in the bud.Finally, there is a very simple amendment that I put forward that just provides clarity to the men and women of the Department of Defense. All it does is remind them of what their job is. The military is too often asked to do so many different things--to focus on climate change and to focus on so many other issues. The military has one job: to provide combat-credible military forces needed to deter our adversaries, to protect the security of our Nation, and to win our Nation's wars when called upon to do so.I put forward an amendment that said just that: Here is your priority, and here is what you are supposed to do. It is needed because of all of the things that our top civilian leaders are now telling the troops they should be focused on. They should be focused on prevailing in a war if they are called on to do so, and that is what my amendment did. Believe it or not, a number of Senators voted against it, but that also made the Defense Authorization Act this year.In addition to significantly increasing the Department of Defense's authorized budget, we are starting to, once again, get the military focused on their primary job: lethality and winning wars.So we need to bring the NDAA to the floor. We have passed it 66 years in a row. As I mentioned, the administration's priorities are clearly not with regard to national defense and our military. We can tell by the budget that has been put forward. In the Senate, priorities are often determined by the time on the floor to get a piece of legislation moving. It is clear to everybody who has been here that the majority leader does not prioritize the military in the same way that the President of the United States doesn't.We passed the NDAA in June--the Armed Services Committee did--in a huge bipartisan vote. The House passed its NDAA in the House in July. So we are waiting to bring up one of the most important pieces of legislation we work on every year: the legislation that sets the policy and funds our troops and their families.Where is it?Senator Schumer, where is it? When are we going to bring it up?You have Democrats and Republicans who are looking at this floor time in September, saying: We need to bring up the NDAA. The rumor, right now, is that the majority leader plans to bring it up in December. Think about that, America. I don't even know what we are doing right now on the Senate floor--minor nominations. We should be bringing up the NDAA to protect this country and to make sure the men and women in our military know we have their backs. Right now, nobody has any idea--maybe the majority leader does--as to when we are actually going to bring this most important bipartisan piece of legislation to the floor. This is why I joined in a letter that we sent out today, led by Senator Tuberville, who serves on the Armed Services Committee with me, signed by 20 of my colleagues. By the way, I know it would have been signed by some Democratic colleagues as well. They didn't want to put their names on the letter, but they feel the same. It says to the majority leader: You control the Senate. You control the priorities of this body. Bring up the NDAA by the end of September. Here is the letter. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.Madam President, the letter says:At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, ``When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well.'' As General Milley said, at one of the most dangerous times in recent history, it is vital that our civil and military powers cooperate. What we need to do in this body right now is get back to the important work of bolstering our economy, of fighting inflation, of bringing down energy costs, of unleashing American energy, and, most importantly, of passing the NDAA so we can bolster the national security of this great Nation in very dangerous times. I call on the majority leader, along with 20 of my colleagues and some of my Democratic colleagues, to bring the NDAA to the floor and not wait until the end of the year, which is what we hear he is planning to do. # # #"

The House of Representatives approved its version of the legislation in July with a broad, bipartisan majority voting in support. The letter, sent late Wednesday, invoked the words of George Washington while calling on Leader Schumer to schedule a vote on the NDAA in time for an open Senate amendment process to take place. Among other priorities, the legislation funds military technology, strengthens capabilities, and delivers a 4.6 percent pay raise to America’s service members. “At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well. Two centuries later, that still rings true.

Following the event, the Senators released the following statements.“I congratulate Congresswoman Peltola on her swearing-in and welcome her, not only as a member of our delegation, but also as the first Alaska Native to ever serve in Congress,” said Senator Murkowski.“Congresswoman Peltola’s swearing-in will ensure Alaskans once again have a voice in the House. Congresswoman Peltola has a huge task ahead, but I am committed to be there to help her transition into her new role as quickly and seamlessly as possible. I particularly appreciate her commitment to representing all Alaskans, just as Congressman Young always did, and am glad to have her with us in the fight for our state’s future.”“I appreciated the opportunity to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Congresswoman Peltola and officially welcome her to Congress,” said Senator Sullivan. “I have spoken with Mary and offered my and my staff’s assistance on case work for individual Alaskans, setting up her office, and on matters of policy, particularly those that relate to advancing Alaska’s interests, like the Willow and Ambler projects, and pushing back against the Biden administration’s unprecedented shutdown of our state.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-lankford-colleagues-stand-up-for-female-athletes,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) were joined by 10 other Republican senators in sending a letter to Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona urging the secretary to withdraw a recently proposed Title IX rule that pushes far-left gender ideology on schools receiving federal financial assistance. The senators argued that the rule runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute and congressional intent and would have the opposite effect of Title IX’s intent by further eroding women’s equality, privacy and safety. Joining Sullivan and Lankford are Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jim Risch (R-Id.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Roger Marshall, M.D., (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) is leading the letter in the House of Representatives.The members write in their letter, “Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.”You can read the full letter HERE and below:Secretary Cardona,We write to express our grave concern with the intent and implications of the US Department of Education’s Proposed Rule: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, RIN 1870-AA16 (Proposed Rule), and urge the Administration to immediately withdraw the rule. Among other harmful changes, the Proposed Rule expands the scope of Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as Congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule. On June 23, 1972, after in depth Congressional consideration and subsequent agreement, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX into law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives either direct or indirect federal funding. Title IX ensures women and girls are given the same opportunities in school afforded to men and boys. Unfortunately, over the past decade, two Administrations have attempted to undercut the statutory purpose of the law and to use it as a way to promote progressive gender ideology. In 2010 and 2011, the Obama Administration sent multiple Dear Colleague letters to every public school and university in the country to expand policies related to campus assault and harassment. Since it was merely a Dear Colleague letter and not a rule, these “regulations” were implemented outside of the formal federal rulemaking process, clearly in order to bypass such process.The Departments of Education and Justice subsequently sent another Dear Colleague letter in 2016, again to all public schools and universities in the country, claiming that, “[a]s a condition of receiving Federal funds,” schools must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX.”As a result, schools were prohibited from maintaining separate locker rooms, shower facilities, and restrooms for male and female students based on their biological differences. Because the letters lacked foundation in Title IX’s statutory text, and it attempted to create federal policy outside of the public rulemaking process, they did not carry the force of law, and created a lack of clarity around the scope, application and enforcement of Title IX. The policies pushed in the letters caused mass confusion among states, schools, parents and children.  Thankfully, both letters were swiftly revoked in 2017. Further, the Trump Administration issued a rule to prevent and respond to instances of sexual harassment and assault. Among other things, the rule respected Title IX’s statutory text and Congressional intent; it protected both victims and the accused, while also taking important steps to ensure that religious freedom protected by clarifying what institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX. The current Administration has seized our nation’s primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, to enact political, social and cultural change, with no regard for the harmful repercussions or the rule of law.  On his first day in office, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. Contrary to the protections Congress afforded to women and girls under Title IX, this Executive Order unfairly called for the elimination of equal opportunity for girls in sports and dangerously suggested that children in schools should not have access to sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms and other private spaces.As if that wasn’t enough, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a memorandum in March 2021 that further misinterpreted Title IX.  As a legal foundation for its misapplication of the law, DOJ cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that “an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.’” Notably, the opinion in Bostock explicitly stated that it applies only to hiring and firing decisions under Title VII, leaving other issues and other laws for another day.The Department of Education followed DOJ’s lead by publishing a notice of interpretation to assert that Title IX’s protections extend to claims based on “sexual orientation and gender identity.” This interpretation, which rewrites the plain meaning of sex, is now in the Proposed Rule.The Proposed Rule would radically redefine discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity (both of which are left without clear definitions), sex stereotypes, (defined as “fixed or generalized expectations regarding a person’s aptitudes, behavior, self-presentation, or other attributes based on sex”), and sex characteristics, (which includes “a person’s physiological sex characteristics and other inherently sex-based traits,” or “intersex traits”).The Proposed Rule claim that because the statute does not explicitly define sex as biological, “the Department does not construe the term ‘sex’ to necessarily be limited to a single component of an individual's anatomy or physiology."" To be clear, sex is biological. Unlike the assertions in the Proposed Rule, “sex” does not “encompass many traits.” Sex is not one’s self-asserted belief about himself or herself based on emotions, preference, self-presentation or behavior. Sex is binary. People are either male or female as demonstrated by their DNA, reproductive biology and other immutable characteristics. The proposed rule’s attempt to expand the definition of sex, while simultaneously neglecting to clearly define what the Department means by such an expansive definition, demonstrates that it is more focused on pushing an ideology rather than protecting individuals from discrimination.There is no question that this expansion of the meaning of sex goes far beyond the statute, Congressional intent, and Supreme Court opinions. Indeed, while the Proposed Rule attempts to find its footing in the holding of Bostock, the Court’s decision is based on the reality that sex refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female.” It’s clear that regardless of Title IX’s statutory text and the requirements of the rulemaking process, the Department of Education is pushing schools to apply Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to sexual orientation and gender identity. This is antithetical to the statutory text and congressional intent of Title IX and should not be finalized.By passing Title IX, Congress recognized the need for explicit laws to protect women and girls and promote a level playing field for equal opportunities within education.In addition to its dissonance with the law, the Proposed Rule will disadvantage and harm women and girls, as we have already seen a number of times where similar policies have been in place. The Proposed Rule says that “preventing any person from participating in an education program or activity consistent with their gender identity would subject them to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex and therefore be prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by Title IX or the regulations.” This scope reaches far and wide with little guardrails to protect women. Under the Proposed Rule, sex-specific spaces, including housing, bathrooms and locker rooms, at primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions will be based on undefined “gender identity.” The Proposed Rule rewrites the intent of Title IX in such a way that it could, and will, be used by those who desire to cause harm. The Proposed Rule will only make it harder for school officials to protect children, as child predators and those who are intending to cause harm to children could use these policies to gain access to private spaces such as bathrooms or locker rooms.The Proposed Rule should be clear that under Title IX, sex is biological and binary.Policies included in the Proposed Rule could require teachers, administrators, contractors and grantees to undergo training to “affirm” students’ sexual identities. This is a clear violation of the free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. Such policies could also purportedly compel teachers and school personnel to participate in teaching gender ideology in the classroom, including using preferred pronouns and names. Children and educators would be forced to learn and accept curriculum that affirms a progressive and baseless ideology with contrary opinions shared because of the threat of such dissent being considered discriminatory. For example, in Virginia, a French teacher was fired for refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns.The 2020 Title IX rule made clear that the Title IX does not restrict any rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, so it would not limit free speech or the free exercise of religion. The Department should similarly ensure that the Proposed Rule will not limit these Constitutional protections, especially for people of faith, at Title IX entities. Without such clarifications, it is possible that the Proposed Rule would have a chilling effect for people and groups of faith or those who hold prolife views, who will be afraid to speak about their beliefs at risk of being unjustly accused of harassment. Similarly, as the Proposed Rule promotes the affirmation of gender ideology and abortion, the Department should make clear that no student, teacher, administrator or employee of a Title IX covered entity will be compelled to affirm, teach or promote gender ideology in or out of the classroom. Neither the federal government nor any school, is in a position to govern the conscience and beliefs of students, parents, teachers or administrators. Traditional beliefs about gender, sex and marriage should be honored and respected in the public square, including schools. Our Constitution distinctly protects free speech and religious freedom. As such, the Department of Education must ensure these rights are afforded equal protection and respect.Further, parental rights must be foundational. Yet, the Proposed Rule seems to forget them. The Department should make clear that any attempt by a school to “affirm” a student’s gender identity that is incongruent with the child’s biological sex must be made known to the child’s parents, including anything related to social or medical transition. Schools and the government have never been and will never be a substitute for parents. All gender alterations – whether social or medical – could present serious, long-lasting physical, emotional and relational harm to children, such as infertility, bone development, brain development, and more. As such, schools should never hide such information from parents.The Proposed Rule claims to remain silent on the application of its policies to athletics, with the announcement of a separate, forthcoming rule. However, the policies outlined in the Proposed Rule have already and will continue to be a detriment to ensuring an equal playing field for women and girls in sports. The Department purports to claim that the Proposed Rule does not address women’s and girls’ athletics. Instead, the Department of Education said it “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.” But nothing in the text of the proposed regulations state that the prohibition against limiting participation based on gender identity does not apply.It is obvious that the Proposed Rule, as written, will disadvantage women and girls in sports, regardless of future rulemaking specific to athletics.The Proposed Rule explicitly states that a “recipient's education program or activity would also include all of its academic and other classes, extracurricular activities, athletics programs (emphasis added), and other aspects of the recipient's education program or activity.”  The Department claimed to remain silent on the issue of sports, but they ignore the plain text of the Proposed Rule, which will quickly erode the integrity of athletics by requiring biological males who identify as transgender to compete on girls and women’s teams. By doing this, the Department is putting women at a disadvantage. Both the law and public opinion are clear; women and girls should be afforded equal opportunities to men and boys, and should not be forced to compete against males in athletics. The effects of the Proposed Rule will eliminate women's athletics by allowing individuals to compete based on definition-less gender identity. Despite 50 years of progress toward achieving equal opportunities for women and girls in education, this Proposed Rule will force women to sacrifice, by allowing men to take, athletic opportunities, team participation, trophies, awards, scholarships and more on the altar of progressive gender ideology. For example, high school girl track athletes were disadvantaged in Connecticut after the state’s unfair, gender identity policies permitted two biological males to compete in, and subsequently win a combined fifteen girl’s track championship titles previously held by nine women. One of these participants set a first-place record for the girl’s track event. The males’ participating and success prevented the girls from advancing to regional meets, taking away an opportunity for the girls to compete in front of college scouts. Men and women are biologically and physiologically different, which is why there are different men’s and women’s sports in the first place. It is self-evident and a scientific fact.It is also important to note that it is not discriminatory to acknowledge the difference between men and women. Disregarding it would, in many instances, such as athletics and physical capability, subject women to unfair standards and limit their ability to fully participate in educational opportunities. The Department has an obligation to ensure that any policy it puts forward, including this Proposed Rule, does not discriminate against women. This Proposed Rule completely misses that mark.  Religious freedom is fundamental to society, including education. Since our nation’s founding, our laws have reiterated the importance of protecting, upholding and advancing religious freedom. In addition to both the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, Congress has enacted laws such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that the government cannot substantially burden religious exercise without a compelling government interest.Congress explicitly included language in Title IX to ensure that no part of the law would require religious institutions to forfeit their sincerely held religious beliefs in order to partner with the government or provide educational opportunities to students, regardless of whether the students share those religious beliefs. The law states that Title IX “shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” As such, religious educational institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization, even if the educational institution receives Federal financial assistance. Unfortunately, under the Obama Administration, religious schools were unfairly targeted. Schools were publicly shamed for living out their faith. They were also required to seek permission from the government to be exempt from Title IX.No law or policy should ever require religious organizations to seek permission from the government to live out their faith, nor should policies unjustly target or discriminate against schools based on religious status. The Proposed Rule should ensure that the integrity of the statutory exemption is upheld, and that the Department will not retaliate against schools that are exempt from Title IX by creating a public list, which will shame schools for living out the principles of their faith.  When the current rule was proposed and finalized, it rightly clarified that Title IX applies only to recipients of Federal financial assistance. It expressly exempted educational institutions controlled by religious organizations from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the religious organization even if the educational institution does receive Federal financial assistance. It ensured that instead of actively having to seek an exemption that bureaucrats at the Department of Education get to evaluate, institutions can simply claim an exemption. The statute does not require schools to ask permission to live out their faith, so neither did the existing rule.It is notable that the Department does not address religious liberty in this rule, despite the fact that the “Religious Liberty and Free Inquiry Rule” is simultaneously pending with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  To the extent that the Department intends to propose changes in the Free Inquiry Rule that will impact the scope of which organizations qualify for religious exemptions under Title IX, the Free Inquiry Rule should be considered in conjunction with this Proposed Rule to ensure commenters and stakeholders have a fair opportunity to engage and comment.  Further, we strongly encourage the Department to expressly maintain all of the protections afforded to religious institutions by the underlying statute and made clear by the 2020 regulation. In 1988, Congress amended Title IX to include abortion neutrality language to make clear that it does not confer a right to abortion. Congress clearly and deliberately, said that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require … any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” Not surprisingly, the Administration is using this Proposed Rule, based in a law from 1972, to promote its pro-abortion agenda in the wake of the repeal of Roe v. Wade. We are concerned that the Proposed Rule’s definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” includes “pregnancy or related conditions,” which is defined as ""(1) Pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; (2) Medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; or (3) Recovery from pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, lactation, or their related medical conditions""). This definition disregards the abortion neutrality language and attempts to use Title IX to promote, and confer a right to, abortion. Notably, the Proposed Rule makes no mention of the existing, statutory abortion neutrality language. Further, the proposed rule expands the scope of pregnancy discrimination to apply to all education programs and activities, rather than just admissions. While we agree that no woman should be punished or discriminated against on account of her pregnancy, it is concerning that the Department goes as far as redefining sex discrimination to include “termination of pregnancy,” essentially equating abortion to pregnancy and childbearing. As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there is no federal right to abortion. That includes Title IX. The inclusion of this language in the proposed rule raises a number of unanswered questions, including whether educational institutions that refuse to provide access to abortion or abortion counseling will be deemed discriminatory. While we maintain that the Proposed Rule as a whole should be withdrawn, at a minimum, the Department must clearly define in the regulation that schools will not be compelled to promote abortion, and that speech, organizations, events and speakers that promote the sanctity of human life beginning at conception will not be considered to be in violation of Title IX. Further, regarding curriculum pertaining to reproductive health and sex education in schools, the Department must clarify that schools are not directed to promote abortion, including abortion counselling or referrals. While we oppose the inclusion of termination of pregnancy as part of the definition of sex, it is important to ensure that women are not prevented from equally participating in education programs or activities based on pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation. We maintain that the proposed rule should be withdrawn, but affirm the inclusion of lactation in this context. Schools should be required to reasonably accommodate pregnant and lactating women in accordance with Title IX to ensure that no woman is ever forced to choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy or her education. The Department should take all steps necessary to ensure that its policies promote life and that no woman is ever pressured or compelled to seek an abortion by her educational institution. Notably, such action would explicitly be discrimination based on sex, as childbearing, childbirth and lactation are inherent, biological capabilities of women. Of additional concern due to the underlying policies, the Proposed Rule broadly defines any Program or activity under Title IX to mean all of the operations of (1) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or local government; or (II) The entity of a State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government.Further “recipient” is defined to mean, among other things, “any State or political subdivision thereof.” Regardless, Title IX does not give the Department the authority to compel states to disregard their own laws related to protecting children from harmful gender ideology, ensuring equal opportunities for women, and upholding the sanctity of human life. The Proposed Rule should make clear that no part of the regulation would preempt state laws that are contrary to the far-reaching and unsubstantiated attempts of the Proposed Rule to indoctrinate students. The Proposed Rule should explicitly acknowledge that no schools, students, teachers, parents, or states would be subjected to unfair or discriminatory practices or actions by the Department on the basis that such individual or entity understands sex to be binary and based in biology, or upholds equality for women in sports by ensuring thatbiological males are not allowed to compete against women and girls in female athletics. Similarly, the Proposed Rule should also ensure that those individuals and states that affirm protection of all life, including the lives of the unborn, do not face discrimination. The Department must make clear that Title IX does not preempt prolife state laws by encouraging and facilitating abortion tourism through enabling students to access abortion regardless of school policies, under the guise of Title IX protections.As drafted, the Proposed Rule will have ripple effects in other nondiscrimination laws written by Congress, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, Food and Nutrition Services and more. We have already seen the harms causes by such policies, including compelling doctors to perform harmful, irreversible and experimental gender alteration procedures on minors, and strong-arming schools into adopting progressive policies by tying such policies to school lunch programs. The broad, harmful, and lasting impact that this Proposed Rule would have on other agency programs is just one reason that the Department should withdraw it. If the Department moves forward with the Proposed Rule, it must consider the impact in such areas and explicitly state that such regulation does not apply to these or any other area of law that is not clearly addressed in the Proposed Rule. The Proposed Rule seeks to unilaterally expand the scope of the law contrary to the text of Title IX and Congressional intent. The proposal would harm women and girls, violate First Amendment free speech, religious freedom and parental rights, and promotes abortion. The Department of Education should promptly withdraw the rule and instead focus on upholding existing law and regulations consistent with our law.  Sincerely, # # #"

Most concerning of all is that, as Americans struggle to stay afloat and continue to watch their paychecks shrink, especially in Alaska, President Biden and congressional Democrats are taking a victory lap for passing their socialist spending bill, which pours more fuel on the inflation fire.“As I’ve said before, the Democrats’ so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ is exactly the opposite of what our country needs right now. This bill is loaded with reckless spending, billions of dollars in new taxes on hard-working Americans, and, of course, the radical left’s favorite policy—an attack on the American energy sector.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-murkowski-urge-energy-department-to-complete-without-delay-draft-seis-for-aklng-project,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) sent a letter yesterday to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm expressing their support for the Alaska LNG Project (AKLNG), and urging the department to “complete, without delay, finalization of the draft supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS)” for the project. The letter calls for the DOE to reissue their approval of the project. “Given the United States is on the brink of an economic recession, coupled with record energy prices, completion of the regulatory process for AKLNG should be a top priority,” Senators Sullivan and Murkowski wrote. “AKLNG is the only federally permitted LNG export project on the West Coast, has 41.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas readily available, and provides a number of strategic geopolitical benefits. In fact, AKLNG would provide a supply of long-term, clean natural gas critical to our energy security and the growing global demand for energy, given Alaska has enough available gas to reduce our reliance on authoritarian foreign adversaries. Our global network of allies, military strength, world-class energy resources, dynamic economy, and most important, our democratic values and commitment to liberty, will put the United States at a distinct advantage, compared to the dictatorships of countries like China and Russia, if utilized correctly. “AKLNG also provides a significant number of environmental benefits. Given the shorter shipping routes from Alaska to meet the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand of markets in Asia, Alaska natural gas generates less carbon equivalent emissions than other U.S. LNG exports and far fewer emissions than other fuels. Further, AKLNG’s associated carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) capabilities are an important aspect of the project and moving towards a low-carbon future. Alaska’s North Slope has the potential for 205 million metric tons of carbon dioxide sequestration, which is the equivalent of planting 4 billion tree seedlings over the course of ten years, or offsetting the annual emissions of 55 coal-fired power plants or 44 million cars. AKLNG would also require no additional drilling and utilize the existing infrastructure on Alaska’s North Slope, and the development of spur lines off of AKLNG’s pipeline into Alaska’s cities, towns, and villages, would all but alleviate existing air quality issues, such as the presence of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in Fairbanks.       . . . “Lastly, the draft SEIS identifies critical socioeconomic benefits associated with AKLNG. This project would create tremendous employment opportunities for hardworking Americans, including Alaska Natives, and new revenue for the State of Alaska, mirroring the economic boom communities in the state saw following the development of the North Slope in the late 1970s. Just look at the immense support AKLNG has received from the men and women who build this country, including the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA), the Alaska chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), the Alaska chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and affiliates like the Fairbanks Building-Construction Trades Unions, Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 375, Laborers' Local 341, and Laborers' Local 942.” To read the full letter, click here.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-whitehouse-introduce-fish-act-to-fight-illegal-unreported-unregulated-seafood-harvest,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today announced the introduction of the Fighting Foreign Illegal Seafood Harvest (FISH) Actto combat foreign illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The FISH Act will combat foreign IUU fishing by blacklisting offending vessels from U.S. ports and waters, bolstering the U.S. Coast Guard’s enforcement capabilities, and advancing international and bilateral negotiations to achieve enforceable agreements and treaties.“Alaska is the superpower of seafood, the source of roughly two-thirds of all seafood harvested in the United States,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Our fishery’s extraordinary abundance is the result of responsible stewards who’ve sustainably managed this incredible resource and followed the rules. But not all vessels and countries abide by these rules, ravaging fish stocks without regard for other users or future generations—particularly the worst offender, China. My Save Our Seas Act partner, Senator Whitehouse, and I have assembled a package to tackle this threat to the sustainability of our oceans—by ratcheting up inspection and enforcement, raising the costs for the purveyors of illegal fishing, and working with other nations to eliminate any safe harbor for illegal fishermen and their backers. The FISH Act is an all-hands-on-deck effort to crack down on IUU fishing for the sake of our fish, our environment, and our coastal communities.” “Illegal pirate fishing puts Rhode Island’s fishermen and processors who play by the rules at a disadvantage. We have to root out this practice to protect our hardworking fishing industry and ocean economy,” said Senator Whitehouse, co-founder of the Senate Oceans Caucus.  “TheFISH Act, with my longtime Save Our Seas Act partner Senator Sullivan, is a comprehensive effort to curb IUU fishing and restore the fisheries that sustain our vibrant and healthy ocean.”Among other provisions, the FISH Act: Senators Sullivan and Whitehouse have worked together extensively on ocean sustainability issues, most notably on the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, the most comprehensive legislation ever to address the global marine debris crisis, which became law in 2021.# # #"

This funding will allow for a 4.2 mile highway extension to connect to Cordova’s existing road system at Orca Creek to the Shepard Point Oil Spill Response Facility.“The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the release of roughly eleven million gallons of crude oil into the open ocean, impacting more than 1,300 miles of coastline. Over three decades later, communities throughout Prince William Sound are still feeling the impacts. It was a tragic event which served as a catalyst for shaping America’s oil spill response methods,” said Senator Murkowski. “The construction of the Shepard Point Marine Tribal Transportation & Oil Spill Response Facility is a long-standing, top priority for the Native Village of Eyak for years. I’m proud to have helped ensure they have the dedicated infrastructure in place to protect the environment.” “The DOT highway funding announced this week for an extended road to the Shepard Point Marine Tribal Transportation (MTT) & Oil Spill Response (OSR) Facility, coupled with the $40 million grant announced last year for the facility itself, will help the Eyak people protect their way of life and provide economic opportunities,” Senator Sullivan said. “I am pleased to see key provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure legislation I negotiated in the Environmental and Public Works (EPW) Committee finally come to fruition. By helping prevent any future spill from becoming an ecological disaster, the fishing, tourism and resource development industries in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta region stand to benefit.”“All of us at the Native Village of Eyak would like to thank Senator Murkowski, Senator Sullivan, and their staff for their hard work and commitment to the Shepard Point project. Their support through the grant process has been critical to ensuring our community, state and nation are never again unprepared for a catastrophe like the Exxon-Valdez oil spill in 1989. We are honored to receive this award and promise to be good stewards in its use,” said Bert Adams, Executive Director of the Native Village of Eyak.The NSFLTP Program was reauthorized and funded through H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Senator Murkowski played a lead role in writing and negotiating. This funding announcement dovetails a January 2021 grant of $40.1 million awarded to the Native Village of Eyak from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).###"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-bill-to-make-sullivan-shaheen-power-act-permanent-supporting-victims-of-violence,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) are celebrating the Senate’s unanimous vote to remove the sunset date for the Pro Bono Work to Empower and Represent (POWER) Act, which was set to expire later this year after being signed into law in 2018. The POWER Act has been helping combat domestic violence and sexual assault across the country by holding summits that encourage lawyers to offer pro bono legal services to survivors of these crimes. The bill also requires that, every two years, an event be held in areas with high numbers of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, with a focus on addressing these issues among Native populations. In 2021, the POWER Act resulted in 73 pro bono legal summits across the nation, reaching more than 11,000 attorneys.“Studies have shown, without legal representation, survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault have less of a chance of securing a protective order and escaping the cycle of violence,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Many lawyers are more than willing to donate some of their time and knowledge to help vulnerable survivors navigate the complex legal system. The key is letting attorneys know about the significant need that exists and how they can get involved. This was the motivation behind my 2018 POWER Act—a continuation at the national level of our efforts in Alaska with the Choose Respect initiative. In the years since the POWER Act became law, we’ve amassed an army of thousands of lawyers who are lifting women and children out of horrible situations. But the epidemic of domestic violence and sexual assault has not stopped—and neither will we. Thanks to my colleagues’ support in the Senate, we’re going to continue to grow this army of lawyers, and bring hope and healing to many more survivors across the country and in our great state.”“I’m thrilled the Senate advanced this critical legislation, which is a victory for survivors bravely seeking justice. This bill extends authorization of a pivotal program that incentivizes lawyers to provide pro bono legal services to survivors of domestic and sexual violence. As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees funding for the Office on Violence Against Women, I’ve long prioritized measures like this that support those who’ve endured sexual violence and trauma,” said Sen. Shaheen. “I’m glad to work with Senator Sullivan and this bipartisan group of lawmakers to deliver this legislation through the Senate, and I urge the House to move swiftly so we can ensure there is no gap in access to services for those who need it.” The POWER Act requires the administrative office of the federal judiciary to submit a compilation and summary of reports received from the chief district judges detailing each public event conducted in the previous fiscal year. Background on the POWER Act: # # #"

I appreciate the approach that Santos and their partner, Repsol, have taken to advance this project, their strong collaboration with local entities and communities, and their commitment to producing this resource with net-zero emissions from the project itself.”    “It’s exciting to see this project, which has been in the works since I was serving as Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources Commissioner, finally come to fruition,” Sullivan said. “Today’s announcement is great news for energy security, national security, and for economic and community development, including thousands of jobs for Alaskans, in our state where we have the highest environmental standards in the world.”The Pikka project is projected to produce 80,000 barrels of oil per day by 2026. Santos owns 51 percent of the project and Repsol holds a 49 percent stake. Pikka will create an estimated 2,600 construction jobs and 500 permanent jobs, furthering the companies’ strong commitment to Alaska. At present, about 98 percent of the employees for Santos’ U.S. subsidiary, Oil Search Alaska, live in Alaska.  # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-enshrine-former-us-senator-ted-stevens-arctic-legacy-through-grand-opening-of-arctic-security-studies-center,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) took part in the grand opening of the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies. The center, named after the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, will support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum, while also developing robust international networks of security leaders.“The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies—I’m so proud to be able to say that. Ted always watched out for us here in Alaska. He dedicated his life to building our state and was also the first Senator to embrace the “Arctic-ness” of America. He set the foundation, which is why it is so fitting this center bears his name. To go from vision, to concept, to this moment so quickly is a testament to all of the people who worked so hard to make this a reality. From today forward, the Stevens Center will further focus our strategic thinking about the Arctic. It will help us turn ideas into concepts, concepts into action, and action into results. And, with partners across the Arctic, it will work together in a spirit of cooperation, just as Ted and Dan always did. This center will help us truly embrace our role and responsibility as an Arctic nation,” said Senator Murkowski. “I’m proud to have been a driving force in establishing and funding this initiative. It was an honor to be with true supporters of the Arctic at the grand opening for the Center – to let America, and the world, know: the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies is open for business.”“When I arrived in the Senate in 2015, I was stunned by the lack of seriousness and attention given to the Arctic region from our most senior defense leaders,” said Senator Sullivan. “The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, which I was able to pass in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, demonstrates just how much progress we’ve made. The Ted Stevens Center further cements Alaska as the center of gravity for America's Arctic security operations, policy and research and will enable our country to confront an era of authoritarian aggression with confidence and sound Arctic policy crafted by the world’s best and brightest experts, including those who know the Arctic best—Alaskans. I want to thank Senator Murkowski for initially conceiving of the idea and working to appropriate funds for the center, and Congressman Don Young for carrying it across the finish line in the House.” “This endeavor has been a Congressional and Executive Branch of government success. Specifically, this milestone is an achievement for the Alaska Congressional Delegation and the DoD team, and those of us standing up the center are honored to be a part of the team and are thrilled to see how far we have collectively come in this matter in a relatively short time. The Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies achieving Initial Operating Capacity as defined by the Pentagon approved Center Plans, Objectives and Milestones (POAM) on 1 July 2022 was a significant objective for the Center's initial advancement.  Tomorrow's opening ceremony is a public acknowledgement by the Stevens Center and our DoD leadership of the importance of the combined team effort which is building capacity in Arctic and Climate Security research & analysis, executive education and strategic engagement activities to provide a soft power complement to the hard power investments the United States is making in and across the Arctic...in support of our national interests across region in collaboration with our Allies and Partners. We at the Center are truly grateful for the support of the DoD and the support of the U.S. Congress, in particular, the Alaska Congressional Delegation,” said Randy “Church” Kee, Maj Gen, USAF (Ret), Senior Advisor, Arctic Security Affairs. ""Establishing the Ted Stevens Center is a clear and tangible example of the importance of the Arctic region to the fundamental security interests of our nation. Although the Center is located in Alaska, it will link the global community to the Arctic and play a central role in addressing the full spectrum of security issues unfolding before us. Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan have championed our new Center and by doing so, have ensured our nation and our state are well positioned to address future challenges throughout the region,"" said Dr. Michael Sfraga, Chair & Distinguished Fellow of the Polar Institute and Chair of the US Arctic Research Commission. “Ted would be so honored to have his name associated with a vitally important Center as well as experienced leadership and staff.  He was passionate about Arctic research and action - ensuring our country is well-prepared for any threat.  Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan have done just that in working to secure authorization and funding for the Center.  We are grateful to the leadership of the Administration for their support of an Arctic commitment benefiting our country and the world. Ted often commented, ‘Alaska’s strategic location and capabilities prepare us to respond expeditiously to protect our nation.’  As he characterized it, ‘We live along one edge of an incredible vast region - home to half of the world’s population, an emerging superpower, and a malevolent nuclear regime,’” said Catherine Stevens, widow of the late Senator Stevens and member of the Stevens family. “We are also eager to follow how the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies will partner with the Daniel K. Inouye Center for Asia Pacific Studies, and continue the legacy of getting things done, as Ted and Dan did through their strong friendship and referred to each other as ‘brothers’.” “The Ted Stevens Center will create a lasting presence by the DoD in Alaska of a high level strategic center of excellence. The TSC as it develops can not only further education but can help align interests across the polar region. A mission which includes new polar technologies can uniquely add value to existing efforts in the military mission.  Alaska Natives and our vast network of relational and familiar ties across the Arctic, together with our growing capabilities working together with the Ted Stevens Center can help sustain deep collaboration and critical understanding as we continue building our partnerships,” Julie Kitka, President of the Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN). The Ted Stevens Center, the first DoD regional center in the Arctic and the first new DoD regional center since 2000, will support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum, while also fostering strong international networks of security leaders. The DoD has five Regional Centers covering Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Near East-South Asia, and the Western Hemisphere—making this the sixth DoD Regional Center and the only one specifically focused on the Arctic. Senators Murkowski and Sullivan sponsored this initiative in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the late Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska) successfully included the provision in the House’s version of the NDAA, which was eventually signed into law. Through her role as an appropriator, Senator Murkowski secured $10 million for the Stevens Center in the Fiscal Year 2021 appropriations package. The Center’s aim is to support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities through a unique academic forum and to foster strong international networks of security leaders to support multilateralism and diplomacy in the region. The Stevens Center will serve as a soft power tool to support and strengthen the advances DoD is making in the Arctic, using security cooperation, research and academia, and diplomacy.# # #"

Inflation is the highest it’s been in more than four decades and we’re now in a recession following two quarters of negative growth. This is all a result of way too much spending and the unrelenting war on American energy being waged by this administration and congressional Democrats, who are beholden to radical left special interest groups.“What Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders are trying to do with this so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ is exactly the opposite of what our country needs right now. This bill is loaded with more reckless spending, billions of dollars in taxes on hard-working Americans, and, of course, the radical left’s favorite policy—an attack on the American energy sector. The Schumer-Sanders bill is going to do more harm to our economy. The people who are going to bear the brunt of this are working-class Americans. Raising taxes on the middle class is never a good thing, but especially during a recession, and increasing the IRS’s budget by 600 percent and doubling its workforce—which is what this bill does—says all you need to know about the priorities of Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Bernie Sanders.”# # #"

All 50 Senate Democrats voted against the measure.“The humanitarian crisis, the national security crisis, and the health care crisis that are transpiring right now on our southern border is a tragedy of immense proportions that this administration and many of my Democratic colleagues turn a blind eye to—a dereliction that continued today with Senate Democrats opposing my commonsense amendment,” said Senator Sullivan in a statement following the vote. “The priorities in this reckless tax and spending bill are all wrong.

The fact is, strong borders work. Walls work.”Full text of the Sullivan amendment can be found HERE.Below is a transcript of Sen. Sullivan’s remarks on the Senate floor. Mr. President, we have a true crisis—a humanitarian crisis, a national security crisis—right now on our southern border.It is a huge tragedy that my Democratic colleagues want to ignore. And that tragedy has spread across our nation: crime; victims of human trafficking, many of them children; a fentanyl epidemic killing our young people—chaos all fueled by a lawless border. Secure borders work! Walls work. Just ask the Biden administration as they are quietly building sections of the wall in Arizona right now. The Democrats’ partisan reconciliation bill does nothing to address this crisis. Instead, it gives DHS (Department of Homeland Security) $500 million dollars for sustainability and environmental programs when our kids are dying from drugs streaming in from the border, (and) when our communities are under siege.This should not be the priority for DHS. My amendment would take this half a billion dollars and recommit this DHS money to building the wall and securing our border, which is DHS's primary mission, not environmental programs.I ask that all of my colleagues vote yes on this commonsense amendment. # # #"

It is another reminder that we have entered a new era of authoritarian aggression led by the dictators Xi Jinping of China and Putin of Russia. They are increasingly isolated and dangerous, driven by historical grievances, paranoid about their democratic neighbors, and willing to use military force and other aggressive actions to crush the citizens of such countries as we are seeing in the Taiwan Strait and Ukraine. These dangerous dictators are increasingly working together to pursue their aggressive goals, and they are trying to split the United States from our allies.  “We must wake up to the fact that this new era of authoritarian aggression will likely be with us for decades. We need to face it with strategic resolve and confidence. We have many comparative advantages relative to these dictatorships, if we are wise enough to utilize and strengthen them: our global network of allies; our lethal military; our world-class supplies of energy, minerals and metals; our dynamic economy; and, most importantly, our democratic values and our commitment to freedom and liberty. It’s critical the Biden administration leverage these strategic advantages. “Unfortunately, that has not happened in many areas under this administration, such as the President’s weak defense budgets and his policies that undermine America’s energy and critical mineral production. This is exactly the wrong signal to be sending to Putin and Xi.“As for immediate actions we should take right now as it relates to Taiwan, in addition to American military strength, we need to make clear to Xi the true economic costs of any military invasion of Taiwan. This is exactly why, earlier this year, I introduced the STAND with Taiwan Act, which would mandate comprehensive and crippling economic and financial sanctions against the CCP and key sectors of China’s economy if the People’s Liberation Army initiates a military invasion of the island democracy. Congress needs to pass my bill as soon as possible.”###"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-approves-sullivan-murkowski-reed-resolution-designating-august-16th-as-national-airborne-day,"WASHINGTON—The United States Senate last night unanimously approved a resolution sponsored by U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan, Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska), and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) designating August 16, 2022 as National Airborne Day. The resolution calls on all Americans to observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.The resolution also adds language acknowledging the recent re-activation of the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska as part of the ongoing history of American Airborne forces. While previous resolutions acknowledged the service of the 11th Airborne during World War II, it did not reflect the recent re-activation of the division. The 11th Airborne Division unites roughly 12,000 soldiers in Alaska under one flag, marking the first time that the Army has activated an airborne division in 70 years.  “The activation of the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska earlier this summer reaffirmed the Army’s commitment to its new Arctic Strategy, our state’s unrivaled strategic location, and the importance of America’s security interests in this region,” said Senator Sullivan. “As Americans honor the service of all of our brave airborne members, this day will be particularly meaningful for Alaskans celebrating the Arctic-tough warriors of our newly-minted 11thAirborne Division who are standing by on a moment’s notice to keep us safe from threats from across the globe.” “While I’ve led this resolution to honor National Airborne Day for years, this year the resolution is particularly special to the Alaska delegation. That’s due to fact the 11th Airborne Division in Alaska just re-activated, returning to the Army’s active rolls with a reinvigorated mission focused on operations in extreme cold weather and high altitudes, including the ever-evolving Arctic. It was a truly momentous occasion, and one I was thankful to be a part of,” said Senator Murkowski. “Alaska’s Airborne units are Arctic tough—withstanding some of the most challenging climates and terrains on earth as they carry out their missions. They are truly some of our nation’s most skilled and respected forces. With today’s unanimous passage of our resolution, I’m proud my Senate colleagues joined us in formally honoring airborne divisions across the U.S. and all the strength, grit and determination they add to America’s armed services. It’s an honor to recognize their hard work in this way.”“America’s airborne forces are the tip of the spear of our military,” said Senator Reed, who served in the 82nd Airborne Division. “They are trained to operate behind enemy lines, endure the toughest conditions, and blaze the trail for our ground forces – all after jumping out of a perfectly good airplane. I am immensely proud to honor the service and sacrifice of these brave men and women by recognizing National Airborne Day.”National Airborne Day is observed on August 16 of every year to honor the U.S. Army's elite airborne troops and to celebrate all of their accomplishments. In 2002, President George W. Bush established National Airborne Day to commemorate these ""foundational efforts."" The day commemorates the first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, which soon led to the formation of the U.S. Army Airborne Units. # # #"

Today’s vote is a win for the men and women who build things in America. It’s a win for those who support building infrastructure for America in a timely fashion. It’s a win for anyone who supports unleashing American energy that we need so much right now in our country. And, most importantly, it’s a win for the men and women who build this country, feed this country, and grow this country.” On July 13, Sen. Sullivan introduced S.J. Res. 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), cosponsored by all 49 of his Senate Republican colleagues, to nullify the Biden administration’s new NEPA regulation. The recently promulgated Biden administration NEPA rules, authored by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), undermine important provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act intended to streamline key elements of our broken federal permitting process, which Senator Sullivan played a leading role in writing. Additionally, the Biden administration’s NEPA rules are a substantial roll-back of the Trump administration’s 2020 NEPA regulations, which were the first major modernization of federal environmental reviews since 1978. Senator Sullivan was a leading advocate for the 2020 NEPA revisions, having previously introduced legislation—theRebuild America Now Act—that mirrored the Trump-era reforms.The CRA provides Congress with an expedited mechanism to overturn certain federal agency regulations and actions through a joint resolution of disapproval. A joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA is afforded special procedures, bypassing normal Senate rules and allowing for a vote on the Senate floor. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is approved by a simple majority in both houses of Congress and signed by the President—or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential veto—the rule is invalidated. The resolution now goes to the House of Representatives for consideration. Timeline of Senator Sullivan’s Efforts on S.J.

Sullivan. “Today, the U.S. Senate will welcome the nations of Sweden and Finland into the NATO family. Like any family, we may not agree on everything, but when it’s most important, we will have each other’s back. That is the essence of NATO and the core reason for its success.” The Senate unanimously approved Sen. Sullivan’s amendment to the resolution of ratification, declaring that all NATO members should spend a minimum of two percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense and 20 percent of their defense budgets on “major equipment, including research and development,” by 2024, as outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Declaration. “I am a very strong supporter of NATO and the U.S. military, and I want NATO to endure for decades to come,” said Sen. Sullivan. “But alliances can’t endure if shared commitments and shared burdens are not met…There must be a sense among the citizens of such countries that all are pulling their weight for the collective defense of the alliance, for the collective defense of each other. I thank my colleagues for supporting my amendment, sending a clear message from the Senate about America’s expectation that each NATO member fulfill its commitments.” Full transcriptMadam President, it is always good to follow my friend from Delaware, Navy Captain Carper, who is a Vietnam vet, a naval aviator--the whole works. It is an honor to serve with him on the EPW and other committees. So thank you to my good friend from Delaware. Madam President, after World War II, European leaders looked to the United States to help heal a fractured world and to help provide safety against increasing communist Russian aggression. As Winston Churchill said: There I sat with the great Russian bear on one side of me with paws outstretched and, on the other side, the great American Buffalo.Well, the Buffalo prevailed, NATO prevailed, and the world's most successful and enduring military alliance was born. In 1949, the Senate ratified the NATO treaty by a vote of 82 to 13. President Truman was quoted at the signing ceremony of the NATO treaty by saying:In this pact, we hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression . . . For us, war is not inevitable. He continued:Men with courage and vision can still determine their own destiny. They can choose slavery or freedom--war or peace. . . . The treaty we are signing here today is evidence of the path they will follow. That was when President Truman signed the first NATO treaty. And, indeed, since the formation of NATO, no world wars have broken out, no country that is a signatory of NATO has been invaded by another country's military forces. In fact, the only time NATO's article V--which is the pillar of the alliance, which states that an attack on one is an attack on all--was invoked was actually after the terrorist attacks on America on 9/11. Our allies came to our help to ensure Afghanistan wouldn't harbor terrorists, and we appreciate that help. We appreciate it deeply from our NATO allies.NATO, however, is more than just a military alliance. It is a group of countries with shared values and beliefs and a commitment to the principles of democracy. All of this, in addition to the military alliance, is the heritage of NATO. President Ronald Reagan summed it up succinctly in a speech to our NATO allies in 1983: What do the Soviets mean by words like democracy, freedom, and peace? Not, I'm sorry to say, what we mean.Replace the word ``Soviet'' with ``Russia,'' and the sentiment, unfortunately, holds true today. We see the antithesis of these democratic values and shared beliefs of NATO being played out in real time before us in the streets of Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin is leading a brutal assault on Ukraine--Russia's democratic neighbor--and committing atrocities, horrible atrocities, against the brave people of that country. As both Presidents Truman and Reagan remarked, members of the NATO alliance are like members of the same house in the same family--the house and the family of democracy. So, today, the U.S. Senate will welcome the nations of Sweden and Finland into the NATO family. Like any family, we may not agree on everything, but when it is most important, we will have each other's back. That is the essence of NATO and the core reason for its success. Neither Russia nor any other country will be able to invade Sweden or Finland, now that they have become members of NATO, without its NATO allies coming to their support.Of course, Finland has experienced the Russian invasion. In 1939, where, without the help from other nations, its greatly outnumbered brave Finnish army fought off over 1 million Russian forces for 3 months. But that won't happen again to Finland. It won't happen to Sweden. They won't be alone now.We welcome these countries' commitment to freedom and their advanced professional militaries, which will make NATO stronger.To Finland and Sweden, no longer will you be working with NATO. You will now be working in and part of the greatest defense alliance in history. So welcome to these great countries.As Churchill once said: There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them!I strongly support the inclusion of these two great nations, Sweden and Finland, into the NATO alliance. Important occasions like this are also an opportunity to reflect on the obligations of membership, not just for these new NATO members but for all NATO members.And on the heels of the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, the heads of state and representatives of the then-28 member countries who made up NATO attended a very important summit, a NATO summit, in Wales. There, they agreed upon a common goal for all NATO members that they would spend a minimum of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. This 2 percent of GDP NATO defense spending goal has been strongly supported for decades by American administrations, both Republican and Democratic: Presidents Bush, Obama, Trump, and now President Biden. At the time, in 2014, of the NATO summit in Wales, 10 of the 28 members of NATO met that 2-percent guideline. Now, 8 years later in 2022, of the 30 NATO country members, we only have 8 of those 30 meeting that 2-percent threshold. I have a chart here. It lays out the 2-percent goal: who is above it, who is below it. It is many other countries besides the ones that are listed there. But the bottom line is, since Wales and that important commitment, there has not been much progress in NATO on this shared goal and commitment. Now, I am a very strong supporter of NATO and a very strong supporter of the U.S. military, and I want NATO to endure for decades to come. But alliances can't endure if shared commitments and shared burdens are not met. This is particularly true for democratic alliances like NATO. There must be a sense among the citizens of such countries that all are pulling their weight for the collective defense of the alliance, for the collective defense of each other. So as I mentioned at the outset, I am calling up an amendment to the resolution. My amendment is to make this commitment clear. It is to announce the U.S. Senate's expectation for all NATO members: the United States, existing members, and now new members--expectations on what has already been agreed to by each NATO country and its citizens.The amendment is simple. It states the following:The Senate declares that all NATO members should spend a minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product . . . on defense and 20 percent of their defense budget on major equipment, including research and development, by 2024, as outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Declaration.That is it. It is a simple amendment, and I hope it can pass in the next hour by voice vote.Let me conclude with this: A robust, expanded NATO with Finland and Sweden as new members is needed now more than ever, especially given the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We need to fully understand the broader implications of this invasion. We have entered a new era of authoritarian aggression, led by Russia and China's dictators, who are increasingly isolated and dangerous, driven by historical grievances, paranoid about their democratic neighbors, and willing to use military force and other aggressive actions to crush the citizens of such countries. These dangerous dictators, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, are increasingly working together to achieve their aggressive goals. We must wake up to the fact that this new era of authoritarian aggression will likely be with us for decades. We need to face it with strategic resolve and confidence. The United States has extraordinary advantages relative to the dictatorships of Russia and China, if we are wise enough to utilize and strengthen them: our global network of allies, our lethal military, our world-class supplies of energy and other natural resources, our dynamic economy, and, most important, our democratic values and commitment to liberty.Xi Jinping and Putin's biggest weakness and vulnerability is that they fear their own people. We should remember this and exploit this in the months and years ahead. NATO, as an alliance, encompasses so many of these powerful comparative advantages: a lethal military, a global network of allies, dynamic economies, and the power of democratic values and the commitment to liberty.We should all welcome and celebrate the addition of Finland and Sweden to the NATO alliance, but we should also use this moment to recognize the seriousness of the authoritarian threats on the rise all over the world and recommit ourselves, all NATO members, to our obligations of collective defense, moving forward.I yield the floor.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/over-40-organizations-support-hard-working-americans-with-nepa-reform,"WASHINGTON—Following today’s press conference on efforts by U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) to nullify the Biden administration’s recently promulgated and onerous National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions through a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, Senator Sullivan’s press office released a list of organizations supporting the resolution.Sullivan’s resolution is supported by all 49 Senate Republicans. The names and statements (where applicable) of the groups supporting the resolution can be found below:""The Alaska AFL-CIO supports responsible development that supports good paying jobs. We have a proven track record in Alaska and we look forward to working with Congress to streamline systems while still protecting our beautiful state.""Letter attached here.“ABC strongly supports the efforts of Sen. Sullivan and his colleagues to reverse the Biden administration’s unnecessarily costly and burdensome revisions to NEPA regulations,” said ABC Vice President of Legislative & Political Affairs Kristen Swearingen. “This rulemaking would reverse the much-needed efforts of the previous administration to update and streamline the federal environmental review and permitting process. While Congress recently passed legislation providing an unprecedented investment in our nation’s infrastructure, including language specifically calling for streamlined environmental review, this rulemaking would delay the completion of these critical projects and increase costs for the construction industry and taxpayers without providing meaningful environmental benefits. “Passing the resolution and undoing this harmful regulation would be a step toward promoting a coordinated, predictable and transparent process to streamline permitting. Congress should swiftly pass this resolution to enable the construction industry to plan and execute even the most complex projects while safeguarding our communities, maintaining a healthy environment and successfully stewarding public funds.”Letter attached here. “LIUNA commends Sen. Sullivan’s Joint Resolution under the Congressional Review Act to re-establish long overdue updates to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  The NEPA updates will reduce the burdensome requirements that cause excessive permit delays. Too often, communities in need of vital infrastructure and the hard-working men and women who build America are waiting on the sidelines as projects are subjected to onerous reviews.  ""Without the proposed reforms to the National Environmental Protection Act, long-overdue infrastructure projects will be jeopardized and good-paying union jobs sacrificed. The strong, proud, and united members of LIUNA are ready and willing to get to work building America but we need a more predictable and efficient system for permitting projects.""LIUNA strongly supports Senator Sullivan’s Joint Resolution, using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the recent rollback of the 2020 National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) updates and urges the full Congress to quickly vote in favor of this needed legislation.” - Terry O’Sullivan, General President of LIUNA – the Laborers’ International Union of North America“North America’s Building Trades Unions strongly supports efforts to alleviate the headwinds faced by the onerous NEPA review process. The excessive delays caused by NEPA inhibit our ability to provide pathways to the middle class for the hardworking men and women of this country. Policymakers must work to streamline these regulations not further convolute them; they must recognize that uncertainty on this matter has real world impacts on our members and the entire construction industry.” “ARA strongly supports efforts in the Senate and House to reverse the Biden Administration’s final Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) rulemaking that will cause further delays of critical projects and is contrary to the permit reforms included by Congress in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation signed into law last year.  Our nation needs to speed up the approval process for much-needed infrastructure projects that help create economic development, jobs and address supply chain disruptions, which will especially benefit the rural communities in which agricultural retailers and their farmer customers live and work.”Letter attached here. “For years, the National Environmental Policy Act process was inefficient and unreasonably costly. Bureaucratic delays held up critical transportation projects, water infrastructure, and basic stewardship activities. With this rule, the administration has turned back to the clock to a process that they themselves recognized as broken. Ranchers and the lands they manage need clear, predictable, and timely NEPA analysis. Thank you to Senator Sullivan and his colleagues for listening to ranchers and rural communities.” – Kaitlynn Glover, Executive Director of the Public Lands Council and NCBA Natural Resources.“For years, the National Environmental Policy Act process was inefficient and unreasonably costly.

S.J. Res. 55 sends a clear message about the need to streamline the process. We applaud Senator Sullivan’s leadership on these important goals.”“The new National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations proposed by the Biden administration are a major step back in our mission to streamline the federal permitting process for infrastructure projects. Following last year’s passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we must stay on track in reducing these onerous delays that would stall the updates to U.S. roads, bridges, ports, and other projects critical to our nation’s infrastructure and supply chain. In order to ensure U.S. infrastructure continues to modernize and improve, the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) urges bipartisan support in returning NEPA back to its original purpose.” - Eric R. Byer, President & CEO, NACD “In short, permitting certainty [for energy projects] is now at a premium,” NAM Senior Director of Energy & Resources Policy Nile Elam said. “Bridges take over 15 years to build, and as it stands now, companies need to invest countless resources and wasted time on duplicative permitting applications to expand their operations or onshore new facilities. Modern permitting reforms and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive—we can grow our economy, strengthen our domestic manufacturing and maintain the highest environmental stewardship while updating an archaic permitting process that benefits both the public and private sector. It is long past due for Washington policymakers to seize this opportunity, and every year we kick the can means the permitting process becomes even more burdensome.”“NEPA remains a vitally important piece of environmental protection. However, after nearly four decades NEPA has also become associated with costly litigation, prolonged project delays, job destruction, and stifling of investment. Unfortunately, the recent Phase 1 Final Rule may serve to continue that trend. NEPA impacts almost every sector of the U.S. economy, including the growing offshore renewable energy segment. Effective NEPA reform must enable a more efficient and timely regulatory process that balances the need for infrastructure investment and project development with environmental stewardship.” - Erik Milito, President, NOIA“As our nation works towards a future that depends on electricity to power most of the economy, Congress must continue to modernize the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act and protect previous reforms,” said NRECA CEO Jim Matheson. “Sensible NEPA reform is an essential first step to speeding the construction of electric transmission and other critical infrastructure. We thank Senator Sullivan for his leadership and for taking this important step that will help electric co-ops reliably keep the lights on at a cost that consumers can afford.”Letter attached here.“RDC welcomed the efforts by the previous administration that streamlined the NEPA review process, reduced unnecessary regulatory burdens, and clarified longstanding regulations without sacrificing environmental protections,” said Leila Kimbrell, Executive Director for the Resource Development Council for Alaska, “Unfortunately, the recent actions by the current administration to repeal those efficiencies takes us in the wrong direction and will most certainly lead to longer permitting timelines, uncertainty, and litigation, which benefits no one.  We are key partner for clean energy solutions, like critical minerals.  Alaska is a wealth of natural resources and has a long history of responsibly developing those resources.  Rather than make the regulatory process more cumbersome, we need commonsense solutions to remain competitive.  At a time when domestic energy independence is more critical than ever, RDC thanks Senator Sullivan for leading the effort to fight administrative overreach.”  Letter attached here.“The Chamber supports Senator Sullivan’s and Representative Graves’ CRA resolutions to restore critical improvements to the NEPA regulations.  To build the new transportation and energy infrastructure the nation so badly needs, we need clear and efficient permitting processes.  CEQ’s changes to the previous NEPA improvements have moved us backwards.  Adding steps in an already onerous and slow process, requiring more time-consuming analyses, increasing litigation risk for project decisions, and encouraging agencies to impose requirements that go beyond CEQ regulations will slow agency decision-making and stretch resources.  There is tremendous opportunity to improve our transportation system, meet our energy needs of today and tomorrow, and build other critical national infrastructure.  Restoring the earlier improvements will help avoid unnecessary delays and increased costs.”- Marty Durbin, Senior Vice President of Policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce“It is well recognized, except by radical environmental groups that want to stop any projects at all, that NEPA has been out of control for decades, raising the costs and severely delaying or halting vital infrastructure projects. Western Energy Alliance believes that conducting NEPA analysis to identify environmental impacts and work to mitigate them is a good thing, but when obstructionist groups use NEPA to tie up projects for years in analysis, red tape, and litigation it’s no longer about protecting the environment but about saying ‘no’ to any energy projects, pipelines, roads, and other infrastructure. At a time of runaway inflation and high energy prices, Sen. Sullivan’s CRA resolution could help move projects along to increase production of American energy and bring down prices for consumers.” - Kathleen Sgamma, President, Western Energy Alliance“This new NEPA rule adds to the regulatory uncertainty coming out of Washington that has created instability and made it harder to plan and manage construction projects. It is disappointing that instead of implementing the environmental review and permitting reforms included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the administration has instead chosen to add new, vague hurdles to this arduous process. The Associated General Contractors of America supports Senator Sullivan’s efforts to nullify this costly and burdensome regulation.” -Jimmy Christianson, Vice President of Government Relations, Associated General Contractors of America Mining companies across the world are looking to invest in places with great mineral potential. Alaska is at the top of their lists for the next great discovery, but permitting uncertainty is the number one deterrent. The 2022 NEPA regulation changes eliminated improvements to the system and created yet one more roadblock to developing mines. The regulatory system puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage and we are losing the investment needed to bring jobs, revenues, and community benefits at a time we need it most.  We wholeheartedly support SJ Resolution 55 and encourage Congress to recognize the importance of a robust and stable permitting system.“From highways to bridges, electricity generation to charging networks – American infrastructure begins with the products of mining. Yet even as demand for mined resources is increasing exponentially, mining projects continue to encounter obstacles from the delays and outsized costs associated with NEPA’s well-documented historical problems. At every step of the mining process, today’s mining industry takes extraordinary steps to protect the environment, the communities in which it operates and its workforce. The much-needed reforms of the 2020 rule helped NEPA to work as intended, balancing societal needs with world-leading environmental protections. Senator Sullivan’s Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Council on Environmental Quality’s Phase 1 rule will once again bring long overdue improvements to a process that has become a barrier to rebuilding and modernizing essential infrastructure of all kinds.”   – Rich Nolan, President and CEO of the National Mining AssociationCitizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) President Heather Reams issued the following statement on S.J. Res. 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify the Biden Administration’s revisions to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). “For years CRES has called upon lawmakers to inject some common sense into the National Environmental Policy Act and streamline federal environmental review processes. However, the Biden White House has taken us in the wrong direction. CRES applauds Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and his 49 Senate Republican colleagues for introducing a resolution to nullify President Biden’s flawed policies on permitting and construction.“America cannot reduce emissions quickly if we are stymied by old and crumbling infrastructure. To build a clean energy future in America, and to protect our vulnerable communities from a changing climate, we need a permitting process that evaluates projects on the merits while discouraging anti-development groups from using environmental review simply to delay or block critical infrastructure construction.”“The Administration’s ambitious clean energy targets are undermined by its own efforts through the revision of NEPA guidance. We can only build new clean energy projects and reduce CO2 emissions as fast as we can permit new projects. If we are to truly ""build back better,"" the mission ought to be build cleaner faster. In addition to Senator Sullivan’s important effort, there are a number of legislative proposals to modernize the permitting process being written as we speak. The need to act is urgent, and can only be done if there are efforts to modernize the permitting process instead of moving backwards,” said Rich Powell, ClearPath Action CEO.“America’s infrastructure is in dire need of investment and our capacity to produce and use energy needs to be modernized to meet demand and reduce emissions. Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s recently finalized National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations will make it much more difficult to receive the federal approvals required to start these projects. “Remarkably, these new rules undercut many provisions intended to streamline the NEPA process that received strong bipartisan support in last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This additional ‘red tape’ unnecessarily hinders our ability to move forward on these vital projects and further exacerbates the inflationary pressures that harm many hardworking Americans. ConservAmerica applauds Senator Sullivan and his colleagues for moving forward with S.J. Res. 55."" – Jeff Kupfer, President, ConservAmerica. “The Alaska Oil and Gas Association has consistently supported reforms to the National Environmental Protection Act that maintain high environmental standards while providing for consistency in the permitting process. The recent revisions published by the Biden Administration will undo the commonsense reforms undertaken in 2020, and will delay approval and building of important projects. I commend Senator Sullivan for leading the charge to remove the unnecessary red tape.”“The Alliance applauds Senator Sullivan for introducing S.J. Res. 55 to nullify the administration’s attempt to make it more difficult to build anything in America.   We can’t “build back better” if we can’t build.”“The Biden administration’s NEPA rewrite will only slow the permitting process for critical energy infrastructure and create new obstacles, not only for natural gas and oil development but also the deployment of CCUS, hydrogen, wind, solar and electricity transmission projects. As energy costs continue to rise, American consumers and our allies are looking to the U.S. for access to an affordable and stable energy supply. We need policies in place that provide certainty and ensure American producers can meet rising demand, not additional bureaucratic red tape.” -API Chief Advocacy Officer Amanda Eversole.The American Public Gas Association (APGA), representing more than 730 communities across the U.S. that own and operate their retail natural gas distribution entities, issued the following statement in response to the introduction of Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval in both the House and Senate related to the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) recent rulemaking revising its regulations for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).“APGA applauds House and Senate efforts to utilize the CRA to repeal CEQ’s recent rule revising its regulations for implementing NEPA. This rule undermines recent attempts to modernize and streamline the federal permitting process, including through certain provisions of the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. APGA was a strong supporter of this legislation, which also includes a significant investment in modernizing the natural gas distribution pipeline infrastructure our members use to deliver energy to American homes and businesses. A timely and efficient permitting process is critical to ensure federal funds deliver much-needed infrastructure projects to the communities APGA members serve.“If this rule remains in effect, it will increase the regulatory burden on infrastructure project sponsors and delay much-needed projects. While APGA and its members appreciate the need to safeguard the environment, we believe there is a way to do that while still permitting infrastructure projects in a timely and efficient manner. Rolling back efforts to modernize the process is not the solution.“APGA appreciates the members of the House and Senate who are willing to use the important oversight powers afforded by the CRA to push back against this rule and call attention to the negative impact it will have on efforts to strengthen and improve American infrastructure.” ""The Energy Equipment and Infrastructure Alliance (EEIA) is in strong support for S.J. Resolution 55, introduced by Senator Sullivan and co-sponsored by 49 of his colleagues, disapproving the recently issued National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions.""America is blessed with vast reserves of natural gas and oil, along with a highly advanced energy industry that produces our resources under the most stringent environmental controls of any country in the world. This blessing has given Americans secure, affordable and reliable energy and enhanced national security at a time when most of the rest of the world is grappling with an historic energy crisis. Yet a key limitation on our ability to fully leverage this advantage is our currently inadequate energy transport capacity, particularly pipelines. This shortfall is worsening rapidly, and that is driving our energy prices higher.""The reason our energy transport infrastructure cannot expand to meet growing demand is our government’s excessive and needlessly onerous infrastructure permitting hurdles which discourage investment in new capacity. This constraint will be made far worse by the Biden Administration’s NEPA Regulations Revisions, which roll back common-sense reforms that modernized federal environmental reviews. These new regulations, if allowed to stand, will make it far less likely that much-needed new projects will be initiated by midstream operators, reluctant to risk investing in the substantial up-front engineering and design work that precedes applications for permits that require environmental reviews under NEPA.""As a result, Americans are paying a hefty price for no benefit, tens of thousands of energy infrastructure workers sit idle, and large investments in capital equipment for construction are stranded. Therefore we strongly urge adoption of S.J. Resolution 55.""“Energy Workforce & Technology Council applauds Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and the 49 cosponsors of S.J. Res. 55, which would repeal the overburdensome Phase I National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation announced by the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) in April 2022. This regulation puts critical energy projects at risk of delay and excessive costs at a time when Americans and our allies are in need of increased infrastructure investment and energy production to meet growing global demand. Energy Workforce & Technology Council calls on the Senate to pass S.J. Res. 55 and empower the US oil and gas industry to secure clean, reliable energy for Americans and our allies abroad.” – Leslie Beyer, CEO, Energy Workforce & Technology Council“We strongly support Senator Sullivan’s S.J. Res. 55. We support common sense NEPA permitting reforms that protect the environment while ensuring that critical energy infrastructure can be built.” The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) applauds Senator Sullivan for introducing S.J. Res 55 and his efforts to overturn the Biden Administration’s new NEPA rules.     ""Since its enactment, requirements for the application of NEPA have grown considerably and place a heavy burden on independent oil and natural gas producers.  While the law itself remains unchanged over the past 50 years, the courts, Presidential directives and significant regulatory modifications have made NEPA unworkable and far more complicated than the original intent of the law.  IPAA supports efforts to modernize NEPA and reduce needless delays that hinder American oil and natural gas projects and badly needed infrastructure initiatives across the nation. ""The Biden Administration’s new rules move our nation in the wrong direction and will only add delays and hinder needed investment in energy projects around the nation. ""IPAA supports Senator Sullivan efforts and urge the Senate to quickly consider SJ Res 55.""The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) appreciates Senator Dan Sullivan’s (R-AK) introduction of a proposal (S.J. Res. 55) that would reinstate the 2020 regulatory enhancements to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  INGAA’s membership, which represents companies that transport more than 95 percent of the nation’s natural gas through a network of nearly 200,000 miles of pipelines, advocated through the rulemaking process for portions of the 2020 NEPA rule to ensure its effectiveness without curtailing environmental protections.  For critical infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines, these 2020 regulatory enhancements integrated leading case law, improved clarity, and resolved interpretive issues that previously reduced reliability in the NEPA process.  We support the Senator’s call for a return to a more dependable, workable, efficient, and legally durable approach to NEPA. Joint quote from David Callahan, President, Marcellus Shale Coalition, Charlie Burd, Executive Director, Gas and Oil Association of West Virginia, and Rob Brundrett, President, Ohio Oil and Gas Association. “The Biden Administration’s actions reversing key permitting reforms threaten to delay or derail critically necessary energy infrastructure projects, from natural gas pipelines to wind turbine installations. Investment decisions rely on a consistent and predictable regulatory environment, and continued ambiguity is a barrier to America realizing the economic, environmental and consumer benefits of abundant domestic natural gas."" Joint quote from David Callahan, President, Marcellus Shale Coalition, Charlie Burd, Executive Director, Gas and Oil Association of West Virginia, and Rob Brundrett, President, Ohio Oil and Gas Association.“The Biden Administration’s actions reversing key permitting reforms threaten to delay or derail critically necessary energy infrastructure projects, from natural gas pipelines to wind turbine installations.

Sullivan and Rep. Graves effort to roll back overly burdensome NEPA regulations and preserve a more sensible, workable permitting process. As the most environmentally responsible way to move freight over land, railroads invest billions annually in making their network safer, more sustainable and more resilient. There is no doubt that protecting the environment and expediting project completion are both possible, and when it comes to the railroads, they go hand in hand.”Rather than looking backward, the Council on Environmental Quality should be focused on implementing the project delivery reforms included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  Senator Sullivan’s legislation will help achieve that goal.  # # #"

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/editorial-a-permitting-test-for-democrats,"Permitting headaches for public works are a bipartisan complaint. So we wonder: Will Democratic Senators join their Republican colleagues in voting to reverse a Biden Administration rule that adds costly new roadblocks? Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan plans to call for a vote as early as this week on a resolution to overturn a Council on Environmental Quality change to permitting rules under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Under the Congressional Review Act, a simple majority of both chambers can pass a resolution of disapproval to kill a rule. Any Senator can also make a non-debatable motion for a floor vote. While a President can veto a resolution, it has the salutary effect of compelling Members of Congress to endorse or repudiate a regulation. Many Democratic Senators have been silent as the Administration tries to strangle public works and private energy projects via regulation. Now they will have to take a position. Finalized in April, the Biden rule rewrote parts of a Trump Administration rule that sought to ease regulatory barriers under NEPA. The new rule gives federal regulators enormous discretion over the scope of environmental reviews under NEPA. The Biden rule summary says it “clarifies that agencies have discretion to consider a variety of factors” and aren’t limited by their statutory authorities. In short, it empowers regulators to do as they please. One exception: The rule limits their discretion to fast-track reviews. For instance, the rule requires federal agencies to consider all of the “cumulative” and “indirect” project effects, including those created by climate change. Regulators have to consider how a project in conjunction with other unrelated activities affects land, air, water and endangered species.Some liberal federal judges have read such a requirement into the law and used this as a pretext to block projects. Earlier this year, a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals panel tossed a permit for the Mountain Valley gas pipeline because the Fish and Wildlife Service did not consider the “cumulative” impact of non-pipeline construction on two endangered species. The judges said the agency should have evaluated how the pipeline—in conjunction with road improvement, urbanization, water withdrawals, agriculture and climate change—could affect the logperch and candy darter fish years into the future. Under the Biden rule, federal agencies would have to do this sort of evaluation for every large project they review. That could include chip-making factories receiving federal subsidies because they have large land impact and require loads of water. A report last fall by Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology noted that permitting obstacles could impede construction of new semiconductor factories.The Biden White House didn’t have to rewrite the Trump rule, and it did so precisely so its regulators and courts find it easier to block projects. There is no other justification for it. The Manchin-Schumer bill gives federal agencies an additional $375 million to “facilitate timely and efficient environmental reviews.” But the real reason regulators need more money is because the Biden rule requires unnecessarily extensive environmental analyses. All 50 Senate Republicans are co-sponsors of Mr. Sullivan’s important resolution. This vote will be telling for West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, since his support would cause the resolution to pass with 51 votes. But the vote will also be a signal of how much Democratic support there is for permitting reforms that Mr. Manchin says Democratic leaders have pledged to vote on by the end of September. That would require 60 votes to pass. We’ll see how many Democrats really want new public works and more energy by how many of them vote for Mr. Sullivan’s resolution.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-will-hold-three-pentagon-nominees-over-bidens-choking-off-domestic-critical-mineral-supplies,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), yesterday announced he intends to hold three senior Biden administration Defense Department nominees in response to the administration’s decision in February to stall the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Road project in Alaska. The nominees will be in charge of the nation’s defense industrial base, including the domestic supply chain of critical minerals, resources that are essential to many defense technologies.The Ambler Mining District is one of the most prolific untapped deposits of critical minerals. The United States is currently 100 percent reliant on other countries for 14 critical minerals and more than 75 percent reliant for an additional ten critical minerals. Sullivan argued that, while he believes the nominees are well qualified, the Interior Department’s reckless action to block the Ambler project and limit the supply of critical minerals, at a time of heightened tension with China, puts the nation’s security at risk and warrants answers from the Biden administration.“The Ambler Mining District is considered one of the most extensive sources of undeveloped zinc, copper, lead, gold, and silver anywhere in the world. But we have no transportation to it. On the same day President Biden hosted a summit on America’s critical mineral supply chains, his Interior Department shut down the Record a Decision for the road to Ambler,” said Sen. Sullivan. “This decision was a huge set-back for our domestic critical mineral supply chains, really undermining our national security. I haven’t been able to get answers from anybody in the Pentagon or at the Department of the Interior. Therefore, while I believe these nominees are well qualified, I’m putting a hold on their nominations until I get answers.” The three nominees are Dr. Radha Plumb, nominated to be deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, Dr. Laura Taylor-Kale, nominated to be assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy, and Brendan Owens, nominated to be assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations, and environment. The Ambler Road project began permitting during the Obama administration and received final federal approval in July of 2020 following a seven-year environmental impact statement (EIS) process, 36,000 public comments, 30 public hearings, and 30 consultations with tribal groups. On February 2, 2022, the Biden administration Department of the Interior filed in federal court to reopen the Record of Decision for the project, adding months of delays for supplemental environmental analysis.The Ambler Road would provide the access needed to responsibly develop a number of high-grade mineral deposits—including copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, and other metals—in northwest Alaska. A right-of-way across federal land is guaranteed by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-key-infrastructure-provisions-for-alaska-ports-and-harbors,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) celebrated today’s passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022 on the Senate floor. The legislation includes key victories for Alaska infrastructure, including increased cost-sharing for the Nome Arctic Deep Draft Port (resulting in community savings of $132 million) and authorization for the Elim Subsistence Harbor project.Following unanimous passage in the EPW Committee, the legislation passed the Senate floor by a vote of 93-1. It now moves on to the House of Representatives. “Alaska is a resource-rich, but infrastructure-poor state,” Senator Sullivan said. “The Army Corps of Engineers continues to do its vital work throughout Alaska, and this legislation provides the tools needed to support new water resources infrastructure and improve existing projects. Since serving as a senator for Alaska, I’ve been advocating for projects that will help our state realize its full economic potential and keep our citizens safe. “I also want to thank my fellow committee members for their continued recognition of the vital role Nome’s deep-water port will play in advancing America’s capabilities in the Arctic,” Sullivan said. “The Port of Nome is positioned to play a critical role in ensuring the United States is a leader in the Arctic region in terms of national security, international trade, and geopolitical influence.” “With more coastline than the entire Lower 48, Alaska’s ports and harbors are essential to our coastal communities and the safe and efficient operation of our marine transportation system. The Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, provides the Army Corps of Engineers with necessary resources and enhanced authorities to fulfill its mission in Alaska so that we can continue to improve Alaska’s ports and waterways, spur economic development, protect the environment, and so much more,” said Senator Murkowski. “I applaud Senator Sullivan for his work on the EPW Committee and strongly support many of the provisions he helped secure, particularly a provision to support Nome’s deepwater port and a new program for communities that are increasingly threatened by storm damage and coastal erosion. For a coastal state like Alaska, this legislation—and the support it brings our ports and harbors—is crucial.” Key provisions for Alaska in WRDA 2022: # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-sullivan-despite-bidens-varying-explanations-this-past-year-inflation-is-joe-bidens-fault,"WASHINGTON—On the Hugh Hewitt Show today, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) called out President Joe Biden for refusing to accept responsibility for the record-setting inflation that is “crushing middle-class and working-class families.” Sullivan said the sky-high prices Americans are paying are “Joe Biden’s fault…the Federal Reserve’s fault…Biden’s anti-energy policies’ fault.” Sullivan also discussed letters he has sent to the Interior Department’s inspector general and ethics office requesting an investigation of political appointees in the department who are allegedly working on matters directly related to and benefitting their previous clients and work.SULLIVAN: Despite Biden’s Varying Explanations This Past Year, Inflation is Joe Biden’s Fault SULLIVAN: “I put out a tweet yesterday going through the list of the Biden administration's explanations with regard to inflation. If you remember first, it's not happening. Then it was transitory. Then you might remember, oh, this is a high-class problem. Then it was well, actually, this is a good thing. Then it was, it was Covid’s fault. Then it's Putin's fault. And now it's the “ultra-MAGA Republicans” fault. I mean, this is literally in the last year. And look, the American people are wise, Hugh. They know exactly whose fault it is. It's Joe Biden's fault. It's the Federal Reserve's fault. It's Biden's anti-energy policies’ fault. And you know, this is the number one issue. As you say, it's not only unsustainable, it is crushing middle-class and working-class Americans.” SULLIVAN: Biden’s Department of Interior Officials Have Huge Conflicts of Interest HEWITT: “You know, I am used to when Democrats when they bring along all their environmental activists, but usually they have the good manners not to put their environmental activists in charge of what they have lobbied for. You call them out on this. Would you explain to them, to the people, what they did by bringing in folks from the environmental activists’ padre?”SULLIVAN: “Absolutely. It's a huge issue in December of this past year. I wrote the Inspector General at the Department of Interior and I said, you need to look into four senior officials at the Department of Interior, all of whom were working with environmental groups or other groups that had interest in shutting down Alaska. And a long long list of activities that these individuals did. And now they are actually in charge, for the American people because they’re senior officials at theInterior [working] on policies. . .doing the exact things that they did when they were working for these radical environmental groups. And it's a huge conflict of interests. And I lay out the statute and the executive orders saying you can't lobby and work on something and then go do it with regard to positions of trust now held, for the American people, and they're doing it in my state: 22 executive orders or executive actions, Hugh, focused on shutting down Alaska—singularly focusing and targeting Alaska, Alaska's working families. It is just remarkable when the national Dems get into power, they institute what I always refer to as the anti-Alaska agenda. They essentially say to all the radical environmental groups, [do] you want to shut down the Great State of Alaska?. . .Go ahead.” # # #"

During her tenure, Kear has grown the services offered, including shelter, job training, education services, and counseling, among others. Covenant House Alaska is now a nationwide model for helping youth. Kear was recognized as part of Sen. Sullivan’s series, “Alaskan of the Week.” As Senator Sullivan noted, Kear is celebrating her 25th year at Covenant House Alaska.“Great job, Alison,” Senator Sullivan said. “Through sheer tenacity, determination, and grit and through deep partnerships throughout the communities--not just in Anchorage but even beyond--Alison has led that effort.

And most importantly, thank you, again, for being our Alaskan of the Week.  I yield the floor.”Full Transcript: Madam President, it is Thursday, and it is my favorite time of the week. And I can see the pages are getting all excited about another edition of the ``Alaskan of the Week.'' We get to talk about someone who is making a big difference in Alaska, someone whose spirit is helping others.We always like to end the week on a positive note here in the U.S. Senate, usually with an ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech. So before I get to talk about our special Alaskan, an incredible woman named Alison Kear, I am going to give a little update about what is going on in Alaska.So, as I mentioned last week, winter is no longer coming; winter is on the run. The sun is out longer and longer every day. Let me give you a real cool example. In Utqiagvik, known as Barrow--the northernmost city, community, in North America at Point Barrow--the sun is getting out longer and longer each day.Now, remember, just 3 months ago, Utqiagvik had no sun--zero, zilch. Utqiagvik gained more than 17 minutes of daylight from yesterday. Isn't that cool? It is kind of amazing. The sun rose at 4 a.m. and will set tonight after midnight. Four months ago there was no sun. So a lot going on.In Anchorage, the home of Alison, our Alaskan of the Week, it is in the 50s, balmy this weekend. So it is a great time to be in Alaska. There isn't a person who doesn't long to visit the great State and join us up there. So please come and join us.So let me go back to Alison Kear, who is doing a great job in Alaska, our Alaskan of the Week. She runs a very special organization called Covenant House, one of 33 Covenant Houses in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.Covenant House's mission is to help with youth homelessness. That means, of course, helping provide short- and long-term housing for young people who are experiencing homelessness. But to really help our young people--all people--get into a stable situation, whether that means to reunite with family or get into a permanent home, what Covenant House does involves so much more.At Covenant House Alaska, they offer so much more, and that has been Alison's incredible legacy. So let me talk about Alison, who started with Covenant House in 1997. So she is celebrating 25 years with the organization, a silver anniversary. Way to go, Alison. We are so proud of her.She was born and raised in Florida. She went to college in Texas. She arrived in Alaska in 1994 armed with a graduate degree in healthcare management, a job at a local hospital in Alaska, and big ideas about where her life would lead her. Initially, at least, those plans did not involve Covenant House. In fact, according to Alison, they didn't involve Alaska for too long. She arrived--as she said recently to some of my team as we were putting this together--in the last frontier with big hair, a couple of fancy suits, and a plan: If she spent 3 years in Alaska working at a hospital, she would probably get transferred to a big city of her choice in the lower 48 to run a hospital of her own.So that was the initial plan, Madam President. But like so many before her, her plans started to change. And like so many before her, the change of heart toward Alaska started making her think: Hmm, maybe I am going to stay here. Maybe I have a great life ahead of me in the great State of Alaska.Now, it happened a bit slowly. Alaska grew on her, as it does for so many people. She moved into a house with a great group of people her age. She began to ski, enjoy the great outdoors, have fun, make friends, friends who eventually turned into her extended family.Slowly, Alison began to question that earlier plan she had that she was so committed to, and that started to lead to her thinking: I think I am going to have a great life here in Alaska. Her best friend was the executive director of Covenant House Alaska. Then--25 years ago--it was a crisis shelter that offered few services and, to be honest, was struggling to actually stay open.Her friend asked Alison if she could volunteer a few hours of her time helping with grant writing. So Alison said: Sure. I will do that, a little bit of time.  And when her 3 years were up, that same friend said to her: You know, Alison, I think you should stay. I think you need a mission right here at Covenant House.Something about that rang true for Alison. So in 1997, she started work at Covenant House in development for $9 an hour--with no health insurance, by the way. So she started kind of at the lower levels of Covenant House and started to work her way up.And then the mission that she never knew she needed found Alison. She tells a story about a Thanksgiving celebration they were having at Covenant House. There was a boy sharing the meal with them, someone whose own story was filled with unspeakable trauma, even horror. He talked about his family:``I don't think my mom ever loved me,'' he told the group, ``but I am glad that she had me because you guys here at Covenant House love me.''That is powerful. That is very powerful. That simple statement hit Alison. She called her mother, Mary Whittemore, that evening, crying to her mom. You always loved me, Alison told her mom. When she internalized that and realized how important that love is, the concept of who she was and what she could be changed forever.And I would say it changed Covenant House forever. Because of the love her mom gave her, she realized, too, that she had a big enough heart for love, especially at that wonderful organization. And Alison has spread that love, that devotion and commitment to thousands of Alaska's youth since that time, she and her team--her ``rock stars,'' as she calls them--at Covenant House.When she started--get this in terms of progress--Covenant House, as I mentioned, was a crisis shelter with a budget of about $900,000. Under Alison's leadership and the hard work of so many others, it is now an organization with a budget of about $15 million, with a new job training center and more education and employment services than ever before.Great job, Alison.And it has also become a nationwide model for helping youth. Through sheer tenacity, determination, and grit and through deep partnerships throughout the communities--not just in Anchorage but even beyond--Alison has led that effort. Roughly 200 kids a day from all over our State--thousands a year--are served by Covenant House Alaska.  So how do they do it? Let's say you are a teen. I know our pages can't imagine being a teen. Let's say you are a teen and you can't stay at home any longer. Maybe there is abuse or family addiction or you have aged out of foster care, and you don't have a place to sleep. Think about that. Unfortunately, a lot of teens have that problem in America.And in Alaska, remember how cold it is--often below zero in the winter--and how horrible it is to sleep outside. So many of these kids are from rural parts of our State and have had to travel hundreds of miles to get to Anchorage. So now they are in the big city. They are likely to be traumatized, confused, lonely. It is bitterly cold outside. They have no place to go.  These are children, and it is heartbreaking whether you are in Alaska or anywhere else in the lower 48. So imagine that.Now imagine this. Enter Covenant House Alaska. Covenant House has an outreach program, an incredible team of dedicated employees and servants to the people, to the kids, who walk the streets, go to malls, to homeless camps, wherever the kids might be. They give them some food, basic essentials, and tell them about Covenant House. That is what Alison's team does. They begin developing a relationship of trust because most of these youth have actually never had a trusting, stable adult in their lives.  What do the youth find when they get to Covenant House? First, there are people who welcome them, who smile at them, who treat them with kindness, who treat them with respect. If they are hungry, they get a warm meal, and they get shelter. And if they are dealing with trauma, they get counseling.Eventually, if they decide they need to finish school or earn their GED, there is a classroom there. If they are pregnant or already have a baby, they will learn positive parenting skills.Covenant House Alaska partners with several other amazing Alaskan organizations onsite--this is a big deal--what they call wraparound services, so the kids don't need to go back on the streets. These different partners who work with Covenant House offer everything a teen needs to learn about in terms of life skills that so many of us take for granted.And what is so amazing is that someone at Covenant House will stay with you for as long as you need it. They provide those services, even--this is really important--even after you leave the shelter, to help these teens navigate the system, apply for jobs, get an apartment, get transportation, get them through a crisis that they might be having.All the things that we as parents do for our own kids, Covenant House does in so many ways for these kids--almost everything they might need to have a chance, an opportunity, a bright future.  Now, of course, Madam President, it is not that easy. It sounds easy, but it is not easy at all. Some of these youth have experienced unspeakable trauma. And I am going to talk a little bit about a tough subject, but it needs to be spoken about. For far too many of these youth, especially the young women and even some of the young men, they have been trafficked by bad people.  And the statistics are horrific. A 2017 study from Loyola University found that 28 percent of the young people being served at Covenant House Alaska identified themselves as survivors of human trafficking--28 percent. A disproportionate number of these teenagers are Alaskan Native--young women, many of whom who have been lured out of their villages with a promise of a better life, and they have been lured into trafficking.At Covenant House, the leadership has not shied away from these statistics, and I think that is a testament to Alison and her leadership. Instead, they talk openly about it. They have studied it. They work tirelessly and diligently with law enforcement and other agencies in Alaska to address this scourge, which, of course, we have in Alaska, and we have throughout America. Importantly, they make these survivors--and all the young people who come to Covenant House--feel safe. They call it ``creating sanctuary'' for the youth at Covenant House, and it works. It works.Alison said there are countless stories of young people who walked into Covenant House Alaska in crisis--traumatized, scared, lonely, very hurt--who are now happy high school and college graduates, working, with their own families, doing great things for the State. Some have even come back to be staff at Covenant House. I have had the honor of meeting a number of these young Alaskans who are contributing so much.  Alison is the key reason why this has all happened successfully. She is tenacious. She is smart, stubborn--that is not my language, by the way; that washer own language--ambitious and loving for her kids.Joe Hemphill, Covenant House Alaska's chief development officer, calls Alison a ``visionary for kids.'' He has known her for 25 years, and Joe said this about Alison:One thing . . . hasn't changed [in over 25 years]: she has never taken ``no'' for an answer and she still doesn't.  But her heart leads. When you talk to her, she will tell you that love is truly the answer for all that ails our communities and certainly for all that ails our young people in them.``How great it is to create a space where someone can . . . feel love,'' Alison said, ``to take it and to give it.'' She continued: “It's the only thing that has truly changed communities [when you think about it]. Homelessness is not a singular experience. It's about a void in relationships, it's about a void of love.”Again, Alison credits her mother--that is very sweet, especially as we are approaching Mother's Day--for helping her understand what love means and how she can give it to others and how it can make a huge difference in all of our communities. So I want to thank all the staff at Covenant House Alaska for doing such great work, day in, day out, 24/7, 365 days a year. As I mentioned, I want to thank you. My wife Julie also wants to thank you. Julie has had the honor of working at Covenant House for several years as staff and on the board and she has seen firsthand all the great work that Alison and her team have done for our youth in Alaska.  Again, to all of Covenant House, thank you for walking alongside our youth who have not had love in their lives and yet who are resilient and working hard to find a positive path in life. The Covenant House team is making that happen.And, of course, thank you to Alison for leading this exceptional team. By the way, Alison, I know your birthday is coming up, so happy birthday. And most importantly, thank you, again, for being our Alaskan of the Week.  I yield the floor.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-van-hollen-recognize-us-foreign-service-day-2022,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), co-founders of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Service Caucus, announced they will introduce a resolution celebrating May 6, 2022, as “Foreign Service Day.” The day recognizes the men and women who have served, or are presently serving, in the Foreign Service of the United States and honors the members of the Foreign Service who have given their lives in the line of duty. Foreign Service Day has been celebrated on the first Friday in May for generations. 2022 marks 98 years since the establishment of the Foreign Service in 1924.Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also co-sponsored the resolution.This year’s “Foreign Service Day” also commemorates six months since the Foreign Service Families Act passed in the Senate. The bill—authored by Senators Van Hollen and Sullivan—was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act on December 27, 2021. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are also original cosponsors of the Foreign Service Families Act.The Foreign Service, comprising 16,000 U.S. personnel, plus 75,000 locally-engaged personnel who serve at embassies and consulates overseas, are members of the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Commerce, the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media. “For 98 years, the men and women of the Foreign Service have promoted America’s interests, strengthened our national security, and assisted U.S. citizens abroad,” Senator Sullivan said. “Today, my colleagues and I salute the hard-working members of the U.S. Foreign Service and reaffirm our commitment to providing this crucial diplomatic corps with the support they need and deserve.”“Our Foreign Service members commit themselves to protect and promote America’s interests – often at great personal risk and sacrifice. Their dedication is vital to maintaining and advancing American diplomacy around the world. That’s why I’m honored to recognize these men and women, their families, and their immense contributions to our nation in celebration of Foreign Service Day today. I’m proud to have bolstered our Foreign Service members through the passage of our bipartisan Foreign Service Families Act – included in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Our Foreign Service members are true patriots, and I will always have their backs,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Each year on the first Friday in May, we commemorate Foreign Service Day to honor those who gave their lives in service to their nation, defending the security, prosperity, and fundamental values of the United States,” said Ambassador Eric Rubin, president of AFSA. “Today, democracy, human rights, individual freedom, and the rule of law are under siege around the world, and U.S. security and economic interests are under threat. Members of the Foreign Service remain ready to defend them, to take necessary risks and accept the hardships that come with serving as the first line of defense for our nation. I thank our caucus co-chairs for their commemoration of this day and the resolution recognizing the important work of the Foreign Service.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-announce-fisheries-disaster-funding-for-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today announced the U.S. Department of Commerce will direct nearly $132 million to Alaska for fishery disasters. The funds, which were appropriated by Congress, are part of a total of $144 million that will be disbursed nationwide for this purpose.“I’m pleased to announce this crucial funding is finally on the way for Alaska’s seafood industry. After facing both serious fishery disasters and the pandemic, there are owners, employees, families, and entire communities in our state who can now breathe a little easier,” Senator Murkowski said. “I thank Secretary Raimondo and Director Young, who were strong partners at the Department of Commerce and OMB as we worked to reform and improve a truly broken approval process. Going forward, I will be pushing for further assistance, to help guarantee that Alaska’s industry can keep their operations up and running and continue to provide fresh, healthy seafood at home and around the globe.”“I want to express my appreciation to Secretary Raimondo and OMB Director Young for working so closely with me and my team to get these disaster declarations approved and funds allocated for Alaska’s fishermen,” Senator Sullivan said. “These disasters have had a widespread impact across our state—devastating many of our coastal and river-based communities, fishermen, and Alaska Native subsistence users. While these federal dollars won’t make these Alaskans and their families whole, they will go a long way toward providing much-needed relief.”# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/army-to-reestablish-11th-airborne-division-americas-third-in-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth announced today that U.S. Army Alaska will be redesignated as the 11th Airborne Division, constituting the nation’s third airborne division and second paratrooper division. Secretary Wormuth made the announcement during a line of questioning today from Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) in a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), which included testimony from General James McConville, chief of staff of the Army. Sullivan and Wormuth mentioned one goal of the redesignation is to give the Army’s Alaska-based forces a greater sense of purpose and identity amid a tragic spike in suicides. The redesignation would also help fulfill the aims of the Army’s recently-released Arctic strategy, which resulted from a Sullivan-authored provision in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.  “This is a historic development for our Alaska-based military,” Sen. Sullivan said after the hearing. “Redesignating U.S. Army Alaska under the 11th Airborne Division banner presents a dual opportunity for our country—renewing the spirit and purpose of our Alaska-based soldiers by connecting them with this division’s proud and storied history, and better fulfilling America’s role as an Arctic nation. We can’t forget, this development would not have been possible had we lost the 4-25 back in 2015 when the Obama administration was enacting draconian cuts to our Armed Forces. I’m glad to have worked with so many Alaskans, who love and support our military, to preserve our Alaska-based soldiers who help secure America’s interests in the Arctic and Asia-Pacific, and to witness this exciting future for our Arctic warriors.”“One of the things we found, in addition, that we think is contributing potentially to some of what we're seeing in Alaska is that some of the soldiers there don't feel like they have a sense of identity or purpose around why they're stationed there,” Secretary Wormuth said to Sen. Sullivan. “So we are looking at, as we talked about yesterday, re-flagging the U.S. Army Alaska headquarters as the 11th Airborne Division, which is a division that was disestablished, but has a very storied lineage and we're thinking of essentially renaming U.S. Army Alaska [as the] 11th Airborne Division.” “…The 11th has a great history and heritage,” said General McConville. “That means a lot to soldiers and tabs on their badges—things like that matter. But, also, we're looking at the Arctic very differently. We put out a strategy. We think it's very different. We've got to be able to operate in that environment. We've got to make sure the units have the capabilities and that gives them the confidence to be somewhat special—you're the ones that can operate with the right equipment and even transform some of those units so they have the right vehicles to operate in the coldest time [of year]. They have the right equipment and the right clothing. All of those things come together to give them a sense of identity, and that's who we send there. We have a lot of people who want to go to Alaska. They go up there and they thrive. We have some that don't. They just have a tough time…We talked about building cohesive teams. You build a cohesive team around a mission and you give them focus, and you give them identity, and that's what brings them together. That's what we want to try to do.”The 11th Airborne Division originally operated between 1943 and 1965, first activated during World War II in the Pacific Theater for the liberation of the Philippines and the occupation of Japan. The Alaska-based 25thInfantry Division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team, based at Ft. Wainwright, and 4th Brigade Combat Team, based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, will be redesignated as the 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams of the 11thAirborne Division. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech-indo-pacific-economic-framework,"Mr. President, I wanted to come down to talk about a topic that a number of Senators have been talking about and that a number of Senators have been focused on. That is the topic of Taiwan and potentially the defense of Taiwan and the support for Taiwan.As this body knows, in 1979, the Senate passed a very important bill called the Taiwan Relations Act--a very bipartisan bill. From that time on, the Senate has played a very important oversight role in U.S. relations with Taiwan, and it has always been very bipartisan.Recently, a bipartisan codel, led by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Menendez, with many other Senators--Senator Graham, Senator Portman, Senator Sasse--traveled to Taiwan. I just got an out-brief from some of those Senators--a very good meeting. I was part of a bipartisan codel about a year ago, with Senator Coons and Senator Duckworth, also to Taiwan. So there is a long tradition in the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan way, with all of us working together, of addressing this question: To what degree should we be supporting and defending Taiwan against a very aggressive Chinese Communist Party, led by the dictator Xi Jinping? Why does it matter? Why should we all be working together, as we have done for decades here in the U.S. Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to deter a military invasion of Taiwan?What will be happening in the next few weeks I want to talk about because I am concerned about the direction of the Biden administration, and I think every Senator here should be concerned. So I am going to ask my colleagues to lift up their voices when they talk to the Biden administration on a topic I am going to mention here in a minute. But why does it matter? Well, this issue of the potential invasion of Taiwan could take place in a few years. The INDOPACOM commander, a little over a year ago, in front of the Armed Services Committee, opined that the threat of an invasion of Taiwan by an aggressive Chinese Communist Party would manifest itself during this decade--``in fact, in the next 6 years.'' That was Admiral Davidson, former INDOPACOM commander, and that is not a lot of time. Here is why I think it matters: Right now, Taiwan is on the frontline of freedom in Asia. It is not some peripheral sideshow; it is, in many ways, central to freedom in that part of the world like West Berlin was during the Cold War. A violent military takeover of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party would be a sea change in how the entire world is ordered. It would change the history of the 21st century in the way that the Guns of August of 1914 changed the 20th century. Now, some see the defense of Taiwan and the support that is required from the United States because of the Taiwan Relations Act--again, led by this body--some see the defense and support of this island democracy as a luxury that we can't afford in an age shaped by great power competition.I actually believe--and I believe many Senators, Democrats and Republicans, believe the opposite--that a Taiwan under China's control would decisively advance Beijing's campaign to export its authoritarian model around the world; to separate the United States from our democratic allies; and it would certainly be part of Xi Jinping's goal of excluding the United States from the INDOPACOM theater.Taiwan--a thriving, prosperous Chinese democracy that holds free election and bounds its power by the rule of law--is central to the free world and its future.By the way, if you are an American citizen, regardless of political party, you should take pride in the fact that this country--or this island democracy--is free because it wouldn't have happened without the sacrifice and resources of the United States and our military, and that is a fact.A few months ago, I gave a speech on this topic, and I talked about how, when you think of the defense of Taiwan and deterrence, which is what we all want--deterrence; nobody wants a war in the Taiwan Strait--there are really three layers of deterrence for the island of Taiwan.The first is Taiwan's ability to militarily defend itself, the so-called hedgehog approach or porcupine approach. Right here, they are defending themselves in the way the Ukrainians are defending themselves. Senator Roger Wicker had a very good op-ed in the Wall Street Journal just today on that very topic. We need to make sure Taiwan has that capability--it is in the Taiwan Relations Act that we have that responsibility--so that it can defend itself, and they are undertaking the right approach with regard to the military weapons they are buying from the United States and other places.The second level of deterrence that you see here on this chart would be America's capability to defend Taiwan militarily should the President of the United States decide to do so if there is an invasion by the Chinese Communist Party. Over several decades, through many different crises in the Taiwan Strait, this layer of deterrence, wherein the United States has shown up with military force, has proven to be decisive in keeping the Taiwanese people free, and our deep network of allies in the region augments this second level of deterrence.But there is also a third level of deterrence. The third level of deterrence is often not discussed, but in many ways, particularly now, it could be more powerful than the first and second levels, and that is the level that relates to bringing in the instruments of American power beyond our military, such as our global economic and financial strengths, to deter China from an invasion. You see this third level: economic and financial sanctions.This is exactly what my bipartisan bill, the STAND with Taiwan Act, would do. I am working with several Senators on this bill right now. We have introduced it already, but we are going to recalibrate it, particularly with regard to the lessons learned from Ukraine.One of those lessons that we learned from the brutal Ukrainian invasion by the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in Ukraine is that comprehensive economic and financial sanctions have the best chance of deterring a conflict when they are clearly articulated and ready to go before the conflict begins. That wasn't the case in Ukraine, and we will never know, had sanctions already been teed up and ready to go, if they could have deterred that conflict.With the STAND with Taiwan Act, which stands for Sanctions Targeting Aggressors of Neighboring Democracies--STAND--the whole point of this would be to deter Xi Jinping from making the decision. That third layer of deterrence is saying: OK. If you militarily invade Taiwan, here are the massive sanctions that we and our allies are going to hit you with, and they will be devastating.This bill makes it clear that we should be engaging with Taiwan economically, across the board, in many sectors. And this is where I have deep concern--and I believe many of my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate have deep concerns--about the direction that might be happening with regard to the Biden administration.Now, look, I am somebody who, you know, will be critical of the Biden administration when I think they are not doing a good job on certain things. And I do that a lot, particularly on a topic I am going to talk about here in a minute, energy. But in other areas, particularly as it relates to the Biden administration's relationship with regard to our allies and Taiwan, I have been supportive of a number of their initiatives vocally because I think they have strengthened American interests in the INDOPACOM theater. What are those? Well, for example, the Biden administration took this initiative from the Trump administration--it actually started in the Bush administration--called the Quad. That is the biggest democracies in the INDOPACOM theater: us, Japan, Australia, and India. They have taken that grouping, which, during the Trump administration, was reinvigorated, particularly by Secretary Pompeo, at the minister level, and the Biden administration has taken that to the leader level. The President of the United States meets with the leaders of Japan, Australia, and India on a regular basis. That is good. That is smart policy. They have also launched another very innovative policy, the Australia-UK-U.S. agreement to work together on military and defense issues: submarines, nuclear subs, AI, quantum computing. It is called the Arcus initiative. I think it is a really innovative initiative, and I have been very--one of the most vocal supporters of it in the U.S. Senate.The Biden administration has also been pressing the G-7 to do more as it relates to Taiwan--the first time ever in the G-7. That is a good initiative.In a lot of these areas, I have been supportive. So what am I concerned about? This is a concern I have, but it should be a concern that every Senator has. The administration is getting ready to announce what they are calling the Indo-Pacific economic framework. This is going to focus on more economic engagement with our allies in other countries in the INDOPACOM theater. OK. I support that in general. We will see what the details are. But right now, that initiative, which we need in terms of an initiative with regard to economics and other elements of connectivity with our allies in the region, appears to be on the verge of missing two critical factors.No. 1, and the real purpose of what I wanted to talk about, right now, we are hearing from administration officials that the Indo-Pacific economic framework is going to exclude Taiwan. Whoa. Whoa. That would not be a good thing, and I don't think many U.S. Senators--Democrats or Republicans--would agree that the Biden administration's first big economic initiative is going to exclude Taiwan, a very important economic player, very important technical player in terms of chip fabrication. Why would they do that? Well, it is not clear.I have been pressing a number of Biden administration officials saying, you can't make that move. A, the Senate is not going to like it. And we have had a lot to say about U.S. relations with Taiwan for decades. And, B, it just doesn't make sense.Some of the things I have heard is, well, there is this argument that trade is really not national security, so it doesn't relate to Taiwan. Well, that is not correct. Trade and economic issues are clearly national security issues as it relates to our country, as it relates to our allies.The other thing I have heard is that, well, some of the other countries in the Indo-Pacific framework don't really want Taiwan in it. Again, we are the United States. We are the leader in that part of the world. If another country is saying, hey, I don't want Taiwan in it, you know, I think we need to politely tell them that, too bad. They are going to be.So I am primarily giving these remarks right now to let all of my Senate colleagues, many of whom--Democrats and Republicans--I know care about this issue.I have been trying to raise the alarm with the administration, saying, bad idea if your big, first economic initiative for the INDOPACOM theater is not going to include Taiwan. I hope other colleagues of mine will do the same. Let me give you one final area that this administration should be focused on as it relates to our partners in the region, and that is energy--that is energy. We have so many opportunities to do more with our allies--of course, in Europe but also in Asia--as it relates to energy.I put forward legislation called the Quad energy initiative that would be an initiative dealing with the export and importation of LNG. Think about the Quad: the United States and Australia, two of the biggest exporters of LNG; Japan, probably the world's biggest importer; and India, who wants to be to help their economy, to help their environment. This is something else I have been pressing this administration on. It will help our trade deficits, it will help our energy security, and--you know I have talked about this a lot--it will help global emissions. The United States right now, since 2005, has been the leader in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, right there. The climb-down was 15 percent since 2005. India, China, everywhere else, significant increases; more American clean burning LNG to our allies in the region, the Quad. But, heck, even China would help us, our national security, our workers at home, and our environment and the global environment. I just want to end with this: I hope all of my Senate colleagues in the next couple of days can reach out to the Biden administration and say: Look, on a number of initiatives--the Quad, Arcus--you have been going in the right direction, and you have strong bipartisan support. But the INDOPACOM economic framework led by the United States, if it is leaving out Taiwan, that is going to be a huge problem, and I don't think many U.S. Senators think that that would be a good idea. Given our long history of leading in a bipartisan way on issues related to Taiwan, I am asking my colleagues to also reach out to the administration and say, there has to be a better way. We cannot economically isolate and forget about Taiwan when we need to be supporting them now more than ever."
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-approves-sullivan-motion-to-ban-taxpayer-dollars-from-funding-forced-labor-sourced-minerals-technology,"WASHINGTON—The U.S. Senate today approved a motion offered by Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) instructing the conferees for the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2022 (USICA) and the America COMPETES Act to include language prohibiting new renewable energy projects receiving federal funds from purchasing materials, technology or critical minerals sourced in the People’s Republic of China or the Russian Federation. Sullivan offered the motion to ensure the United States has a robust, secure supply chain that doesn’t rely on forced labor, while strengthening the nation’s economy and security.“As recently as the early 1980s, our nation produced the vast majority of the critical minerals and renewable energy technologies we use in America, but not anymore,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Unfortunately, Russia and China now have a stranglehold on most of these critical minerals and the clean energy technologies that our nation needs. To make matters worse, some of these critical minerals and materials we are importing—like solar panels and E.V. batteries—are processed and manufactured in China using forced labor and some of the worst environmental standards in the world. We can change this. We must change this. My motion to instruct is simple: Any renewable energy project receiving federal funds cannot use materials, technologies, or critical minerals from China or Russia. Simple, commonsense, humane, and in the interest of America’s workers and our national defense."" In February, the Department of the Interior announced a list of 50 identified critical minerals. In 2020, the United States was 100 percent import-reliant for 17 of these minerals and more than 75 percent reliant for another 23, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Of the 64 elements analyzed by the USGS, China was the leading source of imports for 20 of them, including rare earths.In March, President Biden announced he would invoke the Defense Production Act to facilitate the production of critical minerals necessary for a massive shift to renewables and electric vehicles (EVs). However, the administration and congressional Democrats have been working to undermine domestic production. Last summer, Democrats proposed legislation that would block a mining project in Arizona that could reportedly supply one-quarter of the copper needed by the United States. The Biden Interior Department also canceled two mineral leases for nickel and copper projects in Minnesota in January and, in February, took action to block a road project to the Ambler Mining District in Alaska. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-recognizes-teresa-gray-as-alaskan-of-the-week,"WASHINGTON—On the floor of the U.S. Senate yesterday, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) recognized Teresa Gray, of Anchorage, the founder of Mobile Medics International, a nonprofit that dispatches medical professionals to hard-to-reach communities across the globe to assist victims of natural disasters and war. The organization now has 120 volunteer members, including several Alaskans, who have treated more than 30,000 people on five continents. Gray recently received a “CNN Hero” award for her work. Gray was recognized as part of Sen. Sullivan’s series, “Alaskan of the Week.”Tribute to Teresa Gray Madam President, I want to say that it is Thursday, and it is my favorite time of week, 6 years' strong--almost 7 years--we have been doing our ``Alaskan of the Week'' series, and we love to do this because we get to recognize a special Alaskan, someone who makes the State very special.Our pages, I think they don't always admit it, but it is probably the best speech of the week because it is interesting and we have got some cool stories. I know some of the reporters here like the speech because it means we are at the end of the week so that is good.Today, we are honoring a really amazing Alaskan. Her name is Teresa Gray, of Anchorage, who was, by the way, recently featured by CNN as one of their heroes for the work her organization does that Teresa founded to provide medical help to people all over the globe. So, before I talk about Teresa and her amazing work, I always like to give a little update of what is going on in Alaska right now. I was home the last couple weeks traveling all over the State, and it didn't seem like too long ago when I had said: Hey, winter is coming. Winter is coming. Well, here is the good news. Well, I love winter, but winter is now leaving. It is leaving Alaska.Now, it is cold in many places. My house in Anchorage still has snow on the ground, but the Sun is now up high in the sky, staying up longer and longer every single day--although I was in Fairbanks and we had northern lights going. So that was awesome just last week. But today, in Anchorage, the Sun rose at 6 a.m. and set around 10 p.m. So it is getting long. It is gaining. We gain about 5 minutes a day during this time of the year. Birds are migrating back by the tens of thousands. The excitement of spring is everywhere.So to everybody watching, if you are thinking about great summer travel plans, Alaska is the place to be. So come on up. We would love to have you.So, now, let me talk about Teresa Gray and the organization she founded called Mobile Medics International, which is doing great work across the globe, even as we speak. Teresa is originally from Michigan. As a paramedic, she moved to Alaska in 1999 to be with her then-husband who was from Alaska. And like so many do when they come to Alaska, she fell in love with Alaska. Now, she wasn't really an outdoorsy type, but she said:I just felt at home.It is the people that she loves. She said the State has such a unique group of individuals. We [all] share a kindred spirit. We're all committed to living the Alaska[n] way.That is what Teresa said. And for Teresa, the Alaskan way has been to put her medical skills to use. Now, initially, she worked as an instructor at the only paramedic school in the State, but within 6 months, she bought the school and created two additional schools, one in Fairbanks and one in Wasilla, and made these very successful. Eight years later, she sold those to the University of Alaska. Then she became a flight medic for AeroMed, now known as LifeMed. She was a medical trainer for the Alaska Air National Guard unit, the 210th Rescue Squadron. These are very brave, intrepid PJs who do amazing work all over the State. And she also helped out with the Anchorage Fire Department.When they again adopted a child, their second adopted child, Teresa decided it was time to retire. An aside here--one of Teresa's children, Boyd Jorgensen, was a U.S. marine under my command, with the great unit ECHO Company 4th Reconnaissance Battalion up in Anchorage. So Semper Fi, Staff Sergeant. I hope you are watching.Let's talk about your mom.That retirement for Teresa didn't last long. One day, she was watching the news, and she saw the image--and I think a lot of us remember this image--of a 3-year-old Syrian refugee on the beach of Lesbos, face down in the water. It was very powerful. People all over the world saw that really ghastly image. She thought: Why isn't anybody?She realized, well, she should and she could. So she volunteered for an Irish medical nonprofit which took her to Greece and then to other places across the globe.It didn't take her long to see a need that wasn't being filled. There are a great many medical nonprofits, but the general model is that the doctors and other medical professionals arrive at a place and set up shop. The people in need of care come to them.But there are so many times Teresa witnessed people who couldn't leave their communities. In the case of Puerto Rico, there was a mudslide with limited access to a road that led to a village which hadn't received medical or any kind of help in over a week. People couldn't get a doctor there.So, back in Alaska, she put a call out on social media, and soon, Mobile Medics International was born. The group is focused on mobility, on getting to the barrios, to the villages, up in the mountains--hard places to get to, where she said that ``[s]o many places are lost or forgotten in disasters'' because they are so hard to get to. Roughly, 5 years later, the group now has roughly 120 volunteers from across the globe, including from Alaska, on nearly every continent. They have been on over 30 missions. They are agile. They are expeditionary. They are like the Marines. When they go to a place that has been hit by disaster or to a place experiencing a refugee crisis, everything they need is in a backpack.Teresa said: We can bring our own food, our own water, our own sleeping accommodations. We try to take basically an ambulance in the backpack.Great image. Great idea.If someone requires more extensive care, then they help get that individual to a medical facility, maybe in another part of the country. In addition to natural and humanitarian disasters, Mobile Medics International also trains people in medically underserved villages to provide treatment to others in their communities. So it is train the trainer. Teach someone to fish. They find people in those communities who are willing to commit to 5 years to build their own program in that community, and they support them during that time. They visit a few times a year, get them equipped, get them supplies, get them training, and then, all of a sudden, you have people in those communities who have these medical skills.Teresa talked about her team once going to a remote island in the Philippines where, because of a lack of nutrition, this remote island and the population had a really bad problem with cleft-palate babies. ``Within three years,'' she said, ``we eliminated cleft-palate babies on that island by giving out prenatal vitamins.''Think about that. That is incredible work--one American with a vision making a huge difference in a place like the Philippines. Great work.So let's fast-forward to today. Where do you think she is? Where do you think they are?Well, they are on the frontlines in Ukraine and Romania to help with the refugee crisis there. They have four teams there. They are providing a 24-hour clinic in Romania and go person-to-person to help with medical care. They have organized a warehouse of donated goods. They have delivered supplies into Ukraine, and they are providing emotional support to people who really need it because of the barbaric invasion that has happened there. For Teresa and her group, helping during a refugee crisis is particularly emotional and wrenching. She said: Natural disasters can be horrific. A refugee crisis is even more emotionally difficult. These are people who have lost everything, including their country, their heritage, and their language. She talked about how the Ukrainian refugee crisis is particularly challenging. ``All the men have been left behind,'' she said. You just have mothers, older men, young girls, and women whose entire life in Ukraine is now gone.Her people do more than just medical care. They provide emotional support as well. When she traveled to Romania, there was an elderly woman whom she was treating for health issues. The woman asked for a different kind of help. She asked that she and her son be driven to the border so she could see Ukraine for the last time--a Ukrainian woman just wanting to see her country--and Teresa did that. ``She asked for help, so we gave it to her,'' Teresa said.This is a great example of the drive, determination, vision, and hard work of just one person. Think about it. One person, Teresa Gray, with a vision--and how that vision and drive can change lives--hundreds of lives, thousands of lives.So, Teresa, thank you for providing so much help to so many. Congratulations for being chosen as a CNN hero; but more importantly, much more importantly--sorry, CNN--congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week. You have really, really deserved it and made us all proud.I yield the floor. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/house-passes-sullivans-american-fisheries-advisory-committee-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, welcomed House passage this week of S. 497, the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act, bipartisan legislation he introduced to create an industry-led committee to assist in the administration of fisheries marketing, research, and development grants. The bill was cosponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). The legislation now heads to the President’s desk.“Alaska has the healthiest and most sustainably-managed fisheries in the world thanks in large part to the dedication and insights of our fishermen, vessel owners, distributors, and processors,” said Sen. Sullivan. “For too long, these Alaskans have not had a voice in directing the millions of federal grant dollars toward the priorities and needs of the fishing industry. No longer. Once my American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act is signed into law, our fishermen will again have a seat at the table to offer appropriate input and oversight of the Saltonstall-Kennedy grant process, identify opportunities for improvement and growth, and maintain Alaska’s status as the superpower of seafood.” “I can’t express enough my gratitude to Senator Sullivan, Senator Murkowski, the late great Congressman Young and the other bill co-sponsors for championing the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act over the finish line,” said Matt Alward, president of the United Fishermen of Alaska. “This effort to restore the original intention of the Saltonstall Kennedy Act was many years in the making and was a tremendous team effort.  We look forward to the creation of the committee that will enable the SK grant funding to once again be directed by the US seafood industry to what they feel will best have a positive and impactful effect on all aspects of the seafood industry.”“I am nearly at a loss for words to describe how excited I am that Senator Sullivan had the foresight to carry this great piece of legislation!” said Bruce Schactler, director of the National Seafood Marketing Coalition and the long-time marketing committee chair of the United Fishermen of Alaska. “With a lot of help from Senator Murkowski and our awesome, late Rep Don Young as well as congressional and industry friends from all over the U.S., Senator Sullivan and his talented staff were able to develop and pass this most valuable American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act! I believe that it has the potential to become one of the most powerful economic development tools for the U.S. seafood Industry since the 200-mile limit.” “The recreational fishing industry thanks Sen. Sullivan for his leadership on the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act, which will give fishermen from all sectors a seat at the table to determine important fisheries funding needs,” said Glenn Hughes, president of the American Sportfishing Association. “In Alaska, recreational fishing supports 12,640 jobs and has a $1.5 billion economic impact. This legislation demonstrates Sen. Sullivan’s continued support for marine fisheries and those whose livelihoods depend on them.”The Saltonstall-Kennedy (SK) Act provides funding for fisheries marketing, research, and development. These funds are derived from a portion of fishery import duties. To inform how these funds are allocated, Congress authorized a group of experts from different segments of the fishing industry to advise on commercial fishing problems and needs. Following a 1972 law, the original American Fisheries Advisory Committee was disbanded. In the committee’s absence, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) decides, by its own criteria, who receives grants. In some cases, the priorities of the fishing industry and Alaska fishermen do not match those of NMFS. The American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act would bring back the board of experts, with members chosen regionally and across all sectors of the fishing industry, to bring fishermen back into the process of identifying needs and funding priorities.In 2021, NMFS issued 43 grants worth $11 million. The American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act has garnered the support of a number of organizations, including the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, the United Fishermen of Alaska, and the North Pacific Fisheries Association.The American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act passed the Senate on March 10.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/blms-npr-a-plan-harms-american-energy-security-ignores-alaskan-voices,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today slammed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for reverting the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) to the 2013 version of its Integrated Activity Plan (IAP). This shortsighted decision closes millions of acres to responsible energy development, deliberately upending a careful balance in the management of the reserve and more broadly across Alaska lands. The Biden administration’s move abandons the 2020 version of the IAP, which was developed in partnership with the North Slope Borough and in consultation with North Slope Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations. It comes mere weeks after President Biden pledged to “work like the devil to bring gas prices down.” “This was the wrong decision when it was announced in January, and it is only worse today. We need more domestic resource development, and areas explicitly designated for that purpose should be at the top of the list, not on the chopping block. It is simply shocking that the Biden administration can look at the world, and decide that Alaska is where ‘keep it in the ground’ should apply,” Sen. Murkowski said. “This decision also flies in the face of many of the Alaska Natives who live on the North Slope, who participated in the 2020 plan update and who supported its finalization. The administration is choosing to ignore them, while giving outside environmental groups everything they want.”“The Bureau of Land Management has 25 million acres of land nationwide available for oil development, 23 million of which are in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I have long urged the President to cut the gimmicks and tap this true ‘strategic petroleum reserve,’ which is teeming with reserves ready to alleviate some of our nation’s dire energy needs. But yesterday, President Biden doubled down on his failed policies, removing half of this federally-established oil and gas reserve from consideration and—even more reckless—specifically removing areas with the greatest potential for actual production. This decision will prolong the pain for hard-working Americans and tighten Vladimir Putin’s grip over our allies. Needless to say, President Biden is not doing everything in his power to control prices at the pump or relieve average Americans’ pain. We now know, record inflation, unprecedented gas prices, and a despot wielding vast sums of the world’s petroleum supply will not deter Joe Biden in his relentless war on American energy production.” BLM manages the NPR-A under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act and other federal laws. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the 23-million-acre region on the western North Slope—roughly the size of the state of Indiana—contains 8.7 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically-recoverable oil.The Alaska delegation also condemned this decision when it was first announced in January.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/secretary-haaland-announces-new-delays-and-complications-for-alaska-native-vietnam-era-veterans-seeking-allotments,"FAIRBANKS, ALASKA—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today disputed Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s claim that she is “[moving] expeditiously to deliver on [her] promise” to Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans as she accepted a “Finding of No Significant Impact” (FONSI) from the acting Alaska Bureau of Land Management (BLM) director on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Allotment Program. In accepting the FONSI, Secretary Haaland again declined to approve and send the public land orders (PLOs) that were completed by the prior interior secretary, David Bernhardt, an action supported by a broad coalition of Alaskans.“The Biden administration inherited a commonsense solution to the land issues that have plagued our Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans for the last fifty years,” Sullivan said. “They received a public land order from the Trump administration that simply needed to be published into the Federal Register. Secretary Haaland should have immediately issued the public land order prepared by the Department of the Interior’s professional Alaska-based staff. “Alaska’s congressional delegation for the past year has been encouraging her to do so, including most recently in a letter sent earlier this week. Despite assurances to the delegation that she would urgently address this issue, the secretary has delayed for over a year. Sadly, many of these Vietnam-era veterans who fought for our country and suffered discrimination thereafter have not lived to receive the land our federal government promised them. After today’s announcement, it now appears many more may not either.“This announcement is cause for great concern. The environmental assessment will delay the program undeservedly, complicate the land pattern unnecessarily, and bring about years—if not decades—of litigation. “I call on the secretary to reverse course immediately and take the steps outlined in our letter to swiftly approve the public land order the Biden administration inherited. Anything less disrespects our Alaska Native veterans and is unacceptable.” BACKGROUND:The roots of the allotment issue date back to 1906 when Congress passed a law allowing Alaska Natives to acquire 160-acre parcels of land. Those rights were extinguished with the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. However, at that time, many Alaska Natives were serving during the Vietnam War and didn’t get the chance to apply for their own allotment. The Alaska Native Veterans Act of 1998 attempted to partially fix this injustice, but due to restrictions, less than 500 Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans ultimately applied. An estimated 2,800 veterans have still not received their allotments.On March 12, 2019, President Donald Trump signed S. 47, the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, legislation authored by Senator Lisa Murkowski and shepherded through the House by Congressman Don Young. The bill included a provision authored by Senator Sullivan allowing several thousand Alaska Native veterans who served during the Vietnam era to apply for their congressionally-promised ANCSA land allotment of up to 160 acres after missing their initial opportunity due to their service. In April of 2021, the Interior Department under President Joe Biden imposed a two-year stay on the implementation of several new Public Land Orders (PLOs) in Alaska, despite the PLOs already being signed. These PLOs would have lifted withdrawal restrictions on 28 million acres of BLM land that have been in place for nearly a half century and whose purposes have long been met.On March 24, 2022, Secretary Haaland, through BLM, introduced an EA for the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program, causing further complications and delay.The Dingel Act makes land selections available through December 29, 2025, meaning the Biden administration’s actions since taking office have significantly narrowed the window of time available for eligible veterans or their heirs.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/speech-in-annual-address-sullivan-invites-alaska-leaders-to-unite-with-one-voice-on-critical-state-federal-challenges,"JUNEAU, ALASKA—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today delivered remarks to a joint session of the Alaska Legislature. In his seventh address since taking office, Sullivan discussed several areas of opportunity where Alaskans of all political backgrounds can unite with one voice and advocate with the federal government on behalf of the state, including: effectively deploying significant infrastructure investments, approving the life-saving King Cove road to Cold Bay, upholding lawfully-issued leases for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), advancing the Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), and securing the long-promised land allotments that were missed by thousands of Alaska Native veterans serving during the Vietnam War era.Sullivan also addressed the suicide crisis among Alaska-based military service members, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Rush Transcript Good morning, everybody. Thank you, President Micciche (and) Madam Speaker Stutes, for the invitation. Great to see so many of my friends and colleagues here. It's great to be back home, a place with grit, with spirit, with heart and I think we have showed that over the past two years, which have been some of the most challenging in our state's history.  I want to thank all of you for all that you did to get us through this very difficult pandemic. I hope, and I think, it started a little bit last night when I flew home and, midway through the flight, was told I could take off my mask. We're putting this pandemic in the rearview mirror. So, thank you. I mean that very seriously.I want to let you know who [is here] with me. I have a big contingent of staff, and even more important than the staff who are here—Larry Burton, Chad Padgett, Amanda Coyne, Dana Herndon, Ben Dietderich—who do great, great work for me. You all know them. And, of course, the love of my life, my wife, Julie, is also here. Thank you to my team and to all the staff here. We know that they are the unsung heroes in terms of getting work done in any Legislature. How about a round of applause for all our staff.  Now I know it's a little late in the season to be giving this address. But I thought I'd come to the Legislature when you don't have anything to do. That was a joke, if you guys didn't actually laugh about that. But in all seriousness, I know how busy you are. So, I really appreciate the chance to give you an update on some pretty important issues we're working on.On a serious matter, I think you all know, we lost an icon in our state recently with the passing of our late great Congressman Don Young. He received the farewell he deserved, his body lying in state in the United States Capitol, an honor that fewer than 50 Americans have ever received in our history. I miss him. Alaska misses him. The United States Congress misses him. I know that you all miss him.His spirit looms very large over this body. He, as you all know, cut his very sharp political teeth here in the Alaska Legislature, first as a House member, then as a senator. And I think it was here where he realized his destiny. He once commented that, while serving as a state senator here, he decided he didn't like it much. He wanted to be where the action was in the people's House. As a matter of fact, he was recently quoted saying, back in those days, “Those state senators would just stand around with their hands behind their back and just talk.” So, sorry my friends—Bert, Click, others. But, as you know, he felt the same way about the United States Senate as well. Don's career—think about it, serving over three-quarters of the time in which we were a state—charted the course of Alaska's history on so many key issues. But he also knew that levity and humor—often in short supply during difficult, contentious political debates—are needed and appreciated in public life.On the day Don passed, I called Speaker Pelosi to make the request for a ceremony in the United States Capitol. She was very supportive and recalled a recent conversation she'd had with Don. He was wearing a bolo tie with carvings of a salmon, a seal, and a walrus. “Don. I love your tie,” Speaker Pelosi teased. “I think you're turning into an environmentalist!”“No, Nancy,” he replied, pointing to the animals. “This is lunch.” He was funny and we also know Don wasn't shy. When the Alaska delegation went over to the White House in 2017 to witness the President signing the legislation that would finally open ANWR, something he had been working on for decades, he turned to President Trump and said, “So you're the other Don in this town!” No, Don didn't make a habit of talking to you, our state Legislature, formally every year. But he did so periodically throughout the years. And, if you look at his speeches, he emphasized over and over the importance of Alaskans speaking with one voice, especially our elected officials. As the famous quote goes, he said to this body in 1978, “If we don't hang together, we hang separately.” A grim image, but Don was never much for using subtle metaphors. He softened his tone in his 1991 speech to the Legislature where he said this unity is the most important message you can all send to D.C. “Alaska cannot rest its hopes on the future on a fractured foundation.”Last year, I spoke to all of you about how the state was under attack by the Biden administration. If you didn't notice, I was pretty worked up at that time. The new President had already issued eight executive orders and executive actions targeting solely and specifically our state, focusing on dismantling much of the progress we made during the Trump administration on critical issues—energy projects, access to federal lands, supporting our Native communities. This … “anti-Alaska agenda” has not abated. In fact, the number of Biden administration executive orders and executive actions [focused on Alaska] has now hit 21. I thought about focusing my speech today on these issues. But, in the spirit of our late great congressman, I realized that today should be about where we can all work together—all of us, Democrats, Republicans, Independents—on issues that we should focus on. There are many of these issues that truly matter for our state, our future, and the wonderful people we are all privileged to represent.Let me begin with this week's visit by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and her team. Now, I won't sugarcoat it. My relationship with Secretary Haaland has been strained. I've called her numerous times reminding her of pledges she gave to me during our meetings before she was confirmed. I have let her know that many of the actions taken by the department under her leadership are hurting our people. I do, however, want to welcome her to our state last year. I mentioned to all of you that when she visits, it will be important for her to hear from all of us collectively on issues that really matter to us. So now is our opportunity. She should be here all week. We need to be respectful, but we also need to be strong and frank.I have placed on your desks an op-ed that North Slope Borough Mayor Harry Brower and I recently collaborated on together in the Anchorage Daily News. In it, we ask Secretary Haaland to announce, when she is in our state, her commitment on four critical issues for our state that are directly under her control.First is ANWR. After my legislative speech in 2017, some of you might remember I was presented with a joint resolution from this body—by the way, a unanimous joint resolution from this body—that in essence said now is finally the time to get ANWR done. And we did it. And when I say “we,” I mean all of us—so many of you, thousands of Alaskans who, for decades, have been working on this vitally important initiative. We got the hard part done—two mandatory lease sales to open ANWR for exploration and development, passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by the President of the United States. Under our Constitution, President Biden and Secretary Haaland have only one responsibility: “…to faithfully execute this law.” That's it. We are a nation of laws. Secretary Haaland should unequivocally tell all Alaskans that she will faithfully follow the law on ANWR and honor Alaska's already-valid leases without delay.The second and very much related issue is that the Secretary needs to tell Alaskans that the Biden administration will uphold the President's commitment that he made to me and other Alaskans on the Willow Project in NPR-A. The stakes for the state, the stakes for Alaska and America, are enormous for this important energy development which will unlock hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day, as well as other opportunities in the NPR-A, not to mention billions [of dollars] in revenue for local, state, and federal governments, and thousands of Alaska jobs.It is for this reason that almost everybody in Alaska—AFN, the North Slope Borough, the building trades, all of you—supports this vital energy project in our state. Last year, Congressman Young, Senator Murkowski and I were in the Oval Office with the President for the signing of the bill that paved the way for cruise ships to return to Alaska last summer. We had a discussion there, but I took the opportunity and said, “Mr. President, I'd like to change the subject, if you don't mind.” I had a hand-out on Willow, and I talked to him and gave it to him and his staff. We saw some of the eye-rolling from the staff like I can't believe he's doing this. But it went to all of the elements of this important development.The President said, “Alright, senator, I'm going to get back on this. Let me look at it.” Two days later, a senior official from the White House called to say that the President of the United States supports fully supports the Willow Project. Great! In subsequent meetings with the Department of the Interior, we have worked with them to make sure they are going to get a supplemental EIS done by the end of this quarter, by the end of June, and that is critical to ensure that Alaskans can start building this project this winter. So, Secretary Haaland needs to reiterate these important commitments on Willow, which should not be a problem, since her boss, the President United States, has already made these commitments. Finally, the Secretary needs to take action on two matters that have been an affront by the federal government to our Alaska Native communities for decades. The first is the life-saving King Cove Road, perhaps the most enduring symbol of an arrogant, uncaring federal government in Alaska. When Secretary Haaland travels to King Cove this week, she needs to tell the determined citizens of that community that she fully supports the construction of the 11-mile gravel road to Cold Bay that will undoubtedly save lives.  And, she also needs to unequivocally voice her support for our heroic Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who are unable to select their Native land allotments because they were patriotically serving their country in a war that many Americans were avoiding serving.  Last year, before all of you, I went into some detail about this issue. It's an issue I'm very passionate about, and I worked hard to get my legislation signed into law to write this historic wrong. In fact, it was the number-one issue I raised with Secretary Haaland during her confirmation process. I told her, “You must rapidly implement this law, the public land order that is ready to go by your predecessor.”  Unfortunately, she did not keep her commitments to me on this and has instead undertaken delay after delay, while Alaskan Native Vietnam veterans who are living—their numbers are unfortunately dwindling. This is truly an outrage.  Senator Murkowski and I have recently written the Secretary on this matter after I heard rumors that she was planning on announcing an environmental assessment for these allotments when she came up here this week, which will, in essence, amount to further delay. The letter is on your desk. In it, I implore her not to take such a disrespectful, shameful and unnecessary action. The Alaska Legislature, all of you, have many powerful voices and I hope we can all raise our voices in unison to Secretary Haaland on this vital issue, as well as the King Cove Road, Willow, and ANWR. This is an important opportunity that we have this week with her in town, and we need to speak with one voice. But our opportunities to work together to move our state forward certainly don't end there. Let me talk about another area that I'm hopeful we can all agree on, and that is infrastructure. We are resource-rich but infrastructure-poor state. Think about it. We have fewer road miles than Connecticut and we're almost 120-times bigger. When we do have infrastructure projects to build, radical, extreme Lower 48 environmental groups, often with assists from misguided federal judges here in Alaska and in the Lower 48, do their darndest to stop projects from being built. So, getting more infrastructure built for our state—roads, bridges, ports, harbors, broadband—has been a top priority of mine as your senator.The five-year bipartisan infrastructure bill we passed last fall will go a long way to addressing many of Alaska's infrastructure needs. But only if we all work closely together. You have my unwavering commitment to do so. In fact, Congressman Young, Senator Murkowski and I already testified before a House committee and are looking forward to testifying in front of Senate Finance, as well.While not perfect, this hard infrastructure bill has many provisions that fit closely with our state's priorities: water and sewer for underserved rural communities, billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees for the AKLNG project, permitting reform, which is a passion of mine, significant funding for the Essential Ferry Service, a passion for many in Southeast, historic infrastructure investments that touch on critical, long-sought and much-needed Corps of Engineers projects that have already been announced and awarded throughout Alaska.Think about it. Right now—the ports of Nome, the Barrow breakwater project, the Kenai River coastal erosion project, the Moose Creek Dam near North Pole, and the Lowell Creek Project in Seward. I believe the biggest opportunity of all, with regard to infrastructure, is in the area of broadband. Historic federal funding over the next five years from this infrastructure bill,  the Federal Communications Commission, the tribal NTIA program and the USDA Rural Connect Initiative should enable us as a state to wire every community in Alaska with internet connectivity if we coordinate well and work together. Think of the opportunities if we do that for education, for health care, for small businesses anywhere in Alaska if this happens. This will continue to be a focus of mine, which is why we are planning on convening a summit in Anchorage later this year to bring all stakeholders together. All of you, the Governor's Office, the feds, tribal entities, businesses, and telecommunications companies to make sure that we are coordinating closely together and as closely as possible to make this vision a reality. Other visions for our state are also starting to become a reality. Take, for example, the Arctic and Alaska's central role in promoting America's interests here. Seven years ago, at a Senate Armed Services hearing, I was a brand-new freshman, and the secretary of defense was testifying. I held up the Obama administration's Arctic Strategy, slammed it on the dais, and I said, “Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, this is a joke. It's not a serious document.” It consisted of thirteen pages, six of which were pictures, and Russia was mentioned once in a footnote.Now, seven years ago, no one on the Armed Services Committee seemed to care, especially those testifying from the Pentagon. Now, all of that has changed. Just four weeks ago, the NORTHCOM Commander was testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and so many senators—Democrats, Republicans—were pressing the commander on Arctic security issues, on icebreakers, on the Port of Nome, on Russian aggression, and on other topics.At one point, I looked back at this hearing and felt a little bit like a proud papa, because this is the issue I have been focused on in the Armed Services Committee for seven years, and now everyone on the committee was focused on the Arctic, including my Arctic Security Initiative bill, which became law last year, and will ensure that the Pentagon continues to maintain its focus on this critical area of the world—our area of the world.  Here's where we can all work together. Senator Murkowski and I, and Congressman Young were able to get passed into law last year the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, which the Department of Defense—and this will be a DOD-run center—recently announced will be headquartered in Anchorage. With your help, this has the potential to be the leading Arctic security and economic security think-tank in the world, regularly convening global experts and the most innovative minds on the strategic importance and needs of the Arctic and its people.The potential for this initiative, and it's happening—this isn't pie-in-the-sky—it's announced, we're doing it. The potential for this initiative for our state for our country, in my view, is limitless. So, too, is our potential to be the leading location to study the oceans and the need to keep them clean and healthy and sustainable. Last year, I mentioned the important victory that we had achieved, working closely with Senator Bert Stedman and his team, on finally bringing the NOAA research vessel, the Fairweather, back to Ketchikan, where it belongs. The new pier and homeport facility right now for the Fairweather are being built in Ketchikan. An estimated 50 crew members and NOAA researchers will reside in Ketchikan at the end of 2022.My bill, the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, was signed into law. Now, SOS 2.0 as we call it, which is the most comprehensive ocean clean-up legislation ever to come out of the United States Congress, contains a provision establishing a congressionally-chartered Marine Debris Foundation. I've been making the case to NOAA that the natural place to headquarter this foundation on the oceans is Alaska.  Think of the potential for our state, with our university systems, ocean and fisheries experts, combined with NOAA’s research facilities here in Juneau and in Ketchikan, this new Marine Debris Foundation, all attracting the best minds in the world to help foster and grow our economic opportunities that relate to clean and sustainable oceans, while strengthening our coastal communities. My team and I would like to work with you all of you and the university to put forward a compelling proposal to convince the new Marine Debris Foundation board to set up shop here in Alaska, the state with more coastline than the rest of the lower 48 combined, and fisheries responsible for approximately two-thirds of all seafood harvested in America.So that's a pretty good list. Not so much a Democrat or Republican list, but components of an Alaska agenda that we can all focus on together—ANWR, NPR-A and Willow, the gift of a road to the people of King Cove, the gift of land to Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who earned it, much-needed infrastructure for Alaska, and making our state the recognized global leader on Arctic and ocean issues. Let me conclude by mentioning two more areas of cooperation. Both have been in the news a lot. Both are, in many ways, very tragic. And both are critically important to our future as a state and nation.With more veterans per capita than any state in the country, I am convinced that Alaska's communities take care of our military members and their families better than any place in the country. I have witnessed that my whole career. But our military members stationed in Alaska are taking their lives at horrendously high rates—11 last year alone, with six more being investigated already this year. This is a very personal issue for me, as I know it is for many of you. Over two decades ago, I had a young Marine under my command—handsome, strong, committed—who called me late one night struggling with a hard, personal issue. We were scheduled to have a drill weekend in a few days for the Anchorage-based Marine recon. unit that we both served in. I told him, “Don't worry, Marine, I'll see you in a few days. You and I can tackle this issue together.” My Marine didn't have a few days. I think about this tragic suicide a lot. What more could I have done? What more could the Marine Corps have done? We can do more, we know we can do more. We need to do more. The U.S. Army, at the highest levels, has been focusing on this. Indeed, the Pentagon has been focusing on this big challenge in Alaska, and I commend them for that.Recently, Senator Murkowski and I, and Congressman Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Armed Service Personnel Subcommittee, sent a letter to the Secretary of the Army on ideas. We have to address this horrible crisis. Think about it. It's a horrible crisis. In the last four years, more soldiers have died in Alaska from suicide—[nearly] 40—than were killed in action in Afghanistan.  It shouldn't be that way.  Now, I don't know what all of the answers are, but I'm sure many of you have answers. Many of you have heard from your constituents about this. What are they? Let us know. We need everybody working on this. The letter we sent to the Secretary of the Army is just the start. This coming week, Congresswoman Speier and I will be holding listening sessions with junior enlisted, NCOs, with their spouses and behavioral health providers, at JBER in Anchorage and Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks to learn more about these life-and-death issues for America's finest. I appreciate Congresswoman Speier for coming up to Alaska to do this, focusing on our troops here in our great state. Finally, I want to say a few words about the other story that is dominating the news here at home and around the world, and that is Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. As much as we have been appalled by the brutality of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, we have also been inspired by the courage of the Ukrainian people, their military and elected officials.I think many of you know, I care deeply about America's national security and focus a lot on these issues as your senator and as a colonel in the United States Marine Corps. On the eve of the outbreak of this war, I attended the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany with a bipartisan group of United States senators, meeting with defense, military and foreign policy leaders from around the world. President Zelensky was there, as well as the imposing Mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko.But the most moving meeting I had was with a number of young Ukrainian parliamentarians, mostly women—strong, smart, brave elected officials. They reminded me of many of you in this chamber. And now, you see some of them on TV showing courage in spite of the grim odds stacked against them in their country.In that meeting I had with them, they asked me this simple question: “If we are invaded, senator, will America help us?” I replied, “Yes, we will help you.” And I have tried to ensure that we keep this promise by relentlessly pressing the Biden administration and the Pentagon leadership to adopt a winning strategy for Ukraine.  What is a winning strategy for Ukraine? More lethal weapons, tighter sanctions, more intel sharing, and more American energy supplies to our European allies who are dangerously dependent on Putin, who uses Russia's energy as a weapon. This should be a clarifying moment for all of us. We need to fully understand the broader implications of this barbaric invasion of Ukraine. We have entered a new era of authoritarian aggression led by Russia’s and China's dictators who are increasingly isolated and dangerous, driven by historical grievances, paranoid about their democratic neighbors, and willing to use military force and other aggressive actions to crush the citizens of such countries. These dangerous dictators, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, of China, are increasingly working together to achieve their aggressive goals, and they are trying to split the United States from our allies.  We must wake up to the fact that this new era of authoritarian aggression will likely be with us for decades and we must face it with strategic resolve and confidence.  The United States has extraordinary advantages relative to the dictatorships of Russia and China, if we are wise enough to utilize and strengthen them. Think about what those are: our global network of allies, our lethal military, our world-class supplies of energy and other natural resources, our dynamic economy, and, most importantly, our democratic values and our commitment to freedom and liberty.Xi Jinping and Putin's biggest weakness and vulnerability is that they fear their own people. We should remember and exploit this fact in the months and years ahead.  So what does that mean for us in Alaska? I believe Alaska has an enormous role to play in ensuring that America prevails in this new era of brutal dictatorships versus democracies.Think about what we have: an incredible strategic location, a very lethal military. We just received our full complement of F-35s at Eielson last week, making our state the only place in the world with over 100 5th-generation fighters. We have our world class energy and mineral resources that can supply America and our allies for decades to come. And, you all know this, we have a commitment to freedom, probably more than any other place in America. You can literally feel it when you get off of the plane when you're home, as I did just a few hours ago.  Unfortunately, the federal government is right now inhibiting our ability to unleash these powerful Alaskan assets. No one has said that better and with more clarity than one of your very own—Representative Josiah Patkotak—along with Mayor Harry Brower, in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed read by millions of Americans. Take a look at it. It's on your desk.My favorite line from their compelling piece was this: “Even as Russian tanks lined up on the Ukrainian border in February, the Biden administration froze up drilling on federal lands and issued rules making it harder to build natural gas pipelines. We may be Inupiat Eskimos 5,000 miles away from the Washington policy machine, but we know crazy when we see it. And this is crazy.”Now, more than ever, the federal government needs to be a partner with us, with our state, enabling Alaska to unleash these incredibly-powerful strategic advantages for our country, for the benefit of our state, for the benefit of America, for the benefit of our allies, and literally, right now, for the benefit of the world. I hope we can all work together on these and other things that I mentioned in my remarks today. Thanks again for taking the time to listen. Thanks for all you're doing for Alaska. You have my commitment on these and other issues to work very closely with the Alaska Legislature for a brighter future for our great state. Thank you very much.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-and-murkowski-ask-secretary-haaland-to-correct-injustice-approve-land-orders-needed-for-alaska-native-vietnam-era-veterans-to-select-promised-allotments,"ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) today sent a letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, in advance of her first visit to Alaska this week, asking the secretary to expeditiously allow the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program to proceed. Specifically, the senators are requesting the secretary lift the Public Land Orders (PLOs) that would make over 28-million acres of federal land available for selection by eligible veterans or their heirs. The senators warned that the program has a five-year sunset date, which means further delays could deny thousands of Alaska Natives their birthright of a land allotment.The Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program, secured by the senators and the late Congressman Don Young (R-Alaska), was enacted as part of the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr., Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2019.Below is the full text of the letter:The Honorable Deb Haaland Secretary Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, NW Washington DC 20240 Dear Secretary Haaland: The Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program enacted in section 1119 of the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr., Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-9) was authored by the Alaska congressional delegation for the purpose of providing eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans an opportunity to select up to 160-acre parcels of land to fulfill their land allotment entitlements.  Prior to your confirmation, we spoke repeatedly about the critical importance of the Department of the Interior (DOI) faithfully executing section 1119 so Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans could finally receive their allotments. Frustratingly, despite your commitment, DOI has passed up an opportunity to make millions of acres of land available in the most straightforward, publicly-supported, and legally defensible manner and effectively paused this program for much of the last year.  As required by the Dingell Act, DOI, through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), developed the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This work across multiple agencies culminated in the development of the program and subsequent revocation of Public Land Orders (PLOs), providing an over 28-million-acre pool of land for eligible Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to choose from. Lifting the PLOs is critical to administering the program because it removes encumbrances on lands throughout Alaska and meets the terms of the Dingell Act, which restricts allotment selections to only unencumbered lands. The BLM recently issued a draft Environmental Assessment (EA), which we understand may be finalized as soon as this week. Unfortunately, this draft EA allows for allotment selections on lands that are top-filed, selected, leased, permitted, in rights-of-way, or otherwise encumbered by other entities. We are concerned this may further cloud title on those lands, thereby obscuring an already complex set of land use and ownership structures, and could lead to greater conflict over them. This only further complicates and delays aging Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans or their heirs from receiving their allotments. The Alaska congressional delegation unanimously agreed with the former Secretary of the Interior’s decision to revoke 28 million acres of PLOs to help resolve the remaining State of Alaska and Alaska Native land entitlements per the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA), the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA), and the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2004 (ALTAA)—while also clearing the way for Alaska Native veterans to select lands and receive their rightful allotments. As required by ALTAA, the BLM reported to Congress in 2006 recommending the revocation of 56 million acres of PLOs. In that same report, the BLM stated to Congress that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1976 (NEPA) analysis for the revocation of the PLOs would be completed through the Resource Management Planning (RMP) process. Since that time, every RMP has recommended revocation of PLOs with the accompanied RMP NEPA analysis. In 2020, the BLM, in conjunction with the DOI Solicitors office, conducted a Determination of NEPA Adequacy on the PLOs and found that the underlying NEPA analysis was adequate. On January 20, 2021, the Biden administration through acting Secretary de la Vega, acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Daniel-Davis, and others, halted any PLO revocation announcements in the Federal Register. This placed the decision by former-Secretary Bernhardt regarding the lifting of PLOs on hold, taking 28 million acres of available land off the table from selection and leaving eligible veterans and their heirs with a dramatically reduced pool of available land totaling roughly 480,000 acres or 1.7 percent of the available lands under the lifted PLOs. Despite your commitment to us to expedite the program, you have delayed progress, weaponized the lifting of the PLOs, and convoluted the process to the point that nobody clearly understands the intentions of the Department.The BLM has already delayed this process for well over a year with no real stated purpose or need. The underlying NEPA analysis has already been completed and the PLO revocations are signed. The only needed exercise is to announce the revocation of the already signed PLOs in the Federal Register. We are aware of the existence of a Solicitor’s analysis stating even this step—announcement in the Federal Register—is unnecessary. However, if the BLM believes this is necessary, we, once again, encourage the immediate announcement in the Federal Register. In closing, we want to remind you that section 1119 includes a five-year sunset of the Alaska Native Vietnam-era Veterans Land Allotment Program, and every day of continued delay for additional reviews, consultations, and analysis further jeopardizes the ability for Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans or their heirs to receive their promised allotments. We ask that you do the right thing and remedy the situation by immediately lifting the PLOs—in their entirety—because it is simple, takes no more time, and adds no additional costs. Your commitment to this result will accelerate the selection of lands by Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans, and help fulfill the largest Native claims in American history after a more than 50-year wait. Sincerely,  # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/op-ed-sullivan-and-inupiaq-leader-as-interior-secretary-visits-alaska-heres-what-wed-like-her-to-say,"As many Alaskans know, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland is visiting our state this coming week, including a visit to Utqiagvik. It’s a commitment that she gave to Sen. Dan Sullivan prior to her confirmation, and we are heartened that she’s living up to this commitment.Because of the power Interior secretaries have over our state, the relationship between the secretary and state leaders has at various times in history been strained. And many of the decisions that the Interior Department, or DOI, has made under Secretary Haaland’s charge have the potential to continue that strained relationship. But we have hope that when she sees our state with her own eyes, when she hears from the people directly affected by those decisions, she will change course and make announcements that will be good for our state, our people, and our country.Specifically, among other actions that she might make, we would like her to announce the following: She and the president will faithfully execute the law as it relates the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR; DOI will fully support the Willow project by recommitting to complete the Environmental Impact Statement in June, as well as committing to support other energy projects within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, or NPR-A; announce that DOI will accept the King Cove Road land exchange without further studies; and, at long last, approve the signed public land orders that will allow Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to apply for the land allotments that they were promised.These actions would strengthen our communities and our country, save lives, and right wrongs that were inflicted on patriotic Alaskans. First, the NPR-A on Alaska’s North Slope contains billon of barrels of oil and has the potential to contribute hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day to meet our country’s energy needs. Roughly the size of Indiana, the NPR-A was set aside in 1923 specifically for oil production in case of emergencies. We believe that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the disruption this is causing energy markets, and the astronomical prices Americans are paying at the pump, all constitute an emergency.Yet the Biden administration continues to take actions, including freezing drilling on federal lands, that delay fields— like Willow— that are on the cusp of production, and making it impossible to explore and produce oil in other areas of the NPR-A.We would also remind Secretary Haaland that Congress passed and the former president signed legislation opening up the 1002 Area of ANWR. This is law. We would hope that she will announce her commitment to following the law, honoring the existing leases, and allowing for the remaining, legally-required second lease sale within ANWR.The bottom line: As we’ve both repeatedly said, it makes no sense for the Biden administration to call on other countries — like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Iran — to produce more oil when we have it in our country and produce it using more rigorous environmental standards. Further, Secretary Haaland is from New Mexico, where there is considerable energy production on tribal lands. On those lands, and throughout the state, the Bureau of Land Management, under DOI, has approved thousands of oil and gas permits during the secretary’s tenure, so she should understand how such production benefits Indigenous communities. Because of resource development on Alaska’s North Slope and elsewhere in the state, Alaska Natives are no longer among the most impoverished peoples on the planet. While the needs are still great, they are no longer one whale hunt away from starvation. We have health care clinics and schools in our communities. We have come far. We respectfully ask Secretary Haaland to treat Alaska like she treats New Mexico and allow us to continue developing our economy so that the progress we have made isn’t undone. Secondly, we understand that she will visit King Cove during her trip. She will hear the community plead for an 11-mile gravel road that leads to Cold Bay and an all-weather airport that would enable them to be transported to medical facilities in emergencies. Too many lives have been lost and risked because of the lack of this road. In 2013, then Interior Secretary Sally Jewell visited the area. When she returned to D.C., from the comfort of her desk, she issued a statement denying the road, telling the residents of King Cove that protecting birds was more important than protecting them. We fervently hope that Secretary Haaland isn’t so callous and commits to approving this life-saving road without delay. Finally, we ask her to approve the public land orders that our Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans have waited on to finally get the land allotments they were promised.In 1906, Congress passed a law allowing Alaska Natives to choose an allotment of 160 acres in the territory. Those rights were extinguished in 1971 with the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, or ANCSA. However, many Alaska Natives—thousands — were serving in Vietnam and missed the deadline to apply.In 1998, the Alaska congressional delegation was able to open up the program, but, as a result of restrictions, thousands of veterans were still left out. Sen. Sullivan was able to get a bill passed that would give more Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans the land that is owed to them. After countless studies, and millions of dollars’ worth of environmental reviews, the revocation of land orders just had to be implemented. All the Biden administration had to do — literally — was hit “send” to the Federal Register.But the new administration delayed doing so for two years. Those two years are now up. We fear, however, that instead of immediately lifting the public land orders, she will instead announce that DOI will announce a decision based on a flawed environmental assessment, further delaying the program. We ask that the secretary does not take such action so that, at long last, the federal government can deliver on its promise to allow some of the most patriotic Americans — who were fighting for us in Vietnam — to finally secure the lands that are their birthright. While Secretary Haaland visits our state, she will witness our great diversity of people and cultures, our geography, and a climate worthy of study by the finest scientific minds. She will see the promise of a new Arctic frontier. She will also see how our vast reserves of oil and gas, as well as minerals and metals, could and should play an integral role in moving our country toward an “all-of-the-above” energy future that includes renewables. She will meet the most welcoming and patriotic citizens in the country, living in the most beautiful state in the country. She will see why we love our state, and why we are so committed to fighting for its people. We hope that she will join us as a partner in progress. Harry Brower is the mayor of the North Slope Borough. He’s a Democrat and a lifelong resident of Utqiavik.Sen.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-speier-murkowski-call-on-army-secretary-to-address-high-alaska-servicemember-suicide-rate,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), chair of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have sent a letter to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth calling on the Army to do more to address the high incidence of service member deaths by suicide in Alaska and to take comprehensive actions to change the current trajectory.“It is a tragedy that the scourge of suicide disproportionately harms Alaska's military service members and their families,” Senator Sullivan said. “Alaska is home to thousands of military service members and more veterans per capita than any other state. But along with that proud distinction, our state also has horrifically high rates of military suicide. As a Marine, I have seen firsthand what happens when service members suffering from a mental health crisis do not receive help. Even when a service member musters the courage to seek help, it can take 60 days to actually see a professional—and, as we’re seeing, these brave Americans rarely have 60 days. I want to thank Congresswoman Speier and Secretary Wormuth for joining me in Alaska to hear from our soldiers directly. I will continue to fight to keep this issue front-and-center for our service members, for the families who have suffered the unbearable pain of suicide, and for our future generations. Ensuring our service members and their families have access to the resources and support they need to improve their mental health and prevent suicide will continue to be one of my highest priorities in the U.S. Senate. One life lost is one too many.”“The epidemic of military suicides across America cries out for immediate action, especially in Alaska where twice as many servicemembers died in 2021 compared to 2020. I have spoken previously with the spouses and parents of servicemembers who have died by suicide there, as well as other servicemembers and behavioral health care providers overwhelmed with demand in the region. And I will travel to Alaska later this month, joining Senator Sullivan to review the situation on the ground as part of a congressional delegation,” Representative Speier said. “There are reforms that we can make to fix this, but to do so we must understand clearly what challenges exist and where action must be taken. There is nothing like talking directly to the servicemembers, face to face, to find solutions. We must do this to ensure our servicemembers are getting what they need to stop this senseless loss of lives.”The letter to Secretary Wormuth asks for the Army’s plans to address several areas of concern based on observations and extensive feedback from service members and civilians in Alaska, including:Click here for a copy of the letter.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/chairman-of-joint-chiefs-opposes-delisting-irans-irgc-as-terrorist-organization,"WASHINGTON—The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, appeared today before the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and said, in his personal opinion, he does not support delisting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization. Milley was responding to a question posed by U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the committee, who asked whether the Biden administration should concede the delisting in order to attain a new nuclear agreement with Iran. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also testified before the committee.“There are press reports that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) under consideration—one of the big red line debates right now is for us to agree—the United States—to delist the IRGC as an organization that sponsors terrorism,” said Sen. Sullivan. “The Iranians want it. You gentlemen, unfortunately, have led troops, some of our finest—over 2,000 wounded and killed by the Quds Force (and the) IRGC with the weapons they supplied. Iraqi Shia militias. I'm sure hundreds under your command were killed or wounded. The IRGC has recently been responsible for missile attacks in coordination with the Houthis against U.A.E civilians, our long-standing ally in the region. Is there any universe in which the two of you could say you support the delisting of this terrorist organization with blood of American soldiers on its hands—recently—and delist them for state-sponsored terrorism because Iran wants it? We should tell Iran to go pound sand. There's no way in hell that they should be delisted. What do you two, in your personal opinion, given how much experience you have with Iran in the Middle East, believe on that question?“In my personal opinion, I believe the IRGC-Quds Force to be a terrorist organization and I do not support them being delisted from the foreign terrorist organization [list],” Gen. Milley replied. “Thank you for your honesty,” Sen. Sullivan said.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-votes-against-confirmation-of-judge-jackson-to-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today released the following statement after voting against the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.“Today, I voted against the confirmation of Judge Jackson to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.“As with all U.S. Supreme Court nominees, I thoroughly examine the individual’s record, prior decisions, confirmation hearing transcripts, judicial philosophy, and take the opportunity to discuss in detail federal laws and U.S. Supreme Court decisions that directly impact Alaska, including Venetie,Sturgeon I & II, and Chehalis. I respectfully ask nominees with whom I meet to read these cases prior to meeting with me so we can go into detail about the uniqueness of Alaska on so many important federal issues.“The most important quality I look for in an individual who is privileged to be confirmed for life tenure as a Supreme Court justice or federal court of appeals judge is a record and judicial philosophy that understands and emphasizes limits on federal judiciary and federal agency powers. This is critical to the proper functioning of our constitutional system of government and of fundamental importance to the State of Alaska. “For 25 years—as a law clerk to federal courts of appeals and to the Alaska Supreme Court, as Alaska’s Attorney General and Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, and as a U.S. Senator—I have witnessed firsthand how federal agencies and federal courts, particularly the D.C. and 9th Circuit Courts of Appeals, have made decisions and taken actions well beyond their statutory mandates as prescribed by Congress. Such overreaching federal judiciary and agency actions have limited our state’s full potential and have negatively impacted the lives of countless Alaskans. “With the recent confirmation of new justices to the Supreme Court, we have made progress in reversing overreaching federal courts of appeals’ decisions that have ignored the will of Congress as it relates to critically-important Alaska issues in the Sturgeon I & II cases, as well as in the Chehalis decision. “However, in my view, an overreaching federal judiciary by life-tenured judges remains one of the biggest factors limiting Alaska’s future potential. Our federal district court in Alaska, with no discernable judicial philosophy recognizing its own limited powers or those of federal agencies, frequently decides cases in favor of Lower 48 environmental plaintiffs. Such decisions by life-tenured judges are having devastating, real-life consequences for Alaskans.“This is the perspective and area of focus from which I have examined the qualifications of all of the Supreme Court nominees I have considered, including Judge Jackson. And on these critical issues, I found her views and record to be very concerning.“First, despite attempts in my personal meeting with her and during her confirmation hearing, Judge Jackson repeatedly stated that she had no judicial philosophy that grounded her approach to the law. She testified that her role as a district judge did not provide her with opportunities to think about constitutional interpretation, which I found puzzling to say the least. And while she demonstrated that she understood approaches to the law that emphasize systemic limitations on a federal judge’s power—such as originalism or textualism—she refused to embrace any judicial philosophy that places limits on the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. “Much more troubling than this lack of a coherent approach to constitutional and statutory interpretation is Judge Jackson’s actual record on the few cases on which she ruled as a district court judge that involved these important issues.“In Make the Road N.Y. v. McAleenan and in American Federation of Government Employees v. Trump, Judge Jackson ignored clear congressional restraints on her powers as a district judge to make decisions with broad, nationwide consequences in high-profile, politically-charged cases.“Judge Jackson described these opinions as two of her most important decisions, which is both curious and troubling, because both were reversed by the left-leaning D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The D.C. Circuit unanimously held, in both cases, that Judge Jackson had significantly exceeded the powers granted to her by Congress to review actions taken by other branches of the federal government. These are exactly the kinds of judicial activist decisions that I believe judges must refrain from making in our constitutional system of government.“Similarly, in Committee on the Judiciary v. McGhan, a case that involved a novel constitutional question impacting the separation of powers, Judge Jackson found an implied constitutional right to sue based on the vague notion of ‘constitutional values.’ The D.C. Circuit reversed, then later reinstated this decision, which ultimately ended up being mooted by subsequent federal government actions. Nevertheless, this decision by Judge Jackson stands out for analysis that is unanchored from a rigorous reading of the text of the U.S. Constitution—which is a core function of a federal judge. “In my meeting with Judge Jackson, I found her to be engaging and extremely intelligent. Her personal and professional accomplishments are very impressive and inspiring, and the historic nature of her nomination and confirmation is important to our nation. While I voted against her confirmation for the reasons stated above, I congratulate Judge Jackson on this achievement.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-sullivan-democrats-host-show-trial-to-dodge-responsibility-for-biden-price-hike,"WASHINGTON—In a Senate Republican press conference this afternoon, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) called out House Democrats for conducting a “show trial” with senior executives from America’s energy companies in an effort to shift blame for the energy crisis hurting working families.Sen. Sullivan: This is a Show Trial. Six Months Ago, Democrat House Members Were Telling Oil Executives to Produce Less Oil SULLIVAN: “If you're watching what's going on in the House right now, it's the closest thing you'll see to a show trial. It's kind of an annual rite of passage. They're bringing forward energy, oil and gas executives, and you guys all know what a show trial is. The subjects of the trial being publicly flogged for being guilty of something that is usually the fault of the very officials conducting the trial. By the way, look at the transcripts of the last show trial in the House. They were getting the energy executives of America to commit to producing less energy. That's what they were doing.Joe Biden, when he campaigned, said, “I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuels.” That is actually one campaign promise he has tried to keep. You keep hearing about it from us because these are the facts: On day one, they moved out to keep Joe Biden's promise of stopping the production of American energy, particularly on federal lands, killing key infrastructure, like Keystone,  slowing down other pipelines, going to our financial community and strong-arming them not to invest in American oil and gas, and begging dictators for more oil, while guys like John Kerry were going to our allies, including in Japan, encouraging them not to buy American LNG. Think about that. Whose side is that guy on? Remarkable. The predictable result, we've all seen it: dramatic increases in energy prices for working families, particularly gas at the pump, pink slips for American energy workers, and empowering dictators. That's what's happening. So, here's the deal though. This is a real problem for the Democrats. You're seeing it here in the Senate and in the House. No one is being fooled by these show trials. I was home over the weekend. I want my colleagues to see that. That's my little poster board. Okay. I filled up my truck—my truck was actually three-quarters empty, so that was filling up my truck in Alaska for $109 bucks. Had it been fully empty, it would have been $142 dollars to fill up. The tank of one truck in America. Devastating to working families, but nobody's being fooled. This is what literally was on the pump in my home state: Joe Biden. “I did that.” Right? Nobody in America is being fooled. This isn't Putin, this is Biden. He did that. And if this show trial that is going on in the House right now was actually trying to find the culprits of rising energy costs, the witnesses wouldn't be American energy executives. It would be [Joe Biden], it would be John Kerry, it would be Gina McCarthy, it would be Deb Haaland. Those are the people crushing the American working family with higher energy prices. Those are the people responsible for laying off patriotic American energy workers, like in my state, and those are the people who have been empowering dictators who produce energy as well. And, as we're all seeing here, it's got to stop. So, it's the kind of flipping back-and-forth policies and the show trial element of that hearing that, in many ways, it's remarkable. They're saying, you need to invest more in terms of capital. Six months ago these same House members were telling the executives, you need to commit right now to producing less oil and gas. Go read the transcripts. Then, the Biden administration is strong-arming financial institutions not to invest and then they're appointing, some of whom get confirmed, some of whom don't, federal officials whose focus is to starve the oil and gas industry of capital. Think about it. Raskin, she didn't get confirmed. The comptroller of the currency, Omarova, said she wanted to bankrupt small oil and gas businesses, and now you have the SEC chairman some of us talked to him, hey don't make your tenure all about starving capital to American energy companies. That was the one thing I focused on during his confirmation hearing. He said, I wasn't going to do it. He did it. FERC, same thing. Go look at the hearing where Joe Manchin brought all five FERC commissioners three weeks ago in front of the ENR Committee. Every single Biden administration nominee confirmed or not focuses on starving capital from the American energy sector and then you have the House members audaciously saying, why are you not investing? It is, to Ted Cruz's point, it is purposeful policy, and if you listen to Gina McCarthy and John Kerry, who by the way, they've kind of put in a closet. You ever notice that? Now that the Ukraine war has broken out, they're like we really need to shut these guys up. Thank God, but if you listen to them prior to the war they were actually saying, increased energy prices will quote, 'help us rapidly transition to a green future.' This is purposeful and the Dems are going to pay big time in November.”  Sen. Sullivan: Every Single Biden Administration Nominee Confirmed or Not Focuses on Starving Capital From the American Energy Sector SULLIVAN: “In many ways it's remarkable.

The charitable and nonprofit foundation was established by Sullivan, Whitehouse, and Menendez’s Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, the most comprehensive legislation ever passed by Congress to address the plastic debris crisis.Part of the new foundation’s role is to encourage, accept, and administer private funding in support of the mission and activities of NOAA’s Marine Debris Program. The foundation will also assist state, local, and tribal governments, foreign governments, organizations, and individuals in mitigation efforts and support other federal actions to reduce marine debris.“I applaud NOAA for assembling a diverse and distinguished group of experts and stakeholders who are well suited to advance the mission of the new Marine Debris Foundation—tackling the global crisis of trash entering the world’s oceans,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I especially want to congratulate two well-qualified Alaskans, Julianne Curry and Ginny Eckert, who will be contributing their insights and experience to the board, and giving voice to the unique challenges facing Alaska, a state that disproportionately bears the brunt of the marine debris crisis. These appointments are an important milestone in the Save Our Seas story, which began back in 2018 and has marshaled a broad coalition—Democrats and Republicans, industry and environmental groups—to address this entirely solvable environmental challenge.”“The creation of the Marine Debris Foundation was a key goal of our bipartisan Save Our Seas 2.0 law,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “These board members have the know-how to make a big difference cleaning up the colossal amount of harmful plastic trash filling the oceans.  It’s a complex challenge, and there’s no time to waste.”“Less than two years since the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act was signed into law, I am pleased to see the establishment of the Marine Debris Foundation. NOAA’s leadership confronting the plastic waste and marine debris crisis will be essential as the world comes together to negotiate a new United Nations treaty to combat plastic pollution,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Menendez. “I am proud to welcome these twelve new appointees into the diverse coalition of public and private sector stakeholders we’ve built to lead global efforts to protect and preserve one of Earth’s most vital resources – the ocean.”“The inaugural members of the Marine Debris Foundation’s Board of Directors all demonstrate passion and commitment to tackling the challenges of marine debris,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. “They bring a wealth of knowledge, and we appreciate their willingness to serve.”The following individuals will serve on the inaugural board (in alphabetical order): The appointees to the board were selected to meet the criteria required by the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act and represent diverse points of view, expertise, education, and experiences relating to the assessment, prevention, reduction, and removal of marine debris. The selected appointees will serve terms of two to six years, so that appointments can stagger in the future.SOS 2.0 built on the success of the Save Our Seas Act, introduced by Senators Sullivan and Whitehouse in the Senate, and Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) and Don Young (R-Alaska) in the House, and signed into law by President Trump in October of 2018.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-sasc-republicans-respond-to-president-bidens-inadequate-defense-budget,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), and his Republican committee colleagues are criticizing President Joe Biden for proposing an inadequate fiscal year 2023 defense budget. Every Republican member of SASC joined U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, in urging President Biden to increase the defense budget by 5 percent above inflation to meet growing threats to U.S. national security. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support: “As I’ve said many times before, we are in a new era of authoritarian aggression. The President needs to go back to the drawing board and craft a defense budget that leaves no question as to whether American men and women in uniform are well-trained, equipped and ready to respond to a threat wherever it emerges. If he does not, he can expect yet another broadly-bipartisan rebuke from Congress as we remedy the administration’s dangerous funding shortfall.”Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.): “President Biden’s defense budget reflects the world he wishes for — but not the world as it is. You simply can’t look at the world around us now and think this budget is adequate to confront all the threats we face, let alone to accelerate our attempts to maintain or restore deterrence and secure U.S. interests for our children and grandchildren. Most problematic is that this budget neglects to sufficiently account for historic inflation. I am particularly concerned about service members losing buying power, just like all American families… Real growth — 5 percent above inflation — is what we need if we are to meet this moment. We must do more to change the military balance of power in the next five years.”Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.): “…Our top military brass from all branches are wisely asking for more. More ships, more planes, more weapons, more satellites, and more training. But President Biden is instead providing them less to complete their mission. This is strategically unsound and could increase the risk of future conflicts and threats to our country. This moment demands decisiveness and strength through a sustained increase in defense spending. We will ensure that America meets that moment, even if the Commander-in-Chief has other priorities.” Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces: “For the second year in a row, the President has proposed a budget that dramatically increases spending on domestic initiatives, while defense spending fails to even keep pace with inflation. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine proves our adversaries are increasingly willing to use force to pursue their hegemonic ambitions. Meanwhile, China’s expanding military capabilities – highlighted by its nuclear breakout – demonstrates threats to our interests are growing at a rapid pace. At a time of unprecedented geopolitical turmoil, the need for real growth in the defense budget is clear.”Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities: ""As America's enemies are on the march and the world has become a much more dangerous place under his watch, President Biden now wants to flatten our defense budget. Biden's budget moves us in the wrong direction, reflecting his doctrine of appeasement that's led to a disaster in Afghanistan and an emboldened Putin in Russia. We should be bolstering our military right now to protect America and show our leadership in the world, and his proposal falls well short."" Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower: “President Biden needs to put a serious budget proposal forward to confront the real threats we face. Russia is just one reason why defense spending needs to be higher. China and other nations are watching the seriousness and resolve of freedom-loving nations.”Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.): “As Russia wages war on Ukraine and threatens the West, North Korea is launching ballistic missiles and Communist China plans an invasion against Taiwan, President Biden is choosing weakness over strength. At a time when the United States should be bolstering our defense spending, Joe Biden’s latest pathetic spending request does not keep up with the inflation crisis he has caused — effectively cutting defense spending and leaving our country in a vulnerable position. Biden's raging inflation crisis is hurting America in every way possible and with threats around the world growing every day, we cannot afford more weakness.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): “President Biden’s budget will force cuts to key nuclear capabilities, at a time when Russia is threatening nuclear war. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran only understand peace through strength. We must provide our military the resources they need to defend and protect our freedom.”Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.): “President Biden’s defense budget fails to provide America’s military with the resources needed to deter an imperial China no less deal with other challenges, many of them created by this Administration’s incompetence. Now is the time to invest in our defenses so we can prevent war and keep Americans safe.”Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.): “President Biden’s budget ignores reality and shortchanges our men and women in uniform. The president’s budget proposal, accounting for inflation, cuts our defense budget at a time when real growth is needed. We cannot ask our military to choose between maintenance and modernization or investment and deterrence. But that’s exactly what the president’s budget proposal does.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-colleagues-call-on-sec-to-withdraw-proposed-climate-disclosure-rule,"WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) joined Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and a group of their Republican colleagues in calling on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler to withdraw the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require publicly-traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and other information related to climate change. The letter expresses the senators’ strong opposition to the proposed rule and raises concerns about the limited public comment period.“After failed attempts to enact radical climate policy via legislation, this rule is yet another example of the Biden Administration’s efforts to have unelected bureaucrats implement its preferred agenda through regulation,” the senators wrote. “Addressing climate issues is a complex task with widespread consequences across the U.S. economy. We believe devising climate policy is the job of elected lawmakers, not unelected regulators at the SEC.”The letter outlines the SEC’s lack of regulatory authority to issue a climate change rule, which would impose significant compliance burdens on public companies, and would further push capital away from domestic fossil fuel producers at a time when energy prices for Americans are skyrocketing. “The proposed rule comes against a backdrop of high inflation, skyrocketing energy prices, and immense efforts to cut off Russian energy supplies. Whether it is putting forth radical nominees to important financial regulatory positions or proposing burdensome regulations like the proposed rule on climate-related disclosure, this administration’s hostility towards fossil fuels is having serious consequences throughout the entire economic value chain and on our domestic energy resources and national security,” the senators continued.Sullivan and Cramer are joined by Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Mike Rounds (R-S.D).Click here to read the letter. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-respond-to-damaging-designation-of-critical-habitat-in-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, today slammed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for announcing it is designating critical habitat in U.S. waters off the coast of Alaska for the Beringia “distinct population segment” (DPS) of bearded seals and Arctic ringed seals. The designated area extends from St. Matthew Island to the Canadian border in the Beaufort Sea, which is roughly equivalent in size to the state of Texas.“NOAA’s decision to designate more than 260,000 square miles as ‘critical habitat’ for seals goes beyond federal overreach. It is an abuse of power, inappropriately leveraging the Endangered Species Act. The domino effect this could have on fisheries, shipping, arctic infrastructure, responsible resource development, and more – is quite serious for Alaska and all who live, work, and raise families here,” said Senator Murkowski. “I stand firmly with the many Alaskans, including the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the North Slope Borough, who know this immense designation of critical habitat is simply unjustifiable and will create more harm than benefit for Arctic communities and our state as a whole. Alaskans are good stewards of our environment, including the important marine species that dwell in our waters and along our coasts. We do not need – and will not accept – harmful layers of unilaterally-imposed bureaucracy that largely serve to hinder our ability to grow, subsist, and adapt in the Arctic.”“A broad coalition of Alaskans—Alaska Native organizations, resource development groups, our fishermen, individual Alaskans, Alaska’s congressional delegation, and the state—have fought against these unnecessary and overreaching ESA listings since they were issued back in 2012 and 2014,” said Sen. Sullivan. “NOAA’s designation of critical habitat for both species allows these crushing federal regulatory burdens to take effect across broad swaths of the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, further locking up our lands, waters and resources. As I’ve done throughout my entire career, I will continue to fight against this federal overreach, and the deep state federal agencies and far-left radical environmentalists, who have no regard for the well-being of Alaskans and work together relentlessly to stifle our ability to have an economy, and support our families and communities.” NOAA previously proposed critical habitat for the ringed seal in 2014 and the bearded seal in 2021. The agency openly acknowledges that the proposed designation would likely result in restrictions on oil and gas activities, marine transportation, port development, defense-related activities, and commercial fishing in state and federal waters.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-lead-resolution-honoring-congressman-don-young,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, yesterdaythanked members of the Senate for unanimously cosponsoring and passing their resolution honoring the life and legacy of Congressman Don Young, who served Alaska in the House of Representatives for the last 49 years. Congressman Young passed away on March 18. “Congressman Don Young was larger than life, as is the legacy he leaves behind. He devoted 49 years to the service of Alaska and the nation. In that time, he shepherded critical, generational legislation into law and became Dean of the House—the longest-serving Republican of all time. He became a close friend to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, but was always best known for his steadfast loyalty to his home state,” said Senator Murkowski. “This resolution is one of the many ways we will honor Congressman Young, to ensure that the life and leadership of the Congressman for all Alaska, one of the most effective legislators of our time, will be remembered always.”Click here for video of Senator Murkowski’s remarks at Congressman Young’s Lying in State Ceremony.“Don Young was so authentic in an age of overly-coached politicians. He was a throwback to a time and a place where people were respected, not so much for how they talked or how they looked, but for what they could do. And boy did he do a lot in life and for Alaska. He was a teacher, a tugboat captain, a gold miner, a mayor and, of course, he was a relentless fighter in the House for the great state of Alaska,” said Senator Sullivan. “Don’s sudden death leaves a major void in Congress, in Alaska, in the hearts of his family, and in all of us who knew and loved him. It leaves a very real void in our small but mighty Alaska delegation. But his tenacious, indomitable spirit lives on. Rest in peace, Don Young.” Click here for video of Senator Sullivan’s remarks at Congressman Young’s Lying in State Ceremony.Murkowski and Sullivan introduced S. Res. 565 on Monday and asked unanimous consent to pass it as Congressman Young lay in state in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall. Every member of the Senate cosponsored the resolution.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-sullivan-cramer-lummis-urge-biden-administration-to-implement-american-energy-jobs-and-climate-plan,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) today urged the Biden administration to fully commit to implementing the “American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan.” With last week’s announcement that the Biden administration intends to work with the European Union to help reduce European reliance on Russian natural gas, the senators are calling on the administration to take serious steps to reverse its anti-American energy policies and implement a plan that offers realistic and achievable solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy costs, create millions of jobs for hard-working Americans, and provide energy security to America and our allies.Originally introduced last November, the plan offers an alternative to the unrealistic and harmful ambitions of policy-makers seeking to shut down natural resource development in the United States. Instead, the plan leverages America’s many unique strengths and positions America back on a path to provide energy to the world. The plan would also accelerate America as a leader in reducing global emissions. If implemented, the plan could reduce global emissions by up to 40 percent by 2050 by building upon what has already worked—U.S. natural gas, technological innovation, and the free market. “This announcement suggests the Biden administration has finally acknowledged—albeit half-heartedly—the need for America to leverage its unique energy strengths,” Sen. Sullivan said. “Their announcement still falls short of the course correction required to unleash American energy and resolve the energy crisis facing Americans and our allies. American resource development, especially natural gas, needs to be part of the long-term solution if we want to realistically solve the crisis at hand. We need to implement an all-of-the-above energy plan that prioritizes the infrastructure and permitting reform needed to leverage our world-class energy resources—which we have in abundance in the great state of Alaska. That’s exactly what our American Energy Jobs & Climate Plan will do, while also creating millions of good-paying jobs.The administration should take immediate action to increase energy production at home, as outlined in a letter 22 of my colleagues and I sentthree weeks ago, and work to implement the American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan as quickly as possible.” “We have a geopolitical opportunity right now to cut Putin’s malign influence and we should be taking full advantage of it. The Biden administration should pursue a long-term solution by working with us to implement the American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan. It will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and the West’s reliance on dirtier fuels from our adversaries. Doing so avoids unilaterally disarming our own economy and losing ourselves to a 2050 fantasy. The Biden Administration is finally beginning to understand energy security is both national security and economic security, but if they are serious about real change we look forward to working with them on the principles in this plan,” said Sen. Cramer.“Instead of half measures, President Biden should commit his administration to unleashing clean American energy to free our allies from dependence on dirty Russian energy,” Sen. Lummis said. “Our resources and ingenuity can solve the current energy crisis hitting not only the United States but our allies around the world. The American Energy, Jobs & Climate Plan is the perfect roadmap for how to do this, and Senators Dan Sullivan, Kevin Cramer and I are ready to help President Biden to implement it.” BACKGROUND:Below is a timeline of Sen. Sullivan’s recent efforts to bolster U.S. energy production: # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-sullivan-americans-are-sick-of-companies-blackballing-us-energy-workers-while-propping-up-the-chinese-communist-party,"WASHINGTON—In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box this morning, U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) called out Biden administration officials and Wall Street investment firms for restricting the American energy sector and harming American workers, particularly in Alaska.Sullivan: The American People Are Sick of Companies Blackballing American Energy Workers While Supporting the Chinese Communist Party JOE KERNEN: Would you say that they're [oil companies] responding to pressure from the government to enforce this ESGs? Where is it? Where is it actually coming from? If it's just AIG they can do whatever they want and if an oil company decides they don't want to drill they can do it because they don't think they can get their money back on it or it's not feasible. You could make an argument that those are market forces, but then again market forces are only as good as the regulations and the government oversight that are controlling. We know we've seen so many examples in the past how government can screw up free markets. What do you think it is?SULLIVAN: Well, I think it's a combination of several things like I said, the federal regulators that the Biden administration's put forward, a lot having to do with finance, right? Comptroller of the currency, SEC chief, they're all putting out signals. I mean heck, some of them are just blatant: We want to bankrupt America's energy companies. That's what Omarova said before, she was yanked as comptroller of the currency. You know you guys did a lot in terms of what Raskin said. No they didn't get the job, but they're sending the signal, but let me continue. It's John Kerry and Gina McCarthy going to American financiers saying, hey, don't invest in American energy projects. I know for a fact that some of our recipients of American LNG, like in Japan, have been told by Kerry and others to be careful on buying American LNG. And then, of course, it's the whole ESG movement which again you're right Joe, AIG can do whatever it wants in terms of a free market, but I will tell you this, the American people are getting sick of it. Congress is getting sick of it when they see companies like that having no problem investing big money in China propping up the Chinese Communist Party and then they're gonna blackball American workers? Alaskan workers to produce American energy? You know, there's going to be a reckoning here  Sullivan: I’m Introducing Legislation To Take Away Passive Investment Power From Firms That Control 88 Percent of S&P 500 ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Larry Fink is building a whole series of funds and marketing funds that effectively exclude these kinds of companies. There are now dozens of firms that are doing the same thing. SULLIVAN: Well, look, I mean, one of the things I'm going to talk to Larry Fink about is legislation I'm getting ready to introduce that would take away passive investor [power from] firms like his and, you know, Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard. Look at the amount of capital and shares that they control. It's well over 15 trillion. They actually don't do any management.  SORKIN: What do you want to do to him? SULLIVAN: I'm just going to say they shouldn't be able to vote those shares. This is just the next step in Dodd-Frank. You guys might remember when Dodd-Frank made it so that broker-dealers didn't have the right to vote, what was called in stocks that they held in street name. Why should these three companies that have monopoly power be able to vote all these shares? SORKIN: The truth is that most retail investors don’t vote their shares. That’s the sad reality. SULLIVAN: Well, I think I think we should make it clear that the retail investors, the people they hold the stock for, should have the ability to vote the shares. It has distorted the market, as you guys know, tremendously to have these three companies with massive, massive power. You know… they have 88 percent of the S&P 500. Those three investment firms have the highest amount of shareholdings. That is a distortion of capital markets. And I think that it reflects on the energy policies that we're talking about that are not supported by the average American. We need American energy and we shouldn't have a few Wall Street firms saying we don't.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-gop-colleagues-press-biden-to-boost-defense-budget-by-5-above-inflation,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and 39 of his congressional Republican colleagues on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees today sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to include a five percent increase above inflation for the defense spending in his fiscal year 2023 budget request. Sullivan has been a leading critic of President Biden for offering an inflation-adjusted cut to defense spending in his FY 2022 budget request, which was ultimately rejected on a broad, bipartisan basis in the Senate.In their letter, Sullivan—along with Representative Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees—encouraged the President to reject progressive members’ push to cut or freeze defense spending, to target investments in programs that will “modernize the force and fill ongoing readiness gaps,” and to ensure that rate of growth outpaces current record levels of inflation.“As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 budget for submission to Congress, we strongly encourage you to reject the approach you took last year when you proposed to cut defense spending below the rate of inflation,” the members wrote. “Over the last year, the threats to our national security have grown exponentially.“This is a crucial period for our national security,” the letter continued. “If we do not make the investments our military needs today, we will not be able to defend our nation or our allies in the future. The security of the free world depends on a credible American military. We must work together to ensure the men and women of our Armed Services have the resources and support they need to successfully carry out their missions now and for decades to come.”The full letter can be read here and below: Dear President Biden, As you prepare your fiscal year 2023 (FY23) budget for submission to Congress, we strongly encourage you to reject the approach you took last year when you proposed to cut defense spending below the rate of inflation. Instead, we urge you to request a 5 percent increase over the inflation-adjusted FY22 enacted level. Since the publication of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, and particularly over the past year, the threats to our national security have grown exponentially. Unprecedented Chinese military modernization has left us behind in key areas in the Western Pacific, and each day the Chinese Communist Party more clearly shows us that its interests are diametrically opposed to ours. Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has already left us and our NATO allies less secure, and his appetite and erratic behavior is likely to grow. There is much more work to do in Eastern Europe to secure the peace.  Your decision to unconditionally withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan allowed terrorist organizations to regain their capability to strike the American homeland. Similarly, little progress has been made to deter the North Koreans, and Iranian aggression has escalated, with the potential for further escalation in the near future. We understand that despite these threats to our national security, many on the left continue to encourage you to cut or freeze spending on our national defense. As you know, during consideration of the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY22 Consolidated Appropriations Act, overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress voted to reject that short-sighted approach. Instead, Congress acted in a bipartisan manner to provide nearly $30 billion more than you requested. We hope that action convinces you that overwhelming political support exists for increasing immediate investment in our national defense. We also urge you to use your FY23 budget request to target investments in programs that will modernize the force and fill ongoing readiness gaps. Specifically, it is imperative that we improve force proficiency on new battlefields such as cyber; continue work at DoD and the National Nuclear Security Administration to modernize our nuclear triad; grow our naval and projection forces; and quickly incorporate the latest innovations and enhancements into warfighting capabilities, including air and sealift, space, missile defense, munitions, and electronic warfare. Finally, in order to protect the buying power of these investments, we need to ensure the budget achieves real growth. Not since 1982 has our nation experienced this level of inflation. It is driving up the cost of fuel, supplies, and labor for the defense industrial base and the Department of Defense. Failing to provide a budget request that exceeds the rate of inflation equates to a cut in real dollars — a cut we can no longer afford. This is a crucial period for our national security. If we do not make the investments our military needs today, we will not be able to defend our nation or our allies in the future.  The security of the free world depends on a credible American military.  We must work together to ensure the men and women of our Armed Services have the resources and support they need to successfully carry out their missions now and for decades to come. Sincerely, # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech-remembering-congressman-don-young,"Mr. President, like my good friend and colleague Senator Murkowski, I rise today to recognize a giant, a larger than life man, certainly a legend in our State, and certainly a legend in the House of Representatives, Congressman for all Alaska, Donald Edwin Young.As Senator Murkowski mentioned, we lost this great Alaskan, this great American, while flying home with his beloved wife, Anne, by his side just this weekend. He was flying back home to Alaska, the State he loved so much and served so well. It is a State that loved him back and showed him that love by electing him to office every 2 years since 1973. Think about that. Unbelievable. He was the longest serving politician in Alaska's history, the longest serving Republican Member of the House in U.S. history, our North Star, Don Young. As Senator Murkowski mentioned, he was 88 years young. I just want to say, like all Alaskans, my wife Julie and I, when we heard the news, we were saddened, shocked, devastated by the sudden passing of Congressman Don Young. And we heard this from so many people over the weekend: his spirit, authentic, tenacious, indomitable, a man of the people--a true man of the people--epitomized our State to such a degree that there was this sense that he would always be there, that he would live forever. There was this sense, and the shock back home is so palpable because of that. Think about, almost three-quarters of our State's history, Don Young was our Congressman. So I, too, want to spend a little bit of time talking about this incredible man, this life in full, as Senator Murkowski mentioned. A lot of stories about being raised on a small ranch in Central California, where he began the hard work of ranching as a young, young boy. Don Young once said: My dad was a good man, but he believed when you turned 7, you became a hired man. So he was working at the age of 7, Sun up to Sun down. It was hot, riddled with snakes and poison ivy. Evidently, Don Young did not like snakes or hot weather because he mentioned often about his father reading him Jack London's ``The Call of the Wild,'' a book about a dog, a man, the harsh conditions of the Yukon, and loyalty. Senator Murkowski already mentioned that one of the things--and I love this man so much--but one of the things about him that you always knew was loyal, loyal, loyal. What a great quality. What a great quality. Then, of course, Alaska captured his imagination--no snakes, no poison ivy, snow. Those of us, all of us who saw Don Young over the years carry around that battery-powered portable fan, we knew that, well, Don Young ran hot with that fan. So, as Senator Murkowski mentioned, he got his associate's degree from Yuba Junior College in 1952. He served in the Army--I always loved to give him a little grief about his Army service as a marine--Chico State, and then at an Elks Club in Chico, he heard then-Alaska Territorial Governor Mike Stepovich give a speech about Alaska, talking about the wonders of Alaska, and Don Young was hooked. In 1959, the year we became a State, he heeded the call of the wild, headed up the Alcan--much of it still unpaved--in a brandnew Plymouth Fury, and the great State of Alaska would never be the same. According to Don Young, in Alaska, you could ``do anything you wanted to,'' so he did. As Senator Murkowski mentioned, he fought forest fires. He owned a skating rink for a short time. I would have loved to have seen that, by the way. He owned a movie theater, tried his hand at commercial fishing, trapping, prospecting for gold. Of course, he was a tugboat captain, teacher at a BIA school, importantly, in Fort Yukon, and that is where he always called home. In fact, he still has a home there. He used to joke he is the only Congressman who, when he goes home, uses an outhouse when he goes home. He eventually met Lu, his wife--incredible Lu, who stayed by his side for 46 years until she passed in 2009. Since that time, Don found another wonderful partner in Anne. So, Anne, thank you and the family for sharing him with us. Don, with Lu's prompting, caught the political bug. He served in the State house in Alaska and the State senate. Now, he discovered that he didn't like the senate much. ``All they did was stand around with hands behind their back and talk''--that is what he said about the Alaska State Senate. Well, guess what. His attitude about the U.S. Senate wasn't that much different. ``You Senators are always late,'' he would often growl at me and Lisa--and we were when we had our frequent Alaska delegation meetings. But even as Senators, we always knew our place with Congressman Don Young, dean of the House. All those Alaska congressional meetings were over in his office--were over in his office. One of my favorite things I did with Don Young, as dean of the House, wherever I saw him--particularly in public in Alaska--the first time I would see him at an event or something, I would say, ``It's the dean of the House.'' I would grab his hand, take a knee, and kiss his ring. Now, he always said, ``Stop that. I hate it when you do that.'' But do you know what? I think he actually kind of liked it. I actually think he kind of liked it. So he didn't like the Senate; he liked the House, the place where bills move fast, where elections are right around the corner no matter what--think about that, 25 elections. Jeez Louise. I could never think about that--and where the action was. Mostly, he was a man of the people, and he belonged in the people's House. Along the way, he had two wonderful daughters, Joni and Sister, whom he loved fiercely. He always said the most important thing in his life were those two daughters. Lu was nothing if not persuasive. She was no doubt the boss in the family, and so when she told him he needed to run for Congress, he did. And with the help of many people--and I would like to say my wife's grandmother, her Sitsoo, was an avid Don Young supporter, flew all over interior Alaska during those early campaigns to help him introduce himself to a wider audience. So when Don was appointed to his seat in 1973, the original knock against him, he said back then, was that he didn't know anything about DC. People said: You don't know anything about DC; it is going to take you 2 years until you can find the bathroom in your office building.I am sure some of you heard the story that the first day in office, he combed the Rayburn Building looking for the bathroom, when someone finally said, ``Congressman, why don't you use the one in your office?'' which I don't think he had noticed. So he was learning.But on a more serious note--and I love this story. The day after he was sworn in, there was a hearing on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act.After being held up for years by litigation and studies--imagine that; sound familiar, America?--Don successfully pushed through an amendment--to me, one of the most brilliant amendments ever conceived in the Halls of Congress--that said: No more studies and no more litigation. We are done. We are building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System now. He said: It was a hard fight. Half of my side was [initially] fighting against me. But when the vote was called, he prevailed. His amendment prevailed by four votes, and Alaska's history was changed forever. America's history was changed forever. And, by the way, what a great idea: Stop endless litigation. Stop studying things. Build infrastructure. The country and the State of Alaska need energy. Practical, commonsense, get it done--this is why Alaskans loved Don Young so much. The day of that vote, when it was successful, 1973--remember--Ralph Nader stood outside the hall and declared Don Young the most powerful Member of Congress--brandnew, baby freshman from Alaska, Don Young. Now, you can say a lot of things about Ralph Nader, but he knew power when he saw it, and Don Young had it, kept it. He went on to win every election after that. And, as Senator Murkowski mentioned, more than 90 bills that he sponsored became law, thousands more that he cosponsored--mostly to help Alaska but to help our whole country. And he became a fierce advocate for helping people--thousands and thousands of Alaskans and Americans. Every 2 years since 1973, Alaskans could count on Don Young, during 1 of his 24 elections, standing on a corner with his supporters--many here today--waving signs in the cold in November back home, wearing his old winter coat. And if you didn't know it then--and few Alaskans didn't know--you wouldn't guess that the man in those clothes had so much power and had done so much to help his fellow Alaskans and fellow Americans. Nearly everything--and I mean everything--that has advanced to benefit our State in the Congress has Don Young's fingerprints on it. The Alaska we know today is only possible because of Don Young. As I mentioned, there is, of course, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which transformed our State and our Nation, as well as many of the victories that Senator Murkowski just mentioned. I always like to talk about the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which, of course, transformed America's fishing industry. Among others things, it created a 200-mile limit to keep foreign fishermen from plundering our fish and sustained our fisheries. It used to be just 3 miles. Now, we all know it is the Magnuson-Stevens Act, but, of course, Don Young moved it in the House with Congressman Gerry Studds of Massachusetts. So I used to like to say, in events with Don Young: Magnuson-Stevens, or maybe a better name would have been the ``Young-Studds Act,'' which, of course, he loved that idea. So I kind of liked calling it the ``Young-Studds Act.'' But here is the thing, the story that is such a great story that a lot of people don't know: The executive branch wasn't thrilled about this bill, wasn't thrilled about it at all, to such a degree that President Ford was considering vetoing it. Why? Because he had a really smart, clever Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who thought it would raise tensions with our allies--the Koreans and the Japanese in particular--who loved fishing off the coast of Alaska, taking our fish. Two hundred miles off, they were going to lose out. They were mad. So he was encouraging a veto.Whether it was on the racquetball court, in the Halls of the Capitol, or a potlatch in rural Alaska, Don Young knew where to be to get things done for Alaska. And he knew that the President and Kissinger were heading to Asia, stopping over in Alaska. So Don and his two daughters and Lu got a ride on Air Force One. A few martinis later, Don Young, the new Congressman from Alaska, was debating one of the most brilliant men in America--the Secretary of State, former Harvard professor Dr. Henry Kissinger--on Air Force One in front of President Ford: Veto the Magnuson-Stevens Act or not. Well, guess who won that debate: the Harvard professor or the tugboat captain? It was the tugboat captain. Now, Don jokingly credits the martinis, but we all know that he was the one who got that done. And, again, our State and our country's history wouldn't be the same. And, by the way, Henry Kissinger and Don Young were great friends ever since. Mr. President, that is just one example of many, as Senator Murkowski mentioned. Don Young served with 10 Presidents, and he knew them all. President George H.W. Bush called him ``Moose.'' They played racquetball often. He had Dungeness crab flown in to eat with President George W. Bush. He and President Clinton were at the White House together one night when the vote was called. They were having so much fun that President Clinton said: I don't want you to leave, Don. Don said: Well, Mr. President, I will need a hall pass. So he got a handwritten note from President Clinton, writing to the Speaker of the House: Dear Mr. Speaker. Please excuse Don Young from voting tonight. We are having cigars at the White House. And when Don Young went to the White House to sign the ANWR legislation that we had been working on and that he had been working on for over 40 years and were able to pass--again, our small and mighty team working together, 2017, with President Trump--he turned to President Trump and said: So you are the other Don in this town. So Don Young has been great friends with Presidents, world leaders, but what really motivated and moved him was helping people, especially Alaskans. It didn't matter their title, their political affiliation. He just wanted to help people. He said: As long as you respect the other person and their beliefs, you can be successful. Whether in the majority or the minority, I try to work with people to solve problems. My job is to listen to what they want and how I can then help them get it done. Like I said, commonsense, practical--no wonder so many Alaskans loved Don Young. And we all know he could tell a story, holding court. As we know, in the House there isn't assigned seating, but there was one seat in the House that nobody sat in: Don Young's. And, by the way, if you did, you may be taking your life into your own hands. He sat, and Members gathered around him, listening to his stories. The story of the oosik might come up, how he used that in debates, how he sat during a committee hearing with his fingers caught in a bear trap to make a point, and his legendary office Christmas parties. Young staffers and Members from all over the Congress stood in a long line that snaked into the hallway just to have a few minutes to hear him holding court. But his true love was always Alaska. He could have done anything, been anything, but he chose to stay and work for the people up until the last moment of his life. You can make all the money in the world. But if you aren't happy, it doesn't count for anything. And Don Young was a happy man.When we lost Don Young, we lost a piece of Alaska, a piece of ourselves, a piece of his indomitable, irascible spirit. But it will live on forever, and I know that he has an army of loyalists he has amassed through the years in the Gallery, in addition to family, his wonderful family. Dozens of staffers are here to pay tribute. Some of them now work for my office. In fact, early on in my Senate career, I learned something very smart. I frequently stole Don Young's staff to come work for me: well-trained, smart. I still do it. And he never minded. As a matter of fact, he always said: I just want what is best for my people. Larry Burton, Erik Elam, Chad Padgett, Liz Banicki, Scott Leathard--so many are still here with me. So many cut their teeth at Don Young's office. And like so many who know Don Young, they are intensely loyal to this great Alaskan. His spirit will live on in the House of Representatives and the people's House, and his spirit will live on in everything he has done for our State and every Alaskan from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, to the Ketchikan shipping yard, to the many, many land exchanges, the health clinics dotting our State, the state-of-the-art Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage.And his spirit will live in his wonderful family: Joni and Sister, his 13 grandchildren, Anne, and so many others. Don was a dear friend and mentor to me, to Senator Murkowski, to my wife Julie, and so many others. He was truly a man of the people, a great man of the people. We miss you, Don. Rest in peace.I yield the floor."

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-commend-coast-guard-for-updating-mental-health-policies,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska) commended the United States Coast Guard (USCG) for updating its mental and behavioral health policies to achieve parity with the policies of the Department of Defense (DoD), a legislative effort Senator Murkowski spearheaded this Congress. In February, Senator Murkowski introduced with Senators Sullivan, Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) the Guarding Mental Health Act, legislation to support Coast Guard members who seek help for their mental health by preventing them from being automatically discharged.“I thank the Coast Guard for taking the initiative to update their policies to mirror that of the rest of the armed services as it relates to members being treated for mental or behavioral health conditions. This necessary update allows members to seek the help they need without having the fear of being automatically discharged,” said Sen. Murkowski. “We should support our military members in all the ways that we can—especially when it pertains to mental health."" “I applaud the Coast Guard for bringing their mental health policies in-line with other branches of the military,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Members of the Coast Guard should not be threatened with automatic discharge if they seek professional help dealing with the extreme stresses they may encounter in their jobs. Our brave Coast Guardsmen can now continue fulfilling their important missions—conducting search-and-rescue operations in severe storms, combatting transnational crime, and securing our maritime borders—and seek support when they need it.” # # #"

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/us-coast-guard-releases-spending-plan-for-infrastructure-bill-funding,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, released the following statements after the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) released a spending plan for funding received through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Over half of the total funding allocated to the USCG through the IIJA will be used for Alaska projects. “I’ve been a long-time advocate for all of America’s military members, including Alaska’s Coasties. The work our Coast Guard men and women do can literally be the difference between life and death for some Alaskans. But even beyond that, our servicemembers, their spouses, and their children become an important part of our Alaskan family—valued parts of the communities in which they live. We must continue to do all we can to ensure that their livelihoods are supported and that they have the tools and infrastructure they need to carry out their important missions,” said Senator Murkowski. “Through my work to help author the bipartisan Infrastructure bill, the men and women of our military remained front of mind. I’m encouraged to know that the funding I helped secure will support a number of projects in Alaska—from Kodiak to Seward and Ketchikan—which the Coast Guard has sought for decades, but has never been able to complete. I look forward to now seeing these important projects get underway.” “When I first came to the Senate, the U.S. Coast Guard had plans to reduce its footprint in Alaska—the state with more coastline than the other 49 states combined. As a member of the Commerce Committee, I worked hard to halt this dubious and misguided proposal, and helped set our great state on track for more vessels and personnel,” said Senator Sullivan. “Our coastal communities now need the critical infrastructure and necessities to support this important build-up of American sea power. I’m glad to have worked with Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young to include critical Coast Guard priorities—housing, a childcare center, and pier-side support—within the bipartisan infrastructure bill. These new facilities will give our patriotic Coast Guard members and their families peace of mind, knowing their spouses and kids are being taken care of, as they fulfill their wide array of important missions to our nation.”“The millions of square miles of ocean off Alaska's vast coastline – which dwarfs the total coastline of the Lower 48 – is kept safe under the watchful eye of the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard. Alaska is home to both the nation's largest Coast Guard district and the world's largest Coast Guard base in Kodiak. Many of us have experienced firsthand how essential their mission in Alaska is to protecting the safety of our waters. The Coast Guard's role continues to expand as the nation asks it to take on an even greater profile in border protection, maritime commercial security, and the ever-present need for search and rescue missions. Alaska is this country's gateway to the Arctic, where I believe the world's future lies. Changes in the Arctic will only increase vessel traffic and activity off of Alaska, and I am confident the Coast Guard will rise to the occasion as they always have,” said Congressman Young. “As Congress drafted what is now the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I worked hard to advocate for Coast Guard funding in Alaska. The bill is delivering on this front by making serious investments so that Alaska's installations receive the support necessary to improve docks, upgrade fuel infrastructure, provide housing for servicemembers, and more. I am very pleased to see that a $227 million investment is on its way to Alaska to support urgently needed USCG projects. But this is just the beginning. I will continue pressing for additional Coast Guard infrastructure north of Kodiak and the homeporting of new Polar Security Icebreakers in Alaska. It is the Last Frontier that makes this great country an Arctic nation, and I will continue working to ensure the Coast Guard is front-and-center in the coming Arctic Century.”Alaska Projects Details: # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/op-ed-headwinds-and-hope-for-the-new-year,"Let’s face it, 2021 was another tough year. The pandemic, which we had all hoped would be in the rearview mirror by now, is still front and center. It’s taken too many lives of our fellow Americans, and has greatly disrupted our communities. Inflation, which is at a 40-year high, is shrinking the budgets of working Alaskans. Compounding these serious challenges is the Biden administration’s open hostility to Alaska’s economy and our way of life.However, despite these challenges, we have been able to make some important progress for our state. While it wasn’t perfect, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that became law in November addresses Alaska’s historic deficit in infrastructure investment, including billions of dollars for roads, bridges, ports, water and wastewater, and our ferry system. Importantly, it also contains historic funding for broadband build-out — as much as $1.5 billion over five years for Alaska, which could create exciting economic, educational and health care opportunities all across our state.Further, a significant amount of the federal funds from this legislation will go to the states, whose elected officials know better than Washington, D.C., bureaucrats on where to deploy these significant infrastructure investments. These substantial funds coming to Alaska in the next five years should also help enable our Alaska Legislature and governor to finalize a long-term fiscal plan for the state.Importantly, passage of the hard infrastructure bill paved the way for Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to deliver the death knell to the Biden administration’s reckless “Build Back Better” bill, which would have supercharged inflation, shut down energy opportunities in our state, and put America on a path toward European-style socialism. That bill is dead, for now, and I intend to work just as hard in this new year to make sure it stays that way.There are other reasons for optimism for our state’s future. In last year’s National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, we were able to include a provision to create the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, which will be housed in Anchorage. In order to address the rise of great power competition with Russia and China in the Arctic, the Ted Stevens Center will serve as a new focal point for Arctic economic and defense strategy as it combines Alaska’s extensive reserve of Arctic expertise with the best and brightest minds from around the world.We were able to further cement Alaska as the center of gravity for America’s Arctic security operations in this year’s NDAA through a provision I authored creating a new Arctic Security Initiative, which should lead to more focus, personnel, vessels, infrastructure, aircraft and investment being directed to our state. Additionally, when combined with the Coast Guard construction funds from the hard infrastructure bill, and this year’s NDAA, Alaska will have close to an additional $350 million in military construction investments. This is great for America’s national security, as well as Alaska’s economy and jobs.Other bright spots in our state’s economy include a tourism industry that we all hope is poised to come roaring back this summer, as well as an increased recognition by the aviation industry of our strategic location, which is resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in new air cargo investments at the Anchorage airport, and more jobs and economic activity in Fairbanks. Hundreds of thousands of barrels per day from large oil projects, like Pitka and Willow on the North Slope, are in sight. Critical economic developments, like the Graphite Creek Project near Nome, and the Ambler District mining projects — which will provide our country with the minerals and metals we need to compete with China — are in the important stages of the permitting process. And, at long last, the strategic Donlin Mine in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region has received its final permits and is expected to provide good-paying jobs and generate significant economic activity, including lower-cost energy for the region and our state.But the headwinds we face are real and strong. The Biden administration has arrogantly worked to overturn or delay nearly every resource project that the Trump administration approved, even though these projects were approved by professional, career federal agency staff. These are projects that keep Alaskans working and produce resources that we need to keep our country strong — oil and gas, critical minerals and metals, timber — resources we extract using the highest environmental standards in the world and ones that, if not produced here, are imported from other countries that don’t share our values and don’t respect our high standards on labor and the environment.Alaska is undoubtedly in the bull’s-eye for the Biden administration’s goal of killing resource projects, limiting access to our lands and harming workers in our state. So far, this administration has targeted Alaska — by name — at least 20 times in executive orders and actions that go to the heart of our economy. No other state in the country has been targeted so aggressively by this administration.Even some of my Democratic Senate colleagues are surprised by this unprecedented assault on our state. I have requested a meeting with the president to see if he even knows that his administration has so singularly focused on targeting workers in one state. Imagine if a Republican administration in its first year targeted Delaware with 20 executive branch actions — Joe Biden would be rightly furious.Some of my Senate colleagues have offered to try to help us. Others, however, are leading the charge in the war on Alaska by urging financial institutions to not invest in Alaska, and requesting that the federal government shut down other energy projects in our state. In a recent Senate floor speech, I called out the Biden administration’s war on Alaska’s working families and Native communities and then singled out one of my colleagues, Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who is leading this effort. In the speech and in person, I pointed out how rankly hypocritical it was of him trying to shut down Alaska’s energy production while his state, New Mexico, received more federal oil and gas drilling permits than any other state in the country last year.Despite the Biden administration’s singular focus on shutting down Alaska, we are still a nation of laws, and they can’t wield executive power illegally or unethically. We’ve seen strong evidence that members of this administration are doing just that. At least four senior political appointees at the Department of the Interior, or DOI, who have been involved in the 20 executive orders and actions against Alaska, were, in their previous jobs, working on the very same issues and advocating for the shutdown of Alaska’s economic opportunities. This is clearly illegal, and I’ve written to the DOI inspector general requesting an investigation into whether these individuals have violated federal ethics laws in their quest to hurt working families in our state. We’ve heard that DOI officials have indicated that they might delay even more Alaska projects if I continue this fight. Such tactics, if true, are more in keeping with how governments treat their citizens in Russia and Venezuela, not America.2021 was a rough year. But I remain optimistic. We live in the greatest state, in the greatest country in the world, and we have been through rough times before. We have always emerged stronger, wiser and more resilient, and I’m confident we will do so again.Happy New Year, Alaska!"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-welcomes-scotus-ruling-against-biden-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today issued the following statement praising a six-to-three ruling by the Supreme Court against the Biden administration’s vaccine mandates for private employers. In December, Senators Sullivan and Mike Braun (R-Ind.), along with 182 of their congressional colleagues, filed an amicus brief with the court arguing that Congress did not give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose a vaccine mandate.“Today is a rough day for Joe Biden, but a GREAT day for America,” said Sen. Sullivan. “The Supreme Court today blocked the Biden administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate on American businesses—a victory for hard-working families and the rule of law. The court today affirmed what I’ve been saying for months: The federal government simply does not have the constitutional or statutory authority to institute vaccine mandates on employers and their employees. I have encouraged my constituents, in consultation with their physician, to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their families. But this is a personal choice, not one that should be forced on Americans by their own government. Hard-working Americans and Alaskans should never be forced to choose between getting vaccinated or putting food on the table for their families because of an unconstitutional mandate.”On December 8, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to overturn President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate for businesses using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), an expedited process for Congress to eliminate an executive branch rule. Sen. Sullivan led the CRA effort against the vaccine mandate with Sen. Braun. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/delegation-welcomes-major-announcement-on-denali-park-road,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, issued the following statements after Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced that $25 million from the bipartisan infrastructure law is being made available to expedite a solution for Denali Park Road access.The investment is one of the first that the Department of the Interior (DOI) has made under the infrastructure law. It is both timely and critical for Alaska, as the Denali Park Road has continued to face deterioration, including landslides, bringing closures and halting travel.“Just weeks after our bipartisan infrastructure bill became law, it is already producing substantial benefits for Alaska. The Pretty Rocks Landslide at Polychrome Pass on the Denali Park Road has long been a slow-moving disaster, and this crucial funding will help ensure the road is once again safe for locals and visitors to traverse,” Senator Murkowski said. “As ranking member of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, I’ve made fixing this road a priority—pressing multiple administrations for both near-term improvements and a long-term, sustainable solution. That work dovetails with my efforts on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which we designed to help address needs across Alaska. I thank the Secretary for working with us to prioritize the Denali Park Road and look forward to further investments in our state under this landmark law.” “Denali National Park is considered by many to be the crown jewel of our national park system,” said Senator Sullivan. “Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock here each year to witness the park’s natural beauty and wildlife and to enjoy the endless outdoor recreational activities that Denali has to offer. These improvements are great news for the Denali Borough and Alaska’s tourism industry, enabling out-of-state visitors and our own residents to continue safely accessing this world-class park. I also pressed senior DOI officials to make sure that this $25 million dollars in road construction goes to Alaska workers and contractors who know how to build our state better than anyone."" “Big investments are already on their way to the great State of Alaska! The soaring peaks of Denali are some of our state's most iconic natural features. Each year, Denali National Park welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors from across the world, and it is vital that this treasured attraction remains accessible for years to come,” said Congressman Young. “Last night, I received a personal phone call from Interior Secretary Haaland informing me that $25 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be made available to address the Petty Rocks landslide. Over the past few years, the landslide has severely degraded Denali's road system, putting public access in severe jeopardy. This crucial funding will go a long way toward restoring the road and enhancing its resiliency for the future. The Alaska Delegation was united in our fight to ensure the infrastructure law would provide historic support for our state. This funding is just the tip of the iceberg in what will prove to be game-changing infrastructure investments in Alaska. I am grateful to the Administration, the National Park Service, and the countless Alaskan advocates who helped make this grant a reality. I want to remind the rest of our great nation that Denali is open for visitors in 2022, and we hope you will consider experiencing our great outdoors and everything Alaska has to offer.”Background: Secretary Haaland announced today that DOI will allocate $25 million from the Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) to accelerate work at Denali, allowing the National Park Service to move Phase 1 of the project forward in Fiscal Year 2022. The FLTP received funding through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides historic investments in roads, bridges, ports, airports, broadband, ferries, water and wastewater, resilience, and energy projects—modernizing and upgrading the nation’s core infrastructure. Senator Murkowski was a lead author and negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure package, which garnered support from the entire Alaska congressional delegation.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-democrats-block-bipartisan-bill-to-sanction-putins-pipeline,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), today voted with 54 of his colleagues for a bill to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which runs between Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea. The bipartisan majority of senators failed to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary for the legislation, introduced by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), to pass the Senate.Sen. Sullivan spoke on the Senate floor shortly before the vote, criticizing the Biden administration for upending the long-standing bipartisan foreign policy of making America’s European allies less vulnerable to Russian energy blackmail, and calling out many of his Senate Democratic colleagues for rescinding their previous support for Nord Stream 2 sanctions in the 2020 and 2021 National Defense Authorization Acts.Transcript Thank you, Mr. President. I want to commend my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso who  has been a leader on so many of these issues, and Senator Cruz on his bill, this important piece of legislation that we're going to be voting on here in a couple hours.  And, Mr. President, this Nord Stream 2 sanctions bill is not just about the immediate crisis in Ukraine, but this would be a continuation of long-term bipartisan American strategy as it deals with Russia, energy security, and American security. I want to provide a little broader context to that bipartisan strategy, Mr. President, and put this debate and vote that we’re having here today into that context.The United States’ commitment to European security as we all know is ironclad. We fought two World Wars, a Cold War to protect our interests in a free and open Europe. We expanded NATO to secure those gains, and to prevent Russia from ever building a new empire that could threaten us or our allies. But, Mr. President, as we all know, Russian power is not just a function of military power. To the contrary, Vladimir Putin and the Russians, for decades, have been using energy in terms of power, and energy as a weapon. As a matter of fact, it's their weapon of choice in many instances in Europe.Let me provide a few recent examples. If you look at this map, one pipeline that's actually not depicted is the so-called “Brotherhood Pipeline” from Russia into Ukraine, and it goes into Europe. The Russians have cut off supplies of natural gas on that and other pipelines going through Ukraine in 2006, in 2008, in 2014, and in 2015.In Moldova, shortly after the defeat of a pro-Russian government and the election of a pro-Western one, Russia did what they normally do: they cut off gas to that country. And, Mr. President, it's not just impacting countries like Ukraine. When these gas supplies were cut off by Russia, because Vladimir Putin was angry about something, it impacted over 18 E.U. countries with regard to those cutoffs—and it's happening even today. Just yesterday, Mr. President, the head of the International Energy Agency in Paris said that Russia is already, right now, strategically limiting natural gas to Europe during this very cold winter to pressure European nations not to support Ukraine as the Russians amass tens of thousands of troops on their border as we speak.For these reasons, Mr. President, it has been the long-standing bipartisan American policy to do two things as it relates to energy security. First, we have sought, dating back to the 1980s, to block implementation of major pipelines from Russia, from then the Soviet Union, into Europe. The Reagan administration did this with sanctions in 1982, and we have continued to work this element of our policy. The other element of American bipartisan policy as it relates to European energy security has been to help countries, former Soviet Union countries, particularly in the Caspian and Central Asia area, to provide their own energy outlets in terms of natural gas and oil to Europe through the southern corridor, the BTC pipeline—these are all areas that Democrats and Republicans have been involved with in terms of energy supplies to our European allies that don't go through Russia. Mr. President, some of the diplomacy here on these pipelines started with the Clinton administration, which did a very good job on this. I had the opportunity as an assistant secretary of state in charge of economic and energy issues in the Bush administration to lead efforts on these southern corridor pipelines. And they were successful.Right now, these pipelines are providing energy to our allies in Europe. They don't go through Russia. They start in countries like Azerbaijan and go through Georgia, go through Turkey. This has been very bipartisan, supported by the Senate, and the Russians hate this. They hate it. Why? Because it doesn't give them any control over energy into Europe.So, Mr. President, as I mentioned, today's vote is actually part of a long-term bipartisan American strategy, for decades, that we have been pursuing because we know the Russians use energy, particularly natural gas, as a weapon. How have we been doing on this? Well, at the end of the Trump administration, we were in a very good position on European energy security in two key areas.First, as Senator Barrasso mentioned, we had strong, very strong bipartisan support with regard to Nord Stream 2 sanctions—on its construction and in operations. We had overwhelming Republican and Democrat support for the sanctions that we’re going to be voting on today in the 2021 NDAA, and in the 2020 NDAA. Very big, very bipartisan.Another reason we were set up very well, Mr. President, in terms of Eurasian energy security, is that at the end of the Trump administration, we had achieved a long-standing bipartisan goal of American national security, economic security, and energy security. What was that? Energy independence. We once again had become the world's energy superpower. What do I mean by that? The largest producer of oil, bigger than Saudi Arabia. The largest producer of natural gas, bigger than Russia. One of the biggest producers of renewables in the world. This is a bipartisan goal. With regard to European security, why was that so important? Because it answered a huge question that the Europeans often said: If we're going to block Nord Stream 2, Russian gas into Germany and other places in Europe, where are we going to get the gas?  Well, we had an answer. You’re going to get the gas from America. Our exports of LNG, liquefied natural gas, surged to Asia and Europe to take care of this problem. This is a good thing! And, Mr. President, in terms of the environment and climate, US LNG exports to Europe have a 41% lower emissions profile than Russian gas and pipelines to Europe. So it's good for the environment, climate, national security, and energy security. And here's another area: This big production of American energy was something that the people who know Vladimir Putin best knew was one of the biggest things we could do.A couple of years ago, I was in a meeting with my colleague who we miss very much here—Senator McCain—and a Russian dissident, a very famous Russian dissident. And at the end of the meeting, I said, what more can we do to undermine the Putin regime? Mr. President, you know what he said to me? He looked me in the eye without hesitation saying “produce more American energy.” That's the number one thing you can do undermine the Putin regime. And we did it! We did it.  These are all things—in addition to strengthening our own military, in addition to giving the Ukrainians Javelin missile systems—all of these things were putting us in a good position. Putin seemed very much in a box and certainly wasn't threatening Ukraine with tens of thousands of troops on the border. Where are we today on these key areas that I just mentioned?Well, Mr. President, we're not in such good shape. In terms of energy independence, this administration seems focused on actually destroying the production of American energy—oil and gas in particular. I guarantee you that the dictators in Moscow, as well as in Beijing, can hardly believe their luck. It seems like President Putin wants to undermine the very bipartisan goals we've had for decades: American energy independence and the United States as the world's energy superpower again. Just think about what he's seeing: [President Biden] cancels pipelines—the Keystone Pipeline in Canada and the United States—and the President is green-lighting Nord Stream 2, killing energy production in great states like mine. Just Monday there were more obstacles to produce energy in Alaska. And now we're importing two times as much oil from Russia as we were a year ago. That's helping Putin, and hurting the United States. And Mr. President, what about Nord Stream 2, where we looked so strong just in the past few years, with this body, in a strong bipartisan way, sanctioning that pipeline right there?Well, President Biden has greenlit it, but we don't have to. That's the point of this vote today. And, again, this vote is not just about the current crisis in Ukraine. It's about continuing a long-term bipartisan approach to Eurasian energy security that would make our European allies less vulnerable to Russian energy blackmail, which has not only gone back decades, it is literally happening right now. Just listen, as I mentioned, to the International Energy Agency's report yesterday on this topic. And, Mr. President, to be honest, it's also about a more political question, this vote today. Many of my Democratic colleagues suddenly became very hawkish against Russia and Putin on these issues and other issues during the Trump years. And I welcomed their conversion to a more hardline approach. But it always begged the question: Was that more hawkish conversion a principled one, because they realized being tough on Putin in terms of energy and our military was the best way to achieve American national interests, or was this conversion more of a temporary one depending on who occupied the White House? I hope it's not the latter, but today's vote will answer that for some of the senators who are looking to change their recent votes. But clearly some of my colleagues just a few years ago, who were voting to sanction and stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and were sounding very tough on Vladimir Putin and Russia, are now in a bit of a quandary if they vote differently today. Not surprisingly, they’re making arguments to rationalize this new position and I'd like to review briefly, Mr. President, just a few of those.Senator Murphy has been down on the floor, the junior senator from Connecticut, with a lot of these arguments, and I respect his thoughtful voice on foreign policy. I don’t always agree with him, but he’s a serious voice. But, Mr. President, his arguments on this issue right now are not very persuasive or powerful. Here's the thing he's saying right now: “This isn't about Russia.” And I'm quoting Senator Murphy. This is about “a Cruz-Trump agenda to break up the Atlantic alliance.” A Cruz-Trump agenda to break up the Atlantic alliance.He's clearly trying to make a boogeyman here, the so-called Cruz-Trump agenda. But, Mr. President, serious people who’ve been working on these issues for decades know that what we're doing today is a continuation of long-term bipartisan support for a really important energy security policy for the United States and our European allies. This is continuing that long-standing approach.In his quote on the “Cruz-Trump agenda,” [Murphy] said this is actually about keeping the Atlantic relationship going to “save Ukraine from an invasion.”But where is the President of Ukraine on this issue? What does the President of Ukraine, who knows a little bit about power politics and Putin, think about what we're doing here today?He supports sanctions on Nord Stream 2. That's where Senator Murphy is starting to dig a little deeper on his weak arguments and trying to provide cover for his colleagues who are going to change their vote. He had to respond on where President Zelensky of Ukraine was. Here's what Senator Murphy said about that: “I'm a big supporter of President Zelensky, but he often misreads American politics, and I think it would be better for him to have stayed out of this one.”  Wow! So the leader of the country that many of us think this is all about, who certainly knows what Russian energy power politics are about, since he's been on the pointy end of that weapon many times—we now have a senator saying President Zelensky, sit down, be quiet. Stay out of this one. We don't want to hear from you. even though this is about “saving your country.” Unless, of course, you support his position on Nord Stream 2.So, Mr. President, these are very weak arguments by the senator from Connecticut.The most legitimate argument I've heard some of my Democratic friends make on switching their vote on their previous Nord Stream 2 sanctions is that the Germans—a very important ally, we all agree on that—don’t want us to apply Nord Stream 2 sanctions. Okay, that's an argument we should all consider. And this is what I've heard Secretary Blinken and National Security Advisor Sullivan telling senators this week as they lobby against this vote we're going to take. Although earlier in the year, it was reported in the press that both of them actually supported Nord Stream 2 sanctions.But, Mr. President, here's the thing on that argument. It's actually hard to tell what the Germans really want. In fact, what the Germans really want seems to be changing by the hour. There was a recent change in government in Germany, and the new foreign minister herself has said that the country should not grant Nord Stream 2 regulatory approval in order to resist “Russian blackmail on energy prices.”This is the current Foreign Minister of Germany! It's also important to remember where the rest of the European Union is. There is broad opposition in Europe on Nord Stream 2.The European Parliament voted last year on an overwhelming cross-party basis of 581 to 50 in favor of cancelling the entire project in the wake of the arrest of Alexei Navalny, a Russian democracy leader who Putin first tried to kill before locking away in prison.  The European Parliament has voted at least four further times on other resolutions to call on the E.U. to halt this very project, which is what we're looking to vote on today. And, finally, Mr. President, outsourcing this very important foreign policy, national security, American issue to the Germans is simply not wise. The Germans have not always been so clean or level-headed when it comes to Russian gas, Gazprom, and Nord Stream 2. What am I talking about? Well, of course, I'm talking about the former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder, one of the biggest betrayers of the West, certainly in the last century. He left his chancellorship to become Putin's Gazprom lapdog. He's the main lobbyist pushing Russian gas all over Germany and Europe. He's an embarrassment to the Atlantic alliance, he now is the chairman for many years of Gazprom, the former chancellor of Germany.And of course he's influenced Germans to say this is good. He's made millions doing it, by the way. He should be sanctioned with other Putin cronies. But at the end of the day, Mr. President, this shouldn't be outsourced to Germany. What we need to do is make a vote on what's right for American national security. A vote that sanctions this pipeline would be consistent with long-term, very bipartisan American-Eurasian energy security policy.Make no mistake, my colleagues: Nord Stream 2 is Putin's pipeline. Let's not make it his lifeline. I encourage all of my colleagues to do what they've done recently, in the last couple of years, which is to vote in an overwhelming bipartisan manner to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.I yield the floor. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-calls-out-schumer-and-bidens-outrageous-jim-crow-20-smear,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) spoke on the Senate floor last night, calling out President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for falsely accusing Republican-led states of instituting “Jim Crow 2.0” voting laws at the same time their own Democrat-led states lag behind in several key areas. Sullivan drew the comparison between voting laws in states represented by Democratic senators and his own state of Alaska, including on automatic voter registration, no-excuse absentee voting, and early in-person voting.Sullivan also noted the hypocrisy of Democratic senators calling for eliminating the legislative filibuster just a few years after adamantly calling for the preservation of the filibuster—when Republicans held a majority in the Senate.Below are excerpts from Sen. Sullivan’s speech.On Leader Schumer and President Biden’s charge of “Jim Crow 2.0”:“The Jim Crow era, we know, was a horrible blight and stain on our country. Some of the most heinous laws were passed to prevent African Americans from voting. It was a horrible era. But it is remarkable how casually the President of the United States and the majority leader now throw out their ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ insult at Republicans, at Republican states. The President and the majority leader do this when their states don't even closely measure up to mine on critical voting rights issues and laws. It is pretty remarkable, pretty hypocritical.” On Senate Republicans resisting pressure to scrap the legislative filibuster when they held the majority during the Trump administration: “In 2017, 61 U.S. Senators, in this letter, wrote the majority leader, then Senator McConnell, and the minority leader, Senator Schumer—33 Republicans and 30 Democrats—saying, in essence, don't get rid of the filibuster. These were 30 Democrats, four years ago, who wrote this letter, saying don't get rid of the filibuster. Now, that is when the Republicans were in the majority, and there was a Republican in the White House. There was pressure, I will tell you, on Republicans like there is now on Democrats, from certain elements in the White House and other places, to get rid of the filibuster, and we didn't do it. We did not do it for all of the reasons that we have been discussing.”On Republican-led Alaska’s voting rights laws relative to prominent Democratic-led states:“My Republican state, the great State of Alaska, has voting laws that are significantly more expansive than the laws of New York, than the laws of Delaware, than the laws of Connecticut, than the laws of Massachusetts and the laws of New Hampshire, just to name a few. That is a fact.”On voter registration:“My state, in essence, has automatic voter registration—probably one of the most forward-leaning of any state in the country. As I speak right here on the Senate floor, there is no automatic voter registration in Pennsylvania, in Minnesota, in Arizona, in New Hampshire, in Delaware—President Biden's state—or in Wisconsin. None. None. None of these States have automatic voter registration. Are these states ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ relative to Alaska, my Republican state? I wouldn't say that, but, again, by President Biden's logic, they are.”On no-excuse absentee voting:“…in my State, there is no excuse [absentee voting]. If you want to vote absentee, you can. In these [Democratic] states, you have to have an excuse. But here is the deal. In New York or Connecticut or Massachusetts, age is not an excuse. It is not an excuse. You can be 90 to 95 years old; fought in World War II; maybe it is hard for you to get to the polling place—nope, not in New York, not in Connecticut, not in Massachusetts. That is no excuse. Sorry, World War II veteran who can barely walk.”On New Yorkers having the opportunity to update their own state’s voting laws:“New York actually doesn't want to change their own voting laws to be more expansive of voting rights like we are in Alaska. How do I know this? New York just had a statewide referendum to have same-day voter registration and no-excuse absentee voting like my state. Guess what. The people of New York voted against that. The people of New York had an opportunity to meet the level where we are in Alaska, a Republican state, and the people of New York rejected it. I don't know what is going on in New York, why the good people there rejected these provisions, but it is going to be interesting. We will see if Leader Schumer is consistent and accuses his own constituents of supporting ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ as he has millions of his fellow Americans. Is he going to do that?”On federalizing all state elections: “I am not trying to say that every other state should be like Alaska…I am proud of where my state is, and I am certainly not going to let any smug argument on the other side somehow accuse my Republican state of [having] ‘Jim Crow 2.0.’ Meet the standards in my state before you make those arguments...The point is, we are not all going to be the same. I have a state that is one-fifth the size of the Lower 48. We have very unique voting issues. And the Founding Fathers strongly believed that election laws, for that reason, should be crafted state by state.”On President Biden’s “invitation” to Republicans:“My invitation to the President and other members who are demanding that we fundamentally alter this body by getting rid of the filibuster: Save your smug ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ insults. Go back to your own states. Undertake voter rights legislation as expansive as my state. Take care of your own states first before you come here and tell us that you need to fundamentally reorder this body and this country by getting rid of the filibuster—an issue that almost everybody agreed on just a few years ago was not a good idea for the Senate or for America.”# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech-voting-rights-and-the-senate-filibuster-011122,"Mr. President, I wanted to come down here, like many of my colleagues today, and talk about a really important topic, and that is the future of the filibuster and the issue of voting rights, both of which are very important to this country. We are going to be focused a lot--perhaps with some major votes, historic votes, in the U.S. Senate this week--on these topics.There has been a lot of talk recently from my Democratic colleagues about actually getting rid of the filibuster. This, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, would be an action that would fundamentally transform this institution and this country.The irony is that, until very recently, the vast majority of our colleagues here--Republicans and Democrats--were in agreement on this topic, in essence, of getting rid of the filibuster, which has been part of the U.S. Senate for decades--for centuries, in many aspects, if you look at our history. It would not be a wise move for the Senate. It would not be a wise move for America. This has been a longstanding bipartisan view.Let me just give you a couple of quotes from some of my colleagues. My colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, just said last year: I am a “no” on changing the filibuster. I am a “no.” The move to make the Senate like the House, I think, is a mistake. My colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, said in 2018: I am committed to never voting to change the legislative filibuster. That is what Senator Coons said.My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, in 2018, also said:I can tell you getting rid of the filibuster would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers. We have to acknowledge respect for the minority, and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition and its procedure.Wise words from Senator Durbin.Of course, there is a trove of quotes from the majority leader, Senator Schumer, who vehemently opposed getting rid of the filibuster in the past when he was in the minority. Let me highlight just a few of them.Here is one he said in 2005: Bottom line is very simple. The ideologues in the Senate want to turn what the Founding Fathers called the “cooling saucer of democracy” into the rubberstamp of dictatorship. We will not let them. They want to make this country into a banana republic.Never one for subtlety, that is our majority leader right now. Then he went on to say:It would be doomsday for democracy.Again, not too subtle there, the majority leader. It would be doomsday for democracy if we get rid of the filibuster. Here is another Senator who is very famous around the world and who became President, Barack Obama.He said with regard to getting rid of the filibuster in 2005:What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet. Since we are reaching back, let me quote the late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia on this issue. Here he is in 2005: The filibuster must go, they say. In my 53 years in Congress, I have never seen a matter that came before the Congress, before the Senate, or the House, as a matter of fact, that is so dangerous, so out of the mainstream, and so radical as this one. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.That was Senator Byrd.Of course, it is not just Senators. Here is what the organ of the Democratic Party, also known as the New York Times editorial board, said in 2004 about the filibuster:Republicans see the filibuster as an annoying obstacle, but it is actually one of the checks and balances that the Founders, who worried greatly about the concentration of power, built into our system.So this has been a view that has been widely held: Don't get rid of the filibuster.Senator Manchin, in an op-ed recently, talking about how he would not, under no circumstances, vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster, gave a really important reason why, which, as Alaska's Senator, I feel very strongly about. He noted in that piece that the current rules with regard to the filibuster and the 60-vote threshold guarantee that “rural and small States and the Americans who live in them always have a seat at the table in the U.S. Senate.” Well, I think that that is enormously important. It is enormously important for Alaska, but it is enormously important for the Senate as a body, which was how we were designed by the Founding Fathers. Now, you know, there are charges of hypocrisy that can be leveled at this institution and at the Members in it. Many times, there are examples of when Members of Congress say one thing when they are in power and have authority and they say another thing when they are out of power. But I will tell you, on this issue, that has not been the case for the Republican Senators here.What do I mean?In 2017, 61 U.S. Senators, in this letter, wrote the majority leader, then Senator McConnell, and the minority leader, Senator Schumer--33 Republicans and 30 Democrats--saying, in essence, don't get rid of the filibuster. These were 30 Democrats, 4 years ago, who wrote this letter, saying don't get rid of the filibuster.Now, that is when the Republicans were in the majority, and there was a Republican in the White House. There was pressure, I will tell you, on Republicans like there is now on Democrats, from certain elements in the White House and other places, to get rid of the filibuster, and we didn't do it. We did not do it for all of the reasons that we have been discussing.Yet I guess we are going to see a vote in the first time in history, I believe, in the U.S. Senate where the majority leader of the U.S. Senate is going to actually move forward to start getting rid of the filibuster. I am pretty sure that has never happened--the legislative filibuster--in the history of the United States of America. It is a big deal. So, look, my Democratic colleagues are clearly cognizant of how vulnerable they look with regard to being hypocritical on the issue. As I mentioned, 31 of them, just 4 years ago, signed a letter, saying don't get rid of it when Republicans had power in the Senate and in the White House, and we didn't. But now, they are like, Hmm, we are going to flip-flop and say we should get rid of it.The Presiding Officer may have seen that there are already these filibuster flip-flop cards. I won't name the Senators, but it shows them wearing flip-flops. The President is there, but it is already out there, right? This is a big, big flip-flop, not on some small issue but on one of the most fundamental issues in the U.S. Senate, and my colleagues know this. So what is their response? What is their response?In looking at their previous statements, like the Senate majority leader's, who has made a lot of statements--I have just read a few--in saying, you know, that it doesn't really matter, and I didn't really mean it, what is the argument? Well, here is the argument. Here is their argument. The Senate filibuster must be nuked because American democracy must be saved from Republican State legislators and Republican Members of Congress and their so-called Jim Crow 2.0 schemes. This is their new language. Everybody from the President to Majority Leader Schumer is using this talking point.Just yesterday and today, the majority leader was going on about Republican Jim Crow 2.0 schemes and the need for Democrats to protect and defend American democracy, and Joe Biden--that unifier, that great unifier--uses the Jim Crow 2.0 charge against Republicans on a very regular basis. As a matter of fact, he just did it a few hours ago, again, down in Georgia today. It is all historically inaccurate, and it is insulting to millions of Americans. Of course, they are stated with a smug, moral superiority, their arguments that voting rights laws--just listen to them, listen to them--in Democrat States are good and noble and are protecting American democracy while voting rights laws in Republican States are bad and even racist. Jim Crow 2.0 is their argument. Listen to the President. Listen to the majority leader.They were making those arguments as recently as today. That is their argument as to why, after all of these years of saying don't get rid of the filibuster, they are saying now we have to get rid of the filibuster.So here is the key question: Are these arguments accurate? Are their claims actually true?Now, I do not assume to know the details of other States' voting laws, and here is the truth. You have had a lot of U.S. Senators in the last couple of weeks and couple of months--heck, even today--coming down to the Senate floor, claiming they know all about these other laws in other States on voting rights. They don't. Trust me. For those watching, they don't. I don't claim to know the details of voting rights laws in other States. But here is what I do know. I know a lot about Alaska's laws, a lot about Alaska's voting laws. In fact, when I was attorney general, I was in the trenches, defending the right to vote for all Alaskans. I am proud to have that as part of my record.I know a lot about Alaska's voting rights laws--a Republican State--and here are some very important and rather inconvenient truths and facts about my State's laws in three critical areas of voting rights: early in-person voting, automatic voter registration, and no-excuse absentee voting. My Republican State, the great State of Alaska, has voting laws that are significantly more expansive than the laws of New York, than the laws of Delaware, than the laws of Connecticut, than the laws of Massachusetts and the laws of New Hampshire, just to name a few. That is a fact.President Biden's speech today talked about facts. Well, these are facts. And I am going to talk a little bit more about these facts, but here is my point: Those States I just named--New York, Delaware, Connecticut, and Massachusetts--are those States Jim Crow 2.0 relative to Alaska? Well, by Joe Biden's reasoning, they are.So I want to go a little bit more in detail on some of these issues I am talking about. These are important areas with regard to voting rights.Let's start with early in-person voting: Alaska, 15 days; other States, less so; New Jersey, DC, 10 days, 7 days; New York, 10 days; Massachusetts, 11 days. They haven't met my State yet. That is OK.Now look at Connecticut--no days. There is no early in-person voting at all. In New Hampshire, there is no early in-person voting at all. Why don't these States want people to vote early? Is it Jim Crow 2.0? Look, I wouldn't make that claim against those States, maligning their elected officials. I am sure they have their reasons. But, again, by President Biden's logic, they are.Let me do another area of important voting rights laws: voter registration.My State in essence has automatic voter registration--probably one of the most forward-leaning of any State in the country. As I speak right here on the Senate floor, there is no automatic voter registration in Pennsylvania, in Minnesota, in Arizona, in New Hampshire, in Delaware--President Biden's State--or in Wisconsin. None. None. None of these States have automatic voter registration. Are these States Jim Crow 2.0 relative to Alaska, my Republican State? I wouldn't say that, but, again, by President Biden's logic, they are.Let me give you one more, a pretty important one as well. This is the issue of no-excuse absentee voting. There are many other expansive provisions in Alaska's laws as it pertains to voting, but here is one that we think is important. If for some reason you can't make it down to the polling location and you want to vote absentee, you can. You don't need an excuse to vote absentee. We have been doing that for years and years and years.Let's look at other States. In Delaware, you have to have an excuse. In New Hampshire, you have to have an excuse. Connecticut. Massachusetts. New York. By the way, all of the Senators from these States are down here. Jim Crow 2.0. Republican States. What about this issue? This is a really important issue. Are these States Jim Crow 2.0 relative to my State? Well, according to Joe Biden's logic, they are. I wouldn't make that claim. Let me focus on New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts for a little bit longer, on their laws--because I did look into this--and actually what does not constitute an excuse. Again, in my State, there is no excuse. If you want to vote absentee, you can. In these States, you have to have an excuse. But here is the deal. In New York or Connecticut or Massachusetts, age is not an excuse. It is not an excuse. You can be 90 years old, 95 years old; fought in World War II; maybe it is hard for you to get to the polling place--nope, not in New York, not in Connecticut, not in Massachusetts. That is no excuse. Sorry, World War II veteran who can barely walk. Let me give you another example of those States--actually, the States of New York, Delaware, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. If you are a victim of stalking or domestic violence--you don't want to leave your home and go to a public polling place; you don't want your address on a public document--is that an excuse so you can get an absentee ballot? Nope. Nope. You must leave your home and go down to the polling place. That is not an excuse, domestic violence victim. Let me remind the listeners. New York doesn't allow that as an excuse. The majority leader is from New York. Delaware doesn't allow that as an excuse. The President of the United States is from Delaware.To me, these election laws seem particularly egregious, as egregious as any of the examples offered by the other side about voting restrictions in other States that we have been hearing about, ones that are now shamelessly and ridiculously compared to Jim Crow 2.0 by our own President, the unifier. But here is the thing: I wouldn't tell New York that it must change its voting laws. I don't understand the people who live in New York who don't want to give a World War II veteran an excuse to vote absentee. For that matter, New York actually doesn't want to change their own voting laws to be more expansive of voting rights like we are in Alaska. How do I know this? New York just had a statewide referendum to have same-day voter registration and no-excuse absentee voting like my State. Guess what. The people of New York voted against that. The people of New York had an opportunity to meet the level where we are in Alaska, a Republican State, and the people of New York rejected it. I don't know what is going on in New York, why the good people there rejected these provisions, but it is going to be interesting. We will see if Leader Schumer is consistent and accuses his own constituents of supporting Jim Crow 2.0 as he has millions of his fellow Americans. Is he going to do that?They just rejected what my State already has: no-excuse absentee voting. New York rejected it. Are the New Yorkers Jim Crow 2.0 relative to Alaska? I don't think so. There are reasons in their State, I am sure, that they would make for not doing what we do in Alaska. But, again, by President Biden's own logic, they are. I am confident the good people of New York have a reason. But here is the thing, and it is a serious issue: The Jim Crow era, we know, was a horrible blight and stain on our country. Some of the most heinous laws were passed to prevent African Americans from voting. It was a horrible era. But it is remarkable how casually the President of the United States and the majority leader now throw out their Jim Crow 2.0 insult at Republicans, at Republican States. The President and the majority leader do this when their States don't even closely measure up to mine on critical voting rights issues and laws. It is pretty remarkable, pretty hypocritical.But it is not just me making this argument. Here is an article from The Atlantic that came out recently entitled “The Blue States That Make It Hardest To Vote.” Here is the subtitle: “Democrats are criticizing Republicans for pushing restrictive voting laws. But states such as Joe Biden's Delaware can make casting a ballot difficult.”I would I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.Here is a little bit of what this article says:[President Biden] has assailed Georgia's new voting laws as an atrocity akin to “Jim Crow in the 21st century. . . . But even once the GOP-passed measure [in Georgia] takes effect, Georgia citizens will still have far more opportunities to vote before Election Day than their counterparts in the president's home state. That is The Atlantic--not known as a Republican magazine or anything. The Atlantic article goes on to say:Delaware isn't an anomaly among Democratic strongholds, and its example presents the president's party with an uncomfortable reminder: Although Democrats like to call out Republicans for trying to suppress voting, the states [the Democrats] control in the Northeast makes casting a ballot more difficult than anywhere else. Than anywhere else.Here is the point I am making. I am not trying to say that every other State should be like Alaska, that we need to federalize elections so every State has the same voting rights issues. I am proud of where my State is, and I am certainly not going to let any smug argument on the other side somehow accuse my Republican State of Jim Crow 2.0. Meet the standards in my State before you make those arguments. But the point is, we are not all going to be the same. I have a State that is one-fifth the size of the lower 48. We have very unique voting issues. And the Founding Fathers strongly believed that election laws, for that reason, should be crafted State by State. This is in the Constitution: The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.Yes, this Congress may make laws and regulations, but a wholesale Federal takeover of every State's elections law is not what the Constitution contemplated, and it is not what would be good for each citizen of each State in our country. My invitation to the President and other Members who are fundamentally demanding that we fundamentally alter this body by getting rid of the filibuster: Save your smug “Jim Crow 2.0” insults. Go back to your own States. Undertake voter rights legislation is as expansive as my State. Take care of your own States first before you come here and tell us that you need to fundamentally reorder this body and this country by getting rid of the filibuster--an issue that almost everybody agreed on just a few years ago was not a good idea for the Senate or for America.I yield the floor."
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/no-action-administration-targets-npr-a-for-latest-restrictions-on-alaska-resource-development,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, issued the following statements after the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signaled that it plans to close millions of additional acres in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) to responsible resource development. “With zero analysis or consultation with Alaskans, the Biden administration has decided to upend the NPR-A’s current management plan to return to an outdated policy that is worse for our state’s economy, worse for our nation’s energy security, and contrary to federal law,” Senator Murkowski said. “BLM claims a need for greater ‘balance’ in managing this area, but fails to realize that balance is what will be lost through this move. This is a petroleum reserve, specifically designated for energy development, located within a state that already has tens of millions of acres of parks, refuges, and federal wilderness. The current management plan was carefully crafted to protect the reserve’s most sensitive areas and includes numerous safeguards for responsible development. Sweeping restrictions like this – which are being imposed even as the Biden administration implores OPEC+ to produce more oil – demonstrate everything that is wrong with its energy policies.” “There they go again. Yesterday it was 20 executive actions from the Biden administration targeting our state’s economic opportunities and future, today it’s 21. No state in the country has been singled out like Alaska with such a destructive war on our working families, which hits our Alaska Native communities particularly hard,” said Senator Sullivan. “Moving to revert back to the 2013 Obama administration version, which removes roughly fifty percent of the NPR-A from oil and gas development, will hurt Alaska’s economic future, our nation’s security, and likely violates federal law. Reverting back to the 2013 management plan is not only arbitrary and contrary to good science, it will be harmful to the very people and issues the Biden administration purports to care most about—indigenous communities, and racial and environmental equity. Instead, the Biden White House is taking its orders from radical extreme environmental groups who care nothing about Alaskans. I will continue to fight this war on Alaska’s workers and economy with everything I’ve got.”“For years, the NPR-A has been crucial to providing affordable energy to families across our country. This move by the Biden Administration is not only insulting to the hardworking men and women on the North Slope, but also extremely foolish. Gas prices around the nation are soaring; why then would President Biden and the BLM want to kneecap our domestic production, thereby emboldening our oil-producing adversaries overseas? This decision is yet another insult among a series of anti-Alaska actions taken by this Administration. By reverting to the 2013 IAP, BLM is attempting to shut down almost 50% of the NPR-A – that's over 11 million acres. To put this in perspective, the President’s home state of Delaware could fit in this part of the NPR-A about seven times over. No state should be subject to such a heavy-handed decision, and certainly not Alaska. Our state has proven that conservation and energy development can go hand in hand. Despite this, the Administration continues working to stifle American energy production and economic opportunity in Alaska,” said Congressman Young. “This reversion, championed by bureaucrats thousands of miles away from the NPR-A, is dead wrong. I condemn it and call on President Biden to end his Administration's attacks on Alaska's economy and way of life.”The Biden administration announced yesterday that it plans to use Alternative A – the “No Action Alternative” from the NPR-A’s 2020 Integrated Activity Plan (IAP) as its preferred alternative to manage the reserve. This would close approximately half of the surface acreage of the reserve, which is roughly the size of Indiana, to energy leasing.The Alaska delegation strongly supported the previous administration’s decision to re-evaluate and revise the NPR-A’s IAP. That process, which concluded in early 2021, resulted in a management plan that BLM itself described as including “important safeguards for wildlife and sensitive resources, while allowing for responsible oil and gas leasing across 18.6 million acres of the NPR-A. These safeguards include no surface occupancy, controlled surface use, timing limitations and provide for new and emerging technologies to access subsurface resources while maintaining important surface values.” The preferred alternative selected under the early 2021 IAP kept more than four million acres of the NPR-A closed to leasing and represented a suitable balance for managing the reserve.BLM administers the NPR-A under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act and other federal laws. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the 23 million-acre region on the western North Slope—roughly the size of the state of Indiana—contains 8.7 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically-recoverable oil.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-wins-stand-off-with-white-house-over-ninth-circuit-nominees,"ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) announced on Sunday that he had met via phone with several nominees to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, with jurisdiction over Alaska, ending a blockade by the Biden White House, which had been denying the senator the opportunity to meet with the judges prior to voting on their confirmation in the Senate. In his remarks on the Senate floor on December 13th, Sen. Sullivan argued that by withholding these meetings, the White House was subverting the “advice and consent” duties senators have under the Constitution. He also noted that this policy was a marked shift from the previous administration, which had facilitated meetings between senators and judicial nominees upon request. Sen. Sullivan delivered the news on Sunday Night in America on Fox News Channel, hosted by former Congressman Trey Gowdy.Transcript of the senator’s interview: GOWDY: Senator Sullivan joins us now. Thank you for joining us, Senator. I actually watched your conversation with Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island on the Senate floor. It was cordial, as most Senate conversations are, but I do not understand the explanation for why you cannot meet with judicial nominees whose decisions impact your very state.  SULLIVAN: Well, Trey, listen. I'm really glad you're raising this topic and, by the way, Merry Christmas. It’s great to be on the show. But here's the thing. This administration with some Democratic allies in the House and the Senate has been smashing key constitutional norms. As you know, they're trying to pack the Supreme Court. Look at what Elizabeth Warren just announced. They're trying to kill the filibuster. And then this one comes up—trying to undermine the advice and consent role that the U.S. Senate has with regard to nominees, especially, as you mentioned, judges who have life tenure. I've been fighting this and I'm actually glad to report right now that we finally have a victory on this one. We have stopped in its tracks this latest attack on the Constitution and constitutional norms. But I'll tell you, this was a breathtaking overreach—another one by the Biden White House. GOWDY: Well, good for you, Senator. How in the world—because I watched you and Senator Whitehouse. I think you had put a hold on something until they just simply let you meet. So how did you pull this off?SULLIVAN: I called the Biden White House and said, “What the heck is going on?” I meet with every Ninth Circuit judge, no matter what. As you mentioned in your piece already, the Ninth Circuit has enormous power over my constituents. They often get legal cases wrong. So I said, “Are you the one White House counsel that’s not letting me do my advice and consent role as a U.S. Senator?” It's hard to tell who's in charge over there in the White House. She actually said, “Well, we want to protect our judges.” I said, “Protect our judges? What the heck are you talking about? Protect them from what? Us doing our constitutional duty?” So I put holds on these judges and I got all of my [Republican] Senate colleagues to commit to voting against every Biden judicial nominee. And then I started talking to Democratic senators too. And, to be honest, I think I convinced some of them to say we're not going to do this. We're not going to undermine the Senate's advice and consent power. So we played hardball and finally I started getting some meetings with these judges who are up for life tenure appointments and will have enormous power over my state and the whole Ninth Circuit. Trey, you know, that's one out of five Americans. But this again is just another power grab and undermining of constitutional norms. We have to keep fighting. We had a victory on this one. But there's a lot more of the Constitution we have to protect. GOWDY: You know, senator, they do serve for life. They make incredibly challenging, difficult decisions. I've been lucky. Every federal judge I've appeared in front of you would have been proud of, whether you voted for them or nominated them, or not. They were wonderful. But the issue of temperament—will that road get heavy, will you change? How do you make that call if you've never met or talked to the person. SULLIVAN: You're exactly right, and here's what I did in these meetings when I finally was able to have them. Again, I've met with every Ninth Circuit judge, by the way, every D.C. Circuit judge, and every Supreme Court justice. Of course, it's a huge part of our job. It's Article 2, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. The notion that the White House would say you can't do that under the Constitution because we want to “protect” judges is just crazy. But when it comes to the issues of temperament or their knowledge, what I do in the cases of Ninth Circuit judges, Trey, is I send them several U.S. Supreme Court cases that have an impact on Alaska. I ask them to read them so that they're up-to-speed on big issues in my state. And then I talk about issues, like the Second Amendment. Let me give an example. Nearly 70% of the households in Alaska are gun owners. The Second Amendment is hugely important to my constituents. So I raised the issues that matter to Alaska and, to be honest, these judges usually don't know anything about these issues, and it's a way to educate them. So when they're on the bench for life, they are doing things that represent everybody in the entire circuit, not just where they're from. And, unfortunately, in my case, California produces the vast majority of the Ninth Circuit judges. Alaska gets one judge out of 29. So you better believe I'm going to interview every single one of them. We finally fought back and won against this latest Biden attack on the Constitution.GOWDY: Well, senator, just to show you how much of a nerd I am, I was actually watching C-SPAN. So I listened to it and that's what piqued my interest. Congratulations to you for getting this resolved. You know, life is a long time. You have a job for six years minus sort of day to day or night-to-night, but life is a long time. So kudos to you for staying on it and getting it resolved. Merry Christmas to the entire Sullivan family and thank you for being with us tonight.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-and-murkowski-introduce-alaska-salmon-research-task-force-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) introduced the Alaska Salmon Research Task Force Act, legislation that would form a panel of Alaska’s salmon stakeholders and research experts to study Pacific salmon trends and create a coordinated research strategy for Pacific salmon in Alaska to support salmon management. The Research Task Force would be directed to conduct a comprehensive review of Pacific salmon science relevant to understanding and managing salmon returns in Alaska, and publish a report, within one year of convening, to provide recommendations identifying knowledge and research gaps and further research priorities for salmon in Alaska.“It is difficult to overstate the importance of salmon to Alaska, our communities, our economy and our traditional way of life. Over the past several years, Alaskans in some parts of the state have witnessed strong, historic runs of salmon, while Alaskans in other regions have seen shocking and unprecedented declines,” said Sen. Sullivan. “Our existing management system, with the state’s authority to manage Alaska’s salmon harvest and the federal government managing federal fishery salmon harvest and much of the at-sea research, has created a clear gap in research and research prioritization that urgently needs to be addressed. This crisis warrants the combined attention of our state and federal governments, and the expertise of our greatest scientific minds, as well as the indigenous communities that have harvested salmon for millennia. With this legislation, we would establish a body to expand our understanding, identify knowledge gaps, and ultimately drive us toward concrete policies and management decisions that we hope will bring increased abundance and stability to our salmon stocks for the benefit of all Alaskans.”“It has been said that the summer season doesn’t arrive in Alaskan coastal and in-river communities until the salmon do. In some regions we are seeing not just a decline in salmon runs, but a crash that is damaging to not only the local economies but to the culture and spirit of the people in the region. It is clear we must further our understanding of salmon and their ecosystems in these times of rapid change. I am proud to join Senator Sullivan on the Alaska Salmon Research Taskforce Act as we seek to identify and bolster the necessary science to chart a path forward to ensure these critical species thrive,” said Sen. Murkowski. “I also continue to welcome feedback from affected community members and groups on how best to target research funding and craft policy to identify and mitigate the drivers of these declines and ensure the vitality of Alaska’s salmon fisheries for future generations.”The Research Task Force would be composed of between 13 and 19 members, with the secretary of commerce appointing a representative from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and the U.S. section of the Pacific Salmon Commission. The secretary would also appoint between two and five representatives from Alaska covering the wide array of state fisheries stakeholders, including subsistence, and commercial or recreational users. Lastly, the secretary would appoint five academic experts in salmon biology, management, and ecology, or marine research. The governor of Alaska would appoint one representative of the state.The bill also directs the Research Task Force to establish a working group specifically focused on salmon returns in the AYK region of Western and Interior Alaska, where salmon return failures have had devastating impacts, and provides flexibility for the Research Task Force to establish other geographically-focused working groups. # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-recognizes-50th-anniversary-of-alaska-native-claims-settlement-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska) yesterday introduced S. Res. 482, a resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and the lasting impact of this landmark law on Alaska and Alaska Native people. ANCSA, the largest land claims settlement in U.S. history, transferred 44 million acres of federal land to 12 newly formed Regional Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and more than 200 Village and Urban ANCs, fostering economic development through managing and developing the land for the benefit of their Alaska Native shareholders.“It is a story of self-determination and, in many ways, heroism, and it is a story for the ages,” said Sen. Sullivan. “I am honored to represent these wonderful people—many of the leaders who are still alive who made this happen fifty years ago—and their children and grandchildren. We have more work to do, but fifty years ago, on December 18, 1971, it was the start of a new, positive, innovative chapter in the history of Alaska.”Transcript of remarksMr. President, today I introduced a resolution with Senator Murkowski celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act--ANCSA, as we call it back home in Alaska--which was an enormously consequential piece of legislation that, after years and years of debate right in this body, passed the House, then passed the U.S. Senate, and then was signed into law by President Nixon on December 18, 1971, almost exactly 50 years ago to this day. It was a great day for Alaska.I know Senator Murkowski was on the floor earlier talking about ANCSA and why it is so important and why in Alaska, right now, we have been celebrating 50 years of this important piece of legislation.I want to go back in time a little bit to help explain, because part of what Senator Murkowski and I do here is we are constantly talking about and educating our colleagues about this very unique legislation, which happened right here in the U.S. Senate. If you go back in time to 1867, that is when the United States purchased Alaska from Russia. Within the agreement, there was acknowledgement of the Alaska Native people and their lands, but, still, almost 100 years after the purchase from Russia, even following statehood for Alaska, the claims settlement that the Native people had to their own lands was still in limbo.It got a kick and a turbo charge when oil was discovered on Alaska's North Slope during a worldwide shortage, which created new urgency to develop Alaska for our resources but to do so by settling these land claims.There were allies in the Federal Government who were helpful, but it was truly the Alaska Native people and their determination to themselves and to future generations and their resiliency and brilliance which led to the passage of ANCSA 50 years ago, which became the largest and, certainly, most innovative indigenous land settlement, certainly, in U.S. history, and it is no exaggeration to say probably in the world--44 million acres of land going to the Native people of my State. It brought tremendous educational, social, political, economic, and cultural achievements for the Alaska Native people. It certainly wasn't perfect, but this body played a very important role. Now, there were obstacles, challenges. In fact, when you look back on the history over 50 years ago, it was kind of a classic David-and-Goliath story. Let me spend a few minutes going back in time to set the stage for what was happening in Alaska.In 1954, the U.S. Department of the Interior did a health survey on the Native people of Alaska. Here is a quote from that survey: ``The indigenous people of Native Alaska are the victims of sickness, crippling conditions and premature death to a degree exceeded in very few parts of the world. . . . health problems are nearly out of hand. If . . . Americans could see for themselves the large numbers of the tuberculosis, the cripple, the blind . . . the malnourished, the desperately ill among [this] relatively small [Native] population,'' it would have a profound impact on them. And it did. Even in the face of these crippling conditions, the Alaska Native people joined hands, joined hearts and said: This is our land. We need rights to it.They did this by coming together. In the mid-1960s, they formed the Alaska Federation of Natives--AFN, as we call it back home--an entity that is very important to our communities.Of course, the Native people in our State looked for potential allies. In the lower 48, they gave speeches. They wrote columns. They formed their own newspaper, The Tundra Times, edited by legendary Howard Rock, which was highly read throughout the State, celebrated throughout the globe, and had an enormous impact on bringing people together.A few years ago, my team and I combed through some of the hearings that led to ANCSA. It was many years in development. There were field hearings that took place in Alaska in 1968, 1969--3 years before the passage of ANCSA.Incredibly proud and determined first peoples from all over the State--Tlingit, Haida, Athabascan, Inupiat, Yupik, Aleut--travel to Anchorage, to Fairbanks to give their testimony in field hearings to U.S. Senators. Some of them had never even left their villages. Some of them didn't even speak English. Many were veterans--and I am going to talk briefly about that. Dozens and dozens of young men and women, old men and women, all of them testifying before U.S. Senators and Congressmen, telling their stories of how they lived off the land and the rights that they needed for thousands of years on the land.They told stories of strong and resilient people who had been able to thrive in some of the harshest conditions in the planet. But as I mentioned earlier, they also told stories of health challenges. The first AFN president, Emil Notti, who is still a great leader in Alaska, then only 36 years old, spoke with passion at these hearings and heartbreak about the conditions in rural Alaska.He said to a group of Senators in a hearing:The indigenous people of Native Alaska are the victims of sickness, crippling conditions and premature death to a degree exceeded in very few parts of the world.He told the committee then that life expectancy for the average Native Alaskan was 34 years old. This is in the late 1960s. The average life expectancy in the United States at that time was 69--34 years old to 69.Many spoke of how much they had sacrificed for their country. And this is an issue I never tire of talking about. Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in the U.S. military than any other ethnic group in the country. So they are fighting for their country in World War II and Korea and Vietnam, and they are coming home and they are being denied fundamental rights themselves.Here is what Jerome Trigg, a leader and a marine from Nome, had to tell U.S. Senators who were in Alaska. His testimony was said to have brought tears to the eyes of many. He looked at the U.S. Senators and said this: We have showed our patriotism as proudly as any Americans on Earth. We have answered the call of duty with pride in serving in our military. In World War II, we answered the call 100 percent. Every man--old and young--in every village volunteered with the Alaska National Guard.On Vietnam, which was raging at the time, he said: I have never heard of an Alaska Native burning their draft card or our Nation's flag. We love our land, and we will sacrifice and fight to protect it.He concluded with this thought, which I love: ``Sometimes I think the wrong people are running this hearing and taking our testimony,'' he said to the Senators. ``It seems that [maybe] we should be on the bench and you people should be . . . giving [us] the testimony.''I love that--strong words from Marine Jerome Trigg, who had a very important point to make.So many in our communities testified in front of Congress. One happened to be a beautiful, young Alaska Native woman in her thirties from the village of Rampart named Mary Jane Fate, who not only worked on this but came to Washington, DC, to lobby U.S. Senators to pass ANCSA. I had the very great privilege of being the son-in-law of that great Native woman who, unfortunately, passed away recently. That was my mother-in-law, Mary Jane Fate, who came to this body and made sure Senators understood what was happening in Alaska and got them to vote for ANCSA 50 years ago. So here is what it did in a nutshell. As I mentioned, it was the largest indigenous land settlement in the history of the country: 44 million acres of land, almost a billion dollars from the State and Federal Government to transfer land in fee simple--not the reservation system like you have in the lower 48, which was a huge innovation at the time. They own this land. It is theirs. It is not held in trust by the United States like it is in the lower 48 on Indian reservations.Congress mandated the creation of for-profit Alaska Native corporations solely owned by Alaska Native shareholders. Twelve of these regional corporations and 200 village ANCs were created by the Congress. Sometimes people talk about ANCs as if they were some foreign entity. They were actually created right here 50 years ago.What did all of this do? It provided economic opportunity. These were not typical entities, but they were more than just corporations. They were kind of a combination: social, cultural, economic. They passed on the values to the different shareholders. One of the great things about ANCSA was that it required, actually, the sharing of revenues. Some of these regional corporations did very well; others didn't. There were provisions early on that said, if these corporations are doing great and these aren't, there is going to be some sharing. It was called the 7(i) provision. These provisions have been critical to the survival of ANCs, which regional ANCs at times, as I mentioned, were receiving more revenue than others.So that day 50 years ago--December 18, 1971--was really an important day for our State. How has it worked out? It has worked out well, but, of course, we always have more work to do.Over the last 50 years, the Alaska Native people have managed their lands to foster sustainable businesses, created employment opportunities for all people--Native and non-Native--in Alaska, across the country, and across the globe. They have become the heart and soul of our economy in Alaska, employing thousands of both Alaska Native and non-Native people. And they have prospered with their own initiative and with innovative approaches to fostering economic development through self-determination. And beyond the economic benefits, these ANCs, these groupings, these shareholders in these Alaska Native entities created right here on this floor, provided benefits in terms of culture, language revitalization, scholarships, burials, funeral assistance, and an enormous focus on education. Over 54,000 individual scholarships were given to younger Alaska Native people. And, importantly, this law, passed by this body, gave the Native people the opportunity to thrive; to continue to live on their land, practice their culture, create leaders throughout the State. In what was once one of the most impoverished places in the country are now, in many areas, strong, dynamic--health, education, housing, food security, and sanitation have all improved immensely.We have a long way to go. There is still a lot of misunderstanding. In Alaska, you have Tribes, Tribal members, you have ANCs, and shareholders. These are the Native people. You have crossover. And sometimes there is a misunderstanding.For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act specifically excluded tens of thousands of Alaska Natives because they were members of an organization that Congress created. My own view was that was outrageous.So that is why we need to keep educating our colleagues here. But overall, this was a story of success, of resilience, of what can happen when you allow people to take charge of their own destiny. It is a story of self-determination and, in many ways, heroism, and it is a story for the ages.I am honored to represent these people, wonderful people--many of whom the leaders are still alive who made this happen 50 years ago--and their children and grandchildren. We have more work to do, but 50 years ago, on December 18, 1971, it was the start of a new, positive, innovative chapter in the history of Alaska. And that is why Senator Murkowski and I wanted to celebrate this very important milestone this afternoon."
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-honors-shari-daugherty-as-alaskan-of-the-week,"WASHINGTON—On the floor of the U.S. Senate yesterday, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) recognized Shari Daugherty, of Homer, who founded “Share the Spirit” back in 1992, a community-driven nonprofit that provides all of the ingredients of a proper Christmas celebration—including a full meal and presents—for less-fortunate families and children. Daugherty is retiring from the program and from her job as a medical biller at South Peninsula Hospital this year, but will be handing on the reins for “Share the Spirit” to a new generation of leaders. Daugherty was recognized as part of Sen. Sullivan’s series, “Alaskan of the Week.”Tribute to Shari Daugherty Mr. President, it is Thursday. The Senate is still very busy here. We have a lot of work to do, as we are all trying to get home for the holidays. And I thought it was still the appropriate time to come down and talk about somebody who is making our State such a great State, somebody who is contributing to the community, somebody who I refer to as our Alaskan of the Week.Now, we have been doing this for, gosh, going on almost 6 years, maybe 5 years. But it is always one of my favorite times of week, even when the speech is late. So I appreciate the majority leader and the Presiding Officer letting us stay open here for one more speech. And I know the pages--I mean, they love the Alaskan of the Week. So this is a little bit of a treat. But I always start this speech with a little bit of an update on what is going on in Alaska. So right now, Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow--that is Point Barrow. That is the northern most community in North America. They haven't seen the sun in nearly a month. The sun went down, and it is not rising again until January 23. So they get a lot of darkness. There are 66 days of darkness. Great people up there. Wonderful people up there. I love it up there.We have had some pretty significant cold spells already. That, for now, doesn't seem to be lifting. It was 40 below 0 in Fairbanks yesterday. In Anchorage, the high was 4 degrees above 0. Forty below is chilly. Tough people throughout the State. Four degrees above is pretty cold for Anchorage.But everybody is excited because Christmas is right around the corner, and it is, of course, a great time to be in Alaska. We do have a place--I was just talking with the Presiding Officer and the majority leader. We have a great community in Interior Alaska called North Pole, AK. Santa actually lives there. We have a city council member in North Pole named Santa Claus, and a reindeer there. And, of course, I am like everybody else here, looking forward to getting home, going to Midnight Mass, eating my special Alaska seafood Newburg, having friends over, and family, of course. And I think we all know we are very fortunate. I, certainly, believe I am a very blessed man.And we are blessed in Alaska because of people like Shari Daugherty, who is our Alaskan of the Week. And so I want to talk a little bit about Shari because what she has done is literally the definition of the Christmas spirit.For the last month, as she has done for the last 30 years, she has been working pretty much around the clock, volunteering her time for the nonprofit Share the Spirit. Share the Spirit--that is the nonprofit that Shari helped found in 1992--30 years. Share the Spirit's mission is to make sure that hundreds of less fortunate families in Homer, AK, her hometown, get all of the ingredients for a proper Christmas dinner and presents for the kids.Share the Spirit--it sounds pretty simple, but, as you can imagine, this is no easy task. And Shari would tell you that it involves so many others in Homer to make sure that the children in the community, who might not otherwise have anything under the tree, can experience the magic of Christmas that every child deserves. So who is Shari, this great volunteer who has been doing incredible work in Homer? Originally from Chico, CA, Shari and her parents moved to Homer when she was in the 10th grade. Her father was a fisherman.And for those of you who have been to Homer or want to come to Homer, I will tell you, it is one of the most stunningly beautiful places in all of America--really, in all of the world. It is known as the ``Halibut Fishing Capital of the World.'' But anyone who goes there falls in love with Homer. It is surrounded by the glistening waters of Kachemak Bay, jagged mountains, glaciers, snowcapped volcanoes, and a great tight-knit community. After college at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Shari moved around a little. But in 1991, she came back home with her daughter. She did so because she had family there in Homer. And even if she didn't, as she put it, she had a whole town full of family in Homer.Now, volunteering was in her blood. She said her mom stressed the importance of giving back to the community since she was a young girl. So she almost immediately joined the Emblem Club. That is the unofficial auxiliary of the Elks. And during one of their first meetings, it was announced that a Christian minister's group that every year provided food and presents for people in the community was actually going to disband.A meeting was called. The talking lasted for a very long time--at such volunteer meetings, that can happen, of course--until Shari finally cut in and said: Hey, guys, we are really burning daylight here. Here is what needs to happen: We need to form a committee, form a plan, form a nonprofit, and get busy--get busy.And as such things go, she and another woman, Norma Foust, were put in charge. And boy, did they make a difference. That year, with Christmas only weeks away, a nonprofit was formed and a fundraiser to organize with the help of a strong community. They put together 57 baskets of food: turkey, stuffing, potato, sugar, salt, eggs, celery, pie crusts, cards with recipes on them--all the fixings for a nice Christmas dinner. And then there were the presents for more than 100 children. There were 220 gifts that first year, 30 years ago.And the program has grown ever since. Hundreds of families each year are referred to Shari's program by social agencies, including food banks and anywhere people go for help. The information is passed on to Shari and the whole Share the Spirit team. Each family is identified by their needs: a family of three, say, with a 4-year-old girl who needs boots and would like a princess costume. They are then assigned a number that goes onto a Christmas decoration and put on one of the numerous trees posted by local businesses in Homer. Homer residents pick up a decoration and buy the presents. It is pretty well organized.And Shari and the volunteers then get busy organizing a huge spaghetti feed to raise the funds, and then they go shopping for the food. A few days before Christmas, the group stages the location, normally at the high school. The presents and the food baskets are then disbursed. As I mentioned, Shari has done this for 30 years--30 years--and throughout the years, many stories and people stand out.This is Alaska. So, of course, this was the year of the huge blizzard. Nobody could drive. So they enlisted a club of snow machine riders to deliver the presents and the food throughout the area.There is the woman who now lives in Pennsylvania, who lived in Homer for a while, with a young child. That child, because of the group, was able to experience Christmas. And now, like clockwork, this woman sends a quarterly donation to Share the Spirit. You see how the spirit is literally being shared all over the country: Alaska, Homer, Pennsylvania.There are many people now adults, some with children of their own, who got help, who got presents because of Share the Spirit and are now regular volunteers. Shari knows of many people who got presents as children because of her group's efforts and decided to stay in Homer, have families of their own, and now help out at Share the Spirit. She said: They decided that this is where they were going to live. This is the town they are going to live in and to contribute to, because this is the place that took care of them when they were young and needed it. Shari is retiring this year from both the program and from her job as a medical biller at South Peninsula Hospital. She will be leaving Share the Spirit in good hands, though: Kelly Glidden, who began volunteering as a sixth grader in 1993; John Adams, who started when he was 8 years old volunteering; and Emmy Olsem Drye, who has been involved in Share the Spirit since she was 3, and who is also Shari's daughter. They will take on the mantle of this great volunteer effort, focused on the Christmas spirit, that Shari started. And there are those who have been there since the beginning: DeeDee Shoultz and Fran Van Sandt.And then there is the great community of Homer--a community that takes care of its own.So thank you, Shari, for all you have done throughout the years--three decades to keep the Christmas spirit alive. Thank you for making our State a much better place, a more generous place, a caring place for all, and touching the lives of so many, and especially for making sure that children in Homer and across Alaska--and really across America--experience the joy and the magic of Christmas. Congratulations, Shari, on being our Alaskan of the Week, and Merry Christmas.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-whitehouse-provision-in-defense-bill-aimed-at-cracking-down-on-pirate-fishing,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today announced passage of their maritime security proposal as part of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which has now cleared Congress and is expected to be signed into law by the President. The senators’ amendment requires the Secretary of the Navy to produce a report on maritime security measures related to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. “As the largest producer of seafood in the nation—roughly sixty percent of American seafood comes from our waters—Alaska is undoubtedly the super power of seafood for our country,” said Sen. Sullivan, honorary co-chair of the Senate Oceans Caucus. “I intend to do all I can to keep it that way, including ensuring that we have an all-of-government effort to crack down on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. This provision will help protect America’s fishing fleet, as well as the seafood industry across the globe, against bad actors, particularly as China continues to use its fishing fleet to project power in the Indo-Pacific and, increasingly, around the world. I look forward to continue working with Senator Whitehouse on pirate fishing and on cleaning up our oceans. Our work together is a model for how two senators, from different sides of the aisle, can work together to get big things done for our nation.”“We need to protect Rhode Island’s hardworking fishing industry by rooting out unfair competition from illegal pirate fishing,” said Sen. Whitehouse, a co-founder of the Senate Oceans Caucus. “I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Sullivan and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to curb illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.”The amendment will require the U.S. Navy to share information about steps taken to support the dissemination of unclassified information and data to regional partners, best practices learned from public-private partnerships, and any new authorities or capabilities needed to support counter-IUU efforts in order to guide future legislative efforts.The legislation builds on maritime security provisions Whitehouse secured in last year’s NDAA. Whitehouse championed measures in the previous defense bill that required the Department of Defense to update Congress on previously enacted measured to combat illegal fishing, directed the Navy to work with the Coast Guard to assess solutions for tracking vessels engaged in unlawful activity at sea, and requested that the Office of Naval Intelligence provide an update on foreign governments using distant-water fishing fleets to undermine American interests. Each year, IUU fishing produces between 11 and 26 million tons of seafood, resulting in global economic losses valued between $10 billion and $23 billion.The bipartisan Senate Oceans Caucus works to find common ground in protecting oceans and coasts. Thanks to the caucus’s leadership, Congress has taken steps to guard against IUU fishing, including ratifying a series of key IUU treaties with partner nations and passing implementing legislation to bring those treaties into effect.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-sullivan-van-hollen-foreign-service-families-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), co-founders of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Service Caucus, announced the passage of their Foreign Service Families Act yesterday as part of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The legislation will help ensure that the Foreign Service is able to attract and retain a world-class diplomatic corps by providing expanded career options and services to eligible family members. For many of these family members, the process of finding employment isn’t easy—frequent moves, language barriers, and limited options pose significant challenges. The legislation will address those issues in order for the Foreign Service to continue to serve the best interests of Americans at home and abroad. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are also original cosponsors of the Foreign Service Families Act.“Our country relies on Foreign Service officers to engage with governments, businesses and individuals around the world, all with the aim of promoting America’s interests, strengthening our national security, and assisting U.S. citizens,” said Sen.Sullivan. “Two ways we can better support our Foreign Service officers is to prioritize their access to State Department opportunities at the conclusion of their service, and also expand private sector employment opportunities for the family members of officers where they serve. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving us one step closer to providing that support and for recognizing the exemplary service of this crucial diplomatic corps.”“America’s Foreign Service is vital to maintaining and advancing American diplomacy around the world. But for Foreign Service families, overseas postings often come with hardships for family members that can take a lasting toll. That's why I’m proud that today – as part of the National Defense Authorization Act – the Senate passed our bipartisan Foreign Service Families Act, to help expand employment opportunities for Foreign Service spouses and ensure in-state tuition benefits for students to help these families succeed and strengthen our Foreign Service across the board. We provide these benefits to military families and this same support should be extended to Foreign Service families serving our country,” said Sen. Van Hollen. “Initiatives like the Foreign Service Families Act help attract and retain our nation’s top talent in the Foreign Service ranks,” said Ambassador Eric Rubin, president of the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), upon introduction. “AFSA strongly supports this effort to ensure that our diplomats and their families are afforded all possible consideration, much like our military counterparts.”“AAFSW (Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide) whole-heartedly supports this bill,” said AAFSW President Lara Center upon introduction. “As an organization which has advocated for spouses since our creation in 1960, we believe this bill will contribute greatly to Foreign Service morale and effectiveness.” “The American Academy of Diplomacy supports the bill, noting that the legislation will help the State Department attract and retain the best personnel overseas where family well-being is critically important to the employees,” said the American Academy of Diplomacy upon introduction.The Foreign Service Families Act would provide authority to the State Department to offer the same services to Foreign Service family members that the Defense Department is permitted to provide to military families.

https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-senate-pass-defense-bill-that-takes-care-of-our-troops-and-makes-america-more-secure,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), voted today to pass the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which would raise the Department of Defense’s (DOD) budget by $25 billion beyond President Joe Biden’s defense budget proposal, a level consistent with the recommendations of the National Defense Strategy Commission, and includes numerous Arctic and Alaska priorities championed by Sullivan. The bill now goes to the President’s desk for his signature.“Republicans and Democrats in Congress today soundly rejected Joe Biden’s dangerous, dead-last prioritization of the U.S. military, passing an authorization that robustly invests in our nation’s defense and provides our troops with the resources they need to fulfill a wide array of critical missions,” said Sen. Sullivan. “We were also able to work on a bipartisan basis to remove provisions championed by far-left members of the House and the President that sought to conduct social engineering experiments in our military ranks and detract from the readiness and lethality of our fighting force. This NDAA also invests heavily in defense technologies and weapons that will help us keep pace with our adversaries, like Russia and China, as they continue to threaten democracies and upend the global rules-based order. “Additionally, this NDAA includes numerous provisions for Alaska, including approximately $155 million dollars for military construction, and a new Arctic Security Initiative I authored that will, at long last, ensure the Arctic is properly resourced and integrated into our larger defense strategy—where it belongs. The independent assessment this initiative requires will ultimately mean more focus, personnel, vessels, infrastructure, aircraft and investment being directed to America’s Arctic—to Alaska—in defense of our nation’s interests in this critically-important region. With my provision in last year’s NDAA to establish the Ted Stevens Center, which the DOD recently announced will be headquartered in Anchorage, and my Arctic Security Initiative in this year’s NDAA, Alaska has rightfully become the critical focal point for Arctic security endeavors for America and our allies throughout the world.” Congress has historically only authorized two region-specific security initiatives—the European Deterrence Initiative in 2014, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) in 2021, following China’s militarization of the South China Sea and other provocative actions in Asia. Sen. Sullivan was able to include a provision authorizing the secretary of defense to establish a third such initiative in the FY 2022 NDAA—the Arctic Security Initiative (ASI), which features a five-year plan to fully resource the DOD’s and individual service-specific strategies for the Arctic that have been released over the past several years.“Finally, after years of advocacy, this year’s NDAA includes legislation I’ve introduced to maximize interagency collaboration and capacity between the Defense Health and Veterans Health Agencies, authorizing the secretary of defense and the secretary of veterans affairs to enter into agreements for the planning, design, and construction of facilities to be operated as shared federal medical facilities,” said Sen. Sullivan. “This is critically important in states, like Alaska, where there is no full-service VA hospital and more than forty percent of residents are federal health care beneficiaries.”“As the senior Republican on the Subcommittee on Readiness, Sen. Sullivan has fought to make sure our military is prepared for any threat that comes our way—whether in the Indo-Pacific or the Arctic. That includes making sure the Department of Defense has the budget it needs to take care of our troops and defend the country and that those resources are going to the right places,” said SASC Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). “I’m proud to have worked with him to make this National Defense Authorization Act a strong, bipartisan bill that will make our country more secure.”In addition to authorizing the ASI, the FY 2022 NDAA:# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/commerce-committee-advances-sullivans-visit-america-act-in-tourism-omnibus,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, today thanked his committee colleagues for advancing his Visit America Act as part of the larger Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act of 2021. The bill would set a visitation goal of 116 million annual international travelers to the United States by 2028, formally authorize the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, and create a high-ranking position within the Department of Commerce focused on bolstering America’s travel and tourism industry and coordinating a strategy across multiple federal agencies. The Visit America Act would also require the development and implementation of a strategy to assist the travel and tourism industry to quickly recover from the COVID–19 pandemic. Original cosponsors of the Visit America Act include Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Angus King (I-Maine), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). “Travel and tourism are critical engines of our national economy, supporting millions of jobs and generating billions of dollars for communities across the country, including in Alaska. Those jobs and revenues were absolutely decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and many have still not returned,” said Sullivan. “In order to realize a full recovery from the pandemic, the tourism industry—like other major economic sectors—deserves an advocate at the highest levels of the federal government to coordinate a whole-of-government strategy. This is an idea my team and I came up with five years ago, and I appreciate Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Wicker, and my committee colleagues for incorporating the Visit America Act into the committee’s bipartisan ‘Tour Bus’ package. I am hopeful we can get this legislation to the President’s desk soon and support the hard-working small business owners in the travel and tourism economy.” The United States is the only member of the G20 international economic forum that does not have a high-ranking official focused on the tourism sector. Most G20 nations have a minister or secretary at the cabinet level.In addition to the Visit America Act, the Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act includes:# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech-fy-2022-national-defense-authorization-act,"Mr. President, I want to come down to the Senate floor and commend a number of Senators, but I want to particularly commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Reed, and the ranking member, Senator Inhofe, and their staff, and all the staff on the Armed Services Committee for the exceptional work they have done over the last several months to produce the strong National Defense Authorization Act that just passed in a very strong bipartisan vote here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.That vote was 88 to 11. I think it is a prime example of something that I mention a lot back home; and that is that there is a lot more bipartisan work that gets done here in the Senate that isn't often recognized, and there is nothing more important than having Senators from both sides of the aisle come together with regard to national defense and supporting our troops and their families. We have been doing that over 60 years in a row, where we have passed the National Defense Authorization Act--one of the most important bills that comes to the floor of the Senate and the House and the Congress. And, once again, we have passed it. And I think Chairman Reed and Senator Inhofe--Ranking Member Inhofe--deserve a lot of the credit.So I just want to touch on a couple of the key provisions here, a lot of what was in it, and then mention a few things. A lot of times it is important to recognize, actually, what is not in a bill because that can be just as important as what is in it.But I would start with the No. 1 issue here, and it is the top-line budget increase for the Department of Defense.I have been outspoken on the disappointment and damage that President Biden's budget, which he proposed, with regard to the Pentagon, supported, unfortunately, by many here--the majority leader, the budget chairman--that that was unacceptable--unacceptable. Why was it unacceptable? Because our Nation is facing many threats right now. Just read the paper every day--China, Russia, Iran. Yet that budget that was actually provided by the White House was a cut--a pretty dramatic cut--if you look at it as adjusted for inflation.The Armed Services Committees in the Senate and in the House thoroughly rejected the Biden budget to cut defense spending. We have in this bill a 3-percent real increase. That is a little over $25 billion. This amendment, which I cosponsored with Senator Inhofe and others, to increase our defense spending, when it came to a vote in the committee, every Senator on the Armed Services Committee voted for it, with the exception of one. That is about as bipartisan as it gets. There are many important things in this bill in terms of the significant increase to the top-line budget, but readiness, in my view, of our military is one of the most important things we do here as U.S. Senators, and now is certainly not the time to cut defense spending. I think today's vote was a strong bipartisan showing that this body does not agree with the Biden budget, and that was one really important aspect of today's NDAA.Second, I want to talk a little bit about the great State of Alaska and its role in our military and some of the provisions in this bill that relate to Arctic security.I like to say that Alaska constitutes three pillars of America's military might. We are the cornerstone of missile defense. Almost all the radar systems and all the ground-based missile interceptors protecting the whole country are located in Alaska.We are the hub of air combat power for the Arctic and Asia Pacific. By the end of this year, we will have over 100 fifth-generation fighters--combat-coded, fifth-gen fighters. That is F-35s, F-22s, stationed in Alaska--over 100. There is no place on the planet Earth that has over 100 fifth-generation fighters. Supersonic stealth can get anywhere--anywhere--very quickly: Russia, China, Taiwan. That is another area of Alaska's pillars of military might. And, finally, we are a platform for expeditionary forces, the 4-25, the only airborne brigade combat team in the entire Asia Pacific; the First Striker Brigade; and many others that can get to places all over the world, because of our strategic location, very quickly, and also because of our strategic airlift in Alaska.But this NDAA is going to add another element of Alaska's military might to our Nation, and that is the center of gravity for America's Arctic security operations.Last year in the NDAA, we were able to get the first and only and much needed Department of Defense Center for Arctic Security. The Department of Defense named it the Ted Stevens, after the great, late Senator. The Center for Arctic Security is going to be in Anchorage, AK.And now, in this year's NDAA, we have what is called the Arctic Security Initiative. I was honored to cosponsor that with my good friend Senator King from Maine. And this gets the Pentagon to focus on a 5-year strengthening of our national security in the Arctic region. As you know, that is becoming an area of great power competition, and America has very strong, strategic national security and economic security interests in the Arctic. And this NDAA will cement not just the Arctic as an important national security imperative of our country but Alaska as the focal point for Arctic security endeavors for the United States and our allies.The other element here in the NDAA which is so important, of course, is taking care of our troops and their families. This bill authorizes a pay raise of almost 3 percent for both military members and Department of Defense civilians. It has numerous initiatives relating to military health and housing leave policies. One that I was proud to get into this bill is an important provision that allows the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration to do facility sharing.What does that mean? It enables both the Pentagon and the VA to work on agreements to plan, design, and construct facilities to operate as VA and DOD shared medical facilities. That is going to help with readiness. That is going to help train our young Active-Duty medical forces. It is going to help with taking care of our veterans. And it is going to save money. These are the kinds of provisions that we need. They are win-win-win between the VA and our veterans and the Active-Duty and Reserve forces that also need healthcare. And we are looking forward to taking advantage of that in Alaska and in other places in the country.As I said at the outset, oftentimes what is not in a bill is as important as what is in a bill, and some of our Members--some of the far-left Members of the House--tried to plug into the NDAA--and they did so over in the House--a number of bills that really didn't have a lot to do with the military, but they were trying to move forward on a far-left agenda that they tried to attach in the NDAA.Ironically, many of these Members really have no intention of ever voting for a strong NDAA, but they tried to plug things in, in the House bill. They did that in the House bill, but we were able to get rid of pretty much all of those--again, things like red flag laws that would confiscate firearms without due process. There is another provision that I am really glad was not in there. There has been this narrative on the far left that somehow the men and women of our military--that our military institutions--are filled with a bunch of extremists. There are news reports that say this. None of it is based on data. None of it is based on data. And I have been pressing officials, saying: Give me data. You make these charges, which I dislike. I happen to know many, many members of the military. They are some of the finest people in the country.So we were able to get rid of some of the provisions in the House bill that--one was going to set up an office in the Pentagon on essentially trying to, in my view, do witch hunts on so-called extremists. It is an issue that the Pentagon needs to come up with data on and not make these false charges.So, overall, this is a good day for our troops, for their families, for the Senate. It is a very bipartisan bill, with people coming together--Democrats and Republicans--on, in my view, one of the most important issues, if not the most important issue, we deal with here in the Congress: the national security of our Nation; keeping a strong, lethal military.And when we do that, like we did today, that also sends a message to our adversaries: The United States, despite some challenges, still has the best, most lethal military force in the world, the most professional military force in the world. And this bill is going to help enhance that, and our adversaries need to take notice. I yield the floor."
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech-ninth-circuit-nominees,"Madam President, this week, the Senate is going to take up three Ninth Circuit judges, three Federal judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And in the process, the Biden administration is going to smash an institutional and constitutional norm between the executive and legislative branches, particularly the executive branch, the White House, and the U.S. Senate that every U.S. Senator--all 100 of us--should be concerned about.Let me explain. This is a really important issue.Article II, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution says the following:[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.Now, that includes Federal circuit court judges, Throughout this, article II, section 2, provision of the Constitution, it says: ``[W]ith the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' We are ``of the Senate,'' right here. And this week, we will be voting on three U.S. court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Now, this provision in the Constitution, like so many which gives the U.S. Senate the exclusive right for the advice and consent power, was the result of compromise.If you look at the history in Federalist Nos. 75 and 76, Alexander Hamilton argued that this provision afforded a necessary means of checks and balances against the executive branch, against the President.The Constitution--according to the U.S. Senate history that I am quoting from--``also provides that the Senate shall have the power to accept or reject presidential appointees to the executive and judicial branches.'' This was born of compromise, as I mentioned:In debating the issue, the framers addressed concerns that entrusting the appointment power exclusively to the president would encourage monarchial tendencies. Additionally, as the Senate was to represent each state equally, its role--The advice and consent role in the Constitution--offered security to the small states, whose delegates feared they would be overwhelmed by appointees sympathetic to larger states.For these reasons, since I have been in the U.S. Senate, I have taken this advice and consent role very seriously for all nominees: during the Obama administration, when I was here for the last 2 years of that administration; all of the Trump administration; and now the Biden administration.And as you can imagine, whenever I have asked for a meeting of any nominee so I could meet with them under this constitutional provision for a Senate-confirmed position, every single administration I have dealt with--the three I just named--has said: Of course, Senator. That is your constitutional role. Of course you should meet with them.Why is that? Why has every White House said yes?Because, as I just mentioned, they know that that is literally our constitutional role, as I just mentioned. So every time I have asked for one of these meetings for a Senate-confirmed nominee of any administration, it has always been granted, until today--until today.As I said, the Senate's business--a lot of the business this week is actually going to be focused on the advice and consent constitutional role that we have, especially as it relates to judges. But I have been told by this White House, specifically the White House Counsel, I guess--to be honest, it is often difficult to figure out who is in charge over there--that I can't meet with any of these Ninth Circuit judges that we are going to vote on this week before the vote.This is a shocking breach of constitutional norms between the White House and the Senate that every Senator here--every Senator, regardless of party--should be concerned about. Why? As I mentioned, the advice and consent role is really important for every Senate-confirmed position, mandated by the U.S. Constitution, but it is particularly important for judges--judges who will get life tenure. By the end of this week, it is likely that these three Ninth Circuit judges will be on the bench for the rest of their lives, and right now I can't get a 1-hour meeting with them.They have enormous power over American citizens. And I am going to talk about the Ninth Circuit and the power it has over my citizens.So my experience as a Senator is that I meet with as many judges as possible, and whenever I have requested a meeting of any administration to meet with a judge, it has always been granted. But I always, always, always meet with the Ninth Circuit judges.As I mentioned, until now, I had interviewed every single Ninth Circuit judge that this body has voted on for the last 7 years--every single one--during my entire time in the Senate.Why is it so important to me?Why is it so important to everybody? Well, specifically, as it relates to the Ninth Circuit, if you can look at this map, as many Americans know, our Federal court systems are divided into what are called circuits. The Ninth Circuit, which is this dark brown, is the biggest Federal court of appeals in the country. It is huge. Look at all the States that are under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit: California, Idaho, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Alaska, Hawaii. It is enormous. Almost one in five Americans are under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit. It has enormous power, especially over my constituents in the great State of Alaska.But here is the thing. If you look at the number of judges that each Circuit Court gets, another reason why the Ninth Circuit is so important and so powerful is that it gets an enormous number of judges. The Ninth Circuit is listed here on the far left. Out of 29 active judges, one judge comes from the great State of Alaska. One judge comes from the great State of Alaska. So, as you can imagine, discussing legal issues with any judge from the Ninth Circuit is very important to me and, more importantly, to the people I represent.Here is something else about the Ninth Circuit. On so many issues that matter to my constituents, the court gets the legal issues wrong. The court gets the legal issues wrong. Now, I have seen this firsthand. Almost 25 years ago, I had the honor of being a Ninth Circuit law clerk for the only Ninth Circuit judge we have in Alaska, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a phenomenal judge. I watched panel after panel in the Ninth Circuit get cases related to the great State of Alaska wrong. Now, look. In some ways it is not their fault. Yes, they had different views and a legal outlook. But if you are a judge and you grew up in LA and all you know is LA and California laws, and now you are a Ninth Circuit judge and you are supposed to rule on all these Alaska-specific Federal laws, you really don't know what you are doing. You don't really know what you are doing, and I saw that as a young lawyer. But don't take my word for it. In the last 4 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken up three specific Alaska cases, two of which were from the Ninth Circuit and one of which was from the DC Circuit. These big, important circuits all got them wrong. They are cases that would have changed the history and future of my State.So when I meet with nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it is usually always very cordial. I walk them through a lot of issues, legal issues of which they know very little about--again, not their fault--and to explain why these are so important to the people I represent.Again, if you are an LA lawyer or a lawyer from Phoenix, you don't know about Native Alaskan law. You don't know about the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act, called ANILCA--a Federal law, 1,000 pages--that the U.S. Supreme Court, in the last 3 years, twice smacked down the Ninth Circuit, 9 to 0--9 to 0--because the Ninth Circuit continually gets these Alaska-focused statutes wrong.So I walk them through these issues. That is all I do. It is not a big deal. It is actually trying to help the judges. I think every Ninth Circuit judge I have met with appreciates it. Let me give you a couple of examples of what I would do if I could meet with these judges.Like I said, ANILCA, or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, is a hugely important Federal law that was passed in 1980. We didn't want it, by the way. It federalized almost 100 million acres of land in Alaska. Imagine that. Most States aren't even as big as 100 million acres. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 in favor of a moose hunter who wanted access to Federal land. His name is John Sturgeon. He is a very famous Alaskan right now.It went back to the Ninth Circuit. They misinterpreted it. It went back up to the U.S. Supreme Court--9-zip--they smacked it down again.Justice Kagan, who wrote the second opinion, said: ``If [John] Sturgeon lived in any other State, his [law]suit would not have [had] a prayer of success. . . . Except that Sturgeon lives in Alaska. And as we [the U.S. Supreme Court] have said before, `Alaska is often the exception, not the rule,' '' when it comes to these kind of Federal laws in Federal parks. Do you think it would be good to have a Ninth Circuit judge getting ready to get on the court to understand the Sturgeon case? It would be. So that is what I do. I have the judges read Sturgeon. I have them read other cases. It is all advice and consent. It is our constitutional role. Until today, I have done it with every Ninth Circuit judge.Like I said, I was over at the White House on Friday, really kind of banging the table on the Biden administration's war on Alaska. Some of you may have seen a speech I gave last week. There are 20 Executive orders and Executive actions singularly focused on my great State--20--crushing working families.And I said: You know, one thing I would like to do is continue my record of meeting with every Ninth Circuit judge. I am available Sunday, Sunday night, all day Monday. Give me a call. I haven't heard anything back.Something else I do with these judges when they come before me is I talk about Indian law. Now a lot of lawyers think, ``Hey, I really know Indian law well.'' And my advice and counsel in the advice-and-consent process, when it comes to Indian law in Alaska, is ``If you think you are an expert, throw out everything you know about lower 48 Indian law when it comes to Alaskan Indian law. The Native Alaskan law, in Alaska--the Federal law--is 100 percent different than it is in the lower 48. This is just advice I give judges who are going on the Ninth Circuit. They don't know this. An LA lawyer doesn't know this.This week, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Congress's passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, what we call in Alaska ANCSA, the largest settlement of indigenous land claims, certainly, in America, and probably in the world. It is a really successful act, not perfect, very innovative. But it has been litigated like crazy.We had a case from the Ninth Circuit several years ago that essentially said: ANCSA created reservation land throughout the entire State of Alaska.That would have changed the history of Alaska forever. Of course, the Ninth Circuit got it wrong. That case went up to the Supreme Court. Nine-zip, the Supreme Court smacked down the Ninth Circuit. They said: ANCSA doesn't do that. That is not what Congress intended.Do you think it would be good for these judges this week, if I could sit down with them, to understand that? It would be really good, really important. It would help them for their job.Just this year, the DC Circuit on another ANCSA-related case, the Chehalis case, got ANCSA wrong again. And guess what. It went up to the U.S. Supreme Court again. They just ruled on it 4 months ago. It was a huge victory for my State, again.We wrote an amicus brief--Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young, and I. But it was enormously important. This wrong case of the DC Circuit would have changed the history of Alaska forever. The Supreme Court, 6 to 3, said: No, you are misinterpreting Alaska.Do you think these judges on the Ninth Circuit who we are debating to confirm this week would learn a little bit about that if I could meet with them? They would.Finally, the other thing I always do with circuit judges is I talk about the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is really, really important to the people I represent. We use firearms for food, for self-defense in the wild. Well over 60 percent of all the homes in my State have firearms for these reasons.If you are an LA lawyer, you don't know this stuff. But, all of a sudden, you are going to be ruling on cases that deal with Alaska or Idaho or Montana. And here is the thing: They might not know these issues, these judges. I have looked at their background. I wanted to interview them. Remarkably, I can't get an interview with them. And here is the thing: As soon as they get confirmed, they are going to get these cases before them, in my State and other States, to rule on these kinds of issues.Do you think a meeting would help them? “Boy, I should really think about that. I remember Senator Sullivan talked about ANILCA and the Sturgeon case. I am really glad I read the Sturgeon case.” This is why these advice-and-consent constitutional meetings are so important. And, as I mentioned, I have been doing this my entire time in the Senate. I have never not had a meeting with a Ninth Circuit judge. It doesn't matter where they are from--Montana, Arizona, Washington State. They are going to rule on issues that relate to my State and my constituents. And these judges don't mind it. They actually, I think, enjoy it. They learn. But this White House says: You can't meet with them.This is absurd. Here is the question: What are they hiding?What are they worried about? Are they hiding something? Are the judges hiding something? Again, this is a precedent that Democrats and Republicans should all be against, because we know what goes around comes around in this body. And this just doesn't make sense.All three of these Ninth Circuit judges will have life tenure and enormous, enormous power over everybody in the Ninth Circuit. That is 20 percent of all Americans, and, certainly, enormous power over the people in Alaska, whom I am privileged to serve and represent. These judges are likely to know very little about these issues that I just talked about. Well, I believe I have a constitutional role to help them understand these issues better, and that is the way it has always been. Nobody has complained.Absurdly, the White House has said: Well, Senator Sullivan, you can meet with a Ninth Circuit judge if they are from Alaska.What? We have one judge, and she is not going to be retiring any time soon. That is it. Now, here is the thing. I just talked to the previous administration's White House counsel this morning, when I called the Biden administration's counsel this morning. I am still waiting for that phone call, by the way, because I said: Look, if the White House Counsel is saying no to a U.S. Senator to do his constitutional duty, I would like to hear it directly from her. So she hasn't called me back yet. But I talked to the previous administration's White House Counsel, and I asked: By the way, did you guys do this? I am just double-checking. I mean, I got to meet with all the Ninth Circuit judges President Trump put forward. But did you blackball Democrats? Did you do that?And they said: Absolutely not.I made a few phone calls to other people in the White House Counsel's office. They said: To the contrary, when any Senator wanted to meet with any circuit judge, we always made it happen.So this is a new precedent. And, again, it doesn't matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat. This is just a bad precedent.And the notion that ``Well, Senator, you get to meet with a Ninth Circuit judge from Alaska,'' when, by the way, California, I think, has close to 20 Ninth Circuit judges--but the notion that you can only meet with the one who is from your State is actually moronic. The people who need to be educated are the ones who aren't from your State, because they are all going to rule on issues from your State.So I am still waiting for the White House Counsel to call me back--or whoever is in charge in the White House. But I am going to conclude with this. I am going to go around them. I am going to go around them. Here is what I am going to do, and I hope someone is watching from the White House. But, more importantly, I hope someone is watching from the judge's chambers.So, Judge Koh, we are getting ready to vote on your nomination tonight.Judge Sung of Oregon, we are getting ready to vote on your nomination tomorrow. Judge Sanchez of California, the rumor is, the majority leader is going to file cloture on your nomination.Those are three Ninth Circuit judges.Judge Holly Thomas of California, you might get voted on this week too. Four.Here is my ask: Give me a call. Give me a call. Give my office a call. I will meet with you tonight. Let's do a phone call. Do you want to learn about ANILCA? Do you want to learn about the Sturgeon case? It will make you a better Ninth Circuit judge. Here is the number: (202) 224-1026. Give my office a call. I am ready to meet anytime. Here is the thing for the judges: It is 1 hour of your time. You are going to have lifetime tenure. It is 1 hour to talk to a U.S. Senator who is doing his constitutional duty for the people he represents. It shouldn't be that hard. As a matter of fact, this is probably your first test of judicial independence. A U.S. Senator of the Senate--of the Senate; read the Constitution--wants to undertake his advice and consent, his constitutional role, with you, OK?You guys have read the Constitution, those four judges I just mentioned, but an unelected bureaucrat in the White House--I guess the White House Counsel, but who the heck knows; it is hard to tell who is in charge over there--is blocking this. So, again, give my office a call at (202) 224-1026. I am ready to meet and talk to you anytime before the vote. Don't worry--I don't think President Biden is going to yank your nomination if you call me. Heck, he probably doesn't even know this is going on. But you know this is the right thing to do, Judges. You have read the Constitution. Heck, if our meeting goes well, I might even vote for you.But here is the thing: You will learn more about the issues that you are going to have to deal with very soon in your tenure that you probably don't know anything about--no offense to you. I have read your backgrounds. You don't know anything about Native Alaskan law. You don't know anything about ANILCA. You probably have very different views than I and my constituents do on the Second Amendment. But you need to hear these issues because you are going to be life-tenured on the Ninth Circuit, and you don't have time to talk to me, a U.S. Senator, who is a Senator representing a State from the Ninth Circuit? You know it is wrong.By the way, my colleagues in the Senate know it is wrong. So I hope my Democratic and Republican colleagues realize that this is not a good precedent. This is not a good precedent. It has never happened as long as I have been here.You know, from big things to small things, this administration has really focused in many ways on smashing political and institutional norms that have enjoyed strong bipartisan support. It is not good for this body, and it is not good for the government. The Wall Street Journal, today, had an article about Biden's Federal regulators staging a coup against the Director of the FDIC on bank mergers. One of these regulators doesn't even have the power over bank mergers, and now he is trying to be in charge.I serve on the U.S. Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. It is a huge honor. The President comes in, President Biden, and fires everybody on the service academies who was appointed by President Trump. Nobody has ever done that before--no President. Everybody on the Board of Visitors of the Naval Academy is furious--the Democrats, the Republicans. The No. 1 thing they are saying is, this President is the first one to politicize the service academies. Then, oh, by the way, he hasn't appointed anyone yet to replace the people he fired, so we didn't have a quorum for our meeting last week.He is just smashing institutional norms. Yet this institutional norm of advice and consent, when it comes to circuit court judges with life tenure, is something that we have all agreed upon. The previous administration certainly allowed for it. Yet, right now, I can't meet with Ninth Circuit judges who are going to have enormous power for their entire lives over my constituents. So, to my colleagues, we shouldn't allow this. You guys know it is wrong.To the judges--like I said, Judge Sanchez, Judge Koh, Judge Sung, Judge Thomas--give my office a call. Do the right thing. Your first test of judicial independence is before you of the Senate. The U.S. Senate--of the Senate, of which I am a part--wants to do our constitutional role. Give us a call so we can do it. Ignore the very bad advice you are getting from the White House Counsel or whoever is in charge over there.I yield the floor. "
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-historic-inflation-increase-and-5-trillion-cbo-price-tag-for-build-back-better-should-kill-bidens-socialist-agenda-save-christmas,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) issued the following statement in response to the Labor Department’s announcement today that U.S. inflation hit a 39-year annualized high of 6.8% at the end of October, and the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment released today that President Joe Biden’s so-called “Build Back Better” legislation would cost $4.9 trillion and add $3 trillion to the national debt—rebutting the administration’s absurd claim that the bill will cost “zero.” Sen. Sullivan says the inflation increase is largely a result of the Biden administration’s far left policies and would only be further exacerbated by the $4.9 trillion reconciliation bill recently passed in the House and currently being considered in the Senate. “The inflation numbers announced today are a lump of coal in every American’s stocking this Christmas,” said Sen. Sullivan. “This shocking increase in inflation just makes more evident what we already know—this administration’s war on affordable energy, coupled with the out-of-control spending being pushed by President Biden and the radical far left in Congress, is inflicting real pain on America’s working families, who are paying much more for their holiday presents, and at the gas pump, grocery store, and to heat their homes this winter. Enough is enough. These inflation numbers should be the final nail in the coffin of the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, which would pump trillions more in wasteful deficit spending to fund a liberal wish-list. Let’s be clear: Despite the Democrats’ incredible claim that their socialist tax-and-spending bill costs ‘zero’ dollars, the President’s plan will super-charge inflation even more and do real, lasting damage to our economy. Building back to the Jimmy Carter malaise of the 1970s is not what any American wants and is definitely not what our nation needs.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-requests-ig-investigation-of-senior-biden-interior-officials-targeting-alaska,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, yesterday sent a letter to the inspector general (IG) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) requesting an investigation of four senior political appointees in the department who are allegedly working on matters directly related to and benefitting their previous clients and work. The officials mentioned by Sen. Sullivan are Nada Culver, deputy director of policy and programs at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Natalie Landreth, deputy solicitor for lands at DOI; Laura Daniel Davis, deputy assistant secretary for land and mineral management at DOI; and Robert Anderson, solicitor at DOI. In his letter, Sullivan alleges that the officials have clear conflicts of interest, violating federal ethics laws, having worked to halt certain resource development projects in Alaska in their prior positions with environmental advocacy groups, and subsequently working to halt those same projects as executive branch employees.The Alaska projects described include the Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska (NPR-A), the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) oil and gas leasing program, and the Ambler Road project—all projects that have been slowed or stopped by the Biden administration DOI.In addition to requesting the ethics investigation, Sen. Sullivan has requested a series of documents, within 30 days, from the DOI IG, including signed and dated ethics pledges for each official, recusals or ethics waivers issued by or to any of the officials, and any communications between the DOI officials and their former employers or clients since their appointments.Sen. Sullivan announced his letter in a speech on the Senate floor last night. In his remarks, Sullivan decried an ongoing “anti-Alaska agenda” and “war on Alaska working families” by the Biden administration through its issuance of 20 executive orders and actions specifically focused on the state since coming into office in January. Sullivan also criticized Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) for leading efforts among members of Congress to block investment and projects in Alaska, while New Mexico has received nearly half of all drilling permits approved nationwide on federal lands in the past year.Below is a full transcript of the senator’s floor speech:Madam President, today, I wanted to rise on the Senate floor and talk about a topic of utmost importance to my State, the great people I have the privilege of representing, and what the Biden administration is doing to good, hard?working American families in Alaska. It is what I call the “anti?Alaska agenda,” or the Biden administration's war on working families. I know that Americans all across the country have felt pain—economic pain, health pain, unfortunately, too many deaths as a result of the pandemic. Right now, we are seeing high energy prices and empty shelves. There has been a lot of suffering in America. We are a resilient people, however.  My State, like many, has been hit very hard by the pandemic, particularly economically—our energy sector, our fishing sector, our tourism sector. And as we are coming out of this pandemic and everybody is trying to work together—we all want growth and opportunity in America—we have now been hit with this.This administration has issued, in its first 9 months in office, 20 Executive orders or Executive actions solely focused on Alaska. I came down to the floor 2 weeks ago to talk about this. It was 19 then. You wait a week or two with the Biden administration in Alaska, and it is up to 20. I am sure they have a lot more ready to go. Twenty. There is no State in America that is getting this kind of attention from the Biden administration, and we don't want it.  What I am going to be continuing to ask my Senate colleagues to do—and I am going to start with the President of the United States, who was a U.S. Senator for many years, decades—put yourself in the shoes of the people I represent.  Let's imagine that a Republican administration comes into office and issues 20 Executive orders or Executive actions focused on Delaware—tiny, little Delaware. The Senators from Delaware, including the former Senator, now?President, would be down on the floor of the U.S. Senate raising Cain, raising heck—I don't think I am allowed to swear here—because of this, because they want to stick up for the people they represent. Imagine that.  These Executive orders and actions are not some kind of simple abstractions; they are 20 orders and actions that go to the heart of what Alaskans do in terms of our economy: work, keeping food on the table, keeping lights on in their homes, paying the mortgage, keeping their kids in college, keeping their cultures thriving, keeping our communities from crumbling, particularly in rural Alaska. Some of the poorest communities in America are where this administration is targeting the people I represent.  Very few people in my State—Democrat, Republican, Native, non?Native—support this war against Alaska. This is not a partisan issue back home, and here is why: because real people, real families, real communities are being hurt—your fellow Americans. It has got to stop.I have demanded a meeting with the President and his team to just walk him through this. Mr. President, do you know what you are doing to one of your States that you are sworn to defend?  These orders threaten the well?being of my entire State, but they particularly threaten the people who live in rural Alaska, who are dependent on the land and natural resources for so much of their economy, so much of their tax base.Here is the thing. I know what some of my colleagues or those who are watching are saying: Oh, it is just resource development issues in Alaska. Well, I will talk about that. It is some of that, but it is not just resource development issues that are happening here. Let me give you one that really burns me up.We had a bipartisan bill last year, last Congress, to provide what you will now call racial justice, racial equity, to Alaskan Native Vietnam veterans who served their country when most Americans were avoiding service and missed out, because they were overseas fighting for their nation, on the opportunity to apply for what is called a land allotment. There was a deadline that happened, a complete injustice.Native Vietnam veterans coming home, not treated well because they are Native, not treated well because they are Vietnam veterans, and then told: “Oh, by the way, the land you were supposed to get, you don't qualify.”So we got a bill passed to say that is an injustice. The previous administration signed it. They were implementing it. And when this administration came into office, the number one issue I asked Secretary Haaland to commit to was to finish getting the Executive order out on these land allotments, to implement this bipartisan bill, because these Native Vietnam veterans aren't living that long.The administration delayed it for 2 years. Why? It has nothing do to with oil and gas or mining. Why? These Vietnam vets, many aren't going to live for 2 more years. They did it anyway. That is one of 20. Let me give you another one.We have had, down in Southeast Alaska, the issue of the Tongass—that is the largest national forest in the country. Every elected official—Governor, Senator, Democrat, Republican—in Alaska, the last 30 years, has pressed with the Roadless Rule, an exemption to the Roadless Rule, so we can have an economy there; roads for Southeast communities. Every elected Governor or U.S. Senator, didn’t matter the party, that is how important this was. We were able to get an exemption in the last administration. I appreciate what President Trump did on that.This administration comes in, and they reverse it. One of the 20. Guess how we, the Alaska delegation, found out about that reversal. A front?page story in the Washington Post. The Secretary of Agriculture wanted to brief the Washington Post and all of the extreme environmental groups who wanted this before they let the people of Alaska or their representatives know. These are the examples. And, yes, the list also includes resource development projects. But here is the thing on that—I have a folder full of letters. These are letters from the elected leaders, Tribal leaders, borough leaders, Alaska Native Corp. leaders, Native leaders in my State—dozens of letters. Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, Native village of Kaktovik—that is a Tribe, City of Utqiagvik, City of Atqasuk, City of Wainwright, Inupiaq Community of the Arctic Slope—that is another Tribe, the Voice of the Inupiat Arctic. These are all Alaskan Native leaders who live on the North Slope, some of whom live in the Arctic National Wildlife area. Every single one of these great leaders in my State, every one, was writing, even begging, this administration not to do this—not to do this. And they ignored them. This is a letter from Edward Rexford. He is the President of the Native Village of Kaktovik. He wrote to Secretary Deb Haaland after she suspended oil and gas leases in ANWR, which we passed. What the Secretary did, in my view, was clearly illegal. Edward Rexford wrote: “You have changed our future with one stroke of a pen without any explanation or consultation with us—the tribe that lives within the Coastal Plain.”His village, Kaktovik, is the only village within the coastal area of ANWR. That is it. There is no group of Americans who should have a greater voice in the development of this area than them. But they didn't even get a phone call—not a phone call, not a consultation, Tribal consultation, which is required by law—none of it.That is all part of the 20 Executive orders and actions that I said are hurting people, hurting communities, hurting families, hurting Native cultures.I will tell you this: The Biden administration loves to talk about how they are committed to environmental justice and racial equity, but it is with a caveat.Here is the reality: They want to help unserved minority populations around the country. And I think this is a good goal, but it comes with a caveat: unless, of course, they are indigenous people of Alaska. Then the Biden administration targets them. Look at this folder. These are communities of color in my State, and all they do is get targeted, not helped; targeted, their economic opportunity. And then the things that most Americans take for granted that don't exist in these communities—clinics, flushed toilets, gymnasiums—all of that comes with economic opportunity. And when you shut it down, you are really hurting indigenous people in some of the most impoverished communities in the country. But I guess they seem OK with that. I want all of my Senate colleagues to do just a quick thought experiment. Imagine what it would be like, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican—but just think about it: You are a Democrat and a Republican administration comes in or you are a Republican and a Democrat administration comes in and changes the future of your State with a stroke of a pen, as Edward Rexford said, for the people you represent. Imagine an administration coming in with 20 Executive orders in 8 months, shutting down your economy as you are trying to get out of a pandemic. Every Senator here would be mad. And the one thing I very much enjoy about serving in this body is we are a collegial body. We have our differences, but I certainly have friends on both sides of the aisle. I try to work with everybody, try to be respectful with everybody. The Presiding Officer and I chaired committees together, worked together on a lot of things. And here is the thing. If a Republican administration came into power and targeted one of my colleague's States with 20 Executive orders in 8 months and whoever it was came to me and said: ""Hey, Dan, you know this is unfair. My constituents are really being attacked, really being hurt. Could you reach out to the Republican administration and say: ‘Hey, come on. Tone it down. Geez, Louise, 20 Executive orders in one State?’"" I would help, and I think almost every Senator here would help. That is what we do here.  And I want to say that some of my Democratic colleagues here, when I have talked about this, when I have told them about this, when I have spoken about this, a number of them have come to me and said: ""Hey, Dan, give me the list. Give me the list of 20. Maybe I can't help you on every one of them, all of them. Maybe there are some I actually like. But I do want to try and help."" That is what has happened. That is what makes this body a good place. To those Senators, I really want to thank you. And I am going to ask for your help because I would do it for you. And this is unacceptable. Tens of thousands of people I represent are being hurt by the federal government, by the President and his White House. So I appreciate that from my colleagues. And this is, in general, how this body works. It makes this a special place.But I will say this. Not all Senators have been so gracious and senatorial and collegial. To the contrary, a few of my colleagues are helping lead the charge in the war on Alaska's working families. They seem to be putting a ton of effort into it themselves. I am not sure why, but they spend a lot of their time and energy focused on doing this: shutting down the Alaska economy, hurting working families, and ridiculously and absurdly, acting as if they speak for the very people I am privileged to represent, as if they don't have enough to do in terms of helping their own constituents.So I am going to make an example and give an example of one. The leader of this small group is the senior Senator from New Mexico. Here is a sampling—three letters in the last year and a half he has written, signed, or led, focusing on shutting down Alaska's economy and hurting the great people I have the privilege of representing. Two of these letters deal with the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge—controversial, no doubt. In 2017, we voted to provide the opportunity for development in that small area, what we call the 1002 Area. The President signed it. It came into law. Now, I know most of my colleagues on the Democratic side didn't agree with that. We have legislation we don't agree with. I accept that. I am still very good friends with so many.  But, afterward, the senior Senator from New Mexico led letters to all of the top banks in America and all of the top insurance and financial institutions in America and didn't just say don't invest in ANWR but said ""don't invest in any oil and gas development project in the Arctic.""  What is that, the Arctic of America? That is my State.  So now you have, as opposed to collegiality, a small group, led by this Senator, writing the biggest banks in America, the biggest financial institutions in America, trying to muscle them, saying: Don't invest anything in Alaska.   That is not what this body is all about. I would never do that to a colleague. I would never write all the banks of America and say: Don't invest in poor communities, Native communities in New Mexico or in the New Mexico oil and gas industry. I wouldn't do that.  Who does that? Well, unfortunately, a few—not many, a few—Senators are doing that. Absurdly, this Senator had the audacity, in one of his letters, to try to speak for the people I represent. He put in the letter: The people dependent on the Arctic Refuge don't want you to invest there.  That is patently absurd. Just read the letters from all of the people who actually live there, all of the people who live there, who overwhelmingly want opportunities for oil and gas development and for jobs and economic opportunity. You would think, with all of New Mexico's problems, this Senator would focus on his own constituents.So I reached out to him and the few others who wrote these letters. I have reached out. I wrote my own letter to them saying: “Hey, I was disappointed to see you do that. Why didn't you come talk to me? I wouldn't do that to you. And, by the way, what you are doing is really going to hurt my constituents.”This is a letter I wrote to this Senator and a few others: I would appreciate the courtesy of talking about this before you go do it. You clearly don't understand the indigenous communities that I represent. I even provided a Wall Street Journal op?ed from the mayor of the North Slope Borough, Harry Brower, the Inupiaq mayor, who had a lot to say to the banks who weren't going to invest in his community.  But I got no response. To the contrary, just a few months ago, this same Senator led a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, asking her to shut down a very important energy development in Alaska called the Willow Project. This is that letter—just about 4 months ago. Let me talk about the Willow Project. The Willow Project is not in a controversial area; it is in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, set aside by Congress decades ago for oil and gas development. Every Native group in Alaska supports this project, all the unions do. 2,000 direct jobs, billions in revenues for some of the poorest communities in America, and the lowest emissions of any major oil and gas development project in America.  This is a huge win?win?win for everybody—not even controversial. Yet the senior Senator from New Mexico wrote Deb Haaland saying: “Shut down the Willow Project in Alaska.”  Why is he doing this, literally trying to kill thousands of Alaska jobs and impoverish Alaska Native communities? Do the people in New Mexico know that their senior Senator spends so much time trying to give Alaska oil and gas workers pink slips and impoverish Native communities? I wonder. I wonder.  I thought, for just a moment, maybe I should do something against New Mexico, but then I was like: “No. You know what, that is not my style. I wouldn't want to hurt New Mexico oil and gas workers or Native communities. They are all great Americans, I am sure. We are a great country. I wouldn't want to target them the way this Senator is targeting my State, trying to hurt thousands of Alaskan working families.”And it should be emphasized, and I want to emphasize, that is not how we work here. That is not what I have seen in my almost seven years in the U.S. Senate, Senators trying to attack other Senators' States, specifically focusing on hurting working families. The vast majority of the Senators I know wouldn't do that at all. That is not how business is conducted here in the U.S. Senate. To the contrary, most of us generally try to help each other. We don't always agree; that is for sure. But, particularly when States have unique challenges that could hurt their citizens, when my colleagues would come to me and say, ""Hey, Dan, can you help out on this,"" I usually try to help. But I certainly don't go on offense and try to hurt like this administration is doing and the senior Senator from New Mexico. But I thought the better course to fight back—because I am going to fight back, OK. I am going to fight back. These are my constituents who are hurting. The better course to fight back against these attacks on Alaskan working families was not to try to hurt New Mexicans, but just to show this, the rank hypocrisy of what the senior Senator is actually doing and saying.One of his main reasons, in this latest letter, to shut down Alaska, in trying to deny Federal permits for the Willow oil and gas project, is to ""achieve climate goals."" OK? That is in his letter to Deb Haaland.But if you do just a little digging, this Senator seems fine with trying to achieve these goals on the backs of Alaskan workers and Alaska Natives but not on his own constituents, not on the backs of his own constituents—to the contrary.   Guess which State in America has gotten way more Federal oil and gas drilling permits than any other State in the country. Guess which one. It is certainly not Alaska. It happens to be New Mexico. It just so happens to be New Mexico.Guess where the Secretary of the Interior is from. New Mexico. Hmm. Is that a coincidence? I wonder, in their frequent phone calls, when they talk about concerns of climate and shutting down oil and gas in Alaska, if shutting down oil and gas in New Mexico ever comes up? I am pretty sure it doesn't. How do I know that? Because close to half of all oil and gas drilling permits issued by the Department of the Interior, by New Mexican Deb Haaland, in 2021 have gone to one State. What State is that? New Mexico—2,286 Federal oil and gas drilling permits; almost half of all of the permits in the country to one State.  So here is the bottom line. Here is their view. Shut down Alaska, hurt working families in Alaska, supposedly, to help America's climate goals, but then quietly say ""drill, baby, drill"" in New Mexico, with more permits by far than any other State in the country—almost 2,300. If that is not rank hypocrisy, I don't know what is. So I am going to start asking questions about this and, by the way, so should the press. I sure hope our friends in the press think that, hmm, there is something a little strange going on here. Clearly, there is hypocrisy happening. But, you know, that happens here occasionally—or maybe more than occasionally. But is there anything else going on? And I hope the press in New Mexico ask their senior Senator why he is so darn focused on hurting the good people of Alaska—because I wouldn't do that to New Mexican oil and gas workers or New Mexican Native communities.  And finally, I am going to ask questions in another area. The Biden administration is clearly trying to shut down my State. It is there for everybody to see. Everybody back home knows it. But here is the thing. They can't do it illegally, and they can't do it unethically. And right now there is strong evidence that they are doing just that. What do I mean? Today, I sent this letter, that I would like to be printed in the record, to the inspector general of the Department of the Interior.Here is what I am asking in this letter. There is very strong evidence that at least four senior political appointees at the Department of the Interior who have been involved in many of these 20 Executive orders and Executive actions shutting down my State were actually, in their previous jobs, working on the very same issues and advocating for the very same outcomes—meaning they are working with a special interest group to say shut down the Willow Project. And then when it came to the Interior, they are working on whether or not to shut down the Willow Project. Now, most of us know, if that is true, that is clearly illegal and clearly unethical.  We have documented in this letter—four senior Department of the Interior officials, all of whom who are trying to shut down my State—and I think there is strong evidence that they are violating ethics laws and violating the law. So I have asked for a detailed investigation by the Department of the Interior inspector general into whether or not these individuals have violated federal ethics laws in their quest to hurt working families in my State. Let me conclude with this. I am a supporter of responsible resource development in America of all of the above: energy, wind, solar, oil, gas—in every part of our great country, in Alaska, of course, in New Mexico—all across our great land. And I am a supporter of the great men and women who do this in Alaska and New Mexico and Texas and North Dakota.What is happening in my State right now, this is just wrong, and I am going to fight it. And any other Senator who would be going through what my State is going through, with your constituents being harmed, you would be down on the floor fighting it, too. The vast majority of the U.S. Senators here—Democrats and Republicans—I think deep down in their hearts know that this is just wrong. You don't come in with a new administration and say, “Hey, let me target one State and beat the heck out of their working families.” It is just wrong. And I am hopeful that my colleagues here—and I am asking them because we need the help. I have great people I represent—proud, tough people, but you can't fight the whole damn federal government when they are focused on shutting you down. So I am hopeful that my colleagues—all of my colleagues—I will share the list of the 20—that you can help me get the Biden administration and some misguided hypocritical U.S. Senators to enact a cease?fire in their war on working families and Native communities in the great State of Alaska. I yield the floor.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-braun-lead-bipartisan-group-of-senators-in-voting-to-overturn-biden-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today voted with all 49 of his Senate Republican colleagues, as well as two Democratic senators, to overturn President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate for businesses using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), an expedited process for Congress to eliminate an executive branch rule. Sen. Sullivan led the CRA effort against the vaccine mandate with Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.). The joint resolution, S.J. Res. 29, provides congressional disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of Labor entitled “COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard,” which would result in hundreds of thousands of Americans potentially losing their jobs. Companion legislation, H.J. Res. 65, in the House of Representatives currently has 212 supporters, with every Republican in the chamber cosponsoring.“President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates have been wreaking havoc on American businesses and hard-working families across the country, including in my state of Alaska. It’s an issue my team and I hear about from constituents on a daily basis,” Sen. Sullivan said. “I am glad to see a bipartisan majority of U.S. senators standing up today for hard-working Americans by rejecting this gross federal overreach from the Biden administration. These mandates are not supported by the Constitution or statute, a fact that courts just keep reaffirming as they hand down loss after loss for the President and his administration.“In 2020, Congress and President Trump worked in a bipartisan way on an agreement that we would provide relief to American businesses on the condition they keep their employees. Now, Joe Biden is taking a sledge hammer to that employer-employee connection. Firing hard-working Americans who have made the personal choice not to get vaccinated not only undermines the significant work Congress and the Trump administration did to save millions of jobs during the pandemic, it also exacerbates the workforce shortages employers are already facing. No one should ever be forced to choose between getting vaccinated or putting food on the table for their families because of an unconstitutional mandate.”BACKGROUND:# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-cheers-withdrawal-of-radical-omarova-nomination,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) celebrated President Joe Biden’s announcement today that Saule Omarova has withdrawn her nomination to serve as Comptroller of the Currency. Sen. Sullivan has been rallying his colleagues and speaking out forcefully for weeks against the nominee, highlighting her demonstrated hostility toward the free market system and American banking, her lack of qualifications, and her affinity for Marxist ideology.“Good news for a change: President Biden withdrew Saule Omarova’s nomination to be Comptroller of the Currency today,” said Senator Sullivan. “I’ve been pushing for her nomination to be pulled for the last several weeks—highlighting her hostility toward our free market system, her pledge to ‘end banking as we know it,’ her plan to ‘bankrupt’ our energy companies to enact Green New Deal policies, and her general adherence to Marxist ideology. In a statement, however, Biden didn’t mention any of this, nor did he mention that she had lost the support of at least five Democratic Senators. Instead, he said that she ‘was subjected to inappropriate personal attacks that were far beyond the pale.’ This is not true. The concerns I raised about Omarova were always about her ideas, beliefs and policies, which is exactly what the Senate is supposed to do during the confirmation process. The fact is that this nominee was dangerous for our country and there was nothing inappropriate about drawing attention to her radical, far-left, socialist ideas and sympathies. “Ironically, the only inappropriate attacks in this entire confirmation process have been when this nominee publicly called anyone who criticized her a ‘racist.’ Americans are sick of this. There is no place in our political discourse for labeling people as racist simply because they don’t agree with your ideas and vision for our country. The far left seems to do this on a regular basis to try to silence their critics. America and all of Alaska should breathe a sigh of relief that Omarova’s nomination got pulled and that this individual will not be regulating America’s banks and our currency.”Sen. Sullivan spoke on the Senate floor on November 4 to detail his opposition to Omarova’s nomination.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-honors-beth-bragg-as-alaskan-of-the-week,"WASHINGTON—On the floor of the U.S. Senate yesterday, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) recognized Beth Bragg, of Anchorage, who retired recently after a 35-year-long career covering sports for the Anchorage Daily News. Bragg has covered Alaska’s diverse sports scene and events, from the Iditarod to the World Eskimo Indian Olympics, as well as Alaska’s many heroes, from Kikkan Randall, to Tommy Moe, to Lydia Jacoby, to the everyday athlete who makes Alaska so special. Bragg was recognized as part of Sen. Sullivan’s series, “Alaskan of the Week.”Tribute to Beth BraggMadam President, it is Thursday, and it is usually the day I get to come down to the Senate floor. Usually, the Senate is kind of wrapping up things; we are still pretty busy right now. But it is the day I love to come down to the Senate floor and talk about somebody in my State, the great State of Alaska, who is making a difference either for their community, for their State, for the country; you name it. We call this person the Alaskan of the Week.We have done it a lot. I usually like to give a little bit of an update. The pages typically really like this time of the week because we get to tell stories about Alaska, about the adventure of Alaska, but also about--typically, a little update about what is happening in the State. Right now, we are in a bit of a cold snap pretty much throughout the State. We are getting a lot of snow throughout the State. We have seen some record low temperatures all across Alaska, from Homer, King Salmon, Bethel.Monday in Fairbanks--so this is not even into December yet--it was 26 below zero. They are tough in Fairbanks, very tough. You get down to 50, 60 below in Fairbanks.My wife is from Fairbanks. She is a wonderful volunteer for this organization called Covenant House. They did their annual ``Sleep Out.'' It is a homeless shelter for teenage youth. This was in Anchorage just a couple of weeks ago. It was 15 below for the ``Sleep Out.'' You get a cardboard box and say: Good luck. So, boy, she is tough.Alaskans across the State are rugged, tough, individualistic, and we bond all the more for it. We are in it together when it is that cold. And it frequently is. And like one big community, one of the many things that brings us together--actually, one of the many things that brings Americans together--is bonding over sports: local sports, State sports, national sports, and your local newspaper as it relates to sports reporting. It is actually a universal instinct.One of our most famous Supreme Court Justices, Earl Warren, said it best:I always turn to the sports section first [in the morning]. The sports page records people's accomplishments. The front page [usually] has nothing but [people's] failures.I am not sure that is always true, but it is a good anecdote in terms of what binds us with regard to sports. You know, over the holidays, in particular, everybody in America watches great football, other sports activities. I had a good chat over lunch today with Coach Tuberville about the really incredible Alabama Auburn game that just happened last week. But sports is also the place in our local papers where we see the names of our children, our loved ones, our neighbors, our friends. In fact, it might just be the only time their names appear in the paper at all, when you think about it. So our Alaskan of the Week this week is somebody who knows sports and sportswriting in Alaska better than anybody. We are talking about Beth Bragg, who recently retired after 35 years as a sportswriter for the Anchorage Daily News. She understood all of these attributes about sportswriting better than anybody. During her 35 years at the paper, Beth always told cub reporters there was one rule they must always follow, no matter what. She said: Even if the person's name is something like Cindy Jones, ask that person for the spelling. It might be the only time their name appears in the paper, and it is very important that name is spelled correctly. Now, let me talk about Beth, about her reporting and about her work and how it has added to our communities across the great State of Alaska.Beth grew up in Billings, MT. Her father worked for the Billings Gazette. And she, too, while still in high school, joined the paper as a sports clerk so this is in her blood.Now, it wasn't so much that she was crazy about sports back then, but it was a job, a good job. And then she said she began, bit by bit, to fall in love with newspapers and sports reporting. She liked the irreverence, the strict deadlines, the energy.Importantly--and it is almost counterintuitive--covering sports allows more fun in the writing, the opportunity as a writer to take a little bit more in terms of chances and to be more creative than maybe on other beats. And throughout the years, Beth has brought so much of this kind of creativity, so much heart to her stories. Without looking at a byline in Alaska, you always knew when you were reading a Beth Bragg story. So, in 1986, when she was 27 years old, she came to Alaska to write for the Anchorage Daily News. That is our State's biggest paper. She thought she would stay for a few years, then move on. Her dream was to cover professional sports, maybe even Major League Baseball in a city that has got a Major League Baseball team, but as the years progressed, she stayed in Alaska. She fell in love with Alaska, and her ambitions as a sportswriter changed. But, in some ways, they got even bigger. She discovered that, in her words, ``the real reward, and the real challenge, is to find stories that resonate with everyone. And you don't have to be at the Super Bowl to do that.''In fact, Beth said she found more interesting, more unique stories to cover in Alaska than probably anywhere else.Now, we don't have big-time professional sports teams in the great State of Alaska, but we do have sports, loads of sports. And just like so much about Alaska, we have expanded the meaning of what it means to partake in sports.Let's take one very famous sport in Alaska, the Iditarod--the famous 800-mile sled dog race--as one big example. There is also heli-skiing, ice climbing, curling, and snowboarding. It didn't get its start in Alaska, but it reached its apex in Valdez, for those who participated in that incredible sport.Beth is likely one of the few, if only, reporters in the country who reported on this incredible sport in Alaska at 3 a.m., seal-skinning. Yes, that is a sport. It goes along with the ear pull and other sports in terms of competition at the World Eskimo Indian Olympics, which are incredible to go to and watch in Alaska--great athletes, by the way.She covered seal skinning, the competition. At 3 a.m. she was tired, but the excitement and the smell of the seals--first frozen, then thawed for the competition--kept her wide awake.We may not have professional sports teams, but we certainly have athletic stars galore in Alaska. For 35 years, Beth has written about these stars and some of the toughest athletes anywhere in the world. Let me give you a couple examples.She wrote about athletes running Mount Marathon. Now, I gave an ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech several months ago about Mount Marathon. It is what Outside magazine calls ``the toughest 5K on the planet''--straight up a mountain and straight back down. We always do it on July 4 in Seward.She wrote about the Alaska Wilderness Classic, the 150-or-so-mile ``secret race'' up mountains and across rivers in the Alaskan wilderness. Here are the rules of the Alaska Wilderness Classic: No outside support, nothing human-powered, leave no trace, and rescue is up to the racer. Pretty tough. Pretty tough.She wrote about the Arctic Man, another incredible Alaska event that has been described as one of the world's toughest downhill ski races and an exciting snow machine race, all combined together. You want to see something amazing? Go to the Arctic Man.She has written about swimming heats and cross-country track and field matches; skiing, lots of stories about skiing in Alaska; ice hockey; high school football; basketball games; and, as I mentioned, the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics, with the ear pull and the blanket toss.She wrote a great story about a mother and son literally tied by rope together for 2 weeks climbing Denali, North America's tallest peak, in Alaska.There was a story about a sled dog that was cut loose and ran away from her Iditarod sled dog pack. Miraculously, this dog found her way home to her kennel through mountain ranges and hundreds of miles of tundra in the dead of an Alaskan winter. Pretty amazing. She wrote a great story about an event I attended this past June, an inspiring USA Patriots-Amputee Softball Team event where almost every player on that team were some of our greatest American heroes. Almost all of them had lost a limb--all of them had lost a limb, mostly in combat. Always at the center of Beth's stories are the people, even when those people are sled dogs. She has written about their victories; their struggles; their heart for the game, for their teams, for their communities, for their State, for their country, and for life itself.Thinking back on her long career, a few events stay with her. She talked a lot about what it was like to watch Alaskans compete in the Olympics, four of which she attended--Olympic Games.Now, we are a huge State. I talk about that a lot. We have a pretty small population relative to other States--730,000 people. But Alaska is really good in terms of Olympic athletes. We punch way above our weight, sending some of the top American athletes to especially the Winter Olympics but also the Summer Olympics.Beth remembers, for example, the electricity in the Olympic stadium in Norway in 1994 when a little-known Alaskan named Tommy Moe shocked the world by winning the gold in the downhill and then, 4 days later, a silver, becoming the first American skier ever to win two medals at the same Olympics.She remembers writing stories about the legendary and beloved cross-country skier from Alaska Kikkan Randall when Kikkan was just 13 years old. Then, like so many Alaskans, Beth swelled with pride and cried when Kikkan Randall won the gold in 2018.Beth said she also cried just this summer when 17-year-old Lydia Jacoby from Seward, AK, shocked the world by winning the gold medal in Tokyo this summer in the 100-meter breaststroke. Remember that? Seward, AK, doesn't even have an Olympic-size swimming pool. And I will say, Lydia Jacoby is the only person in U.S. history to be Alaskan of the Week in the U.S. Senate twice. That is unbelievable.Of course, there are heartbreaks, too--the losses, the illnesses, the injuries, and sometimes the deaths--all of which Beth has handled with the utmost sensitivity. Because she was at it for so long and has so much history with Alaskan athletes, she understood something about them that a new reporter might not. It takes a certain kind of grit to be an athlete in Alaska, to wake up at 6 a.m. and head off into the dark, subzero weather to train. It takes a certain kind of grit to travel outside of Alaska for competitions, often thousands of miles away from your home, to get noticed. As Beth said, ``You have to work hard to make it big'' in Alaska. As a result, she thinks Alaska athletes have a sense of home in a way a lot of other athletes don't. As I said, Beth recently retired. She is going to clean her home; maybe travel some; of course, watch some sports, as a fan now, not as a reporter. She leaves behind a great legacy, thousands of stories charting some of our State's greatest moments in athletics, times when we all cheered and cried and came together to support the best of our people and competition and grit and determination--the reason Americans across the country love sports so much.Beth, thank you for your great job. Congrats on an incredibly stellar career, and, of course--I am sure one of your biggest honors ever--congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/save-our-seas-20-lead-sponsors-welcome-new-academy-of-sciences-report-on-marine-debris-crisis,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) and Don Young (R-Alaska)—champions of the 2020 Save Our Seas (SOS) 2.0 Act, the most comprehensive marine debris legislation ever—today welcomed a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine entitled “Reckoning with the U.S. Role in Global Ocean Plastic Waste.” The report, mandated by the SOS 2.0 Act and sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), synthesizes all existing research on marine debris and presents a stark assessment of the amount of plastic that enters the world’s oceans. According to the report, an estimated eight million metric tons (MMT) of plastic waste enters the world’s oceans each year—the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck of plastic waste into the ocean every minute. If current practices continue, the amount of plas­tic waste discharged into the ocean could reach up to 53 MMT per year by 2030, roughly half of the total weight of fish caught from the ocean annually. The study’s key recommendation is that the United States create a com­prehensive federal research and policy strategy that focuses on interventions across the entire plastic life cycle to reduce the U.S. contribu­tion of plastic waste to the environment, including the ocean. “I want to share my appreciation for the experts at the National Academies study committee and the NOAA Marine Debris Office for their critical work on this landmark analysis that deepens our understanding of the challenge of marine debris,” said Senator Sullivan. “This report is a sobering reminder of the scale of this problem, which impacts Alaska more than any other state with our 6,600 miles of coastline. The research and findings compiled here by our best scientists will serve as a springboard to our future legislative efforts to tackle this entirely solvable environmental challenge and better protect our marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal economies.”“This National Academies study, carried out at the direction of our Save Our Seas 2.0 law, illustrates the mind-boggling scale of the global ocean plastic problem and how the U.S. contributes to it,” said Senator Whitehouse. “There’s a bipartisan tradition of ocean stewardship in the Senate, and I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep making progress cleaning up this harmful mess.”“The National Academies plastic waste report, which emphasizes the negative impact of plastic pollution on coastal tourism, property values, and fisheries, is especially relevant to the safety and prosperity of communities in coastal states like New Jersey,” Senator Menendez said. “As the United Nation’s Environment Assembly initiates negotiations on a global agreement to combat plastic pollution this February, we are committed to ensuring the advances made in SOS 2.0 continue to guide the United States’ environmental and climate leadership on the world stage.”“Marine debris is a threat to the health of the ocean and the species that depend on it for survival,” said Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici. “I am encouraged that this report, required by the Save our Seas 2.0 Act, which I helped lead, focuses on the importance of interventions across the entire plastic lifecycle. Improving our monitoring and waste management efforts will be important but not sufficient. We must significantly reduce the creation of plastic debris. I look forward to the implementation of this report’s findings and the continued development of policies to address this critical environmental issue.”“Healthy oceans are essential to Alaska's economy and way of life. As Co-Chair of the House Oceans Caucus, monitoring and eliminating marine debris has been one of my highest priorities,” said Congressman Don Young. “Last Congress, I was proud to help champion Save our Seas 2.0, which is now law, and I am pleased to see this vital effort is producing results. I am grateful to everyone at the Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine who helped make this report possible. I will keep standing up for the health of our waters, and look forward to continuing to work with friends on both sides of the aisle to ensure recommendations from this report are explored and implemented.”# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-introduces-arctic-focus-act-to-direct-coast-guard-operations-to-americas-arctic,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), ranking member of the Senate Commerce subcommittee with oversight of the Coast Guard, today introduced the Arctic Focus Act, legislation to ensure the historic investments being made in the Arctic achieve their intended benefits for the United States, including improving America’s ability to operate in the Arctic, securing economic opportunities as sea ice recedes and traffic increases, and addressing threats posed by America’s adversaries. The Coast Guard is the lead agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. interests in the Arctic. “We are making significant investments in vessels, infrastructure, research and personnel to expand America’s presence in the Arctic, yet the United States continues to trail Russia, and even China,” said Sen. Sullivan. “If we are to keep pace with our adversaries and realize our role as an Arctic nation, these historic investments need to be directed by policy and clearly defined objectives that advance America’s economic and national security interests in this important region. I look forward to discussing the goals of the Arctic Focus Act with my colleagues as we work to protect America’s sovereignty in our Arctic and build upon the enormous progress we’ve made these past six years.” The Arctic Focus Act provides congressional direction to the Coast Guard to: The bill also requires the Coast Guard to report to Congress on a plan to achieve these objectives, as well as the ability to conduct a transit of the Northern Sea Route and periodic transits of the Northwest Passage.# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-statement-on-biden-decision-to-tap-strategic-petroleum-reserve,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) today issued the following statement regarding President Biden’s decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an attempt to tame skyrocketing gas prices. “The Biden administration’s incompetent and schizophrenic energy policies continue, and America’s working families are paying the price. Since Day 1, this administration has purposely sought to raise energy prices, by limiting the production of American energy, killing energy infrastructure like pipelines, and strong-arming American financial institutions to not invest in American energy projects, particularly in Alaska, all the while begging OPEC and our adversaries like Russia to produce more energy.“Tapping our nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve is political window dressing that will do little to counteract the Biden administration’s own destructive Green New Deal policies. “Mr. President, I have a better idea. Get the boot of the federal government off the neck of energy producers in Alaska and other energy states and let them do what they do best—produce American energy for America with American workers and the highest environmental standards in the world! Don’t tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, tap into the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska (NPRA)—where billions of barrels of oil are just waiting to be produced.”# # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murkowski-sullivan-introduce-landless-legislation-to-rectify-50-year-injustice,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, introduced updated legislation to allow the Alaska Native communities of Haines, Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, and Tenakee to form urban corporations and receive land entitlements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The five Southeast communities were not included in ANCSA, which divided 44 million acres of land among more than 200 regional, village, and urban corporations to resolve land claims throughout Alaska, when it became law in 1971.The legislation, the Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition and Compensation Act, aims to rectify that injustice by amending ANCSA to provide each community with the opportunities it granted to other Native communities 50 years ago: the right to form an Alaska Native Urban Corporation and receive 23,040 acres, or one township, of federal land.“The culture and heritage of Alaska Native peoples is intricately tied to the land on which they live. The unique regions they have inhabited for centuries are directly connected to their identity,” said Senator Murkowski. “Unfortunately, five communities were not afforded the same benefits under ANCSA – access to land – that were granted to others throughout Southeast. It is past time the federal government make good on its promises to each of the communities that were left out of this significant agreement. I’m proud to work with Senator Sullivan, Congressman Young, and local stakeholders to correct this decades-long wrongdoing and provide equity to these landless communities.”“For years, Alaska Native residents in five southeast communities have been denied the land and opportunities afforded by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, a historic injustice that Congress has a duty to rectify. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the passage of ANCSA, I am hopeful my colleagues will recognize the federal laws and circumstances that uniquely impact Alaska and join Senator Murkowski and me in quickly advancing our legislation for the benefit of our constituents,” said Senator Sullivan. “This legislation is a testimony to perseverance and hard work and having an Alaskan delegation who not only listened but took up the shield and said to all five communities. They not only would tell us it was a terrible wrong but along with their hard working staffs, would help to end this inequity to the five communities. The Ketchikan Indian shareholders all want to thank Lisa Murkowski for her steadfast support all these years when it would have been just as easy to feign support and never bring this bill forward. Senator Murkowski, instead, always said let’s get this bill done so we can introduce it and right this wrong.  That conviction is admirable and because of her and the other Alaskan delegation support, this historic bill has been introduced,” said Randy Williams, Tribal Administrator of the Tribal Council of Ketchikan Indian Community.U.S. Congressman Don Young (R-AK) previously introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.To read the legislation, click here. To see the Forest Service’s maps, click here.Background:The legislation is the result of extensive and ongoing outreach to stakeholders in Southeast Alaska. It identifies specific parcels of land that would be conveyed to the new urban corporations, which are depicted on official maps produced by the U.S. Forest Service. The legislation also includes provisions to protect existing rights-of-way and many existing uses of those lands and to ensure that reasonable public access can continue.In November 2020, Senators Murkowski and Sullivan and Congressman Young introduced their original landless legislation, upon which today’s newly introduced bill was built.Following introduction, during an Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining (PLFM) legislative hearing, Senator Murkowski raised her bill, S. 4889, the ANCSA Fulfillment Act, a package which aimed to resolve a number of outstanding issues related to the landmark 1971 law, including authorizing the five landless communities in southeast Alaska to form urban corporations and receive lands. Senator Sullivan was also a cosponsor of S. 4889.Earlier this year, staff from the Alaska Congressional delegation traveled throughout southeast Alaska to hold community meetings and to discuss the legislation with impacted stakeholders. Feedback from those meetings was critical in developing this text.  # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-criticizes-biden-administration-rule-to-restrict-economic-activity-across-the-tongass,"WASHINGTON--U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Congressman Don Young, all R-Alaska, issued the following statements after the U.S. Forest Service announced it will attempt to re-impose near-blanket restrictions on road construction and other economic activities across millions of acres of the Tongass National Forest. The Forest Service will seek to do this by proposing a new rule to reinstate the 2001 Roadless Rule, despite finalizing a different rule to exempt the Tongass from the 2001 rule barely a year ago.“This is a frustrating decision that will impact not just timber, but a wide range of industries in Southeast Alaska—tourism, recreation, mining, energy development, and transportation alike—so we will fight it,” Senator Murkowski said. “It is needless, given the level of protections that already exist for the Tongass. It misses a genuine opportunity to work together to establish a sustainable regional economy. And it is exasperating, given that we just passed a historic infrastructure bill, that the Biden administration is intent on returning the Tongass to an overly restrictive environment where projects almost always take longer and cost more, if they can proceed at all. Everything from the deployment of broadband to the development of more affordable energy stands to suffer under a return to the failed Roadless Rule.”  “Like many Alaskans, I am deeply frustrated by the Biden administration’s continued assault on our state. This latest announcement announcement by Secretary Vilsack shows a complete disregard for the interests of Alaska’s hard-working families,” said Senator Sullivan. “Instead of serving as puppets for the extreme leftist environmental groups who have no interest in promoting economic opportunities in our state, the Biden administration should recognize that Alaskans in Southeast—like any Americans—have a right to connect their communities, sustain local economies, build renewable energy projects, and responsibly harvest resources, all of which is being crushed by a return to this overly-burdensome and out-of-touch regulation.”“USDA Secretary Vilsack — who works in a federal agency office 3,000 miles away from our state — doubled down on this Administration's record of hostility toward Alaska. Earlier this year, I implored Secretary Vilsack to come to Southeast to visit our communities before making a decision on the Tongass. Clearly, he did not. Those in Southeast, including Alaska Natives, know how to balance environmental protection with development; they have been doing it for years. To lock up the Tongass, as Secretary Vilsack is doing, sends the message that this Administration does not trust Alaskans to take care of the very environment in which they live. All our communities are asking for are the same things many people in the Lower 48 take for granted: transportation, economic opportunity, outdoor recreation, and the ability to stay connected with one another. This is truly a sad day for Alaska,” said Congressman Young. “To the countless families whose economic opportunity and chances of a better life are being snuffed out by the Biden Administration, I want you to know that I will keep fighting for you. I will not stop working until my constituents in Southeast receive the trust and respect they deserve from the people in D.C. who continue to think they know what is best for them.”The Tongass spans nearly 16.7 million acres, covering nearly all of southeast Alaska, and is home to 32 islanded communities. For decades, successive layers of federal law and regulation, including the Roadless Rule, have continually restricted access needed for timber, mining, tourism, recreation, and the development of more affordable renewable resources such as hydropower.Separate and apart from the Roadless Rule, the Tongass is already well protected under existing law. Some 91 percent of the forest is already conserved in Wilderness, Wilderness National Monument, or Inventoried Roadless Areas—meaning only nine percent of the Tongass is available for any kind of development.In 2018, the Forest Service announced it would develop a state-specific Roadless Rule focused on the Tongass. The Alaska-specific rule, finalized in October 2020, exempted the Tongass from the one-size-fits-all Roadless Rule, which established sweeping prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction, and timber harvest on inventoried roadless areas on National Forest System lands beginning in 2001. The 2020 rule came in response to a petition from the State of Alaska requesting a full exemption for the Tongass, and helped restore balanced management and reasonable economic prospects within the Tongass.Now, the Forest Service has announced that on Tuesday, November 23, it will formally propose a rule to reinstate the 2001 Roadless Rule across the Tongass. The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 60 days. More information can be found here.# # #"

But Sullivan expressed deep concerns that the Biden administration has already set the agenda for the EPA through its environmental and energy policies without Mr. Regan’s expertise and input, and about how these polices are impacting Alaska. Sullivan also questioned how much influence and authority White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator during the Obama administration, will have over the agency.TranscriptMr. President, we just voted on Secretary Michael Regan to be the new EPA Administrator. I want to congratulate him on his vote. He is now the new EPA Administrator. I sit on the Committee on Environment and Public Works. So we had hearings for Mr. Regan--Administrator Regan, I guess we want to call him now--and I have had a number of conversations with him. I actually voted for him to move out of committee to come to the floor for this vote that we took today.I like to come down to the floor to explain my votes because sometimes I support the Biden administration's Cabinet officials. I introduced Secretary of Defense Austin at his confirmation hearing. I served with him many years ago when I was a marine and he was a four-star general in the Army. I have a lot of respect for the Secretary of Defense.Then there are other times when I am a “no.” What I typically like to do is come and explain the noes but not always. On this one, for Secretary Regan, for Administrator Regan and his team, I want to explain it because I will say that I was impressed with him. I think he is qualified. He was essentially the EPA administrator for North Carolina. Both of his Republican Senators introduced him at his hearing and voted for him, I believe, today, and I have had good conversations with him as well.Here is the thing: I was trying to get commitments from him. Now, this is very normal in the confirmation process. You work with the nominees and try to get commitments. Sometimes they give them, and sometimes they don't, but that is what we do--give advice and consent. We have been doing this since the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution on what the Senate should be doing in these confirmation processes that we are going through right now with the Biden administration. So I wasn't asking for a lot in terms of commitments from this administration for the great State of Alaska, but it was important to me. Why was it important to me?Unfortunately, the Biden administration has launched a war on working families in Alaska. Now, that sounds like a pretty dramatic statement, “a war on working families in Alaska.” What I am looking for is a ceasefire. My State, like a lot of States, is hurting economically. We are doing very well and I am very proud of Alaska on the health side. We are No. 1 in terms of vaccinations per capita in the country, which is remarkable, if you have been to my State, as it is so huge and the populations are so spread out, but we are working together, all of us, and we are achieving really remarkable results. We have been No. 1 in testing per capita throughout the whole pandemic, and we have had some of the lowest per capita death rates throughout the whole pandemic. But we are being really hit hard economically in the energy sector, the tourism sector, and the commercial fishing sector. So why am I looking for a ceasefire? In the first 2 months of the Biden administration, there have been eight Executive orders, if you include the recent statement by the President and the Prime Minister of Canada, which had a focus on Alaska, which have been focused on my State. Usually, it will be on economic development projects and usually on access to Federal lands. Eight. There is no State in the country that is getting that kind of attention from this administration, and we are hurting. It is not even close. Show me any other State represented in the U.S. Senate Chamber that has eight Executive orders directed at your State. It won't exist. Trust me--my constituents don't like all the attention.So I want to ask the President--not the Presiding Officer but the President: Mr. President, Mr. President Biden, sir, you were a U.S. Senator for three decades. Let me just ask you this question: If a Republican administration came into office and focused its attention on shutting down Delaware with eight Executive orders inside of 2 months, you would be on the floor every day like me, talking about it, asking for some relief. That is all we are asking for--a ceasefire on the hard-working families of Alaska.This is what I asked Secretary Regan. A commitment on these is not a big issue. I told him, if I could get a commitment on these things, I would come down to the floor and give a speech in favor of his confirmation.One was of a very big energy project in my State that has been permitted for almost 25 years. It started with the Clinton administration, in a place called the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, and was set aside by Congress for oil and gas development. That is what the NPR-A is. We do it responsibly, better than any place in the world, but this is a project that was started by the Clinton administration and moved forward by the Bush administration. There was a big NEPA environmental impact statement by the Obama administration, called the Integrated Activity Plan for NPR-A, which was approved. It was completely noncontroversial because that is what this part of Alaska is set aside for. Then the Trump administration finalized a very large but responsibly developed energy project. We started it this winter with no controversy. It has estimates of 2,000 direct jobs, with thousands more indirect jobs. All we wanted was a commitment to keep it going. That is it--simple, status quo. Couldn't get it. Couldn't get it.There is litigation with regard to this project right now. About 200 people--almost 200 workers--have been sent home with pink slips during a recession. Those were great jobs by the way. We tried to get a commitment on this. We couldn't get it. By the way, 75 percent of those 2,000 jobs were union jobs and high-paying--building trades, laborers, operating engineers, teamsters. They are great Americans, by the way. Seventy-five percent. Noncontroversial. Twenty-five years of permits. No one has been against this. So I just wanted a commitment on it. No. Like I said, it is a war on working families.Here is another one. Here is something that a lot of people don't know about Alaska: 60 percent of the country's wetlands, of America's wetlands, are in my State--six zero. Now, we have the most beautiful State. We love our wilderness. We love the outdoors. We care about the Alaskan environment more than anyone else and--trust me--more than anyone else in the EPA. That is for sure. We have 175 million acres of wetlands. So this creates challenges. Unlike most of the lower 48, we have not dredged and filled these areas in the past. If you look at the east coast, at its environments--no offense to some of my colleagues whose States are up the corridor here--holy cow. And you wonder about my environment? Geez Louise. But it is hard to do compensation for projects where you haven't had dredge and fill before, because we have so many wetlands. So, in 2018, the Corps of Engineers and the EPA had an MOU to address some of these mitigation challenges. It wasn't controversial; it was creative. I thought Secretary Regan thought it was creative when I talked to him about it. So we just asked for a continuation of this. These are really simple commitments, good ideas--couldn't get it from the Secretary.Now, look, here's my own view. I think Mr. Regan wanted to--I explained these to him. I think he was reasonable, someone who has done this in his State and knows each State is unique. He cares about jobs. He cares about environmental justice. That is a big issue in my State when a lot of these communities that are getting targeted are actually Alaska Native communities. They are killing jobs in those communities. That is environmental justice; that is for sure. So my instinct was he wanted to make these commitments, but I think he was told no. I don't know that, but I'm pretty--well, I can't say. But I think he was told no by the White House. This raises a much bigger concern about this nominee. My good friend, the esteemed Senator from West Virginia, Senator Capito, was on the floor earlier. She also sits on the EPW Committee. She is the ranking member on the committee. She gave a really important speech on why she also voted no for Mr. Regan. And I think she had the same feeling I did. He knows the issues, is qualified, cares about different States' challenges. But she raised a concern that I want to reiterate because I think it is going to be a really big concern, and I think it is going to come to a head here soon, and that is this: There is concern, not just among Republican Senators--it is all over the press, and she cited it--that Mr. Regan, who is now the EPA Administrator might not be the person in charge of the EPA. Now he's Senate-confirmed. He is the one who has to come before the Congress for hearings, for oversight, but what are we talking about here? Well, the former EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, is in the White House. She is out talking to the press all the time. She's an unaccountable czar on these issues, working behind the scenes--and, actually, not even behind the scenes. She was recently quoting about herself, saying she's the orchestra leader of all of these issues.Wait, what about the EPA Administrator? I thought he was the Senate-confirmed person nominated by the President. The big, big concern is that he is not going to have the authority or the decision-making capacity and is going to be told what to do by a shadow EPA working out of the White House run by Gina McCarthy. That is not just me. That is not just Senator Capito. That is all over the press. Read it. Inside EPA--she was quoting from that, Senator Capito was. No transparency there? All these previous Obama administration EPA alumnae in the White House running it.By the way, if I am the new EPA Administrator, Mr. Regan, I wouldn't want that notion out there. But with all due respect, sir--and, again, congratulations--it is out there, and you need to tamp this down because it is going to come to a head. Look, my State did not fare well under the Gina McCarthy EPA. There is a long list: the waters of the United States--I won't get into the details of the disrespect to my constituents. Armed EPA officials with body armor, rifles, were going after gold miners and placer miners in Alaska because they thought they were violating the Clean Water Act. No kidding. Read about it. Chicken, AK--go Google that. We were not big fans. So I believe Mr. Regan wants to work with Alaskans. I believe he understands the concept of cooperative federalism on these environmental issues. I don't believe he would authorize armed guards to terrify small placer miners in the interior of Alaska the way the previous Administrator McCarthy did and talk to the press in a blatantly disrespectful way to my fellow Alaskans. It was shameful, in my view. But this issue is going to come to a head. Who is in charge? Regardless of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, if you voted for the EPA Administrator or you didn't, we want him in charge because he is the Senate-confirmed official nominated by the President, not an unelected official in the White House who I guarantee wouldn't have been able to get confirmed. So it is going to be a challenge. And it is not just Gina McCarthy. We had an EPW hearing today, and I raised the issue of the other czar--John Kerry, the former Senator. But he is not confirmed. He hasn't been appointed to a Senate-confirmed job. He and the President are at loggerheads on a really big issue. President Biden, the President of the United States, recently in a meeting reported by the press with labor leaders, said: I am all in on natural gas. That is important. That is a huge issue for our environment and our workers. The President of the United States said “I am all in on natural gas” to the men and women who build pipelines. He told them that recently in a White House meeting. He is the President of the United States.Now John Kerry--I think some people think he is President of the world. He is flying around on his airplane right now, and he is telling people he is not for natural gas. Well, I wonder who is going to win that debate.But this goes to this issue: These are going to come to a head. Who is in charge here--the President of the United States or the President of the world--on natural gas? I hope it is the President of the United States because natural gas is going to be key for our workers, for our environment, for our national security. And at the EPA level, who is in charge? Mr. Regan? I hope so. Or Gina McCarthy? It is looking more and more like she is in charge.So that is why a number of us, despite being impressed, wanting to work with the new EPA Administrator voted no, and I certainly hope that the unaccountable team of McCarthy and Kerry in the White House are not going to be running the policy, but it is going to be the people who were actually confirmed by the U.S. Senate because that is the way our system of government is supposed to work.So, Mr. President, for those reasons, although I again want to congratulate Mr. Regan, I respectfully declined to support his nomination, and we will see. We will see who is going to be ultimately in charge.I want to work with him and his team. These issues are so important to my State. I want him to help convince others in the Biden White House for the ceasefire that my constituents need. We need to get to work, and I am hoping he is going to be a constructive partner in that regard. # # # "
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-cosponsors-resolution-condemning-chinas-aggression-in-the-south-china-sea,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) yesterday joined Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in introducing a resolution to condemn the Chinese Communist Party’s actions to militarize the South China Sea, applaud members of the United States Navy and Coast Guard for their efforts to ensure freedom of navigation operations, and send a clear message that the United States will not tolerate China’s extension of power into waters beyond its legitimate territorial sea boundaries. “In recent years, China has ramped up its aggressive actions against neighboring peaceful nations both to expand its influence and subvert the rule of law in the South China Sea. The alarming, belligerent behavior of Xi Jinping cannot continue,” Sen. Sullivan said. “This resolution commends the courageous Coast Guard and Navy service members who continue to promote international order in the region and sends a strong message to the Chinese Communist Party that hostility toward our allies will not be tolerated.”“The Communist Party of China, led by General Secretary Xi, continues to militarize the South China Sea and is eager to expand its territorial claims in the region,” Sen. Scott said. “This aggressive and unlawful action cannot be tolerated. I’m proud to lead my colleagues today in a resolution to applaud the hardworking men and women of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for working to defend our freedoms, and to send a clear message to General Secretary Xi that his aggression cannot continue.”  “The brave men and women of our Armed Forces deployed in the Indo-Pacific play a critical role in protecting access to vital commercial corridors like the South China Sea,” Sen. Tillis said. “I am proud to join my colleagues supporting the tireless efforts of our servicemembers to safeguard a free and open Indo-Pacific region and denounce the Chinese Communist Party’s ongoing aggression in the South China Sea and other international waters.”“China’s claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea are unfounded and threaten the international order,” Sen. Wicker said. “The U.S. must hold Beijing accountable for its unauthorized expansions, and I applaud the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for working to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific region.” # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-welcomes-planned-us-china-senior-diplomatic-summit-in-alaska,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, a top White House official briefed Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) on the upcoming foreign ministers meeting between the United States and China that will take place in Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday, March 18. In response to the announcement of the meeting, Senator Sullivan released the following statement:“Alaska is at the center of the strategic crossroads of the world and I am glad that the Biden administration has recognized this by selecting Anchorage as the site of its first official in-person meeting between senior foreign policy officials from the U.S. and China. “In my discussions with the Biden White House today, I encouraged them to press their Chinese counterparts on the vital importance of human rights and religious liberty, to ensure China fulfills its obligations on matters of trade and reciprocity, and to get China to be more transparent on the origins of COVID-19. Finally, I emphasized – as I have for weeks – that the export of clean burning Alaskan and American natural gas to Asia, including to China, will help dramatically increase American jobs, decrease our trade deficit, enhance our national security, and significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.”###"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sullivan-cosponsors-cramers-fair-access-to-banking-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) recently signed on as a cosponsor of the Fair Access to Banking Act, legislation introduced by Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) to prevent discrimination by banks and financial service providers against constitutionally-protected industries and law-abiding businesses.“As we work to build momentum toward a robust and lasting economic recovery from this pandemic, the last thing our country needs is America’s large financial institutions blacklisting whole sectors of the economy, and hurting our workers and communities,” said Senator Sullivan. “After Alaska energy projects—which employ thousands of hard-working Americans—were targeted by the Big Banks in late 2019, we worked for months with federal officials, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to prevent this kind of discrimination against industries that have fallen out of favor with radical left-wing activists. I am glad to join Senator Cramer in introducing legislation to establish this commonsense policy in law, bring substantial consequences for banks that violate it, and protect every American business’ fair access to capital in order to create jobs and help strengthen our communities.”“Fairness matters,” said Senator Cramer. “There is no place in our society for discrimination, and big banks are no exception. Financial service providers do not have the right to circumvent the Constitution or the law to create de-facto bans on legally-compliant businesses like energy producers or firearms manufacturers when they believe it is politically convenient. Our legislation makes it illegal to do so and imposes serious consequences on those who choose to violate the law.” The purpose of the Fair Access to Banking Act is to protect fair access to financial services and to ensure banks operate in a safe and sound manner, basing their judgements and decisions on impartial, individualized risk-based analysis developed through empirical data and evaluated under quantifiable standards. If enacted, the bill would:The legislation has the backing of more than one-quarter of the Senate and more than half of the Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, with Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) joining as cosponsors.Timeline # # #"
https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/former-legislator-bud-fate-remembered-as-renaissance-man,"Hugh “Bud” Fate died late Thursday. The U.S. Army veteran, who used the G.I. Bill to study dentistry and brought dental care to rural Alaska, served in the Alaska Legislature representing Fairbanks in the early 2000s.While the 91-year-old lived an accomplished life, many people knew him as the husband of the late Mary Jane Fate, originally of Rampart, who co-founded the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska and the Fairbanks Native Association. She was the first woman to co-chair the Alaska Federation of Natives, the first woman to serve on the Alaska Airlines board of directors and much more.Gov. Mike Dunleavy has ordered that U.S. flags and Alaska state flags fly at half-staff on Monday to pay respect to Fate and issued a statement noting some of Fate’s contributions to Alaska, particularly in public education.Originally from Oregon, Fate came to Alaska in 1950 for a job on an oil rig on the North Slope. He fished, he mined and he later went into politics, serving in multiple elected and appointed roles. During the 1970s, Fate flew up and down the Yukon River with his wife providing dental services to underserved communities. In 1988, the University of Alaska granted Fate an honorary doctorate of public service.U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, son-in-law to Fate, announced his passing on Friday at the GOP luncheon in Fairbanks where he was the last-minute featured speaker.Fate died surrounded by family in the home he shared with his late wife of 65 years.“He loved all of you guys,” Sullivan told the Republicans gathered in a banquet room at the Westmark Fairbanks Hotel.The senator choked up at times when speaking about Fate, who he said was like a second father to him.“I got to tell him that,” Sullivan said.The story of Fate’s life reads like a Hollywood movie and even includes a stint in Tinseltown. After getting hurt playing football for the University of Washington, Fate studied drama and moved to Hollywood to work in cowboy movies. Fate had ridden horses since age 6 and spent time on the rodeo circuit.After turning 21, Fate arrived in Alaska and was soon drafted into the U.S. Army. It was during the Korean War, and Fate was “charged with riding the lead Jeep to conduct the combat survey on all the twists and turns of the newly constructed, 1,700-mile-long Alcan Highway, advising the mission commanders about the Arctic, cold weather, and Alaska,” reads a 2019 tribute to Fate by Sullivan.A few years later, Fate met and married Mary Jane, who was a Miss Alaska contestant. Their marriage served as an inspiration for their daughters.“Mom and Dad really worked together. They were such a team,” said Janine Fate Avner.Some of the roles in business, politics and state government that Fate performed include president of the UA Board of Regents, vice chairman of the Alaska Republican Party, president of the Alaska State Board of Dental Examiners and chairman of the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce.Sen. Sullivan said his father-in-law was as comfortable at his fish camp on the Yukon River as he was in the boardroom.Jennifer Fate Velaise described her father as a classic example of “one of those old-timer Alaskans who came up before statehood.”Fate’s three daughters were reached by phone and said their father continued to give advice, recite poetry and dabble in the stock market even as his health deteriorated from old age.“We miss him so much right now,” Julie Fate Sullivan said. “He was 91 but he was still such a force and a foundation in our lives.”Memorial arrangements are pending."
