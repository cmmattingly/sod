https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-proposes-a-pipeline-for-a-pipeline-on-permitting-reform,"WASHINGTON – U.S. U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, issued the following statement after proposing changes to Senator Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) “permitting reform” legislation:“A pipeline for a pipeline. If Senator Manchin and his Democrat colleagues want to get to yes, it requires input from everyone, not a backroom take-it-or-leave-it proposal. The national significance of the Mountain Valley Pipeline applies to DAPL as well.“Aspirational timelines do not motivate federal bureaucrats or curb the zeal of environmental litigants. We need a ‘shot clock’ for permit approvals which automatically defaults to the applicant within the one- or two-year timeframe outlined in the bill.“If Joe Manchin and his Democrat colleagues want me to get to yes, let’s scrap these proposals to overrun state siting authority, give the timelines some teeth, and treat DAPL the same as the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Let’s make a deal.”Senator Cramer proposed the following amendments:

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-stand-with-sportsmen-introduce-bill-to-stop-the-ban-of-traditional-ammo-tackle,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), and 21 colleagues introduced a bill to prohibit U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from banning the use of traditional lead ammunition or tackle on public lands unless such action is supported by the best available science and state wildlife and fish agencies.“I will continue to fight against needless bureaucracy, which would limit hunting and fishing opportunities for North Dakota’s sportsmen. This bill prohibits wildlife and land management federal agencies from banning the use of traditional, affordable lead ammunition or tackle on National Wildlife Refuges,” said Senator Cramer.“Sportsmen are the original conservationists and play an important role in wildlife management—the last thing we should do is limit their access by implementing a blanket-ban on traditional ammo and tackle. Not only would this affect our state agencies’ revenue but it’s also unfair to sportsmen who can’t access or afford lead alternatives and depend on hunting and fishing,” said Senator Daines. “Outdoor recreation is part of our Montana way of life—I’ll keep fighting to protect our hunting and fishing legacy and ensuring these decisions are guided by science, not politics.”Last spring, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service entered into settlement negotiations with activist organizations over a lawsuit regarding the use of traditional lead ammunition on over 3 million acres of federal land. Senators Cramer and Daines sent a letter urging FWS Director Martha Williams not to cave into activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands.This bill also comes one week after the FWS published a rule that, while expanding access to hunting and fishing at certain wildlife refuges, phases out the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle.Joining Senators Cramer and Daines are Senators John Thune (R-SD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Rick Scott (R-LA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Dan Sullivan (R-AL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Hoeven (R-ND), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Todd Young (R-IN).

North Dakota has found the right balance because we are naturally agrarian. We understand without sustainability, we have no land or resources to develop. It was a pleasure to show North Dakota’s excellence to leaders from around the United States and the world. I encourage them to follow Brian’s lead and come see our state’s innovation first hand,” said Senator Cramer.   Background:Senator Cramer hosted Mr. Moynihan in Fargo, North Dakota, in November 2021. Mr. Moynihan visited North Dakota State University for moderated discussion and town hall on climate solutions as part of Senator Cramer’s “Bully Pulpit” speaker series. The “Bully Pulpit” brings a variety of public officials and influential leaders to North Dakota to hear from constituents and share their expertise in a format designed for constructive discussions.Senator Cramer highlighted North Dakota’s leadership in research and innovative climate solutions. He emphasized the need for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards that account for emissions reductions rather than targeting specific fuels. There were also presentations on carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), which Mr. Moynihan expressed a desire to learn more about in previous conversations with Senator Cramer. Learn more here.

A summary of the reporting data specific to North Dakota from the last 10 weeks is below.Following STB’s hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” in April, BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific submitted service recovery plans, explaining the specific actions they will take to improve service and identify the specific metrics they will use to evaluate their progress toward such improvements.Starting June 3, the STB is requiring BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific to file service progress reports further explaining efforts to correct service deficiencies. They will continue to file service progress reports every two weeks for six months. Starting June 15, the STB is also requiring all class I railroads to report additional employment data for six months.Grain Car Backlog Status Report:Click here to access the data. Background:In May, Senator Cramer led 20 colleagues in a letter urging the STB to ensure reliable, consistent rail service for American industries and shippers. “We are very concerned over the significant rail service disruptions occurring throughout the U.S. freight rail network. Reports from rail customers, including our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and energy producers, indicate reliable rail service is not being provided in many situations,” wrote the senators. The letter also outlines concerns and issues raised by customers and labor organizations at STB’s April hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” from agricultural producers and grain shippers unable to get empty railcars leading to significant delays in delivering commodities to energy producers forced to curtail production due consistently delayed arrival of railcars. Learn more here. In March, Senator Cramer led colleagues in a letter calling on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet to take action to prevent a Canadian Pacific railway strike. A strike would have significant market implications from agriculture to energy and exacerbate the Biden Administration’s supply chain crisis. Up to 15% of Canadian Pacific’s business is fertilizer shipping and the U.S. relies on the railway to move Alberta crude oil south to U.S. refineries. Learn more here.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/-sen-cramer-discusses-community-care-veterans-issues-with-va-secretary-mcdonough,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) highlighted issues with timely access to community care for veterans, including a veteran on his own staff, with Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough at a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee (SVAC) hearing this week.“I have a staff [member] who is stuck in one of these ruts between the VA and community care. Roughly four months ago, she was told that it would take five months to get an appointment for the particular specific service she needed, obviously well outside the 28 days to qualify. In hopes of not having to wait five months, which by the way in itself is a ridiculous proposition, she sought third-party care or community care. She got approval from the VA to pursue community care, but what she got caught up in is the authorization system. The movement of information from the VA to the third party administrator, back and forth, back and forth, which became very frustrating,” explained Senator Cramer. “One of the more concerning issues for me is there’s this pointing of the finger back and forth between the two entities. We sent it, we didn’t receive it, we faxed it, we didn’t get it. Now I suppose they could both be right, but right now I have a staff [member] who is neither getting the care and at the same time, sort of anxious about where’s all my personal healthcare information that keeps getting faxed.” Senator Cramer emphasized this is not the first time constituents have had issues with the VA health care system and discussed underlying issues in the bureaucracy.“I would like to say this is the only one that I’ve had to deal with, but I have constituents who have had very similar situations where days turn into weeks turn into months,” said Senator Cramer. “I’m afraid the VA like every bureaucracy around here, if [Congress doesn’t] prescribe in law precisely what they have to do, and write into law precisely what they’re prohibited from doing, they’ll do whatever they want to do.” He then pivoted to a discussion on solutions and proposed the inclusion of critical access hospitals as an extension of the VA health care system to ensure veterans in rural communities have timely access to care.“I want to be part of the solution. A lot of us are from rural states, you’re hearing a lot of the rural issues—the access issues are particularly relevant to them. Would it be possible that in a state like Montana, Alaska, or North Dakota, where we have a lot of critical access hospitals, which are critical access because they’re so far from other places. They’re hospitals that run on very small margins, have very small populations, but they’re still necessary. Is there a way that we could work on something where at least, we could simplify it for those people in those very remote rural places and make a critical access hospital an extension of the VA?” said Senator Cramer. Secretary McDonough responded positively to Senator Cramer’s critical access hospitals proposal and committed to resolving the staff member’s health care scheduling issue.“I visited a facility like that with Senator Moran in Kansas and we do a lot of business in that facility for vets in Kansas. So I think there’s a way to make this work. I’m open to having that conversation… but it seems like something that we could do some work on. I also worry about your staff member. I’m confident if she’s comfortable talking to our Office of Community Care, we can get that worked out,” responded Secretary McDonough. “I appreciate that and we'll follow up on that. I’ve had other people that I’ve helped in similar situations where when I make the inquiry, it gets solved. But every time I do that, it bothers me because I think of how many people don’t know me. Most people know me in North Dakota just like everyone knows Senator Tester in Montana, but there are some people who don’t think to call their senator,” concluded Senator Cramer. “You don't want to have to have that special pleading,” agreed Secretary McDonough.  "
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-questions-ceos-of-americas-largest-banks-on-efforts-to-block-gun-purchases-legal-commerce,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) pressed CEOs of America’s largest retail banks to protect and process all transactions for legal goods and services in light of political pressure to legislate social policy issues through financial services and institutions at a Senate Banking Committee hearing today.Senator Cramer encouraged the panel of bank CEOs to stand up to the left’s radical economic policies. “Please resist the impulse to respond to the very loud noise in your left ear. I’m happy to be the loud noise in your right ear. When it comes to being one of the cool crowd, I know the pressure that you feel and I’m sorry that sometimes those of us on the conservative side aren’t as activist-oriented. But I want to help you,” said Senator Cramer.  Senator Cramer highlighted his recent letter to the Bank Policy Institute which urges the organization to resist political pressure to block legal transactions and insert financial institutions into controversial social issues. The letter follows an announcement from Visa, Mastercard, and American Express to implement a new Merchant Category Code for gun and ammunition stores.“Last evening, I led a letter that was signed by nearly all of the Republicans on this [Committee] to the Bank Policy Institute, and you’re all members, regarding this new Merchant Category Code for gun and ammunition stores. I want to be clear about who did this. The International Organization for Standardization [did this] against the wishes of the credit card companies who opposed it in the beginning, the voted against it on the advisory committee, their opposition was upheld, and then ISO did it anyway. They did it at the urging of a very liberal activist bank, Amalgamated Bank. I want to ask each of you—as the carriers, as the acquirers, as the facilitators that are providing the capital—can you commit in front of this committee, and the pay-per-view audience that’s listening and watching, that your bank will process all transactions for the purchase of legal goods and services, and I might add constitutionally protected goods?” asked Senator Cramer.All seven witnesses—Wells Fargo & Company CEO Charles Scharf, Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Truist Financial Corporation Chairman and CEO William Rogers Jr., U.S. Bancorp Chairman, President, and CEO Andy Cecere, and PNC Financial Services Group Chairman, President, and CEO William Demchak—committed to processing all transactions of legal goods and services, including guns and ammunition.Senator Cramer then pressed Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on the bank’s history of restricting retail lending to the firearm industry.“Citibank has in particular given me some pause. When your bank has voluntarily committed to restrict lending to firearm retail clients unless they meet your specific criteria, which in many cases exceeds the law. I want extra assurances that law abiding gun purchasers across the country will not be discriminated against using this Merchant Category Code as a means to an end,” said Senator Cramer. “We respect the Second Amendment. As I said, we do not intend to use the code to restrict or limit any purchases of firearm sales by our credit card customers. We do not do so today. We do believe in best practices for the sale of the retail sale of firearms and that is the policy that we’ve had for a while now. Most retailers follow those best practices,” replied Ms. Fraser.“I would say most gun owners do as well. The vast majority of them are very good people,” responded Senator Cramer. Senator Cramer concluded with an invite for each CEO to visit North Dakota and witness the beauty and efficiency of a clean energy economy firsthand.“I want to invite you all to follow in the footsteps of Mr. Moynihan. Come to North Dakota. I want to show you real progress in transitioning to a cleaner energy economy that utilizes, not regulation, but rather innovation and the great riches that God has given us below, on top, and above the earth,” concluded Senator Cramer.

This funding was made available through the Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot Program and will be used for road maintenance at the crossroad of US Highway 2 and US Highway 52, commonly referred to as Brooks Junction, west of Minot. In a letter to DoD, the delegation urged for the approval of NDDOT’s request, outlining the need to reduce risk of washouts along the high traffic route to support the operations of the 91st Missile Wing at the Minot Air Force Base (MAFB) as well as the local agriculture and energy sector in North Dakota.“Both highways have an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of approximately 5,500 vehicles and are used not only by the 91st Missile Wing, but also the agriculture and energy sectors in the state,” wrote the delegation. “In order to ensure the resiliency of this vital network, three structures will be replaced, including a mission-essential structure used by the 91st Missile Wing for convoy operations that include a large number of security forces and maintenance vehicles. The proposed project would provide improved reliability and safety, while supporting our nation’s defense as well as domestic food and energy security.”

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-pushes-back-on-efforts-to-track-gun-purchases-destructive-economic-policies-of-the-left-on-mornings-with-maria,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Fox Business’ Mornings with Maria to preview the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing with the CEOs of America’s largest retail banks and his letter to push back on credit card companies’ efforts to track gun purchases. Excerpts and full video are below.On the New MCC to Track Gun Purchases:“One of the ways, Maria, that liberals have attacked legal, constitutionally protected gun ownership is by trying to choke out their capital. Some of that is through the ESG movement, a lot of it’s due to things like the international standards, which by the way was led by a bank. Amalgamated Bank, a large liberal bank, is pushing this left-wing agenda. The problem with all of [this] is that banks are heavily regulated. They are federally insured, which is not unimportant. I think that puts them in a different category in terms of their legal requirements. So when you start pushing the value chain, if you can’t get a bank to do it, get the credit card companies, if the credit card companies won’t create this category, let’s go to the international standards. Who in the supply chain is going to stand up to this left-wing nonsense and not become a tool of the Left, but rather be the banks that we need them to be.”   On the Left-Wing Agenda of Irresponsible Fiscal Policies:“I think once that gig was up, they had to admit even though they called it inflation reduction it was inflation enhancement. To Jamie Dimon’s point, this runaway government spending, supercharging the demand side of our economy while the supply side continues to be hurt has led to this inflation. We need to get our arms wrapped around that with regard to the ESG piece. That’s part of the problem. The left continues to use capital, use the highly regulated banking industry as well as the index industry to try and shape their policies in ways that they can’t get done through the legislative process. It’s very unfair. In my view it is illegal and that’s why I introduced the Fair Access to Banking Act. This is why I joined Senator Sullivan’s INDEX Act to make sure there’s a loud noise in the right ear of these bank presidents, CEOs, and their boards who are responding to the loud noise in their left ear through activist investors and even staff members. We need to rebalance all of this. I think, quite honestly, that the banks themselves would just soon get in the business of banking… They have enough problems there without having to deal with these highly charged political fights.” On Climate and Economic Policy: “I don’t know a single bank president that wants to destroy the American economy. And yet you have a lot of the people in power [who are] pushing them do exactly that because they have some fantasy that somehow tomorrow we can be at net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Never mind that they just want to transfer climate guilt to polluting countries so that they can feel better about themselves. It’s crazy. People like Jamie Dimon, Brian Moynihan, David Solomon, and others that I’ve talked to, they’re looking for real solutions to a transition that doesn’t destroy the American economy. We can provide that through modern technologies and innovation, but certainly not through regulation.”

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-leads-banking-republicans-in-pushing-back-on-efforts-to-track-gun-purchases-block-legal-commerce,"WASHINGTON – Ahead of today’s Senate Banking Hearing with the CEOs of America’s largest retail banks, U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) led his Senate Banking Republican colleagues in sending a letter to the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), urging the organization to resist political pressure to block legal transactions and insert financial institutions into controversial social issues.Last week, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express announced they will implement a new merchant category code for gun and ammunition stores. This action follows the International Organization for Standardization’s controversial decision to establish the new merchant category code proposed by a bank whose mission is to advance left-wing causes.“The creation of the new merchant category code was celebrated widely by liberal Democrats and gun-control advocates. They have made it clear this is just the beginning of their campaign to block legal purchases of firearms,” wrote the letter. “In the face of this coming political pressure, we expect BPI’s members to demonstrate a commitment to process all transactions for the purchase of legal goods and services, including firearms, and maintain the financial privacy of consumers.” The senators expressed concerns that these efforts will undermine the ability of lawful Americans to exercise their constitutional Second Amendment rights.“Let us be clear: banks should not misuse their power to hinder the ability of law-abiding Americans to exercise a constitutional right by creating de-facto bans on legal firearm purchases. Addressing complex and contentious social and policy issues that involve balancing competing values is the job of democratically-elected leaders, not unelected bank executives. We urge BPI’s members to resist the political pressure to insert themselves into such issues, especially firearms. Instead, our nation’s largest financial institutions should focus on serving the needs of their customers without bias,” concluded the letter. Senator Cramer is joined by Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Senators Richard Shelby (R-AL), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Tim Scott (R-SC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Steve Daines (R-MT).Click here to read the letter.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-urges-use-of-one-federal-decision-rule-to-speed-up-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-projects-at-epw-hearing,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, discussed the importance of One Federal Decision in expediting project approvals, flexibility provided to states through formula funding, and ideas to streamline the grant application processes at a Senate Environment and Public Works hearing on the state and local perspective of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.“Listening, particularly to the three local and state officials, your stories, your reflections, and your experiences reflect the diversity of our great country. [They] serve as testimony each individually and all together as to why flexibility is so darn important. I hear about drought in Arizona and flooding in the Northeast. We have a diverse country. Our geology is different. Our hydrology is different. Our demography is different. We’re all different. This speaks volumes [about] the importance of federalism and states having more control,” said Senator Cramer. Senator Cramer then pivoted to a discussion on the importance of One Federal Decision and reining in the bureaucracy to cut down project timelines with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Executive Director Jim Tymon. “[The bureaucracy] almost never pays attention until we tell them what they’re prohibited from doing. The lack of a prohibition to them is a license to do whatever they want. That’s what you’re experiencing… I want to go into something we haven’t talked about that was in the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law] specifically, and that is the One [Federal Decision] rule. One [Federal] Decision is not to cut corners. It’s not designed to diminish the integrity of oversight or environmental protection. I think you can do it much, much better; much, much faster; [and] with more efficiency and integrity, [through One Federal Decision]. If you do them chronologically, rather than concurrently, you’re going to add time. But if you do it concurrently, you’re going to add synergy. Not just efficiency, but synergy. [This is] what makes sense to me, but the bureaucracy likes chronological because it serves their interests best. That way every agency can take as long as they want to do a simple thing and then pass it to another agency to take as long as they want to do a simple thing. The [One Federal Decision] rule is not being utilized, and I think [it] could be the answer to a lot of your challenges. Couldn’t the [One Federal Decision] become part of the solution?” asked Senator Cramer. Mr. Tymon, who represents State Departments of Transportation, agreed with Senator Cramer and supported finding ways to expedite the approval of infrastructure projects.“I do think that every state [Department of Transportation] in the country supports finding ways to expedite the approval of projects and doing it in a responsible way where we’re not harming the environment. I do think that the [One Federal Decision] provisions do carve out a path for there to be a more efficient decision-making process. We’ve been advocating for 10-15 years for a more concurrent review process as opposed to consecutive. I think this provides a good foundation for us to move forward in that direction,” said Mr. Tymon.Senator Cramer concluded by asking for ways to simplify the discretionary grant application process to remove bureaucratic obstacles and get infrastructure dollars out to communities faster.“On the issue of discretionary grants, we’ve heard about the importance of the formula. Again, can we simplify even the discretionary grant programs by just applying the basics? I get that [the bureaucracy is] coming up with more ways to make it harder rather than facilitating it in my view,” said Senator Cramer. “For several of the discretionary grants, [there’s] a common application, and I have to give a lot of credit for that because I think that did help. For people that were potential grantees, they were able to just go to one application, but it wasn’t for every discretionary grant that they had out there. I think that is going to be a challenge for this Administration moving forward, given the size of the discretionary grants and the number of them, how can they do that in an efficient manner to process those applications and get the dollars out on the street I think that’s going to be very tough,” responded Mr. Tymon.

They will also expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment."
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/nd-delegation-cbp-agrees-to-temporarily-expand-operating-hours-at-maida-northgate-sherwood-ports-of-entry-in-north-dakota,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and John Hoeven (R-ND) and Congressman Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) Armstrong today announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agreed to temporarily expand operating hours at Maida, Northgate and Sherwood ports of entry (POE) in North Dakota. Pending agreement from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the hours of operation at these three POEs will be 9am to 7pm, 10 hours per day.“While it’s encouraging to see the temporary expansion of hours at the Maida, Northgate, and Sherwood ports of entry, Customs and Border Protection’s work is far from over. Temporary won’t cut it and our neighbors to the north, Canada, must do the same. North Dakotans’ ability to conduct cross-border activity remains unnecessarily restricted as CBP refuses to return to pre-pandemic hours at our ports of entry. We will continue to push for the restoration of full operation hours at all ports of entry in North Dakota to accommodate lawful travel and trade with Canada, our close ally and largest trading partner. At a time when the U.S. economy is suffering from record high inflation, it is critical we remove obstacles to the legitimate flow of goods and services and alleviate the mounting strain on the supply chain. The President declared the pandemic over the other day, it’s past time to return to pre-pandemic hours at the northern border ports of entry in North Dakota,” said Senator Cramer.  “The limited hours of operation at our northern ports of entry have created real challenges for North Dakota’s residents and our economy,” said Senator Hoeven. “That’s why we’ve been working to get CBP to extend the operating hours at our state’s POEs, including through our letter to CBP Commissioner Magnus and in calls I held with CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner Flores. Today’s announcement is an important step. However, more needs to be done, and we will continue to press CBP and the CBSA to return to pre-pandemic levels of operation at our northern ports of entry.”“It is important to many North Dakotans and our state’s economy that ports of entry with Canada are accessible. It is positive that CBP has reevaluated and will extend operating hours at these three crossings,” said Congressman Armstrong. “We need to build on this development by expanding access at additional ports of entry and encouraging CBSA to match them. We will continue working to expand trade and cooperation with our northern ally.”Following pressure from the North Dakota congressional delegation, CBP is temporarily expanding hours at three high-priority POEs, including Maida, Northgate, and Sherwood, for 120 days. After 120 days, CBP will make a recommendation on “the path forward for these three locations.” The agency did not commit to opening other POEs in North Dakota.Background:In July, Senator Cramer led the North Dakota congressional delegation in calling on CBP to return the northern border ports of entry to pre-pandemic hours. North Dakota ports of entry continue to exercise reduced and restricted operating hours first introduced at the beginning of the pandemic over two years ago. Learn more here.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/09/16/2022/sen-cramer-rail-companies-issue-status-reports-on-grain-car-backlog,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) announced BNSF Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) publicly filed weekly grain backlog status updates as required by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB). A summary of the reporting data specific to North Dakota from the last 10 weeks is below.Following STB’s hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” in April, BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific submitted service recovery plans, explaining the specific actions they will take to improve service and identify the specific metrics they will use to evaluate their progress toward such improvements.Starting June 3, the STB is requiring BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific to file service progress reports further explaining efforts to correct service deficiencies. They will continue to file service progress reports every two weeks for six months. Starting June 15, the STB is also requiring all class I railroads to report additional employment data for six months.Grain Car Backlog Status Report:Click here to access the data. Background:In May, Senator Cramer led 20 colleagues in a letter urging the STB to ensure reliable, consistent rail service for American industries and shippers.“We are very concerned over the significant rail service disruptions occurring throughout the U.S. freight rail network. Reports from rail customers, including our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and energy producers, indicate reliable rail service is not being provided in many situations,” wrote the senators. The letter also outlines concerns and issues raised by customers and labor organizations at STB’s April hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” from agricultural producers and grain shippers unable to get empty railcars leading to significant delays in delivering commodities to energy producers forced to curtail production due consistently delayed arrival of railcars. Learn more here. In March, Senator Cramer led colleagues in a letter calling on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet to take action to prevent a Canadian Pacific railway strike. A strike would have significant market implications from agriculture to energy and exacerbate the Biden Administration’s supply chain crisis. Up to 15% of Canadian Pacific’s business is fertilizer shipping and the U.S. relies on the railway to move Alberta crude oil south to U.S. refineries. Learn more here.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-sen-cramer-op-ed-one-simple-way-congress-can-support-women-and-unborn-children,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on his bill, the Unborn Child Support Act, which requires child support payments to begin when life does: at conception. While this idea is not new, there is now a greater responsibility to protect and support life in a post Roe v. Wade society.“Pro-abortion activists often quip that pro-life supporters only care about the unborn child. This is fundamentally untrue. We believe each and every life is sacred. Therefore, we must particularly emphasize compassion and support for new mothers, unborn children, and families,” wrote Senator Cramer. “Though I believe fatherhood is both a blessing and obligation and that fathers bear responsibility for the child they helped create, I also recognize that child support is not the solution for every situation. That’s why the Unborn Child Support Act protects mothers who do not wish to seek financial compensation from the father by exempting them from a paternity test if it would put the mother or child at risk,” continued Senator Cramer. “In this age of polarization, the Unborn Child Support Act is something all Americans should rally behind. It is a vital step toward ensuring mothers and children are well cared for and fathers embrace the responsibility of bringing life into the world,” concluded Senator Cramer. One Simple Way Congress Can Support Women and Unborn ChildrenBy Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND)Washington Examiner9.16.2022“The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade is one of the most consequential court decisions of my lifetime. Countless lives are saved by this decision and society is a much better place for it. When new souls are born, new ideas, dreams, and purpose come alive, which enlightens and enlivens our world. “Pro-abortion activists often quip that pro-life supporters only care about the unborn child. This is fundamentally untrue. We believe each and every life is sacred. Therefore, we must particularly emphasize compassion and support for new mothers, unborn children, and families.“To help achieve this mission, I introduced the Unborn Child Support Act in July  to provide assistance for children long before they are delivered. Maximum care must begin at the first moment of life: conception. My bill empowers mothers by giving them the choice to receive child support payments as early as the first month of their pregnancy.“Though I believe fatherhood is both a blessing and obligation and that fathers bear responsibility for the child they helped create, I also recognize that child support is not the solution for every situation. That’s why the Unborn Child Support Act protects mothers who do not wish to seek financial compensation from the father by exempting them from a paternity test if it would put the mother or child at risk. “However, if the mother reconsiders, the courts are required to issue a paternity test and retroactively award child support payments, starting from conception. Child support payment eligibility, which requires confirmation of the father’s identity, remains the same. The best interest of the mother and child are always paramount.“These ideas are not new – I introduced this same legislation during Congress’s last term.. But with the advent of Dobbs v. Jackson and its overturning of Roe v. Wade, there is an even greater opportunity to protect life in this country. “Public polling proves most Americans want to take advantage of this opportunity. According to the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy, there is widespread, bipartisan support for child support payments that begin at conception. Nearly half the respondents were in favor of child support payments beginning at conception (47%), including 53% of Democrats, and 49% of those who described themselves as pro-choice.  “It seems this is one issue on which both sides of the political aisle can agree. Take, for example, a tweet from liberal actor and activist Ken Olin published in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. ‘In states where abortion is illegal, the father should be financially on the hook at the moment of conception,’ he wrote. While I reject the notion that a father’s financial obligations should be limited only to certain states, Olin’s sentiments reflect a basic consensus: mothers and their children should be supported by the father.“In this age of polarization, the Unborn Child Support Act is something all Americans should rally behind. It is a vital step toward ensuring mothers and children are well cared for and fathers embrace the responsibility of bringing life into the world.”"
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-remove-burdensome-regulations-on-american-trucking-industry,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, joined Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) in introducing legislation that would remove burdensome government regulations, which are impacting the agricultural industry, school districts, and trucking companies in North Dakota.In 2012, then-President Obama signed into law legislation that set in motion a new rule that created a requirement for Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT). The final rulemaking went into effect earlier this year. All new drivers who wish to obtain their Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) must now complete ELDT, adding a burdensome requirement at a time when the American Trucking Association estimates a nationwide trucker shortage of 80,000 drivers. Additionally, this requirement is costly and time consuming. ELDT training classes range from $450 to $8,500, depending on the trainer, and can take anywhere from three days to 20 days to complete.The Trucking Regulations Unduly Constricting Known Service-providers (TRUCKS) Act, would allow states to issue a new “Small Business Restricted CDL” so ELDT requirements would not affect small businesses with nine CDLs or less. This would make certain any driver obtaining a CDL without completing the ELDT process could not switch to a larger company and bring a “Small Business Restricted CDL” with them. Further, it would protect small businesses from these constricting regulations so they can fill their positions in a timely manner and remain competitive in the industry. Additionally, the TRUCKS Act would allow states to exempt employees of agriculture-related industries, school districts, and local units of governments (including county, municipal and tribal), from ELDT requirements to obtain their CDL.“With the current supply chain issues and shortage of truck drivers nationwide at a time of tremendous demand, the last thing the transportation industry needs is more overbearing, bureaucratic red tape placed on them by the Biden Administration,” said Senator Cramer. “The TRUCKS Act allows states to exempt certain drivers from new ELDT requirements and provide regulatory relief to small trucking businesses ensuring we have drivers on the road to keep interstate commerce moving.”“At a time when our nation is in a recession and faced with worker shortages and supply chain issues, American businesses should not have to battle the heavy hand of government,” said Senator Rounds. “We should be working on policies to help our producers and consumers, not hurt them. This legislation eases the burden on small trucking companies, agricultural producers, school districts and local units of government. It also gives power back to the states so they can decide their own rules of the road.”Click here for bill text.In addition to Senators Cramer and Rounds, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators John Hoeven (R-ND) and Roger Marshall (R-KS).“At a time when we already have a shortage of drivers and continued supply chain constraints, the FMCSA’s new training requirements impose higher costs and discourage new drivers from entering the workforce,” said Senator Hoeven. “Our legislation provides important regulatory relief and flexibility by allowing exemptions for agriculture, small businesses and state and local governments. This will help ensure farmers, ranchers and other small businesses, as well as school districts and other government entities have access to the reliable and affordable transportation services they need while ensuring safety on our roads.”“Custom harvesters across Kansas are overregulated by federal rulemakers who have never worked on a harvest crew,” said Senator Marshall. “The ELDT requirements for new drivers are burdensome to small trucking companies, and this legislation is a common sense reform to eliminate barriers for small businesses, farmers, and custom harvesters crews who are already hard pressed to find an adequate amount of drivers.”Background:In 2012, then-President Obama signed into law the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act. The law includes a provision, which added an additional section to the federal law dealing with CDLs. The provision directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations establishing minimum entry-level driver training (ELDT) requirements for an individual operating a commercial motor vehicle. A 2020 interim final rule was finalized in June 2021 with a compliance deadline of February 7, 2022. The regulation (ELDT) applies to individuals seeking to obtain a Class A or B CDL for the first time, a Passenger (P), HAZMAT (H), or School Bus (S) endorsement for the first time or if trying to upgrade from a Class B CDL to a Class A CDL or a Class C CDL to a Class B CDL. The Class A CDL allows truckers to drive vehicles that are heavier than what is allowed with only a Class B CDL. ELDT does not apply to those obtaining a Class C CDL.Prior to the implementation of ELDT, in order to get a CDL, applicants had to do the following: Under this new rule, CDL applicants have to complete the following additional ELDT requirements:

Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, questioned Shailen Bhatt, nominee to be Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) at a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee hearing today. Senator Cramer pressed Bhatt to rein in the bureaucracy and focus on implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as Congress intended it.Senator Cramer discussed the FWHA’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Performance Measure Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which imposes GHG performance measures on state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations without any new authority from Congress. He said “it directly contradicts” the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He also emphasized the different needs of rural states, like North Dakota, while highlighting the importance of these considerations and state flexibility when developing regulations.“I come from a rural state, North Dakota. We have a lot more miles of highway than we have people. But we take very seriously that we grow a lot of food commodities to feed a hungry world. That big world that’s hungry is far from North Dakota. We [produce] a lot of energy for a growing national economy and global economy. We used to do a lot more of it, but we’d like to do it again. So this vast system of highways that we manage is very important, and it’s very, very rural. The regulations that come out of the Federal Highway Administration need to reflect that. Not every place is New York. Not every place has a coast, but the coast has fierce advocates and the mountains have fierce advocates and so do prairies of the Midwest. Everybody’s just a little bit different and I think that rules have to reflect that. But in the proposed greenhouse gas emissions [performance measure] rule, one of the things indicates is the [Department of Transportation] can replace cars and trucks with a transit system. Well, we don’t have the type of population density in North Dakota that that’s even plausible or possible, much less, should be part of any rule. Getting back to flexibility, it is really, really critical,” said Senator Cramer. Senator Cramer then pivoted to needed permitting and efficiency reform, especially when it comes to unelected agency bureaucrats.“I want to highlight that we reached a consensus in this country and we agreed that there’s a need to streamline regulatory review. The [One Federal Decision] that we’ve talked about already was part of [the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law]. We codified that in the [law]. Now we discussed other things that didn’t become part of the bill. One of my frustrations as we’re having a debate in the Senate right now over permitting reform, is that when we come up with permitting reforms and we try to legislate them, what I’ve noticed is that unless we tell the bureaucracy exactly what they are required to do, and furthermore, tell them exactly what they’re prohibited from doing, they’ll do whatever they want to do. So please help me be reassured that you’re going to advocate for states and for states’ rights,” asked Senator Cramer. In response, Mr. Bhatt committed to working with states and localities for solutions as opposed to imposing one-size-fits-all mandates.“All I can say is I understand. In Colorado, as an example, the transportation solutions that made sense in the Denver metro area, were not what we were discussing out in the eastern plains or in other more rural parts of the state. My commitment is that I think the best solutions are the ones that are brought forth from the states and make sense in that it’s not a one-size-fits-all. It’s what that local decision [to] make. On the permitting side, I think it is just so critical from a safety perspective, from a cost effectiveness [perspective] that we get these projects delivered on time and on budget, that would be my commitment,” responded Mr. Bhatt.Senator Cramer concluded by encouraging Mr. Bhatt to advocate for innovation and permitting reforms if confirmed.“By the way, the fact that Senator Hickenlooper vouches for you is good, but the fact that former Governor Hickenlooper vouches for you is even better. Like all these former governors in the Senate, we have lots of them. They bring a level of common sense that’s not as common as it ought to be,” said Senator Cramer. “Senator Hickenlooper is quoted in the Denver Post that you’re a fierce advocate for innovation is hopeful. Because I do believe that there are innovations that can allow us to do more, quicker, efficiently without compromising the integrity of our care for the environment and the tax dollar.” Click Here to WatchBackground:In February, Senator Cramer led his colleagues in two letters to the U.S. Department of Transportation pressing the Biden Administration to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) according to the law and highlighting concerns with the FHWA-issued guidance. The IIJA also explicitly excluded language to limit states from expanding their infrastructure beyond the maintenance of existing roads and highways and codified expedited permitting reforms for highway projects. During bill negotiations, Senator Cramer secured the traditional split of Highway Trust Fund program dollars of 90 percent formula funding to 10 percent discretionary grants, ensuring states have consistent funding and the flexibility to meet their constituents’ needs.At an EPW hearing in March, Senator Cramer pressed Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to rescind their flawed guidance regarding the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.When the FWHA’s proposed rule to impose greenhouse gas emissions performance measures on state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations was released in July 2022, Senator Cramer issued the following statement:“The Biden Administration’s Federal Highway Administration is veering off course once again. First, they issued guidance aiming to upend the funding flexibility given to states and now they want to saddle state transportation departments with emission reduction requirements. This proposed rule needs to be fully rescinded.”

Agreements like today’s highlight the need for a more comprehensive trade agreement between our nations. North Dakota farmers and ranchers are national leaders in the production of food for a hungry world. We are committed to supporting the peace and stability of one of America’s most important partners in the Asia-Pacific region through the strengthening of our economic partnership.”The 2022 Taiwan Agricultural Trade Goodwill Mission was led by Dr. Ching-Cheng Huang, Deputy Minister of Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture. The Mission signed three Letters of Intent (LOI) with the U.S. Soybean Export Council, the U.S. Grains Council, and the U.S. Wheat Associates. The LOIs outline Taiwan’s intention to purchase corn, soybeans, and wheat from the United States in 2023 and 2024, with a total estimated commitment of more than $3.2 billion dollars.Taiwan is the 7th largest overseas market for U.S. agricultural products, with a total trade volume of 3.9 billion in 2021. In terms of per capita consumption, Taiwan is the 4th largest consumer of U.S. agricultural products. North Dakota is a national leader in soybean, corn, wheat, and beef production which make up the largest agriculture exports to Taiwan.After their visit to D.C., the two delegations will travel to 7 states to meet with state government officials, farmers, exporters, and related industries to explore opportunities for business or other forms of cooperation. The Soybean and Corn Delegations will visit Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and Kentucky; the Wheat Delegation will visit Kansas, Oregon, and Idaho.Background:In May, Senator Cramer joined Senators Jim Risch (R-ID), Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and 49 Senate colleagues in penning a letter to President Joe Biden urging the Administration to include Taiwan as a partner in the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The senators argued that failing to include Taiwan in IPEF runs counter to U.S. economic interests in the region, yet the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Biden Administration’s largest trade initiative, still excludes Taiwan.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-cramer-rubio-bill-would-make-it-illegal-for-protestors-to-block-interstates,"WASHINGTON – Over the last several years, protesters have increasingly adopted the tactic of blocking interstate highways, risking the safety of commuters, first responders, and other travelers on our nation’s roadways. While some states have criminalized such acts, there is no federal law against doing so. U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Safe Passage on Interstates Act to criminalize this dangerous and disruptive practice. “The Constitution is clear in granting Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. The Safe Passage on Interstates Act reasserts Congress’ critical role by making intentional obstruction of interstates illegal,” said Senator Cramer. “Antifa and other radical protesters who block highways disrupt law-abiding Americans from driving to work, school buses from getting kids to school, and ambulances from getting to the hospital. It’s ridiculous that there is no federal law against this type of stunt. We need to make sure people face criminal penalties for blocking interstate systems that we all rely on,” said Senator Rubio.The Safe Passage on Interstates Act would apply to any intentional obstruction of traffic on an interstate highway, so long as it occurs without proper governmental authorization.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-discusses-inflation-ukraine-on-kudlow,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Budget and Armed Services Committees, joined Larry Kudlow on Fox Business to discuss the higher-than-expected August inflation report and war in Ukraine. Hours after the release of a hot inflation report, President Biden and Democrats gathered on the White House lawn to celebrate the passage of their $700 billion tax and spend “Inflation Enhancement Act.” Excerpts and full video are below.On Bidenflation:“With regard to the party over at the White House, the only thing I can say is the one thing that’s more incompetent than their policy is their politics. How you can be so tone deaf as to celebrate on this day a bill that they dubbed the ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ is beyond tone deafness. With regard to [today’s inflation numbers], I wasn’t at all surprised [by] the fact it came in worse than what was expected. It didn’t surprise me at all for all the reasons you’ve been talking about. We should be crystal clear, Larry, this is the Biden Administration’s fault. It’s not anybody else’s [fault]. No one else shares this with him except the Administration and the Democrats in Congress.” “When you look at the numbers year over year, they’re obviously bad. Food inflation is the highest it’s been since Jimmy Carter was president. Shelter inflation (housing) is the highest it’s been since 1982. This is all because of that American Rescue Plan—$2 trillion poured onto the economy. Now recently, the three-quarters of a trillion dollars they poured on [the economy] that came in the form of this ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ which is really the Green New Deal. And then you throw on this crazy student loan forgiveness thing. It’s no wonder that inflation is rampant and it’s going to go on for a long time. I agree with you. I do not see an end in sight, certainly for the next several quarters.”On the 2022 Election: “I don’t see how we can undo something while Joe Biden is still in the White House unless that long lost Joe Biden that was once a dealmaker [and] that was transactional, unless we could find that Joe Biden again. Maybe in a divided government, we could at least undo some of the damage. Even with a divided House [of Representatives] and Senate at least we can stop some of the bleeding. But it’s important we take Senate. Larry, let me just tell you, we’re going to. I know some people are wringing their hands looking at recent trends. I’m telling you Republicans are going to take the House [of Representatives] and we’re going to take the Senate. When we do, the one piece of leverage we have that is significant is the confirmation of nominees and the promotion of people in the Pentagon and the State Department. The Senate has that unique power and we have to wield it and use it with every possible measure that we can to stop some of this stuff and try to change the trajectory. We need a supply-side solution really, really quickly and we need to get about it right away.”On Ukraine and Vladimir Putin:“First of all, we ought to enjoy the victories when we can get them, and certainly the momentum in Ukraine provides some opportunity. We also have to be careful not to spike the football before we cross the goal line. That said, [before] coming down here to talk to you, I was with some former Members of Parliament from Ukraine who are here advocating for their country and giving us the lowdown. They’re feeling pretty good and quite optimistic. I hate to keep using sports illustrations, but war is a lot like sports, in that, momentum means as much as anything. Momentum generates success and success attracts more success. One of the challenges I think that is going to be interesting to watch from a distance is how this affect[s] Vladimir Putin at home [and] the resolve of the Russian people—many of whom didn’t have their hearts in this in the first place. So I think as life gets more challenging for Vladimir Putin, the momentum continues with the people of Ukraine and those very brave warriors that are fighting with not nearly as good weapon systems, but a lot more heart and quite frankly, a lot fewer of them. But remember what they’re fighting for—they’re fighting for their freedom and their country. That’s a great motivator.” “You don’t go into that lightly when you’re dealing with a thug like [Putin]. He’s always got his hand on the red button, and that scares a lot of people, rightfully so. It’s to be taken seriously. Even a dictatorial thug like Vladimir Putin can’t control millions of people when they turn on him. So we need to continue to support Ukraine, and we need Ukraine [to] keep this momentum. I’d like to see even more support from other European allies. The United States is carrying a pretty big part of this burden. But at the same time, Larry, we need to come to the rescue of Europe with clean, American-produced oil and natural gas to fill that void as well. That will help our economy, that helps their security, it is good for the world.”

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-republicans-unprecedented-drug-price-control-scheme-threatens-innovation-future-drug-costs,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) in expressing concerns with the establishment of a permanent government price-setting program for pharmaceutical drugs, funded by billions of taxpayer dollars, in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act, and raising questions regarding federal health agencies’ plans for program implementation.In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator (CMS) Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the Senators highlight the outsize risks the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, and urge the officials to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D) and domestic manufacturing.“As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years… Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars. The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight,” wrote the senators. In addition to Senators Cramer and Crapo, the letter is signed by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Rob Portman (R-OH), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Tim Scott (R-SC), James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Todd Young (R-IN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), John Boozman (R-AR), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).Click here to read the letter.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-call-on-leader-schumer-to-safeguard-national-security-by-voting-on-ndaa,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R- ND), member of the Armed Services Committee, joined Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and 21 Senate colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) demanding the Senate vote on the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) before the end of September. The U.S. House of Representatives approved its version of the legislation in July, with a broad, bipartisan majority voting in support. The letter, sent Thursday, invoked the words of George Washington while calling on Leader Schumer to schedule a vote on the NDAA in time for an open Senate amendment process to take place. Among other priorities, the legislation funds military technology, strengthens capabilities, and delivers a 4.6 percent pay raise to America’s service members.“At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well. Two centuries later, that still rings true. Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight,” wrote the senators.“Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 – 101,” continued the senators. “For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process. As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period.Joining Senators Cramer and Tuberville are U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Mike Lee (R-UT), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Rick Scott (R-FL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN).Click here to read the letter.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-end-overreaching-child-mask-mandates,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Senators John Thune (R-SD) and Richard Burr (R-NC) in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting that the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but a HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated and requires all staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks – even when they are outside on the playground.“This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” wrote the senators. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”The Head Start program is a federal program that provides qualifying, low-income children with early education services. Program facilities are located throughout the nation and, up until the issuance of this IFR, individual locations had been able to set and enforce their own COVID-19 protocols. Although this rule has been halted by federal courts in several states, including South Dakota, the only way to ensure it never sees the light of day is to permanently rescind it nationwide.  Joining Senators Cramer, Thune, and Burr are Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Thom Tillis (R-NC).  Click here to read the letter."
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-discusses-space-innovation-parcs-radar-modernization-at-sasc-nomination-hearing,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), founder and co-chair of the Senate Space Force Caucus, discussed space innovation and the modernization of the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) Radar Warning System at Cavalier Space Force Station at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing to consider the nomination of U.S. Space Force Lieutenant General Bradley C. Saltzman to be General and Chief of Space Operations (CSO).On space innovation, Senator Cramer highlighted the success of the Space Development Agency (SDA) due to its autonomy and independence which has allowed for innovation. He also talked about the benefits of merging SDA with the Space Force and the role of cyber. “You’re in the innovation business if anybody is in the innovation business,” said Senator Cramer. “We’re coming up on October 1st, at which time as a matter of legislative policy, Space Development Agency will move over to Space Force. One of the benefits, I think, of Space Development Agency has been their autonomy. Their independence [has] allowed innovation to really grow. At the same time, I think they and Space Force and all of us will benefit from the discipline, the oversight, and the collective [opportunities and strategies], if you will, of Space Force. And at the same time, there’s been some talk already of cyber. Once again, the coming together of commercial and government becomes all the more critical. Could you elaborate on those specific things—[the role of] small [commercial space companies], SDA and its autonomy blossoming under your jurisdiction, and the role of cyber?” “You hit on the key principle there, and that’s innovation is going to be critical to the success of the Space Force,” agreed Lieutenant General Saltzman. On the small business piece of Senator Cramer’s question, Lieutenant General Saltzman emphasized the need to “pull in as many ideas as possible regardless of the size of the vendor” across the broad space ecosystem to be successful. He then pivoted to the integration of the Space Development Agency into the Space Force. “With regards to the Space Development Agency, I couldn’t agree more. Their innovative business model, if you will, has been very successful in the early efforts associated with missile warning, missile tracking, space data transport layer, etc. When they come over to the Space Force October 1st, we’ve already been working with them. We’ve been planning for months to make that transition seamless, to make it smooth. And we want to make sure that we don’t violate that secret sauce which is the innovation engine of the Space Development Agency. So if confirmed as CSO, I’ll be committed to making sure that we don’t lose the goodness as we bring them over. Now we need to integrate them and make sure they’re a part of the force design that’s what is going to make it an effective force when it’s finally fielded. But I do not want to lose that innovation engine,” said Lieutenant General Saltzman. During his remarks, Senator Cramer pushed for PARCS modernization.“In the last minute, let’s talk a little bit about my favorite space topic: PARCS radar. As you know the Cavalier Space Force station has that beautiful, old, gigantic piece of concrete that watches space and missile warning, of course, as it has for several decades. Modernization is important. Some has taken place there already and appreciate that we were able to put $5 million into the Fiscal Year 2023 NDAA here in the Senate. Hopefully, that survives. In the closing seconds, [can you share] your vision for that radar?” asked Senator Cramer. “The missile warning mission is a no-fail mission for us. Missile tracking is going to be just as important with hypersonics. What those radars provide is not just missile warning, but space domain awareness. I certainly will not be able to do my job if confirmed as CSO if I have no idea what’s going on in space. So the more data that we can collect from the sensors on the planet, the better we’re going to have for space domain awareness, and I think the better we’re going to be able to do our mission,” responded Lieutenant General Saltzman. Senator Cramer ended by announcing his support for Lieutenant General Saltzman’s nomination.“Thank you, General. Good luck and I look forward to supporting you,” concluded Senator Cramer.   Background: Senator Cramer met with Lieutenant General Saltzman last week where they had a conversation on innovation, radar modernization at the Cavalier Space Force Station. In the meeting, Lieutenant General Saltzman discussed his vision regarding future opportunities for the Space Force. Click Here to Watch

The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule,” wrote the senators. Joining Senators Cramer and Lankford are Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).Click here to read the letter."
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-introduce-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, joined Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and 44 Republican colleagues in introducing the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act, comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform legislation.“The backroom so-called permitting reform deal was a farce and we all know it. The quid pro quo of theoretical permitting reform in exchange for $700 billion in new taxes, spending, and inflation doesn’t even count as a feeble effort, but this bill is an incremental move in the right direction. This bill codifies a number of streamlined permitting policies which protect American jobs, decrease costs, and give authority back to state governments, all of which provide certainty to applicants who have to work with the federal government. It will make a difference in a time when we need more energy and infrastructure, not less. My hope is to strengthen this bill with even more meaningful reforms,” said Senator Cramer. “Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” said EPW Ranking Member Capito. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish line.”In addition to Senators Cramer and Capito, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), John Thune (R-SD), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Jim Risch (R-ID), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Braun (R-IN), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Barrasso (R-WY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Steve Daines (R-MT), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Richard Burr (R-NC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Boozman (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tim Scott (R-SC), John Kennedy (R-LA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Rob Portman (R-OH).Click here for bill text.A section-by-section summary can be found here and below.Section 2 - Codification of NEPA Regulations Section 3 - Providing Regulatory CertaintySection 4 - Limiting New Red Tape and Costs for Gasoline and Other FuelsSection 5 - Expediting Permitting and Review ProcessesSection 6 - States’ Authorities in Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations Section 7 - Federal Lands Freedom Act Section 8 - Expedited Approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline Section 9 - Reducing Timeframes for Endangered Species Act ConsultationsSection 10 - New Source Review Permitting Improvement ActSection 11 - No Retroactive Permit VetoesSection 12 – Policy Review under the Clean Air Act

Charter schools offer an affordable, quality education, and present more options for students and parents. We must protect charter schools from the Biden Administration’s bureaucratic red-tape and new regulations on their funding so these institutions can continue to serve and educate their students,” said Senator Cramer. “Time and time again, this administration has bowed to big-labor unions and liberal extremists at the expense of children’s futures. Now they are outdoing themselves with rules that will undermine charter schools — tuition-free, top-notch public education options that serve primarily disadvantaged students,” said Senator Scott. “Support for these schools has never been a partisan issue.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/republican-senators-to-chopra-stop-abusing-your-power-to-advance-liberal-policy-preferences,"The CFPB Must Stay Within the Boundaries of the LawWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and his Banking Committee Republicans blasted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra for pursuing a radical and highly-politicized agenda unbounded by statutory limits, and deploying inappropriate and legally dubious tactics to unfairly damage financial institutions’ reputations and customer relationships.“Rather than operating as a tough, but fair and sensible regulator, the CFPB is again pursuing a radical and highly-politicized agenda unbounded by statutory limits. It has adopted an arrogant regulatory ethos: the CFPB can do whatever it wants. On at least one occasion, the CFPB has been criticized by a federal judge and former regulator for deploying inappropriate and legally dubious tactics that have unfairly damaged financial institutions’ reputations and customer relationships. The CFPB’s actions, which have been uncontrolled and unwarranted, will ultimately lead to costlier credit, or no credit at all, for millions of Americans,” wrote the senators. As the senators point out, the CFPB has abused its authority by using name-and-shame tactics to pressure companies into eliminating overdraft fees. In February 2022, the CFPB published a chart listing the top 20 banks by revenue from overdraft fees, and boasted that its campaign led some banks to change their overdraft policies. In July 2022, Director Chopra stated he was “gratified to see where the market has been shifting” on overdraft fees and publicly warned that the CFPB is “increasing our supervisory scrutiny of the institutions that are most dependent on [overdraft fees] as part of their deposit account fee revenue.”“It is hard to view your statement as anything other than a threat that banks who do not bow to the CFPB’s pressure campaign could expect the agency to unfairly target them for increased supervision,” wrote the senators.Banking Republicans also criticized the CFPB’s recent modification of its own rules of adjudication, which allows the CFPB Director to bypass administrative law judges, making it easier for Director Chopra to act as both prosecutor and judge.“At the best of times, an agency’s own adjudication of an enforcement action brought by the agency itself blurs the constitutional separation of executive and judicial powers. The CFPB’s new rules of adjudication further disregard that separation in order to enable the CFPB Director to avoid even the most modest checks on his power to engage in regulation by enforcement,” continued the senators.  The senators also raised concerns over the CFPB’s highly unusual and improper actions to harm the customer relationships of a bank involved in litigation with the agency. In March 2022, the CFPB sent an unsolicited mass email to the bank’s customers with a survey that referenced the lawsuit and asked prejudicial questions about whether the bank was acting against its customers’ best interests.“While the CFPB has a responsibility to investigate potential fraud, this mass email was not a legitimate investigative or litigation tool, but rather a means to damage the bank’s customer relationships. Not surprisingly, the CFPB’s actions have been widely criticized. A former career CFPB enforcement director criticized the agency’s behavior while a federal judge called the CFPB’s actions ‘a poor choice … that looks to the Court to be designed to create a wedge between Fifth Third and its customers.’ The CFPB, however, arrogantly defended its actions by responding, as the judge put it, ‘we’re the CFPB so, essentially, we can do whatever we want,’” wrote the senators.The letter concludes by urging Director Chopra to stop using improper tactics to harm the reputations of financial institutions and to stay within the boundaries of the law.Click here to read the letter.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-unanimously-passes-senator-cramers-bipartisan-legislation-to-support-veterans-during-their-transition-to-civilian-life,"***Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) to strengthen the Solid Start program. The Solid Start program was created by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during the Trump Administration to contact every veteran three times by phone in the first year after they leave active duty service to check in and help connect them to VA programs and benefits.“Making sure the brave servicemen and women have access to the benefits, healthcare, and other resources they earned is a crucial part of my role on the Veterans Affairs Committee. The Solid Start program was created by the Trump Administration to help veterans transition to civilian life. Our bill codifies this successful program to ensure veterans will have access to the support services they need. I applaud the Senate’s unanimous support and urge its final passage,” said Senator Cramer.“I’ve talked with New Hampshire veterans about the immense challenges that many veterans face when they end their active duty service, and many are not even aware that resources are available from the VA to help with everything from getting mental health care to finding a civilian job,” said Senator Hassan. “Supporting veterans is not a partisan issue, and I am glad to have teamed up with my colleagues across the aisle on this bill to strengthen outreach to veterans. I will continue working to make sure that Granite State veterans receive the support that they need, especially after having sacrificed so much for our freedoms.”“The transition to civilian life is not always easy. Passing this bill through the Senate is one more step towards giving veterans the support they need to ensure they receive the benefits they earned,” said Senator Cassidy. The VA launched the Solid Start program during the Trump Administration with the goal of reaching out by phone to all newly separated veterans three times within their first year of separation to check in and help connect them to VA programs and benefits, regardless of separation type or characterization of service. The program also prioritizes outreach to veterans who accessed mental health resources prior to separation in order to quickly connect at-risk veterans to services. The Solid Start Act of 2021 codifies the program and authorize sufficient funding so that it can continue to serve veterans. Learn more here.

Our heroic veterans were honored at a 30 Year Commemoration Ceremony at the State Veterans Cemetery in Mandan and a military appreciation event featuring the U.S. Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon in New Town. I also presented a flag to WWII Veteran Vern Otterson in Fargo. It was great to receive a tour of Dickinson’s Killdeer Mountain Manufacturing with EXIM Bank Director Spencer Bachus, the Blue Flint Ethanol Plant in Underwood, the Northwood Deaconess Hospital, SpaceAge Synthetics in Fargo, and the State Penitentiary.”“It was a pleasure visiting so many North Dakotans and attending meaningful events throughout every corner of our great state. I’m headed back to Washington, D.C. inspired by North Dakotans' willingness to work hard and their acknowledgment that freedom isn’t free,” said Senator Cramer.

A summary of the reporting data specific to North Dakota from the last 10 weeks is below.Following STB’s hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” in April, BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific submitted service recovery plans, explaining the specific actions they will take to improve service and identify the specific metrics they will use to evaluate their progress toward such improvements.Starting June 3, the STB is requiring BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific to file service progress reports further explaining efforts to correct service deficiencies. They will continue to file service progress reports every two weeks for six months. Starting June 15, the STB is also requiring all class I railroads to report additional employment data for six months.Click here to access the data. Background:In May, Senator Cramer led 20 colleagues in a letter urging the STB to ensure reliable, consistent rail service for American industries and shippers.“We are very concerned over the significant rail service disruptions occurring throughout the U.S. freight rail network. Reports from rail customers, including our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and energy producers, indicate reliable rail service is not being provided in many situations,” wrote the senators. The letter also outlines concerns and issues raised by customers and labor organizations at STB’s April hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” from agricultural producers and grain shippers unable to get empty railcars leading to significant delays in delivering commodities to energy producers forced to curtail production due consistently delayed arrival of railcars. Learn more here. In March, Senator Cramer led colleagues in a letter calling on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet to take action to prevent a Canadian Pacific railway strike. A strike would have significant market implications from agriculture to energy and exacerbate the Biden Administration’s supply chain crisis. Up to 15% of Canadian Pacific’s business is fertilizer shipping and the U.S. relies on the railway to move Alberta crude oil south to U.S. refineries. Learn more here.

Click here for audio.***BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) released a Labor Day video message today:“Happy Labor Day to all of our workers in North Dakota and across the beautiful United States of America. It is a privilege to be able to work, earn a living, and provide for ourselves, our families, and our communities. This is something that was deeply instilled in me by my hardworking parents. My dad was a rural electric lineman and a proud member of the IBEW. My mom did everything from waiting tables to pumping gas at the local farmers’ union station and taking care of elderly. They set an important example for me and a standard for all of us to live up to and that is: work hard to provide for your family and benefit your community.”“Because of the freedoms offered in our great country, we have endless opportunities to create, innovate, and build this nation to be the greatest that it can possibly be. I hope you all enjoy this long weekend. With friends and family and are able to get some well-deserved rest before going back to work tomorrow.”“Have a blessed Labor Day.”Click Here to Watch"
https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-discusses-bidens-partisan-campaign-address-in-philadelphia,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Jackie DeAngelis on Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street to discuss President Joe Biden’s partisan campaign address on Thursday night. Excerpts and full video are below.On the Partisan Campaign Address:“My reaction as I saw it play out: I suspect this is a little more of a comfort zone for Joe Biden—being angry and loud and obnoxious. But it was very unpresidential, to say the least, and disappointing in many respects. You’ve already pointed [out] the fact that he was going to be the great unifier and of course, he abandoned that not just on Thursday night, but the day after he was inaugurated. I just thought this—what I call a very unhealthy obsession with his predecessor—is a sign of great insecurity and, frankly, some desperation. I don’t know why the leader of the free world, the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States would allow his predecessor to spend so much time inside his head. To me, it was a peculiar speech, but it was a campaign speech disguised as some sort of a military exercise.” “If they’re as desperate as I think they probably are, they probably felt like they needed to do something really big. It looked more like the opening to a Batman movie than it did a presidential address, so it was disappointing in that sense. By the way, I don’t think it elevates him at all, but I actually think it reduces his stature with the American public. When he has now taken the military and used them as a political backdrop, things that they’ve accused Donald Trump of doing, [and] the hypocrisy of this unifier versus great divider, which he has clearly become. I  think it’s a recognition they’re in a position where they have to throw Hail Marys in hopes of surviving this next midterm election in a couple of months and they’re trying whatever they can. I also think he’s just a little more comfortable with this sort of message than he is with some sort of more substantive policy message.”“This is part of the strategy to distract away from the policies and the hurt of the American people and to somehow deflect the blame to his predecessor of all things and MAGA Republicans. When you’re a President who has the incredible luxury of having his party in the majority in the House and in the Senate, and as a result of that all-encompassing power, they flooded this economy with over $2.5-3 trillion of free money. [The] economy was already supercharged. Demand was already higher than supply and they increased the demand. We’re still struggling through all of that even with this week’s job numbers, which still remain to be completely analyzed, but it’s all looking awfully flat. The productivity, that’s what I get more concerned about than anything, is down and we’re in a recession while facing this inflationary time. These are things [Joe Biden] doesn’t want us to be thinking about, much less crime-ridden streets and the influx of illegal immigrants.” “I just think that they’re hoping they can somehow change the narrative while they can’t change what’s going on in people’s lives. You cannot convince the American people with all the marketing and backdrops and movie sets in the world that they’re not hurting. They know they’re hurting every time they fill their gas tank or buy groceries or try to buy a home for crying out loud. We’ve yet to see, I think, the worst of the inflation.”Click Here to Watch

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/09/02/2022/sen-cramer-rail-companies-issue-status-reports-on-grain-car-backlog,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) announced BNSF Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) publicly filed weekly grain backlog status updates as required by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB). A summary of the reporting data specific to North Dakota from the last 10 weeks is below.Following STB’s hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” in April, BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific submitted service recovery plans, explaining the specific actions they will take to improve service and identify the specific metrics they will use to evaluate their progress toward such improvements.Starting June 3, the STB is requiring BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific to file service progress reports further explaining efforts to correct service deficiencies. They will continue to file service progress reports every two weeks for six months. Starting June 15, the STB is also requiring all class I railroads to report additional employment data for six months.Grain Car Backlog Status Report: Click here to access the data. Background:In May, Senator Cramer led 20 colleagues in a letter urging the STB to ensure reliable, consistent rail service for American industries and shippers.“We are very concerned over the significant rail service disruptions occurring throughout the U.S. freight rail network. Reports from rail customers, including our manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and energy producers, indicate reliable rail service is not being provided in many situations,” wrote the senators. The letter also outlines concerns and issues raised by customers and labor organizations at STB’s April hearing on “Urgent Issues in Freight Rail Service” from agricultural producers and grain shippers unable to get empty railcars leading to significant delays in delivering commodities to energy producers forced to curtail production due consistently delayed arrival of railcars. Learn more here. In March, Senator Cramer led colleagues in a letter calling on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet to take action to prevent a Canadian Pacific railway strike. A strike would have significant market implications from agriculture to energy and exacerbate the Biden Administration’s supply chain crisis. Up to 15% of Canadian Pacific’s business is fertilizer shipping and the U.S. relies on the railway to move Alberta crude oil south to U.S. refineries. Learn more here.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-demand-answers-on-us-marshals-proposed-sanctuary-policies-to-release-criminal-illegal-immigrants,"BISMARCK, N.D. — U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) in sending a letter to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Ronald Davis urging answers after reports that the USMS is considering a new policy to permit the release of dangerous, criminal aliens before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is able to apprehend these illegal immigrants.""We are deeply concerned to learn that USMS is even considering adopting a policy where it fails to cooperate with a fellow federal law enforcement entity,” wrote the senators. “The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.”“The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of ‘gotaways’ entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies,” continued the senators.The senators concluded, “Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies. Speaking before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that some cities are releasing illegal immigrants, “even if those individuals pose a public safety threat,” and that, “the public’s safety, the public’s well-being . . . is I think at issue.” In light of this public safety risk, Secretary Mayorkas indicated he would be going to municipal leaders and “asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation . . .”Senators Cramer and Tillis were joined by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Tom Cotton (R-AK), James Risch (R-ID), John Hoeven (R-ND), and James Lankford (R-OK). Click here to read the letter.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-discusses-economic-security-concerns-of-fufengs-purchase-of-farmland-near-grand-forks-air-force-base-on-newsmax,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined Newsmax’s American Agenda to discuss the economic and national security concerns of the Fufeng Group’s purchase of farmland near the Grand Forks Air Force Base. Excerpts and full video are below.On Chinese Infiltration of U.S. Supply Chains“The land purchase has already taken place. What’s at stake is the Fufeng [group], whose chairman is a very active member of the Chinese Communist Party—in fact they once labeled this person as a ‘model laborer’—wants to build this corn milling facility 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base. So there’s really a couple of things here. The first one is that China has increasingly purchased up food supply chains in the United States. They already have a significant amount of the meat processing market in the United States. Now they’ve been buying up farmland as well as investing in value-added agriculture supply chain companies. This is significant because, as we saw throughout the pandemic, China has a lock on a lot of supply chains. They own 75% of solar panels… pharmaceuticals, the personal protective equipment, but certainly food as well.”On Economic and National Security Concerns:“The proximity to the Grand Forks Air Force Base is the issue that has most people concerned because the Grand Forks Air Force Base is an [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] (ISR) base. It’s a Reconnaissance wing. What that means is they fly unmanned aerial vehicles around the world. They rely on a lot of data from space, to the aircraft, to the earth—up and down. We just recently cut the ribbon on a Space Development Agency ground station that would be operating low-earth orbiting satellites. There’s a new mission coming to the Grand Forks Air Force Base in the middle of this decade that would be next generation ISR. So there’s a lot of concern about Chinese investment so close to such a sensitive base.”“You’d have to be naïve not to believe [the Chinese] are up to something and we’ve seen a lot of that in recent years. The China of ten years ago, 15 years ago, or 20 years ago is very different than the China of today. We know how good they are at spying. We know how good they are at collecting data in both passive and aggressive ways and we know how often they do it.”On Community Concerns:“With regard to constituents, constituents are very concerned. They’ve sounded the alarm in the community of Grand Forks. They signed petitions, and yet, local leaders have taken a much slower process, if you will, of due [diligence] on this investment opportunity.” On the CFIUS Process:“You asked if the Biden Administration could be compelled to stop this. Well, they actually can through a process called CFIUS—the [Committee] on Foreign Investment in the United States. That [committee] is led by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes all of our agencies such as Commerce and of course both the security and intelligence agencies. They’re taking a good look at it right now, and they will make some determination I would think within days. That determination will be shared with the company and, of course with Members of Congress that seek some insight. My sense of it is [this project] is not going to happen. I firmly believe that before this is done, this transaction will be stopped and unwound. The local leaders want to see the process played out.”Click Here to Watch

Click here for audio.***BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Budget Committee, discussed student loan forgiveness with Neil Cavuto on Fox Business. Excerpts and full video are below.On Student Loan Forgiveness:“I don’t really see how it’s a winning election issue because of the people that I talk to, the vast majority of them are very upset by the unfairness of this. Just yesterday, I was at a veterans appreciation event at the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation here in North Dakota. A Native American veteran came up to me and said exactly this. He said ‘you tell that President there’s a Native American veteran in North Dakota who wants his money back. I want my GI Bill benefits even back. If you’re going to do this, then what about me? I paid a price as well for my education.’ I think he represents probably millions of other people and for various reasons. In some cases, they didn’t accrue any debt. In some cases, they paid off their debt. In other cases, they had to make choices that led them a different direction—maybe to serve in the military so they could go to college. Then you have people who accumulated debt, but they didn’t do it through the federal system and so they’re not eligible, which brings up your point about whether he can even do it constitutionally. If he can, it’ll be for a very narrow group of people.”“But to suggest somehow [student debt forgiveness] is the fair way, especially in inflationary time—giving away money for a product, by the way, that’s already more inflationary even than the Consumer Price Index and that is, of course, higher education.”  On the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:“After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which did not disproportionately help the wealthy but rather, as much as anything helped the middle class and the working class in this country, we had a booming economy. We had everybody working. We had salaries and wages going up. We had very low unemployment [and] very high wealth creation at every level, including young people getting jobs and getting paid well to do them.”“Let’s cut taxes across the board. Let’s cut regulations. Let’s create more job opportunities and wealth.”Click Here to Watch

Dohrmann, North Dakota National Guard Adjutant General, and Senator John Hoeven (R-ND).“Attending the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery’s 30 Year Commemoration ceremony was an incredible honor. Every single veteran was willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice—this is the fundamental difference between us and them—and they deserve all our honor and appreciation. North Dakota has the best National Guard in the country and their excellence was fully on display today. On this sacred ground, we remember freedom isn’t free and it is only possible because of our brave men and women in the armed services. We thank them today and every day for their incredible sacrifice and service to the United States of America,” said Senator Cramer. Earlier this year, Senator Cramer’s Burial Equity for Guards and Reserves Act, which ensures all reserve components and the National Guard are eligible to be buried in state veterans cemeteries as long as their service was terminated under honorable conditions, was signed into law. In March, Senator Cramer penned an op-ed in the Southern Illinoisan calling on Congress to pass his bill to allow state veterans’ cemeteries to bury Guard and Reservists without penalty from the federal government.As a member of SVAC, Senator Cramer shepherded the Burial Equity for Guards and Reserves Act through committee in December, and it passed unanimously out of the Senate on March 7, 2022.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramers-regrow-act-brings-25-million-to-north-dakota-to-remediate-orphaned-wells,"BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, announced today the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources was awarded $25,000,000 to plug and remediate orphaned wells. The money comes from Senator Cramer’s Revive Economic Growth and Reclaim Orphaned Wells (REGROW) Act of 2021, which was included in the bipartisan infrastructure law.“North Dakota was proactive in dealing with orphaned wells remediation and now, through the bipartisan infrastructure law, more dollars are coming to our state to enhance the program. The REGROW Act provides oilfield job opportunities, cleans up environmental hazards, and brings land back into productive use. While this funding should have been distributed over three months ago I’m pleased to see it happen and will continue to work with Interior and states to ensure our Congressional intent is met,” said Senator Cramer.   Overall, the U.S. Department of the Interior awarded an initial $560 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to 24 states to begin work to plug, cap, and reclaim orphaned oil and gas wells. This money will help create or retain tens of thousands of jobs for workers in the oil and gas sector to properly clean up and retire abandoned oil and gas wells which currently do not have a party responsible for them.BackgroundSenators Cramer and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) introduced the REGROW Act in April. Through hearings and media opportunities, the senators worked to advance their bill by gaining support from their colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives and from governors across the country. They secured the bill’s inclusion in the Energy Infrastructure Act, which the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced with bipartisan support. The REGROW Act then became part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which was signed into law in November 2021.The REGROW Act provides: Across the country, there are over 92,000 documented abandoned oil and gas wells with no responsible party for cleanup, known as “orphaned” wells. Found mostly on state and private land but also federal and tribal lands, these orphaned wells can leak methane, contaminate groundwater, and create safety risks. Even before the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal agencies and states responsible for plugging and reclaiming these wells had limited funding for cleanup. During 2020, global energy oversupply combined with decreased demand due to the pandemic caused major job losses in the energy sector.North DakotaOrphaned wells, according to the Department of Mineral Resources, “historically have not been an issue in North Dakota” until the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, along the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia last summer. In response, North Dakota’s Emergency Commission and legislative Budget Section authorized $66 million in CARES Act funds to plug and reclaim orphaned assets in the state. This helped put hundreds of employees back to work and returned land back to its original use. Learn more here.Additional Resources

After growing up on a farm near Kindred, Mr. Otterson enlisted in the U.S. Army and served overseas as a medic-MP in General George S. Patton’s 3rd Army.“Vern Otterson is the embodiment of our greatest generation. With a high school education in tow, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and left North Dakota for the Western Front.

The flag we presented today is a small token of our appreciation for his heroic dedication and sacrifice,” said Senator Cramer.   “For the last two years I’ve had the pleasure of working with Vern, trying to assist him with benefits. He’s a true hero and remarkable man whose stories are just as amazing as his service to our country. He’s one of the last WWII veterans in the state and has taught me to never give up on your goals, no matter your age,” said Christopher J. Deery, Veteran Service Officer, Cass County Veteran Service.During the ceremony, Senator Cramer thanked Mr. Otterson for his military service, especially his time in France during World War II in which he fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Senator Cramer has also signed a letter of support for a Purple Heart medal for Mr. Otterson recognizing the wounds he suffered in France during the war.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-larry-kudlow-compare-and-contrast-the-trump-economy-and-the-biden-economy,"BISMARCK, N.D. – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the Senate Banking Committee, joined Fox Business’ Kudlow to compare and contrast the philosophies surrounding the Trump economy, which focused on tax reform and deregulation, and the Biden economy, which focuses on socialist policies and unchecked government spending. Excerpts and full video are below.On Democrats’ Socialist Agenda: “[Socialism] hasn’t worked in any country where it’s been tried. It has failed everywhere, so why we want to try it is beyond me.”  “[The Biden Administration believes] there are too many people making too much money and that all we need to do is take more of their money away from them, redistribute to people that have less, and somehow that’s good for the economy all the way around. Of course, that’s failed everywhere it’s been tried, but they’re trying it again.”On President Trump’s Economy and Deregulation Efforts:“In my mind, the thing Donald Trump had going for him in his 2016 election was he clearly understood that the federal government was the problem and he articulated that—the size of the deep state, the size of the bureaucracy. What he underestimated was just how strong that bureaucracy really is. So while he was reducing regulations through the rulemaking process, legislating, as well as guidance, people from the bureaucracy were working against him at every turn. Even at that he was able to accomplish a lot. What we saw was that private sector investment follows lower taxes, fewer regulations, and frankly, even a better environment that manifests itself just in attitude. And now you have exactly the opposite. This changes the investment mind and it changes the relationship with states. I wrote a 22-page essay for the Harvard [Journal of Law and Public Policy] that just came out in June. [It] talks about the heavy hand of the bureaucracy and… cooperative federalism. Donald Trump understood the value of states and state regulation and state oversight. That was a game changer in terms of unleashing ingenuity, innovation, and our economy.”On Student Loan Forgiveness: “This crazy idea of forgiving student loan debts at $10,000. Larry, if they took all of that money and just forced every student to take an Economics 101 class or supply-side economics class or study Milton Friedman or Art Laffer, we would do so much more for the economy than what [the Biden Administration is] trying to do. The problem is their constituency is that very government that they’re growing. They love that government, they love the power of it, they love the dependency of it, they love the organization of it, and that’s a fundamental difference between us and them.” “I think everybody ought to buy Dick Armey’s memoirs and read that as well. You’d find out what works best. But we do have an economic illiteracy problem right in our own government. I mean, Jennifer Granholm the Secretary of Energy, every time she talks I swear to God there’s a professor somewhere in an economics department going ‘What did I do wrong?’ It’s unbelievable.”On Government’s Role in the Marketplace:“As I’ve said many times, if you give somebody a $7,500 Tesla tax credit, the price of a Tesla goes up $7,500. It’s basic [economics] 101. In fact, Ford just announced that they’re going to do exactly that, and why wouldn’t they? It’s the most natural incentive in the marketplace. This is why the government should stay out of the marketplace. What happens with all of these ideas is they compound. You end up having a tax credit for one thing, so what they’re competing against has to have a tax credit. You just pile tax credits on top of tax credits. This is why corporate America gets bigger and richer and the government gets bigger and poorer and the middle income wage earner is scratching [their] head going, ‘My paycheck is not going as far as it used to.’”Click Here to Watch

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-statement-on-bidens-student-debt-cancelation-announcement,"FARGO – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) issued the following statement after President Joe Biden announced the cancelation of up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower and up to $20,000 of debt for some borrowers who previously received a Pell grant. President Biden’s unilateral decision to forgive the student loan debt of some borrowers also included an extension of the payment pause through December 31, 2022.“Just when you think Joe Biden can’t possibly make inflation worse than he already has, he pulls this stunt. Not only will this ‘free money’ further fan the flames of Biden’s inflation, it is fundamentally unfair to the millions of Americans who don’t have student debt to pay off. Transferring student loan debt to people who paid theirs off or never accumulated any in the first place is theft, and taxpaying voters will be justifiably outraged,” said Senator Cramer.Background:Senator Cramer opposed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona’s nomination due to the Administration’s progressive agenda emboldening teachers’ unions and boasting canceling student debt.Free debt cancellation provides a perverse incentive to borrow and spend money one does not have, while undercutting those who are faithfully paying or have responsibly paid off their student loans. Senator Cramer discussed the perverse incentives and inflationary consequences of student loan forgiveness yesterday on Mornings with Maria.“The loan forgiveness suggestion would create so many perverse incentives starting with—to Larry Summers’ point—the increasing of tuition costs. This is what an oversupply of money in a low-demand market creates. It creates inflation. If you gave every kid in America $1,000 to go toward their next semester of college, the price of college goes up $1,000,” said Senator Cramer.The U.S. Department of Education already offers income-driven repayment plans for low-income borrowers as well as specific professional or situational federal loan forgiveness programs including the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or programs related to military service.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-votes-to-uphold-sanctity-of-all-life-opposes-democrats-abortion-bill,"WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) voted against Democrats’ radical
abortion-on-demand bill. The bill would create nationwide right to abortion,
regardless of the upcoming Supreme Court ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s
Health Organization. It would also pre-empt pro-life state laws, including
North Dakota’s. “The
right to life is our most fundamental right, most often taken for granted each
day when we wake up and enjoy our lives. This extreme measure destroys protections
for the most vulnerable by usurping states’ rights to protect life. The
sanctity of life is not a political fight, but a fight for humanity itself. It
is unconscionable for Democrats to not only attempt to legislate the
legalization of abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, but also
override the will of states and their citizens. I have always promised the people
of North Dakota I would fight for life at all stages. I will always fulfill
that promise,” said Senator Cramer.In
addition to permitting abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, the bill
makes every state a late-term abortion state, invalidates laws currently in
effect protecting pain-capable unborn children or protecting babies with
heartbeats, forces states to allow mail-order abortions without an in-person
visit, prohibits states from protecting babies from discriminatory abortions,
invalidates laws preventing coerced abortions, and outlaws parental
notification.Background:Last
week, Senator Cramer issued
a statement emphasizing the implications of the Supreme Court leak and
underscoring his concern for the legitimacy, confidentiality, and independence of
our highest court.“The
far left is attempting to bully justices into submission instead of
letting the judicial branch perform their duties without influence or
bias. The final decision has not been released and I will not speculate on
its contents. However, the impact of this case cannot be
overstated. Each and every life is precious and sacred and I will not
shirk away from this conviction,” said Senator Cramer.Senator
Cramer received an
A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List for his strong legislative record
supporting pro-life measures. In February, he voted
against Abortion On Demand Until Birth Act, which would legalize abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy while simultaneously striking down
pro-life laws at the state and local level in North Dakota and across the
country.Senator
Cramer also joined Senators
Roger Wicker (R-MS), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and over 200 members of Congress
in filing an amicus brief supporting the State of Mississippi in Dobbs
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, urging the U.S. Supreme Court
to uphold Mississippi’s
law protecting life.
In the 117th Congress, Senator Cramer has co-sponsored several
pro-life bills including legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of
fertilization, protect unborn babies who may be targeted for abortion because
of their gender or physical condition, and give states the authority to exclude
abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds. He has
also pledged to vote against any bill that would undermine the Hyde Amendment,
which is a legislative provision barring the use of federal funds to pay for
abortion or other abortion-related activities.

– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), ranking
member of the Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, discussed Navy
authorities, workforce development, and funding issues related to the Shipyard
Infrastructure Optimization Program at a joint Seapower and Readiness and Management
Support Subcommittee hearing.Senator Cramer began by asking for recommendations on process
streamlining and other authorities beneficial to update our Navy’s shipyard
infrastructure.“Do you have any advice for us in terms of policy, streamlining
processes, authorizations, [or] funding? What have we learned so we can be
helpful in making this process a little more efficient and effective?” asked
Senator Cramer.“[It would be helpful to have] authority which we have to pay for
these mega projects to fund them incrementally over time, which you have
provided us in the past. I think continuing that for these large projects, and
potentially looking at maybe a multiyear type procurement like we do in the
shipbuilding world, where we can see if we get the most efficiency by building
a set of projects together in a multiyear contract. [These] are two authorities
that might be worth looking at to get more flexibility and negotiating space to
our team,” said Mr. Frederick Stefany, Principal Civilian Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition.“The multiyear work relative to repair and maintenance is
something we’re looking very closely at. These are complex projects and I
sometimes think repair and maintenance could give the impression of less
complexity, but really the multiyear relative to, say a drydock that we’re
repairing, and the way that relates to a current operational availability is
absolutely critical. Our ability to have a flexible approach, multiyear funding
certainly is going to help us execute over time,” added Rear Admiral
McClelland, Program Executive Officer for Industrial Infrastructure, U.S. Navy.
Senator Cramer also had a discussion on Naval efforts to increase recruitment
and retention and what Congress could be doing to support this endeavor.“There’s another challenge that we’re hearing from everybody. I
mean, seasonal farm and hospitality workers to surgeons, very sophisticated
technology workers and everything in between. We have a workforce challenge in
our country right now, particularly in the private sector. I presume you’re
experiencing the same thing. Do you have any thoughts? Let us know what you’re trying
to do to recruit and retain employees at the yards. Also, is there anything you
think we could be doing?” asked Senator Cramer.“We’re seeing the same thing in the public yards as well. Our
attrition rates are higher than what we had planned, our recruitment rates are
lower than what we had planned. We offer some pretty good training as we bring
people into the yards through our apprentice programs, so that’s one real
positive,” responded Admiral McClelland. “The other thing that
we’re looking at right now is wages for our entry level positions, and many
times we’re competing at a wage that is less than what some businesses in the
local area, for example, whether it be Amazon or even a Starbucks. Typically,
the starting wage for some of our mechanics is in that $14 to $15 an hour range
– right at the minimum wage level. What we’re finding is in some areas where
shipyards are located, Portsmouth and Puget Sound in particular, the going wage
is actually higher than that. So, we’re working through Navy leadership and
with the human resources organizations across the Department of Defense to look
at that wage grade we’re paying our folks.”Senator Cramer also highlighted the Supplying Help to
Infrastructure in Ports, Yards, and America’s Repair Docks (SHIPYARD) Act. The
bill provides funding to make investments needed to optimize, improve, and
rebuild shipyard facilities, electrical infrastructure, environmental systems,
and the equipment of public and private shipyards in the U.S. that support the
U.S. Navy fleet. “There are 18 cosponsors, a lot of them from this Committee, [on]
the SHIPYARD Act, speaking of infrastructure and some additional resources.
Could you just generally comment on the SHIPYARD Act, what you know about it,
and what how helpful it may be?” asked Senator Cramer. “It’s
always tough to apply the time value of money in appropriations processes by
the government, but we need to get better.”“The Navy supports that Act,” responded Secretary Stefany. “The
idea of having a commitment of all the funding upfront and a period of time to
spend the funding most efficiently. The knowledge that the total dollar value
was there and could be worked with industry most effectively is a best
practice. So we would absolutely support that.” Click Here to Watch

admissions policies have disenfranchised Asian-Americans, as the schools
applied racial preferences to discriminate against Asian-American applicants
despite superior GPAs and standardized test scores.“Harvard
College and the University of North Carolina indisputably use race as an

fact, that the challenged admissions policies may strive for racial
balancing—an aim that is unconstitutional on its face,” wrote the
brief.“Race-conscious
admissions decisions inflict a heavy toll on Asian-American students. Treating
them differently because of their race is a stark departure from equal
protection decisions issued early on by this Court, which guarded Asian
immigrants from racial prejudice. And the burdens imposed on petitioner

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-sen-cramer-op-ed-what-ive-learned-from-enes-freedom,"WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) penned an op-ed on lessons learned from
Turkish-American NBA star and freedom advocate Enes Freedom’s visit to
Bismarck, North Dakota last month. Enes preaches the truth that freedom isn’t
free – and as Americans we take our freedoms for granted while the Chinese
Communist Party is committing genocide against the Uyghurs.“Enes’
message is one we all need to hear. He speaks about representing faith, family,
and country. He speaks about standing up for freedom, morals, and values. He
speaks about bringing greater peace into the world. These are American values,
ones we should all agree on and support unwaveringly. It was a privilege to be
a witness to Enes’ testimony. His sense of mission is infectious, but I am
struck that the freest nation in the world needs Enes’ reminder to vigilantly
protect and promote individual liberty. I am thankful for what he’s taught me
with his bravery and what he’s teaching countless people despite facing
constant threats of censorship,” wrote Senator Cramer.“Fundamentally,
I believe the greatness of America lies in our self-governance. But as
fortunate as Americans are, we take a lot for granted. It is easy to
forget the price paid for the unalienable rights – including religious freedom
– which are enshrined in our Constitution and the cornerstone of our society.
This is not to say we are perfect. We are far from it. But there is a major
difference in the way our democracy is embedded into our life versus the way
China, or even Turkey, operates – a reality Enes knows all too well,” continued
Senator Cramer.“Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) leaders control every aspect of the country, and they are
trying to implement their dominance on a global scale. They engage in
full-scale surveillance of their citizens and the world. Every time you open
Tik Tok, China is accessing your data. They are actively committing genocide
and forced labor against the Uyghur Muslim minority and they hold expansionist
ambitions over the freedom-loving people of Taiwan and Hong Kong. There is no
such thing as labor or environmental laws, yet we rely on China for everything
from critical minerals to cheap labor and goods and services,” concluded
Senator Cramer. “Enes brought these issues to light during his time in the
NBA and it cost him his career. The NBA is an American company and is able to
flourish because of the economic freedoms we enjoy. It amplified woke
capitalism, but when it came to supporting Enes and free speech, the NBA bent a
knee to Beijing.” What
I’ve Learned from Enes FreedomBy
Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND)Williston
Herald5.5.2022“A
few weeks ago, I was blessed to spend time with Turkish NBA star turned
American human rights advocate Enes Kanter Freedom in the Peace Garden State.“His
message is bold, yet simple. His message is brave, yet shared. It’s something
we take for granted every single day living in the United States of America.
Freedom isn’t free.“What
is so special about Enes’ message is his conviction. Enes walks the walk and
talks the talk. He truly practices what he preaches.“While
in North Dakota, he delivered his powerful message at the iconic Belle Mehus
Auditorium in Bismarck. He also conducted a youth basketball clinic, which was
generously hosted by Mark Kinnebrew, and spoke to student-athletes at the
University of Mary. It’s safe to say his visit made an indelible mark on the
North Dakotans he met. This would not have been possible without the support
of betruthful.org and their
commitment to comprehensive education in North Dakota. “We’re
not merely listening to history. We’re watching him create history. We’re
living through it.“During
his visit, Enes was treated to North Dakota’s legendary hospitality, leading
him to conclude our state is an amazing place to live, work, and raise a
family. I couldn’t agree more and I am glad he felt the warmth of our welcome.“Fundamentally,
I believe the greatness of America lies in our self-governance. But as
fortunate as Americans are, we take a lot for granted. “It

long as corporate American companies buy cheap goods from China, our supply
chain will continue to feed the genocide and human rights violations of the
CCP. The NBA is never going to relent until Americans stand for a change.“Enes’
message is one we all need to hear. He speaks about representing faith, family,

Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) discussed the
Army’s personnel payment system at a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)
hearing with Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth and Army Chief of Staff
General James McConville. Senator Cramer also expressed gratitude to Secretary
Wormuth and General McConville for their cooperation in fixing a personnel pay
issue for a North Dakota constituent last year.“I was struck by how many times you stated the most important part
of the Army, of course, are the people. You speak with great affection,
passion, and sincerity about it. Secretary Wormuth, you and I got to know each
other early on working with your team to fix this pay problem. It highlighted a
broken system. The new integrated personnel pay system which I became familiar
with through that process was supposed to be fixed last year, but I’m told it’s
still struggling to roll out properly. Can you give me an update on that and
tell us if there’s anything we can do to help? When I look at the big employers
in the world today – obviously, the military is one of those and the Army
specifically – there are much bigger companies that don’t seem to have these
same sort of problems,” said Senator Cramer. “We’re working very hard on [Integrated Personnel and Pay System –
Army] (IPPS-A), which the National Guard is already able to use some of the
features of that personnel system. We are working very hard to be able to roll
out the next increment of IPPS-A release three, hopefully later this fall. We
feel like we will be on schedule for that,” responded Secretary Wormuth.
“Frankly, we are working very aggressively with the contractor to make sure
that they’re able to meet what we’ve asked them to do, and that next release
will bring out some of the talent management features, enable people to look at
what assignments are available, and then it will be the next increment, as I
understand it, that will really provide the pay transparency across all
components.”“Right now we have what we call an industrial age personnel
management system,” said General McConville. “We treat
everybody as interchangeable parts. We have three different personnel systems
for our regular Army, our National Guard, and Reserve. Quite frankly, it’s no
way to run a railroad. We need to have everyone on the same system... We have
tremendous talent in the Army that’s masked by a person’s grade, and their
[Military Occupational Specialty]… we’ve got a lot of work to do in this and as
we manage the future, we could compete for talent. We’re going to have to
manage soldiers’ talents to get the best in the Army. Senator Cramer highlighted the importance of this system to
modernize the Army and attract and retain the best military talent.“You’re both very fluent on the importance of modernization and
the priorities or modernization. It seems that this would be a really high
priority, not as sexy looking, but when we’re talking about challenges,
recruitment, retainment, and getting the best of the best this will be
important. I encourage you to stay at it. Keep us informed and if there’s
anything we need to do from a policy standpoint or oversight standpoint,
anything that helps you with the contractor or anyone else, please reach out,” said

statement after EPW passed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of
2022 unanimously out of committee today:“The
Water Resources Development Act and this committee is an example of the
diversity of our great country. This bill serves as an exemplary example of
what can be done when we work together, when we collaborate, and when we care
about our nation’s water infrastructure,” said Senator Cramer. “This
legislation, for those of us in the West, prioritizes Western states’ water
rights and works toward better cooperative federalism with the Army Corps of
Engineers that was envisioned by our nation’s founders and the authors of the
Flood Control Act of 1944. It also focuses on recreation, you know the Army
Corps doesn’t oftentimes get credit for this, but they are a significant
federal land management agency often overlooked to provide greater recreational
opportunities for our constituents. This bill gives flexibility to the local
jurisdictions for the Army Corps to make repairs quicker and provide improved
recreational access while requiring the Army Corps to outline a plan for future
use of these resources.”“It
provides increased funding levels for water and wastewater programs utilized
and sought after by the small towns throughout North Dakota and throughout the
entire country. In a number of instances, I along with a number of my
colleagues take this once every two years opportunity to provide the Army
congressional direction on matters that are important to our constituents,
including entering into an agreement with the Red River Valley Water Supply
project manager to ensure water supply from the project reaches its beneficial
users and providing the necessary hydrologic analysis to protect our flood
control interests in the Souris River Basin,” continued Senator Cramer.“I

invaluable input throughout this process, helping deliver wins for our state,” concluded

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-introduce-resolution-to-repeal-biden-administration-policy-upending-asylum-process,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Senator Ron
Johnson (R-WI) and Representative Andy Biggs (R-AZ) in introducing a resolution
of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to dissolve a proposed
Biden Administration rule which would illegally upend
the process by which the U.S. government grants asylum claims.The rule, “Procedures
for Credible Fear Screening and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of
Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers,” would
exacerbate the crisis at the southwest border and encourage fraudulent asylum
claims by allowing illegal border crossers who claim asylum to have their
asylum application approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS) officials, not immigration judges, and to not be detained while their
application is pending. “The Biden Administration’s incompetence in handling the crisis
they themselves created at the southern border is astounding. This
new asylum rule will make the border crisis worse and endanger legal
American citizens across the country. Border security needs to
be a top priority for the Biden Administration, but instead, they
insist on opening the southern border to anyone who wishes to
cross. Our resolution puts a necessary and timely check on
the executive branch and protects against future surges of migrants
illegally entering the United States,” said Senator Cramer.“The Biden administration is sending a clear message: our borders
are open, you will not be kept in custody, and you will not have to see a judge
to stay here. In a time where we surpassed 2 million illegal crossings at the
southern border last year and are on track for even more this year, the
proposed rule will only lead to more illegal migration for an already
overwhelmed immigration system. We strongly oppose the Biden Administration’s
reckless attempt to unconstitutionally rewrite the asylum laws in America.
The changes the administration is proposing cannot come from unelected
bureaucrats, but rather from Congress. I thank my colleagues for joining
in this effort,” said Senator Johnson.    “Instead of promulgating new rules, the Biden Administration
should end its illegal catch and release policies and enforce the law. Open
border zealots within the Administration are drastically remaking our
immigration system under the guise of enhancing humanitarian protections. This
couldn’t be further from the truth. This proposed rule weakens the integrity of
our asylum system and will facilitate mass illegal alien incursions. Rather
than focusing on releasing aliens as quickly as possible, the Biden
Administration should reimplement Trump Administration policies that worked to
secure our border,” said Congressman Biggs.Senators Cramer and Johnson and Representative Biggs are joined by
 Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman
(R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo

Tuberville (R-AL), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and other House
Republicans.  The CRA can be used by Congress to overturn certain federal agency
regulations and actions through a joint resolution of disapproval. If a CRA
joint resolution of disapproval is approved by both houses of Congress and
signed by the President, or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential
veto, the rule at issue is invalidated.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-urges-usda-to-provide-relief-for-livestock-producers-increase-calf-payment-rate-following-north-dakota-winter-storms,"WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA), urging FSA Administrator Zach
Ducheneaux to provide accurate relief to eligible livestock
owners for deaths under the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP)
following recent winter storms in North Dakota.  “North
Dakota suffered from Blizzard Haley and the subsequent snow, ice, rain, and
wind storms which resulted in cattle producers having a number of their
livestock perish, particularly calves. Thankfully, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) is in place to assist producers
who had above normal livestock fatalities as a direct result of the storms.
Unfortunately, as producers have familiarized themselves with LIP, they have
expressed concerns the payment rate for calves under 250 pounds does not
accurately compensate them for the losses they incurred,” wrote Senator
Cramer. LIP payment
rates are 75% of the fair market value of livestock using nationwide prices for
the previous calendar year. In 2022’s calculations, assistance
for non-adult beef cattle weighing less than 250 pounds is roughly $175.
However, in today’s market, cattle prices for under 250 pound
calves range from $250 to $500 with an average price of approximately
$393, meaning producers could receive a price of $294, significantly
higher than the current LIP payment. “2021
in North Dakota was a difficult year, especially for ranchers. The state was
ravaged by significant drought, producers were forced to procure feed from
alternative sources, and, in many instances, they were forced to cull herds it
took them years to build. Now in 2022, producers lost a number of calves and
expended significant feed resources to keep their livestock warm and fed. It is
critical these producers receive meaningful relief as soon as possible,” continued
Senator Cramer. In
the letter, Senator Cramer calls for USDA to “accurately compensate
producers for the livestock they lost.” Senator Cramer also request the agency
look into “whether the weight categories under LIP should be
reexamined.”Click here to

download video. Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, joined Chuck Todd on Meet The
Press Daily to discuss Ukrainian aid, Senate energy and climate
negotiations, and immigration reform. Excerpts and the full video are below. On Ukrainian Aid: “If we could bifurcate all of them and have a straight up-or-down
votes, we’d certainly pass Ukrainian aid… I think [passing Ukrainian aid if
it’s linked with COVID aid] becomes more difficult. It becomes more political
and Ukrainian aid so far has been bipartisan. I’d prefer it remains
[bipartisan].”On Senate Energy and Climate Negotiations: “You do have to start thinking about the negotiation – what price
is one side willing to pay to the other [side] to get what they need and what
they want? What I think is realistic is if we have some fuel-neutral things for
example. If we’re going to the tax code and start talking about credits, let’s
focus on emissions, not on the fuel choice, because the fuel choice becomes
part of the politics. The other thing that’s really important, but we don’t
acknowledge often enough is if all we did – and I’m not suggesting this should
be the package – was replace Venezuelan oil with American oil or Vladimir
Putin’s natural gas with liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States,
we’d already be bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. It could be considered
climate [change]. That said, I know that’s not enough for Democrats. “I think we put everything on the table. You can’t have a
discussion with nonstarters. So, let’s put everything on the table and work
through it. We have to start helping investment in things like carbon capture.
The LNG piece is the really big piece. I think is the urgent piece where there
are a number of projects just waiting to be approved. The problem with
a lot of this is that it’s capital intensive, and you can’t deal with a crisis
at the moment and not give the investor some long-term certainty. We need to
have longer term plans to coincide with these longer term investments.”On Immigration Reform: “[The United States] has a pretty decent asylum policy if we
actually enact it. But we have a really big short- and long-term workforce
shortage and that ranges from part-time low-skilled to the various high-skilled
workers. We need a skills-based immigration policy and asylum can fit right
into that. Right now, if you’re an asylum seeker and you get into the United
States and you wait for the processing, you don’t get to work. We have people
who need workers and we have asylum seekers who need income. I think that’s a
reasonable discussion reasonable people on both sides of the aisle could have.”“Just like we have this window opening in Europe
that presents this grand opportunity for significant climate and energy policy,
we have a workforce crisis that opens up the door for a more significant
immigration policy discussion, particularly around skills-based [immigration].
I’ve introduced H1-B reforms and have taken blows to the head from people who
would otherwise understand but don’t because it’s got the word immigration
attached to it. That’s why people need to step up and explain ourselves. You
have to be willing to go out and sell [immigration reform]. I can sell it in
North Dakota, but everyone needs to sell it where they live.”“There are enough specific examples, whether it’s physicians or
specialists in medicine, engineers, or laborers in factories or fields. There’s
a growing demand and a growing understanding of that demand. Inflation itself
is driven largely because of broken supply chains and supply chains are largely
broken for a lack of people to do the work and get products where they need to
get. So, I think we’re in a moment where the crisis demands the discussion.”

Our allies are asking for help. We can meet it if we unleash American energy production, but the absolute intransigence of the administration’s environmental regime stands in the way.”“We need more domestic energy production to meet global demand, not less,” wrote Senator Cramer. “This President and his administration want to impose their mediocrity not only on North Dakota, but the entire nation by hamstringing our energy independence. On Day One, they canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have delivered heavy Canadian crude to Gulf Coast refineries instead of relying on Russia or Venezuela. They banned new oil and gas leases on federal lands despite quarterly lease sales mandated in the Mineral Leasing Act. They halted drilling in Alaska’s 1002 area, which again, contradicts the law.”“Let’s get serious about energy and environment policy. To lower global greenhouse gas emissions, we need to produce more domestic energy and export it to the world. Rather than stupidly shooting ourselves in the foot, this would meet the world’s energy demands while reducing the West’s reliance on dirtier fuels from adversaries, despots, and dictators. There’s an easy road map for energy, national, and economic security at our fingertips, but the administration must be a willing partner in this effort. It starts with undoing nearly everything it’s done since January 20, 2021,” concluded Senator Cramer. The World Is Watching, Stop the Double TalkBy: Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND)Washington Examiner4.28.22“The Biden administration’s energy policy, or lack thereof, is mind-boggling. This 2050 fantasy has distorted their vision to the point they can’t see the geopolitical moment before us today. Our allies are asking for help. We can meet it if we unleash American energy production, but the absolute intransigence of the administration’s environmental regime stands in the way.“Here are the facts. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, total U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions fell by 12% from 2005 to 2018. During the same period, the U.S. became the number one energy producer in the world, but global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions increased over 23.8%. So, our energy production increased while our emissions decreased, but the globe trended the opposite direction. Somehow President Biden concluded American energy was the problem.“We need more domestic energy production to meet global demand, not less.“This President and his administration want to impose their mediocrity not only on North Dakota, but the entire nation by hamstringing our energy independence. On Day One, they canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have delivered heavy Canadian crude to Gulf Coast refineries instead of relying on Russia or Venezuela. They banned new oil and gas leases on federal lands despite quarterly lease sales mandated in the Mineral Leasing Act. They halted drilling in Alaska’s 1002 area, which again, contradicts the law.“The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed natural gas pipeline policies requiring environmental analysis of both upstream and downstream emissions. Even though they were labeled as interim, the policies went into effect immediately. After immense blowback, FERC rightfully did an about-face, but the proposal itself sent the wrong message to a watching world: the U.S. is discouraging its own energy infrastructure. “The Biden administration’s agenda of regulatory overreach knows no bounds. The 30x30 initiative aims to conserve at least 30% of land and water by the year 2030. Why’s this important? It is no coincidence two of the top oil-producing states, Texas and North Dakota, are not dominated by federal lands and bureaucracy. 30x30 is merely an attempt to insert the federal government’s mediocrity into excellent work states already do.“Outside of the typical energy and environment avenues, unelected Biden administration officials are doing everything in their power to regulate fossil fuels out of existence. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency froze the Trump administration’s Fair Access Rule which would have codified guidance stating, “banks should conduct risk assessments of individual customers, rather than make broad-based decisions affecting whole categories or classes of customers, when providing access to services, capital, and credit.” The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed the first-ever regulations to require companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions as well as imagine their exposure to any number of climate change related risks. Not only does the SEC not have this authority, this is yet another signal chilling markets at a time when we need to ramp up our domestic energy production.“Not to be outdone, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently issued draft principles directing financial institutions to address climate-related risks into their risk management frameworks.“The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree given the President himself said, “I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel” on the campaign trail. Radical financial nominees from Saule Omarova to Sarah Bloom Raskin boisterously advocated for bankrupting the oil and gas industry to tackle climate change and other fundamental changes to reimagine the economy. Picking winners and losers seems to be a theme as Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry falsely exclaimed the U.S. will eliminate coal plants by the end of this decade and actively discourages foreign investment in U.S. energy production. These positions are beyond absurd and it’s absolutely tipping the scales to compensate for misguided climate guilt. But this moronic sentiment was only reiterated when Kerry publicly worried Putin’s war in Ukraine was a distraction from climate change efforts. The misplaced priorities are astounding.“Let’s get serious about energy and environment policy. To lower global greenhouse gas emissions, we need to produce more domestic energy and export it to the world. Rather than stupidly shooting ourselves in the foot, this would meet the world’s energy demands while reducing the West’s reliance on dirtier fuels from adversaries, despots, and dictators. There’s an easy road map for energy, national, and economic security at our fingertips, but the administration must be a willing partner in this effort. It starts with undoing nearly everything it’s done since January 20, 2021.”Senator Kevin Cramer, North Dakota Republican, is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He served on the North Dakota Public Service Commission as an energy regulator for a decade where he helped oversee the most dynamic economy in the nation. He worked to ensure North Dakotans enjoy some of the lowest utility rates in the United States, enhancing their competitive position in the global marketplace.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-oppose-doj-expanding-firearm-definitions-and-creating-national-gun-registry,"WASHINGTON –  U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND) joined Senator Ted Cruz
(R-TX) in introducing a Congressional Review Act Joint Resolution of
Disapproval (CRA) to prohibit President Biden’s Department of Justice from
implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions. The
Biden Administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a
“firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its
individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this
new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were
fully functional firearms—meaning they wouldn’t be able to be sold without a
serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The
new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain
records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The
current rule, which the Biden Administration seeks to change, allows for
the disposal of records after 20 years.  “The Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms to all
citizens, but the Biden Administration wants to use bureaucracy and red tape to
weaken this fundamental freedom and prohibit law abiding citizens from
exercising their rights,” said Senator Cramer. “This
resolution will prohibit the Biden DOJ from issuing a final rule expanding the
definition of firearm and creating a national gun registry, which protects our
hunters, sportsmen and firearm owners from more federal overreach.”“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all
across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing
district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law
enforcement officers. Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame
and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in
the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop
the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition
of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false
narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns’ and firearms, and we
want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment
rights,” said Senator Cruz.  According to
the Government Accountability Office, “The CRA allows Congress to review
‘major’ rules issued by federal agencies before the rules take effect. Congress
may also disapprove new rules, resulting in the rules having no force or
effect.”Senators Cramer and Cruz
are joined by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike
Lee (R-UT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Thune (R-SD), Marco
Rubio (R-FL), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), John Boozman (R-AR), Roger Marshall

– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Seapower Subcommittee, pressed U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officials on five
shipbuilding issues at a hearing on Tuesday. He also discussed workforce
challenges across the defense industrial base and their impact on
shipbuilding.With
Mr. Frederick Stefany, performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of the Navy
for Research, Development, and Acquisition, Senator Cramer focused on the
Next-Generation Guided-Missile Destroyer DDG(X) program, specifically
maximizing collaboration in design and early construction between Ingalls
Shipbuilding, Bath Iron Works and the Navy for the DDG(X) program. ""What
we’ve learned on the submarine program is when the shipyards are working
together with the Navy, we get the best result. We don’t have downtime where we
have competitive pressures and we can continue the design spirals until we can
get to the construction of the first two ships,"" said Mr. Stefany. ""Having
both companies work together to get the best product using a single design
tool, a single computer-based model, is what we’ve seen in the Virginia-class
submarine program as the best way to design and build the initial ships of a new
from-scratch program.""Senator
Cramer brought up the procurement of 8 Lewis-class oiler ships over the next
five fiscal years as a good opportunity to provide stability to the
industry and save money through a multi-ship procurement including economic
order quantity authorities. Mr. Stefany agreed and added it would be the most
efficient way to buy ships. Senator
Cramer also expressed concerns with the Navy’s failure to adhere to the
shipbuilding acquisition plans clearly laid out in previous National Defense
Authorization Acts (NDAA) and emphasized the need for transparency surrounding
the amphibious ship LHA-9. “The
amphibious ship LHA-9 was previously authorized in fiscal year 2020 when
Congress approved the procurement of this ship with incremental funding
authority in the NDAA and added $650 million in the final Appropriations Bill.
Subsequent appropriations bills have provided additional funding. After the
2021 budget request showed LHA-9 as a future procurement in 2023, the FY21 NDAA
removed this ship to avoid double-counting it and clarified in section 126 that
any ship added by Congress may not be specified as a new procurement quantity
in future budget submissions. Why does this budget request again show LHA-9 as
a new procurement in FY23 and how is this consistent with section 126?” asked Senator Cramer. “I
believe with the change in administration, not all were aware of the NDAA
language,” responded Mr. Stefany. “I don’t think it was
anything purposeful here. I think it was different parts of the Department not
communicating well.” Mr.
Stefany expressed wishes for a consistent approach and metrics for incremental
ship funding going forward. Senator Cramer reiterated the need for a consistent
protocol as it would not only be beneficial for the military but Congress and
taxpayers as well. Shifting
to amphibious ship requirements, Senator Cramer asked about the importance of
continuing the LPD amphibious ship production line to meet the Marine Corps’
requirement of 31 ships and the top unfunded priority in advance procurement
funding for LPD-33s. “It’s
critical to meet that requirement,” said Lt. General Karsten Heckl, the
Marine Corps’ Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration. “Within
force design is our ongoing requirement as a Marine Corps and by law to be the
crisis response force to the nation. Without those LPDs and other traditional
L-class amphibious warships, we cannot be there. We’re already struggling now.”

Quite simply, because this budget doesn’t keep up with inflation, it’s a cut. I am hopeful we can come together again to provide the Department with the real budget growth it needs to fund critical modernization, readiness and personnel shortfalls,” said Senator Cramer.

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-discusses-inflation-white-house-roadblocks-to-energy-development-on-kudlow,"***Click here to download video. Click here for audio.***WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), member of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, joined Kudlow on Fox
Business to discuss Biden’s soaring inflation and domestic energy development
roadblocks from the White House. During the interview, Larry Kudlow referenced
Senator Cramer’s most recent op-ed,
“‘Free’ Money Can’t Fix Inflation – The American Producer Can,” examining the
impacts of Biden’s skyrocketing inflation on rural America. Senator Cramer also
emphasized the need for long-term investment in American-produced energy, which
would reduce inflation and strengthen national security. Excerpts and full
video are below.On Inflation: “I think it’s a really important to look back at the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, what happened to the economy after it passed, and what that led to in
terms of full employment, productivity, and even producing more revenue for the
government. It also led to a foundation that allowed our economy to get through
the pandemic and come out so strong, so robust, and really growing at a very
fast rate, which now all of a sudden [the Biden Administration] want[s] to
stifle. It makes zero sense. As I pointed out in the [op-ed], when Joe Biden
became President, inflation was 1.4% and now it’s 8.5% and growing. In rural
America, it’s even higher.” On the Importance of Domestic Energy to Help Our Allies:“We have European allies who previously sort of shunned our energy
are now begging for American energy. They have voluntarily cut themselves off
from Vladimir Putin. They are open to the free market. We just happen to have a
lot of supply in this market and they have a lot of demand. If there’s a way for
us to come to this realization and this opportunity to produce more in the
United States – which will bring down price much like Donald Trump did when he
was President – and be able to offer that on the global market, it has national
security ramifications as well as economic ramifications for our country. [We]
need to do our part as an American producer.” On the White House Roadblocks to Energy Development:  “We need to have long run opportunities for long-term investments.
The White House is putting up all of these roadblocks to [energy] production.
However, there are many Democrats growing more and more uncomfortable with the
intransigence of the White House’s position. I stress ‘White House’ because I
think there is a White House and I think there’s Joe Biden. I don’t think the
two are necessarily always on the same wavelength. So, if [Senator] Joe Manchin
can get something put together that can get enough votes which Republicans and
Democrats agree to, then maybe he can go to his friend Joe Biden and say, ‘Mr.
President, let’s set Gina McCarthy and John Kerry on the sidelines for a
moment. Let’s have a realistic talk about the opportunities in front of us.’“Look at the most recent decision by the President to open up 20%
of the available federal lands to leasing, but at the same time, he puts up all
these other roadblocks to production. [This includes] Gina McCarthy on national
television saying, ‘We didn’t really mean it. We just had to do something. We
have this ‘court problem.’’ [They have] a reality problem.”

Heckl, U.S. Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration.Click Here to WatchFull remarks as prepared for delivery can be viewed below: “Thank you Chairwoman Hirono. “This is a critical time for our national security and the stakes are very high. Appropriately funding the Department of Defense in order to keep this Nation safe and defend our interests is the most critical Constitutional duty Congress performs and one I take very seriously. To this end, I thank the Chairwoman for calling today’s hearing to examine Navy and Marine Corps programs in the President’s fiscal year 2023 budget request.“But I must say, like last year, I am very concerned that President Biden’s defense budget request is inadequate — nowhere near enough to give our Navy and Marine Corps the resources, equipment and training they need. Quite simply, because this budget doesn’t keep up with inflation, it’s a cut. I am hopeful we can come together again to provide the Department with the real budget growth it needs to fund critical modernization, readiness, and personnel shortfalls.“Regarding the President’s budget, I want to make three technical points:“More broadly, I am concerned about the state of our Navy and its downward trajectory. It seems to me that the Navy is dealing with the confluence of four key issues.“First, President Reagan added a lot of ships to the fleet quickly – nearly a 600-ship Navy. 13 of the 24 ships proposed for decommissioning this year were procured in the 1980s. The Reagan-era ships are reaching the end of service life in large quantities, just as they were bought. Former Navy officials’ promises over the years to modernize and extend the service lives of many of these ships, or replace them with new ships, have not panned out.“Second, the Littoral Combat Ship or LCS program was planned to be a major portion of our fleet with 55 of these ships in service by 2018. Instead, we have 24 LCS today. Unfortunately, this class has been plagued with problems from the start and a key reason for the program – the anti-submarine warfare capability, which was supposed to be operational 12 years ago – was cancelled altogether in this budget. Nine of the 24 ships proposed for decommissioning are LCSs. “Third, we need Navy shipbuilding programs that can scale up. There is a high opportunity cost in time and money for failure in Navy shipbuilding – that is a key lesson of the LCS, CG-X, DD-X and DDG-1000 programs. Just think, if the LCS plan delivered as promised, we would have a fleet of roughly 330 ships today with 55 LCS capable of hunting submarines, neutralizing mines and conducting surface warfare. Instead, we have 31 fewer ships and no small surface combatants that can hunt submarines.“To this end, the new Constellation-class frigate program must succeed if we are to grow our Navy. Unfortunately, the lead ship won’t be finished until 2026 – 11 years after the last of our 51 Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates was decommissioned – which has resulted in an acute and continuing frigate gap in the Navy’s ability to escort convoys, hunt submarines, and defend high-value assets.“Fourth, we need a consistent commitment from every Administration and Congress to provide steady and predictable funding to the Department of the Navy. As bad as the President’s 2023 request is, the projected cuts to shipbuilding in future years are worse with the LPD amphibious ship production line abruptly ending with no transition plan. This is simply unacceptable as it will both further shrink the fleet and starve our Navy shipbuilding industrial base, which is already barely hanging on.“I also have concerns related to the health and trends for naval aviation and the extent to which this budget supports the Commandant of the Marine Corps’ force design, but in the interest of time I won’t belabor these now.“The bottom line is this budget sends China and other potential adversaries the wrong message — that we’re not willing to do what it takes to defend ourselves and our allies and partners. And we should be worried about China for a multitude of reasons, but looking just at their Navy -- their fleet surpassed our fleet size target of 355 ships two years ago and continues to steadily climb. Meanwhile, this budget proposes to shrink our Navy to 280 ships over the next five years. It just does not make sense.“A few specific areas I hope to cover today include:“Mr. Stefany, I’d like to discuss five shipbuilding issues to better understand how this subcommittee can be helpful.“General Heckl, the Marine Corps appears to be aggressively pursuing air defense and missile systems in the Indo-Pacific. I’m interested in better understanding how these systems can both protect forward-postured Marines, as well as help combatant commanders deny maneuver space to an adversary.  I’m also interested in the Commandant’s requirement for amphibious ships.“I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today.”

https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-stop-biden-from-crushing-american-innovation,"WASHINGTON
– U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R–ND), joined Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) in
introducing legislation to stop the Biden administration from compromising the
intellectual property rights
of vaccine manufacturers through Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waivers.“Ingenuity
is a key aspect of the American dream. The Biden Administration’s efforts to
undermine intellectual property protections when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines
discourages the very medical breakthroughs of President Trump’s Operation Warp
Speed and threatens future discoveries, as well as our ability to prepare for
the next pandemic. The No Free TRIPS Act adds a necessary check on the Biden
Administration and prevents them from entering into agreements which waive global
intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines and
therapeutics,” said Senator Cramer.“President
Trump’s Operation Warp Speed proved the life-saving capabilities of
the private sector, but for some reason the Democrats are on a mission to
stop this innovation in its tracks,” said Senator Blackburn. “I am
leading the charge to stop Joe Biden’s plan to waive the intellectual
property rights of vaccine manufacturers. Without the power
of free market innovation, we will lose any chance we have at
successfully managing another global public health crisis.”“With
the support of decades of research and development, voluntary technology
transfers, and hundreds of partnerships, biopharmaceutical manufacturers are
producing the COVID-19 vaccines we need to vaccinate the world,” said
Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of PhRMA. “Efforts to undermine
intellectual property protections are unnecessary and harmful to our collective
work to end the pandemic and respond to future public health threats. The No Free
TRIPS Act would help ensure the U.S. does not surrender the American
intellectual property that’s been critical to fighting COVID-19.”“Intellectual
property waiver proposals distract from the real issues preventing more shots
in arms, such as logistical hurdles, supply chain bottlenecks, and vaccine
hesitancy. Business is delivering on the promise to manufacture safe and
effective COVID-19 vaccines for the whole world. Vaccine production is
estimated to reach over 20 billion doses this year, enough for everyone. As of
March 2022, over 65% of the global population has received at least one dose,
and this number is growing every day. The dismantling of IP rights threatens
the licensing arrangements that are enabling rapid global production and
technology transfer. The Chamber applauds these Members of Congress for
introducing this important legislation and strongly supports the No Free TRIPS
Act and the Protecting American Innovation Act,” said Neil L. Bradley,
Executive Vice President, Chief Policy Officer, and Head of Strategic Advocacy
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Senators
Cramer and Blackburn were joined by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy
Tuberville (R- AL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Marco
Rubio (R-FL), and Mike Lee (R-UT).Background:Click
