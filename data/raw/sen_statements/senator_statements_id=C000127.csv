https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/pangborn-airport-receives-10-million-grant-from-cantwell-championed-federal-fund-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that Pangborn Memorial Airport is receiving $10,090,532 to help reconstruct airfield guidance signs, taxiways, and taxiway lighting. The funding comes from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which supports infrastructure at the nation’s airports.This funding will help Pangborn Memorial Airport reconstruct 7,100 feet of existing taxiway, which has reached the end of its useful life. The funding will also go towards reconstructing taxiway lighting systems and 28 airfield guidance signs to meet FAA standards. AIP funds can be invested in runways, taxiways, equipment and sustainability projects, which help maintain a safe and efficient airport system for the traveling public. The FAA awards more than $3.2 billion in AIP funding each year to sustain and improve critical airport infrastructure.As chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell is a strong proponent of the AIP. She’s also a longtime champion of investing in our nation’s airports -- last year, she supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which included $25 billion in new airport infrastructure improvements.###"

Land is taken into trust when land is transferred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe. The legislation would take over 17 acres of land currently owned by the Puyallup Tribe into trust, restoring part of the Tribe’s ancestral homeland and allowing the Tribe to pursue economic development and job creation opportunities at the Port of Tacoma and on the Tacoma waterfront. “The Puyallup Tribe is an economic force in the South Sound. Taking this land into trust will allow the Tribe to create more jobs and it will return the Tribe to its ancestral homeland on the Tacoma waterfront,” said Sen. Cantwell. “I look forward to working with our delegation to get this bill signed into law.”“Our Tribal communities should be able to benefit from the same opportunities that have helped other communities across Washington state grow and thrive,” said Sen. Murray. “That is why, along with my colleagues, I am proud to take action with the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Land Into Trust Act to ensure the Puyallup Tribe can grow its economy, create jobs, and get the resources and tax benefits for which it is entitled from the federal government and I will continue to fight to ensure Washington state’s Native communities are given a fair shake.”“For thousands of years, the Puyallup Tribe of Indians have called the shores of the Puget Sound home. This legislation will help restore those homelands - ensuring the Tribe can continue to diversify and grow its economic opportunities, and help create jobs across our region. I’ll keep working to ensure the federal government fulfills its trust and treat obligations,” said Rep. Kilmer. “I am proud to support the Puyallup Tribe and work with members of the Washington state delegation to spur economic development and infrastructure investments,” said Rep. Strickland. “This legislation helps advance the Puyallup Tribe’s vision for a vibrant, healthy, and working Puget Sound as well as honoring treaty rights.”“The Puyallup Tribe greatly appreciates the delegation’s support of the Tribe in our efforts to restore our homeland,” said Puyallup Tribe Chairman Sterud. “This legislation will help the Tribe diversify its economy and bring critical infrastructure and business to the Tribe’s port development and the entire region.”To transfer Tribal lands into trust, Tribes may apply to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The BIA will either approve or deny the application, or Congress may pass a bill directing the BIA to take the land into trust. Due to legacy contamination, the BIA is unable to take the land into trust and Congressional action through legislation is “the most viable option” as the BIA affirmed this in a letter to the Tribe on August 15, 2022. Land that is taken into trust by the federal government is governed by the Tribe and can benefit from federal programs and services such as New Market Tax Credits, Tax-Exempt Financing, Discounted Leasing Rates, Foreign Trade Zone Customs and Duty Deferral, among other benefits that protect Tribal sovereignty and allow the Tribe to create economic opportunities for its Members and surrounding communities. The proposal for the land to be taken into trust is supported by the City of Tacoma, Pierce County, and Governor Inslee. Go HERE for the full bill text. ###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-announces-affordable-housing-award-for-st-catherine-de-vigri-villas-in-tieton,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that St. Catherine De’ Vigri Villas in Tieton, WA was awarded a Charles L. Edson Tax Credit Excellence Award. Edson awards recognize outstanding affordable housing properties and organizations that have demonstrated impactful use of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit – a program regularly championed by Sen. Cantwell.Sen. Cantwell presented the award at the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition Conference in Washington, DC, saying: “We know that the tax credit has preserved 3.5 million homes since its inception in 1986, and I constantly try to remind my colleagues that 90 percent of the affordable housing that gets built in America is built with the tax credit. And if we're not expanding the tax credit, we're not going to get out of this problem.”“I want to thank the National Equity Fund for facilitating the properties’ financing, and to everyone who is involved creating safe and stable affordable housing for the Tieton community. I can't just emphasize how important this is,” Sen. Cantwell continued. “We care, and we want to provide stability. We care about the families, and we care about what they are providing and we want to give them a comfortable and affordable place to feel secure in.”St. Catherine De’ Vigri Villas offer 53 total units of affordable housing for farmworker households earning between 30-50% of the local median income.Developed by Catholic Charities Housing Services (CCHS) and the Office of Rural and Farmworker Housing, St. Catherine De’ Vigri Villas is the largest multi-family housing development in the history of Tieton and the first affordable housing development to be built in the region in over 30 years.Cantwell has long advocated for the need to increase the availability of affordable housing. In April 2021, Cantwell led the introduction of the bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2021. The legislation would increase the current annual Housing Credit allocation by 50% and would produce more than 66,000 units of affordable housing around the State of Washington. Nationwide, the expanded Housing Credit would build more than 2 million new affordable housing units over the next 10 years, including more developments for at-risk and underserved communities.Since 1986, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, has funded 90% of the federally-funded affordable housing construction across the country, and has financed nearly 3.5 million affordable homes.Yakima County has especially been impacted by the national housing shortage. Between 2010 and 2019, the median home price in Yakima increased by 38%, while the median family income only increased by 19%, as Sen. Cantwell highlighted at the opening of the Chuck Austin Place Veterans Housing Center in November 2021. Chuck Austin Place received $9.3 million from the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which was over 50% of their funding to complete the development.###"

So not only did that slow down commuters but it also slowed down our freight and freight capacity. West Seattle felt the worst of the pain with its residents, but it also slowed down a supply chain that was critical to moving goods in the Northwest.”As chair of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Sen. Cantwell was instrumental in securing the majority of funds needed to complete the West Seattle Bridge repair project. Of the project’s $66.94 million repair costs more than half – $37.65 million – came from federal funding sources.""We wanted to make sure that the U.S. Department of Transportation knew how important the West Seattle Bridge was to our residents and to our economy,” said Senator Cantwell. “Not only did we ask Secretary Pete Buttigieg for help, but we convened meetings with the Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg to tour the bridge and East Marginal Way. … A fully-functioning West Seattle bridge is really important to our nation's economy."" One portion ($11,250,600) of federal funding came from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) program, which was created by Sen. Cantwell in 2015. The program helps local communities pay for nationally and regionally significant freight projects just like the West Seattle Bridge.Shortly after the West Seattle Bridge closed in March 2020 due to a crack in the concrete, Sen. Cantwell spoke with then-mayor Jenny Durkan multiple times about helping the city of Seattle secure federal grant funding to help pay for the project.In March 2021, Sen. Cantwell sent a joint letter alongside Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Seattle) and Rep. Adam Smith (D-Seattle) to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg calling on the DOT to support the West Seattle Bridge’s application for an INFRA grant. While their advocacy was successful, helping the project secure an $11.25 million competitive INFRA grant, this was $10.3 million less than the city asked for, so Sen. Cantwell called on USDOT to help provide additional resources to the city.“The stakes are high for both the traveling public and for the freight investments we are making at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5. We need answers now from the U.S. Department of Transportation on real solutions for providing additional federal investment to fix the West Seattle Bridge,” Sen. Cantwell said in June 2021.Sen. Cantwell worked with the city, federal, and regional leaders to ensure the West Seattle bridge received additional funding and helped secure an additional $26.4 million in funding from federal formula programs, nearly $10 million ($7.6 million) more than the city had original estimated the project would receive from other federal sources.This advocacy effort culminated in Sen. Cantwell inviting Polly Trottenberg, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, to see the importance of the West Seattle Bridge and the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5 to both the region and the nation. In August 2021, the two of them took a tour of the bridge and Cantwell advocated for additional federal support to improve this critical transportation corridor. Three months later USDOT announced a $20 million RAISE grant for the East Marginal Way Corridor to improve access to the lower West Seattle Bridge and the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5.The West Seattle Bridge closed on March 23, 2020 when city officials discovered that the cracks on the concrete main span were growing rapidly. The closure took Seattle’s busiest city-owned bridge out of use, forcing 84,000 average daily drivers and 25,000 average daily transit riders to find an alternative route.Photos of Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-statement-on-graham-led-gop-bill-establishing-nationwide-abortion-ban-after-15-weeks-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a bill that would establish a near-total abortion ban nationwide after 15 weeks. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued the following statement in response:“Washingtonians voted to protect abortion rights by a statewide initiative in 1991. Senator Graham’s bill would overrule those rights. I’m against it,” Sen. Cantwell said.More than 30 years ago, voters in Washington state approved Initiative 120, which codified the protections previously established under Roe v. Wade and cemented the right of every Washingtonian to choose to have an abortion up to the point of fetal viability, or if the pregnant woman’s health is at risk. Sen. Graham’s bill marks the latest attack on reproductive freedom from an extremist GOP, which continues to strip away women’s rights to control their own bodies and plan their own families.Sen. Cantwell has been fighting hard to protect the rights of women to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. In July, she joined several Democratic colleagues speaking out in support of a bill that would have protected the rights of pregnant people to travel to pro-choice states, as well as the rights of health care providers to treat patients from anti-choice states. Sen. Cantwell also called on the U.S. Department of Justice to provide clarity on current law protecting patients and providers.Sen. Cantwell additionally cosponsored the My Body, My Data Act, which would minimize the personal reproductive health data collected by apps and websites and create a new standard for protecting that data enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission. She is also an original cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bicameral bill that would guarantee equal access to abortion across the United States.“Anti-choice state laws threaten to roll back years of progress on a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. Washington state made that right law, but a woman’s right to reproductive health care shouldn’t depend on which state she lives in,” Sen. Cantwell said upon introducing the WHPA.###"

Maria Cantwell (D-WA), chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, joined U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Commerce Committee Ranking Member U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), and U.S. Sen Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) to introduce the Orbital Sustainability (ORBITS) Act, a bipartisan bill to establish a first-of-its-kind demonstration program to reduce the amount of space junk in orbit.Space junk, or orbital debris, currently poses a threat to human space exploration, scientific research missions, and emerging commercial space services. In March 2021, a large piece of space junk crashed into a farmer’s property in Grant County, Wash.“There are more than 900,000 pieces of space junk passing over our heads every day, including abandoned Government satellites,” said Sen. Cantwell. “This bill will jumpstart the technology development needed to remove the most dangerous junk before it knocks out a satellite, crashes into a NASA mission, or falls to the ground and hurts someone. We must continue to explore space, and we have to do it safely.”The program will focus on research, development, and demonstration of technologies capable of safely carrying out successful Active Debris Remediation (ADR) missions and jumpstarting a new market for these services. Washington state companies, including Seattle-based satellite servicer Starfish Space, have advocated for the acceleration of space debris removal efforts. Other Washington companies like SpaceX, Amazon’s Kuiper Systems, and Stoke Space Technologies are also looking for new ways to reduce debris from accumulating in space in the first place or have been threatened by debris. More than 1,300 Washington companies are involved in the aerospace industry.There are approximately 8,000 metric tons of debris currently in orbit, including at least 900,000 individual pieces of debris that are potentially lethal to satellites. Because of the magnitude of the current debris, simply preventing more debris in the future is not enough.Full text of the ORBITS Act is available HERE.The bill contains the following provisions to:"

Prior to the vote, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) spoke on the floor of the Senate in support of his nomination.“This is a historic moment. If confirmed, Judge Mendoza would be the first Hispanic judge to serve on the Ninth Circuit from Washington,” said Sen. Cantwell. “He has been an outstanding judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington where he has served since 2014…I know Judge Mendoza will make an excellent addition to the Ninth Circuit Court.”Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr., was raised in the Yakima Valley by his parents, immigrants from Mexico who worked as farmworkers. As a teenager, Judge Mendoza worked mornings in the fields alongside them before hurrying to school. He graduated from Prosser High School in 1990, then went on to earn a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Washington and law degree from the University of California – Los Angeles.Beginning in 2002, Judge Mendoza served as a Judge Pro Tem in Benton and Franklin counties, where he helped create the region's first drug courts for juveniles. In 2013, Washington Governor Jay Inslee appointed Judge Mendoza to serve on the Superior Court for Benton and Franklin Counties.In 2014, Judge Mendoza became the first Hispanic federal judge ever to serve in Eastern Washington when he became U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Washington. When Judge Mendoza joins the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, he will be the first Hispanic judge from the State Washington ever to serve on that court.In 2016, Columbia Basin College named Judge Mendoza as the Martin Luther King Jr. Spirit Award winner.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/seattles-iconic-salmon-bay-bridge-to-get-25-million-from-grant-program-created-by-cantwell-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, announced the Salmon Bay Bridge project will receive $25 million from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program, which was created by the Senator. The 108-year-old Salmon Bay Bridge connects the Magnolia and Interbay neighborhoods to Ballard.“The Salmon Bay Bridge is a critical piece of freight and passenger transportation infrastructure that is at risk of failure,” said Sen. Cantwell. “More than 30 trains and 100 vessels each day depend on this bridge to get freight and commuters where they need to go. These funds will ensure that one of Seattle’s most iconic bridges remains operational for another 50 years.”The bridge is an integral rail link for Western Washington. Between 30 and 40 freight, commuter, and intercity passenger rail trains cross the bridge each day, including Sounder trains and, when they are running, Amtrak trains. The funds will be used to replace the drawbridge’s mechanical system, extending the operational life of the bridge by another 50 years.Sen. Cantwell wrote a letter of support for the Salmon Bay Bridge grant application to Secretary Buttigieg in June 2022. BNSF, who owns the bridge, will provide an additional $70 million in funding needed to complete the project.Originally opened in 1914, the Salmon Bay Bridge is the only direct north-south route to serve the Northern Seattle metropolitan area, northwestern Washington, and Canada. Although currently suspended, Amtrak and WSDOT use the Salmon Bay Bridge for the Amtrak Cascades intercity passenger rail corridor service. Sen. Cantwell recently urged Amtrak board of director nominees to commit to resuming service on this critical route.The waterway under the Salmon Bay Bridge is integral to moving maritime traffic in the region with the Chittenden (Ballard) Locks located nearby. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates 40,000 commercial and recreational vessels travel under the Salmon Bay Bridge annually, making the Chittenden Locks the busiest navigation locks in the country.Repairs for the Salmon Bay Bridge are to take place during work windows identified to minimize the impacts to marine life and protect the rich biodiversity in the affected area, including the thousands of sockeye, Chinook, and coho salmon that pass through the locks during the summer.“This project is critically important to Washington’s rail network,” said Secretary of Transportation at WSDOT Roger Millar. “WSDOT is pleased to be a part of ensuring the continued operation of this bridge that links both train passengers and freight movements throughout western Washington and beyond. We thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership in funding the needed improvements.”“The Salmon Bay Bridge is a critical transportation corridor for freight rail and passenger trains, including Sound Transit Sounder North commuter rail service,” said Sound Transit Board Vice Chair and Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers. “This grant is an innovative solution to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of this bridge, which is crucial to ensuring our economy can thrive and our people move. We are very grateful for Sen. Cantwell’s tenacious work to secure this funding.”“After issuing a letter of support for the Salmon Bay Bridge Rehabilitation grant application, we are pleased to see this come to fruition,” said Dennis Newman, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Planning & Accessibility at Amtrak. “The bridge is a critical component of the transportation network in the Pacific Northwest, carrying passengers and freight that would otherwise travel on the highway system. Amtrak is thankful for Senator Cantwell’s support and the USDOT’s investment in this important project.” Sen. Cantwell created the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program in the FAST Act of 2015. The INFRA grant program was is the first-ever multimodal freight grant program focused on freight mobility. These grants provide funding for projects of national or regional significance including railway, seaport, and highway projects to increase safety and reduce congestion. Due to Sen. Cantwell’s leadership, the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $8 billion for the INFRA grant program, increasing the program’s funding by 78%. Since the program’s creation in 2015, the State of Washington has been awarded over $268.8 million.### "
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/20-billion-intel-semiconductor-plant-to-break-ground-after-passage-of-cantwell-led-bill,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, President Joe Biden will travel to Columbus, Ohio to celebrate the groundbreaking of Intel’s new semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company’s new expansion marks the first major investment in domestic microchip manufacturing directly linked to the passage of the CHIPS & Science Act, which was championed by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and signed into law on Aug. 9. “This groundbreaking represents the commitment we made in the CHIPS & Science Act: to grow good paying jobs in the United States. Intel’s $20 billion plant will employ more than 3,000 people and its partnership with the National Science Foundation will quickly put more than $10 million into workforce development at community colleges across the country and into scholarships for semiconductor education,” said Sen. Cantwell. “We cannot afford to get left behind in designing and manufacturing the next generation of chips, or in educating the semiconductor workforce. That’s why I fought so hard to get this law over the finish line.” Intel had previously announced its plans to build a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio at the beginning of the year. But in July, CEO Pat Gelsinger and the company warned that the company would delay its plans to break ground on the $20 billion site if Congress was unable to pass the CHIPS & Science Act, which included a $76 billion federal investment to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing.In a March 2022 hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Gelsinger told Sen. Cantwell that vital industries of the future including autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and advanced mRNA sequencing all hinge on access to high-performance semiconductors.“All of these depend on the most advanced technologies available, they need the highest performance computing at the lowest power capabilities to process these most advanced algorithms,” Gelsinger said. “Those kinds of capabilities … will define the future competitiveness of industries globally.”The CHIPS & Science Act went on to pass the Senate 64-33 and the House 243-187. Shortly after the bill passed Congress, several companies including Intel, Micron, Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries announced plans to build new chip manufacturing facilities in the United States.Sen. Cantwell, who serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, was a key architect of the CHIPS & Science Act. She led the conference committee of more than 100 House and Senate members charged with reconciling a final version of the bill, rallied lawmakers to ensure the package contained the largest-ever federal investments in innovation and science, and joined President Biden for the signing ceremony at the White House last month.The package invests $76 billion to develop the next generation of semiconductor technologies and to re-establish U.S. strengths in semiconductor manufacturing: $52 billion in for competitive grants to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing, plus a 25 percent investment tax credit for domestic semiconductor manufacturing worth an estimated $24 billion.Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century – they’re found in a huge variety of products, from vehicles, medical devices, and cell phones to advanced national security technology. Currently only 12% of chips are manufactured in the United States, down from 37% in the 1990s.###   "

Maria Cantwell (D-WA) pressed the nominees on their plans to fully reestablish and staff the routes connecting Washington state businesses and travelers to British Columbia – routes that have been suspended since May 2020.“We had a pandemic and we had disruption of services in key areas across the West,” Sen. Cantwell said. “So I think what we need, what I need, before I can support any of the nominees before us today is a commitment for us to come up with a workforce strategy and plan that allows us to continue. We cannot simply say we don't have enough conductors, we don't have enough baggage handlers, we don't have enough this… The public believes they survived the pandemic so now they want to see the services restored. “And we all have workforce issues. Everybody in America has workforce issues. But what I didn't hear enough of is, what does Amtrak believe they need to do about that, to get the services reestablished that we need in America?” Sen. Cantwell continued. “We're not messing around here. We're not messing around here when it comes to the reestablishing (of) these services.”Sen. Cantwell serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard from five nominees for Director of the Amtrak Board of Directors during today’s hearing: David Michael Capozzi, Anthony Rosario Coscia, Christopher Koos, Samuel E. Lathem and Robin Lee Wiessmann.Through the pandemic, Sen. Cantwell has been a champion of the nation’s freight network. Last year, the committee under her leadership advanced a bipartisan $78 billion transportation funding bill that included $25 billion for passenger rail and Amtrak grants.Last week, Amtrak announced it would resume its Cascades passenger train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. on Sept. 26. Amtrak will start by offering one daily roundtrip, with plans to add a second trip later as the corporation hires additional staff."

It also would require equal payment for medical care, travel and expenses. Sen. Cantwell, who spoke during the event, said: “Tonight is truly a historic occasion. An agreement is going to be signed that basically puts in equal pay for our female athletes because a group of women athletes, at the pinnacle of their success, had the audacity to say ‘we deserve equal pay for our success.’ I want to thank US Women’s Soccer, and since I come from Seattle where we love soccer, I have to say a special thanks to Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle who signed the original petition to make this case a reality. “And thank you now to US Soccer, for Cindy’s leadership, in getting this deal done. And making sure that we send a message to all across the United States.“My colleague is here tonight. I’m a Democrat from Washington state. She’s a Republican from West Virginia. But we are going to use the power of this moment to get national legislation passed so that every young girl in every sport knows that we will have equal pay when it comes to sports in the United States of America. Let’s celebrate!”Earlier this year, the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team settled their longstanding lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, reaching an agreement on a deal to be compensated at the same rate of pay as the men’s team. The two new Collective Bargaining Agreements, which run through 2028, achieve equal pay through identical economic terms. These economic terms include identical compensation for all competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, and the introduction of the same commercial revenue sharing mechanism for both teams.The ceremony was emceed by ESPN commentator and World Cup champion Julie Foudy. Fans heard from U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone, Men’s National Soccer Team and Women’s National Team players, and a message from tennis legend, Billie Jean King.Washington state OL Reign players on the USWNT include Rose Lavelle, Alana Cook, Sofia Huerta and Megan Rapinoe, who Sen. Cantwell held a press conference with in 2019.The bill applies to 50 different sports’ national governing bodies, and it requires the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) to conduct oversight and report on compliance with the legislation.Sens. Cantwell (D-WA) and Capito (R-WV) introduced the bipartisan legislation in July 2021 and it passed the Commerce Committee on June 22, 2022. The legislation is currently awaiting to be brought to a Senate floor for a final vote.Read the full bill text HERE. Download Event Photos and Videos.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-celebrates-84-million-federal-grant-to-help-complete-repaving-project-at-skagit-regional-airport,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that Skagit Regional Airport is receiving $8,461,054 to help pay for the final phase of reconstructing its general aviation apron.The funding comes from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which supports infrastructure at the nation’s airports.This funding will help Skagit Regional Airport finish rehabilitating 35,000 square yards of the existing general aviation apron, which has reached the end of its useful life. “The Port of Skagit’s job is to manage the airport, which is owned by taxpayers, in a way that serves the entire community,” Port of Skagit Commissioner Kevin Ware said. “The meaningful assistance that we’ve received from our federal delegation leading to this airport improvement grant is an investment that will pay dividends in a number of ways for our community’s future, including the support of airport services ranging from FedEx to medical ambulance, as well as the economic benefit of attracting businesses to locate here.”The grant for Skagit Regional Airport was the largest of eight awards made to Washington state airports by the FAA on Tuesday. Together, Washington airports received a total of $17.44 million.AIP funds can be invested in runways, taxiways, equipment and sustainability projects, which help maintain a safe and efficient airport system for the traveling public. The FAA awards more than $3.2 billion in AIP funding each year to sustain and improve critical airport infrastructure.As chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell is a strong proponent of the AIP. She’s also a longtime champion of investing in our nation’s airports -- last year, she supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which included $25 billion in new airport infrastructure improvements."
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-local-leaders-tout-potential-growth-for-high-tech-manufacturing-in-spokane-thanks-to-recently-passed-chips-and-science-act,"SPOKANE, WA – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined leaders from Spokane’s biosciences and aerospace industries, higher education, and state government at precision manufacturer Altek, Inc. to tout the major investment opportunities coming to the Spokane area in the recently-passed $250 billion CHIPS & Science Act.The law will strengthen American manufacturing innovation and has the potential to support the growth of Spokane’s aerospace and biosciences industries, as well as the good-paying jobs those industries provide. Eastern Washington is already a candidate for a university research center and could be competitive for manufacturing innovation centers or regional technology hubs enabled by the CHIPS & Science Act, each of which aim to nurture locally-driven innovation regions like Spokane. The legislation could also provide funding opportunities for cutting-edge research at Gonzaga University and Washington State University, and help train the next generation of workers for high-tech Spokane-area companies. “We're calling on Spokane,” said Sen. Cantwell. “We’re calling on everybody to work together here to create the next innovations that make our nation competitive in aerospace, in biosciences, and in other types of manufacturing. We're well poised to do that here. We have the land … We have the people and we have the companies and we're going to have universities who are going to take these dollars and make this investment so we can lead the nation.”Other speakers touted the opportunities now available in the Spokane region thanks to the CHIPS & Science Act.Said Andy Johnston, chair of Evergreen Biosciences Innovation Cluster:  “Spokane is a very innovative city and [that] makes it very attractive for bioscience companies both large and small. And all of these companies need innovations to bring their products to market. … We have a strong manufacturing aerospace pedigree that easily translates into biomedical manufacturing. With the right project Innovation Center, increase in education, organization and leadership, we can and we will make Spokane a leader in biosciences, medicines, and technology.”Said Karlene Hoo, Ph.D., Dean of the Gonzaga University School of Engineering and Applied Science: “Increases in internships, and even in apprenticeships, can only mean a win for the students and for the community. The additional resources that are set aside for federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and others -- to support translational science, so they can move from outside of our laboratories and into products can only yield economic growth, especially in areas that Gonzaga is interested in, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, robotics automation, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing.”Said Lisa Brown, Director of the Washington State Department of Commerce: “We're well poised to take advantage of this, but … I really think we needed the glue that is going to be provided by the CHIPS & Science Act. … This Senator gets it. She gets that this is a national security imperative that is in this bill, that it is a global competitiveness imperative for the United States that is in this bill, but even better – regional competitiveness, so that every part of our state can benefit.”The press conference was followed by a tour of Altek, Inc., including an assembly line of aerospace parts and a facility producing molten, moldable plastics. B-roll of that tour can be found HERE.Monday’s event follows the passage of the CHIPS & Science Act, a historic $250 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and scientific research. This bill -- which was signed into law on August 9 – supercharges America’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity and provides groundbreaking investments in universities aiming to conduct next-generation scientific research, including opportunities for Eastern Washington.The legislation authorizes funding for 10 new collaborative academia/industry manufacturing centers -- called Manufacturing USA (MUSA) centers -- and encourages new institutes that add to the geographic diversity of the program (currently, there are no MUSAs in the Pacific Northwest). It also calls on the National Science Foundation to establish research centers, called regional innovation engines, dedicated to advancing key technology areas such as advanced manufacturing and energy efficiency. “The National Science Foundation has already selected 11 different Washington entities to submit proposals for these regional innovation engines,” said Sen. Cantwell. “We think there should be one here on advanced manufacturing as it relates to aerospace. … We think that this will help grow the jobs here and keep our nation competitive in aerospace.”The Act also authorizes $750 million for universities that are not within the top 100 in terms of Federal R&D for development of research programs, faculty recruitment and professional development, acquisition of scientific instruments, and student research stipends. It also includes a five-year pilot program to enhance partnerships between emerging research institutions, such as Gonzaga University, and institutions that conduct a lot of Federal research.Sen. Cantwell attended the CHIPS & Science Act signing ceremony with President Biden on Aug. 9. For more than a year, she’s been a main architect and key negotiator in each iteration of this legislation. This past spring, she led a group of more than 100 members of Congress to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the package. In her position as the first female Senator to chair the Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, she was instrumental in securing the science R&D funding authorizations in the 11th hour of negotiations.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-touts-new-electric-lummi-island-ferry-to-replace-60-year-old-boat-thanks-to-25m-federal-grant-,"WHATCOM COUNTY, WA – This week, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined local leaders to celebrate a new federal grant that will allow Whatcom County to replace the 60-year-old Lummi Island ferry with a state-of-the-art electric-hybrid vessel. Speaking at the dock used by the current ferry, the Whatcom Chief, Sen. Cantwell touted the benefits of the new ferry, including increased capacity, lower wait times, safer service and fewer maintenance outages.“This is so important because it's part of critical infrastructure, moving 1,000 residents to and from the island in times which can often be very challenging,” said Sen. Cantwell. “And so the ferry needed to be upgraded, and the capacity is being upgraded, the number of cars being doubled, and a significant increase in the amount of passengers.”Sen. Cantwell also noted the environmental benefits of an electric-powered ferry: “We also get an extra little bonus here and that we are helping to decarbonize the marine environment that we cherish so much by getting this to be a battery electric boat….With this ferry system we [are] being better stewards of Mother Earth and solving some of our transportation and infrastructure problems at the same time.”Lummi Island is a rural community, with the ferry producing the only connection between the island and the mainland of Whatcom County. The Lummi Island Ferry is located on Lummi Nation land. The Lummi Island Ferry is one of the state’s oldest vessels and is well past the end of its useful life. The Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant for the Lummi Island Ferry Replacement and System Modernization Project will help replace the ferry with a battery-hybrid vessel that would reduce emissions and increase ridership capacity to meet future growth. The current ferry, the 60-year-old Whatcom Chief, has capacity for 16 vehicles and 100 passengers; the new ferry will have capacity for 34 vehicles and 150 passengers. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Cantwell and Sen. Patty Murray to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in March.This award is one portion of the nearly $100 million ingrant funding for Washington state announced earlier this week. RAISE grants, which were originally created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as TIGER grants, can be used for a wide variety of infrastructure projects with local or regional impact.As chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Technology Committee, Sen. Cantwell worked to authorize the RAISE grant program for the first time ever in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided the program with $7.5 billion over five years, a 50 percent increase in funding.Photos for download and use are available HERE, b-roll of Senator Cantwell stepping off the Lummi Island Ferry is available HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-murray-visit-sw-wa-semiconductor-manufacturer-as-chips-and-science-act-spurs-industry-growth,"CAMAS, WA – Today, U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Patty Murray (D-WA) toured semiconductor manufacturer nLight to tout the major opportunities coming to Southwest Washington in the recently-passed $250 billion CHIPS & Science Act. The competitive grant funding, loans, and loan guarantees as well as the investment tax credit in the bill will potentially support major investments in Clark County’s cluster of semiconductor and electronics manufacturing companies. The Greater Portland Region supports over 30,000 jobs in computers and electronics, with over 2,800 jobs in semiconductor and related device manufacturing in Clark County alone.""We want to be the leaders in the production of semiconductors and we want to be the leaders in advanced chip manufacturing,” said Sen. Cantwell. “We want to be the leaders in the design of the future applications for this great technology. And Camas and Clark County are leading the way.""“Since the beginning of last week, Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, Qualcomm, and SEH have all announced plans for over $40 billion to build new semiconductor fabs – and increase production right here in the United States,” Sen. Cantwell continued.“Right here in Clark County, nLight and companies like them make up a hub of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Sen. Murray. “This bill is a game changer. It’s going to bring down costs on everything from appliances to cars to medical equipment—everything that requires chips, it will create good-paying jobs here in Clark County and across our state, and it’s going to protect us against the price spikes we saw as a result of the pandemic, by strengthening a really critical supply chain. We are building an economy that not only leads the world in innovation, but leads to good-paying jobs right here at home and lower costs on our store shelves.”Sen. Cantwell and other speakers emphasized the opportunities to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in the region, including $200 million for the National Science Foundation to grow the semiconductor workforce.Said Scott Keeney, CEO, nLight: ""As the world changes, there's been more pressure. And I think this CHIPS Act comes at a critical time, not only to enhance what we're doing in industry, but also to go deeper into science and technology, and to go into workforce development, and to go into education.""Said Jennifer Baker, President of the Columbia River Economic Development Council: “We must optimize our efforts on the national stage to anchor in the benefits right here … We can support every young person in our community to explore career pathways in STEM, feeding their curiosity, not just with technology, but also challenging them to ask how it works… To colleagues in the room, I say let's get after it.”During the tour, the senators and media saw the chip manufacturing process in action, from automated wafer construction to semiconductor laser cutting.The recently passed CHIPS & Science Act will enable the Department of Commerce to provide $39 billion in incentives via loans, loan guarantees and grants to chip manufacturers, as well as to companies that do not make chips (e.g., chip equipment and materials suppliers). The Act also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Additional funds can support local workforce development efforts. These activities may be beneficial to a range of local companies, like Analog Devices, nLight, WaferTech, and SEH America.The CHIPS & Science Act also reauthorizes National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program and doubles the budget for ATE from the current level of $75 million per year to $150 million per year. This program helps community colleges like Clark College improve and expand educational programs for technicians to work in high-tech STEM fields that drive the U.S. economy and secure good paying jobs in Clark County.Additionally, the CHIPS & Science Act provides support for expanding internship and experimental learning opportunities at Washington State University Vancouver like the school’s Future Leaders Project, which aims to connect historically underserved students with paid summer internships and mentoring. The bill also supports the school’s ongoing efforts to increase the access, entry and retention of women and people of color in STEM fields. The campus serves a large population of first-generation college students (44 percent) and students of color (33 percent).Sen. Cantwell attended the bill signing ceremony with President Biden last week. For more than a year, she’s been a main architect and key negotiator in each iteration of this legislation. This past spring, she led a group of more than 100 members of to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the package.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-doe-secretary-granholm-tour-pnnl-and-tout-advancements-in-domestic-tech," RICHLAND, WA – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm took a tour of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to observe firsthand the pioneering research and development underway at the lab that will help lead the United States into the next generation of innovation.Sen. Cantwell and Secretary Granholm discussed the federal research and development funding included in the newly-passed CHIPS & Science Act, which invests $17 in national labs like PNNL. The Senator and Secretary also jointly held a roundtable with Tri-Cities community leaders.“We feel that the DOE laboratory system is a very good testbed and a very good deployer of technology. We just saw how some new processing of metals today could revolutionize the automotive sector and drive down cost,” Sen. Cantwell said. “We want to patent it in the United States. We want to deploy it in the United States. We want to scale it in the United States. We want our competitive edge in our manufacturing base right here in the United States. We feel like this is the time to do that.”“Like every state, Washington is eager to work on diversifying its clean energy inputs, and so I’m excited to be able to hear about the great work that's being done here at the lab -- particularly related to the grid,” Secretary Granholm said. “If we want to get to our goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, we have to significantly expand the grid. And the great work that's being done here at the lab will inform the decisions that we make. Fortunately, because you've got a senator who's such an advocate -- for not just this area, but for Washington, and for clean energy, and for communications, and for technology -- we were able to get a significant investment in grid technology.”The CHIPS & Science Act marks the biggest-ever investment in American tech innovation. The bill invested nearly $250 billion into American manufacturing, research and development, including a $17 billion increase for National Laboratory funding in ten key technology focus areas such as AI, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy. President Biden signed the bill into law on Tuesday, Aug. 9. Sen. Cantwell was a key architect and lead negotiator of the legislation, and was instrumental in securing funding for scientific research in the 11th hour of debate.As a cutting-edge domestic research facility, PNNL is very likely to receive funding. PNNL is the largest single employer in the Tri-Cities area and one of the largest in Eastern Washington. On the tour, Sen. Cantwell and Secretary Granholm observed PNNL’s Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, where PNNL conducts fundamental research into the molecular sciences. They also toured the facility’s Applied Process Engineering Laboratory, where PNNL is conducting research into high-performance metal manufacturing with a low carbon footprint.Sen. Cantwell last visited PNNL in April, when she spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony for the lab’s new Grid Storage Launchpad facility.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/washington-to-get-nearly-100-million-in-infrastructure-investments-through-raise-grants-,"WASHINGTON, D.C – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Commerce, Science, and Technology Committee, and U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced nearly $100 million in Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant funding for Washington state. RAISE grants, which were originally created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as TIGER grants, can be used for a wide variety of infrastructure projects with local or regional impact.This is the most Washington state has ever been awarded. Washington state was awarded the second-most grants of any state and received the fourth most in total funding. The state also received a total of 4.35 percent of the RAISE funding available this year, whereas for highway formula funds, Washington state receives 2.2 percent of the funding available.As chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Technology Committee, Sen. Cantwell worked to authorize the RAISE grant program for the first time ever in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided the program with $7.5 billion over five years, a 50 percent increase in funding.Sen. Murray originally created the RAISE program (previously known as TIGER and BUILD) in 2009 and has been a longtime supporter of the program, most recently helping secure $7.5 billion for the RAISE program. The program is funded specifically via the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, which Sen. Murray is a member of.The following RAISE grants were awarded to Washington state projects:Lummi Island Ferry Replacement and System Modernization Project, Whatcom County – $25 million“With over 1,000 permanent residents on Lummi Island, we know how critical having frequent, reliable ferry service is. This $25 million grant award will fully fund the replacement of the 60-year-old Whatcom Chief with a state of the art battery-electric hybrid ferry. This new ferry will nearly double vehicle and passenger capacity, reduce carbon emissions, and will serve residents and visitors to Lummi Island for the foreseeable future,” Sen. Cantwell said.“As someone who relies on our state’s ferry system, I know just how important this investment is. These federal dollars will help replace the 60-year-old ferry with a safer, greener ferry that will also allow for more riders,” Sen. Murray said. “This is a win for jobs, for clean energy, and for anyone who relies on the ferry service. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”Lummi Island is a rural community with the ferry producing the only connection between the island and the mainland of Whatcom County. The ferry is one of the state’s oldest vessels and is well past the end of its useful life. The RAISE grant for the Lummi Island Ferry Replacement and System Modernization Project will help replace the ferry with a battery-hybrid vessel that would reduce emissions and increase affordable ridership capacity commensurate with demand. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Cantwell and Sen. Murray to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in March.Poplar Way Bridge Project, City of Lynnwood – $25 million“This $25 million grant will fully fund the construction of Poplar Way Bridge, improving multimodal access into Lynnwood while also reducing regional congestion on I-5. Lynnwood’s population has grown by 13 percent since 2010, and with a new Sound Transit Light Rail station expected to open by 2024, Poplar Way Bridge will allow the city to accommodate future growth,” Sen. Cantwell said.“A new Poplar Way Bridge in Lynnwood would mean less traffic, safer travel for bikers and pedestrians, and more access to forthcoming public transportation options when Lynnwood Link is completed,” Sen. Murray said. “These RAISE grants are going to make a world of difference in these communities whether it’s safer streets, shorter commutes, or cleaner air. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”The $25 million grant will go towards the construction of a new six lane bridge, the Lynnwood Poplar Way Bridge, over I-5 that would support car, bike, and pedestrian traffic. The new bridge will reduce congestion in the City of Lynnwood, provide an alternate route for emergency vehicles, and improve access to the Lynnwood Link light rail, scheduled to open in 2024. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in March.Bothell Way Multimodal Improvement project, City of Bothell -- $19 million“As Bothell continues to grow over the coming decades, average daily traffic on Bothell Way is expected to double. This $19 million grant will fully fund multimodal and freight improvements on Bothell Way by reconstructing and widening 1.3 miles of highway — improving freight mobility, safety, and transit access for all highway users,” Sen. Cantwell said.“No matter where we live, we all want safer streets – and that’s exactly what this RAISE grant will go towards in Bothell,” Sen. Murray said. “The project is going to make the roads safer for buses, motorists, and bikers trying to go to the grocery store or pick their kids up from school. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”The $19 million dollar RAISE grant will provide vital improvements to the Bothell’s transportation system and address key safety concerns in the communities. The project will reconstruct and widen roadways, install bus rapid transit lines, and construct protected bike lanes to reduce interaction between motorists and bikers. It will also help install adaptive traffic signals to enhance safety and improve traffic flow, and well as provide for the construction of new sidewalks to connect residential and retail areas. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Murray in July.Pines Road/Burlington Northern Santa Fe Grade (BNSF) Separation Project, City of Spokane Valley -- $21.7 million“Last year, the Spokane Valley’s Pines Road crossing of the BNSF mainline resulted in over 26,000 vehicle hours of delay. This crossing sees over 15,000 vehicles and 67 trains per day and saw 9 recorded collisions in 2021. This $21.7 million in grant funding will increase safety by fully replacing an existing at-grade crossing with an underpass of BNSF’s railroad tracks, and will keep vehicle and freight traffic moving by constructing a multi-lane roundabout,” Sen. Cantwell said.“Pines Road is one of Spokane Valley’s busiest streets and, thanks to this grant funding, we are reducing congestion on Pines Road and expanding public transportation access so everyone can get where they need to go quickly and safely,” Sen. Murray said. “These projects are critical to ensuring workers get to work on time, kids get to school on time, and reducing our emissions so our air is cleaner. I created the RAISE program to help make infrastructure projects like this one a reality, and as a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’m going to keep working to secure the federal dollars Washington state needs to keep moving forward.”Pines Road is one of the most heavily traveled roads in Spokane Valley. The $21.7 million RAISE grant for the Pines Road BNSF Grade Crossing Elimination Project will construct a new roundabout at the intersection of Pines Road and Trent Road, both of which are state highways. It also provides for constructing a new rail underpass at Pines Road that would expand capacity from one track to four and expanding bus service routes. The project will also add a new parking lot with electric vehicle charging stations and a new trailhead facility to provide access to the Centennial Trail and the Spokane River. Sen. Murray also secured $5 million in Congressionally Directed Spending this year for the Pines Road project. This RAISE funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in May.Airport Road Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements Project, City of Pullman – $1.05 million“Pullman-Moscow Airport is an economic driver for the region, supporting nearly 1,000 jobs with an economic impact of $130 million annually. These funds will support efforts to increase the capacity of Airport Road which will improve access for students, business travelers, and workers as the airport continues to grow,” Sen. Cantwell said.“Airport Road is a critical artery for so many drivers in Pullman and the surrounding area, but right now is not built for any other kind of transit,” Sen. Murray said. “This planning grant will help the city implement their complete streets policy around the city so that walkers and bikers can safely community on Airport Road and around Pullman. These kinds of investments make our communities stronger and better places to live and raise a family and I am proud to fund projects like these in Washington state.”Right now, Airport Road in Pullman is limited to motorized vehicles. The City of Pullman Airport Road Multimodal & Regional Access Improvements Project will design a road to expand access to alternative forms of transportation and improve access to the airport for communities in the region. This will be especially important given the recent announcement of Pullman-Moscow Airport’s terminal expansion. The grant funding will ensure that these projects are shovel-ready once the city acquires capital funding. This funding comes following a letter of support written by Sen. Murray to Secretary Buttigieg in April.Yakima County Heritage Connectivity Trails project, Yakima County – $1 million“There have been 26 crashes involving pedestrians in the Heritage Connectivity Trails project area over the last decade, 80 percent of which resulted in serious injury or death. This funding will support efforts by the Yakima Nation and the state to improve safety and walkability of this dangerous stretch along US 97,” Sen. Cantwell said.“Safety and connectivity are two absolutely critical parts of any transportation system and this planning grant will help improve both in Yakima County,” said Sen. Murray. “Right now, Yakima County experiences more fatal collisions between pedestrians and automobiles than anywhere else in Washington state. This project will help address that by building more trails that connect people to the resources they need so that walkers and drivers stay a safe distance from each other.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/pact-act-to-expand-care-access-for-more-than-124000-post-9/11-veterans-in-wa,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, the U.S. Senate passed historic legislation 86-11 that would help millions of veterans exposed to toxic materials in the line of duty access health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 would expand VA health care eligibility for exposure to toxic burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, automatically covering treatment for veterans who served after Sept. 11, 2001. The bill also allocates funds to expand care services at 31 VA facilities across the nation, including $36.13 million for the Richland VA Clinic in Washington state.""The PACT Act will help over 124,000 post-9/11 veterans living in Washington state get care if they were exposed to toxins,” Sen. Cantwell said. ""This legislation also specifically authorizes funding to expand the VA Richland Outpatient Clinic, giving Tri-Cities area veterans more primary care, mental health, and specialty care options.”The Senate had previously passed the PACT Act in June with an 84-14 bipartisan vote, and the House went on to pass it 342-88. But last week, just after Democrats announced a plan to move forward with the Inflation Reduction Act, 25 Republican senators suddenly pulled their support and changed their vote -- the Republicans claimed that they disagreed with how the measure would be funded and believed that veterans should have to ask Congress to reapprove funding for the measure every year, instead of being able to rely on an automatic allocation. Sen. Cantwell has steadfastly supported the PACT Act, which now awaits President Biden’s signature. The bill is named after Sergeant First Class Health Robinson, a medic in the Ohio Army National Guard who died after a battle with a rare form of cancer caused by his exposure to burn pits in Iraq.Burn pits were commonly used to dispose of waste in or around military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan up until around 2010. These open-air pits would often include dangerous chemical compounds and hazardous materials, exposing service members to toxic fumes that can cause short- and long-term medical conditions.The PACT Act also authorizes $36 million for the Tri-Cities Outpatient Clinic, which will allow the clinic to lease a much larger space. The new facility would provide primary care, mental health, certain specialty care and ancillary services to veterans in the Tri-Cities area. The new clinic location would expand on care currently provided at the existing Richland Outpatient Clinic lease and relieve pressure at the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla.Sen. Cantwell is a strong advocate for veterans in Washington state and across the nation. Last year, in response to an uptick in call volume to veteran suicide hotlines, she joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues calling on the VA to swiftly develop a program that proactively reaches out to veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq and provides them with mental health resources.“This plan must proactively contact veterans in the coming months through means including, but not be limited to: digital correspondence, social media, phone calls, and text messages,” the senators wrote in a letter to VA Secretary Denis McDonough. “Furthermore, VA's outreach should consist of detailed information on clinical mental health services and community-based support systems, such as Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) and VA Vet Centers. For example, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America is just one of many VSOs that helps connect veterans to services critical to mental health and overall well-being.”In 2020, she and her fellow Senate Democrats advocated for Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange in the line of duty, calling on the Trump administration to stop stonewalling critical benefits for service members suffering from bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, Parkinsonism and hypertension related to their exposure.“Your Administration’s refusal to add these conditions to the presumptive list continues to deny more than 190,000 sick and aging veterans the health care and compensation they have earned and desperately need,” the senators wrote. “More than fifty years after their service and sacrifice, these veterans continue to suffer the detrimental effects of their exposure each day. These heroes deserve more than inaction and indecision from their own government— they deserve justice.”###"

Sen. Cantwell helped assemble a bipartisan coalition of Senators to support these investments, including:“Innovation is driving agricultural improvements all over the world, and America will not leave our farmers behind,” said Senator Cantwell. “The research investments in this bill will drive yield-improving technology like precision agriculture, an area where Washington State University is already leading the way with innovations from 3D vision systems to hand-held thinning devices. The funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing will also be important, helping to tackle delays for farm machinery and for the trucks needed to ship goods.” Currently, the semiconductor shortage in the U.S. is limiting farmers’ ability to access the equipment they need. The $52 billion to spur domestic semiconductor manufacturing, coupled with a 25% investment tax credit for domestic chip manufacturing worth $24 billion, will help ease supply chain issues for generations to come.""Our tractors have been delayed 8-12 months, pickups have been delayed about that long. Communication hardware for irrigation circles is a problem too,” said Adam Weber, owner of Weber Farms in Quincy, Wash.READ A LIST OF THE TOP 10 PRIORITIES OF THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT HERE Washington State University is a leader in precision agriculture. The school’s Center for Precision & Automated Agricultural Systems (CPAAS) researches agricultural automation and precision farming and focuses on Washington relevant research to meet the needs of agriculture in Washington state. In 2021, Washington State University also won a new center, AgAid, for applying artificial intelligence to agricultural production.These projects demonstrate how additional funding for research can provide useful benefits for Washington farmers. CPASS has completed several successful research projects, including developing technology to help accurately estimate apple crop load, improving the estimation by 20%, increasing efficiencies and profitability.Additionally, CPASS developed a 3D machine vision system to map red raspberry bushes for automatic pruning and created a hand-held mechanical thinning device for cherry production, allowing field workers to penetrate inner layers of cherry trees, increasing efficiency and productivity.The CHIPS and Science Bill will provide greater funding opportunities for WSU to continue to research and develop agriculture technology that benefits farmers and consumers.Sen.

Cantwell helped assemble a bipartisan coalition of Senators to support these investments, including:READ A LIST OF THE TOP 10 PRIORITIES OF THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT HERE“From quiet, clean-fueled jets to speedy, maneuverable drones, there’s no limit to the future of aerospace innovation,” said Senator Cantwell. “The CHIPS and Science bill authorizes billions of dollars to advance aerospace R&D, and Snohomish County stands ready to play a leading role — resulting in economic growth and good-paying jobs.”Snohomish County business are primed to benefit from investments in these areas:Next Generation of Aerospace Manufacturing:New materials, producing lighter, more sustainable aircraft, are the future of aerospace manufacturing. The NSF Technology Directorate ($20 billion from FY 2023 to FY 2027) will further U.S. research into advanced materials like thermoplastics and composite manufacturing which will produce the next generation of aircraft, from large-bodied planes to advanced air mobility concepts and drones.The NASA Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technology Program will help develop new composite materials, create efficient manufacturing processes, and reduce the time it takes to design, industrialize, and certify advanced materials and their manufacturing processes. This program will also leverage public-private partnerships to provide education and training opportunities for the U.S. aerospace workforce in advanced materials and manufacturing technology.A skilled workforce is critical to meeting future demand. According to the Washington State Department of Commerce, over the next 20 years, more than 200,000 new jobs could be created in the state to develop flight technologies for, design, and manufacture new types of aircraft. This will nearly triple the amount of aviation and aerospace jobs in Washington over the next two decades. Nationally, the U.S. composites end products market was valued at $26.7 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $33.4 billion in 2025.Sustainable Aviation:NASA will accelerate its sustainable aviation work through a newly authorized research and development initiative with a goal of (1) reducing greenhouse gas emissions from new aircraft by 50%; (2) reducing noise levels throughout all phases of flight; and (3) achieving net-zero aviation greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Aviation represents 11 percent of United States transportation-related emissions. Air travel is one of the most carbon intensive activities an individual can engage in. Washington state is the fifth largest consumer of aviation fuel in the United States. In 2019, jet fuel and aviation gasoline made up 7.8 percent of Washington’s total carbon emissions, significantly more than the national average of approximately 2.7 percent.NASA will continue to form partnerships with commercial aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing, other manufacturers in the supply chain, and new entrants, to advance research and development in commercial aviation emission reductions. NASA has partnered with Boeing and air carriers, such as Alaska Airlines through the Boeing ecoDemonstrator project, to test and prove sustainable aviation technologies. The project has made advancements such as fuel-efficient winglets, sustainable aviation fuel use, and additional carbon fiber composite applications possible in today’s commercial aircraft.These research and development goals directly align with the work of Washington aerospace companies and the growing number of new entrants in the sustainable aviation sector.Unmanned Aircraft Systems – Drones:NASA’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operation Program will continue unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) research and testing to advance air traffic management technologies and promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system.UAS, otherwise known as drones, are the fastest growing segment of aviation in the United States. As of January, over 860,000 drones have been registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and over 260,000 Remote Pilots have been certified by the FAA. These numbers are projected to continue to grow.This NASA program has the potential to benefit efforts underway by members of Washington’s Uncrewed Systems Industry Council, which seeks to help the state compete on a national and international basis in this fast-growth sector of aviation.  According to the Washington State Department of Commerce, approximately 200 companies – twice the number from five years ago – are involved in aircraft, systems, datasets, traffic management, and other UAS technologies.  This means more than 2,000 direct jobs which, based on the past trajectory, could grow quickly to more than 10,000 jobs in the next several years.Aerospace Supply Chain:Strengthening the supply chain, from first tier to sub-tier suppliers, is critical to U.S. aerospace manufacturing and Washington’s 1,400 supply chain companies, the country’s largest concentration.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) ($2.3 billion from FY 2023 to FY 2027) will help Washington supply chain companies integrate new technologies, and fend off new threats like cyberattacks.Impact Washington helps facilitate the MEP program in the state and has provided manufacturing and job training assistance to aerospace businesses.Domestic Semiconductor Capacity:Semiconductors are an integral part of key systems used in the aerospace and defense industry – chips enable critical avionics systems like flight computers to function. Building up U.S. capacity to produce chips domestically through the enactment of the CHIPS Act ($52 billion in semiconductor manufacturing incentives and research funding) will ensure more secure and resilient supply chains for original equipment manufacturers in the aviation supply and their tiered suppliers in Washington.Sen.

In Southwest Washington, generations of business owners, researchers, and workers are poised to lead us into the future by helping us solve supply chain shortages, secure advanced chips needed by our Armed Forces, and support American leadership in developing industries like artificial intelligence, clean energy and quantum computing.”The CHIPS and Science Act would enable the Department of Commerce to provide incentives via loans and loan guarantees as well as grants to chip manufacturers, as well as to companies that do not make chips (e.g., chip equipment and materials suppliers). Additional funds can support local workforce development efforts. These activities may be beneficial to a range of local companies, like Analog Devices, nLight, and SEH America.The CHIPS and Science Act also reauthorizes NSF’s Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program and doubles the budget for ATE from the current level of $75 million per year to $150 million per year. This program helps community colleges like Clark College improve and expand educational programs for technicians to work in high-tech STEM fields that drive the U.S. economy and secure good paying jobs in Clark County.Additionally, the CHIPS and Science Act provides support for expanding internship and experimental learning opportunities at Washington State University Vancouver like the school’s Future Leaders Project, which aims to connect historically underserved students with paid summer internships and mentoring. The bill also supports the school’s ongoing efforts to increase the access, entry and retention of women and people of color in STEM fields.

For instance, the University of Washington’s tech transfer lab, CoMotion, has already helped to facilitate 1,950 patented licenses and 73 UW spinoffs which have gone on to raise over $4.3 billion in funding.Today, there are 103 active UW spinoffs in the state of Washington with 4,081 employees. Other UW patents have supported the production of life-saving biologics, including insulins and hepatitis B vaccines.These successful ventures are strong examples of tech transfer for the rest of the country.The impact of the bill will be felt across all of Seattle. Several of the region’s companies are engaged in developing technology in the ten key technology areas targeted by the bill (the ten areas are listed below).Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine LearningOne specific key technology where the Seattle-area tech ecosystem already shows considerable strength is artificial intelligence and machine learning.Seattle is the third largest employer of the AI workforce, with 9% of our nation’s AI professionals in Seattle. The University of Washington, according to U.S. News and World Report, is ranked No. 5 for an AI education.UW is already receiving substantial funding from the NSF in this area, including two new institutes announced in 2021: An artificial intelligence research institute, the AI Institute for Dynamic Systems (expected to receive approximately $20 million in funding over five years), and the Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery Institute — or A3D3 Institute – set to receive $15 million over five years.Leading tech companies based in Washington are implementing machine learning and artificial intelligence today – to interactively and in real-time train such skills as surgery and military equipment repairs. With this ecosystem, work opportunities and economic growth will continue for the state well into the future.Chips & Science Act Ten Key Technology AreasSen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/richlands-pnnl-to-share-in-nearly-17-billion-funding-increase-for-national-laboratories-secured-by-cantwell,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— This week, the U.S. Senate and House passed the CHIPS and Science Act, authorizing $250 billion to advance key technologies of the future.U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, is one of the primary architects of the bill, which is currently awaiting President Biden’s signature. The bill was led through a Congressional Conference Committee by Sen. Cantwell and will include $16.9 billion in additional funding to support research on key technology areas at Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, including the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland.“PNNL scientists and researchers are developing the technologies we need to reduce greenhouse gases and mitigate the impacts of climate change,” said Sen. Cantwell. “This investment will supercharge their important work, and bolster the lab’s $1.6 billion contribution to the Washington state economy.”READ A LIST OF THE TOP 10 PRIORITIES OF THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT HERE “This bill is an important commitment to the kind of technological innovation that is key to our national competitiveness and security – the kind of innovation for which the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is known.  Once funded, it will help advance U.S. scientific leadership in computing, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, biotechnology, advanced materials for energy storage and other clean energy technologies, in addition to increasing the domestic production of much-needed semiconductors.  It will do so by investing in and leveraging the world class research staff and facilities at PNNL and the other national labs.  As chair of the conference committee responsible for this landmark legislation, Senator Cantwell deserves our thanks for her leadership and commitment to science,” said Dr. Steven F. Ashby, Director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.PNNL maintains one-of-a-kind, world-class research capabilities that support sustainable energy and U.S. national security -- particularly innovation in areas like energy storage, grid modernization, and carbon capture. While the United States is a leader in these technologies, federal energy R&D spending has declined from 0.14% of GDP in 1978 to just 0.04% in 2019. Thirteen other countries invest more in energy R&D as a share of their economies than the United States. With passage of this Act, new investments will be targeted toward key technology areas such as nuclear power, cleaner fossil fuels, and sustainable energy projects.With approximately 5,000 employees, PNNL is the largest single employer in the Tri-Cities region and one of the largest in Eastern Washington. In total, the lab’s economic impact is responsible for $1.59 billion in economic activity, 7,580 direct or indirect jobs, and $651 million in Washington state wages.Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-co-leads-bicameral-legislation-to-protect-consumers-and-prevent-energy-market-manipulation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) introduced bicameral legislation to provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with additional authority to protect consumers from the harm caused by traders that repeatedly manipulate electricity and natural gas markets. The Energy Consumer Protection Act is also being introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09).“This legislation will add a key consumer protection arrow to FERC’s quiver by blocking market manipulators from repeating their crimes and harming energy consumers,” said Senator Cantwell. “The burden of today’s elevated energy prices makes the quick passage of this bill more important than ever.”“We need an all-of-the-above strategy to make sure that energy prices are affordable for Nevadans,” said Senator Cortez Masto, “and that includes my legislation to create new tools to prevent bad actors from manipulating energy markets and hiking up prices for consumers and businesses alike. I’m going to continue working to bring down costs for businesses and families in the Silver State.”  Current law bans market manipulation, but FERC’s current enforcement mechanisms aren’t sufficient for deterring traders from violating the law. This legislation would give FERC additional tools to enforce existing law. The Energy Consumer Protection Act would allow FERC to temporarily or permanently ban traders from trading in certain energy markets if they 1) violate the Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act by manipulating the electricity or natural gas markets or 2) file false information regarding those markets.Full bill text is available HERE.Senator Cantwell has long sought to protect consumers from unjustified energy prices. In the aftermath of Enron’s energy trading schemes, Cantwell authored an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that strengthened the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) authority to investigate and punish market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets.  Since then, FERC has built a permanent cadre of internal energy experts that continually monitor and investigate anomalous market trends and suspicious behavior. These policemen on the beat have uncovered numerous exploitive schemes, to date approving 127 settlement agreements, assessing over $790 million in civil penalties and disgorging over $521 million in illegal profits. In the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, Cantwell authored legislation that gave the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) similar anti-market manipulation authority and responsibilities in financially-settled energy commodity derivatives markets. Over the last decade, the Commission has used their anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation authority to prosecute more than 50 actions which have collectively imposed more than $4.5 billion in monetary relief.A Cantwell addition to the 2007 Energy Bill gave the FTC virtually identical anti-market manipulation authority and responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission to oversee wholesale crude oil and petroleum markets.  However, unlike FERC and the CFTC, the FTC has only used their authority sparingly.Most recently, Sen. Cantwell introduced S.4217, the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act, which would significantly enhance the 2007 authority and establish a new unit within the FTC dedicated to overseeing transportation fuel markets, as well as direct the Energy Information Administration to collect the market data necessary to effectively monitor and police markets. The bill will protect consumers at the pump by increasing transparency, uncovering possible manipulation, and penalizing cheaters up to $2 million per day.### "
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/major-upgrades-expected-for-washington-ports-rivers-salmon-wetlands-as-water-resources-development-act-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022 by a vote of 93-1. U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), fought to secure language in the bill that would provide funding for critical port, water resource and salmon restoration projects in Washington state. The Senate will now work with the House of Representatives to move a bicameral bill forward to be considered by the House and Senate.“Senate passage of the Water Resources Development Act is a major step forward for Washington state waterways, ports, and salmon,” said Senator Cantwell. “This funding will support key infrastructure projects, like deepening the Blair waterway in Tacoma to increase competitiveness at the port and dredging the Port of Clarkston to boost tourism, it will open more than 100 miles of salmon habitat by constructing fish passage at Howard Hanson Dam, and support water storage innovations, like ground water and aquifer storage. I look forward to ensuring that these and other Washington state projects get underway soon.” “Salmon recovery has got to be a major federal priority—it’s my job to make sure it is and this year’s Water Resources Development Act has us headed in the right direction,” said Senator Murray. “The provisions Senator Cantwell and I fought to secure will go a long way in restoring critical salmon habitat, make important investments our water transportation infrastructure, and helping to ensure every family has access to clean, safe drinking water. This legislation is good news for our salmon, good news for our ports, and good news for our entire state.”Below is a full list of all Washington state projects included in the Senate-passed WRDA Bill:Howard A. Hanson Dam Downstream Fish Passage Facility:WRDA will authorize construction of the Howard A. Hanson Dam Downstream Fish Passage, which will open at least 100 miles of prime salmon and steelhead habitat above the Howard A. Hanson Dam in Pierce County, nearly doubling the amount of habitat currently available. Completing the downstream fish passage facility will also allow the Additional Water Storage Project for the Green River to move forward, ensuring clean water to surrounding communities.Tacoma Harbor Deepening:WRDA will allow the Army Corps to deepen the Blair Waterway at the Port of Tacoma. The current authorized depth of the federal channel in Tacoma’s Blair Waterway does not meet the draft requirements of today’s fleet of larger container ships, which means these ships can’t call on the Port of Tacoma. Deepening the waterway will allow for these ships to call on the Port of Tacoma, creating more economic opportunity for the Port, Seaport Alliance and surrounding community.Dredging at the Port of Clarkston:Directs the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Port of Clarkston, ensuring vessels can continue passage. Maintenance of the Snake River between Lewiston, Idaho and Clarkston, Washington is critical to support safe and efficient navigation. Over 8.6 million tons of cargo are moved by barge on the inland portion of the Columbia Snake River System that feeds the deep draft lower Columbia River which transported over 56 million tons of cargo in 2018. In any given year, nearly 10% of the U.S. wheat exports transit the Snake River and the river cruise industry on the Columbia Snake River System provided over 25,000 cruise passengers in 2019, with over $15M in direct economic benefits to the region.Duckabush Estuary Restoration:Directs the Army Corps of Engineers to consider taking further action and providing resources to reconnect the Duckabush River to neighboring floodplains and wetlands by modifying local roads, elevating Highway 101, and rerouting utilities. This is a critical step in the removal and replacement of the Highway 101 causeway and bridges and in the larger Puget Sound Nearshore Restoration Project which is restoring nearshore habitat throughout Puget Sound.Columbia River Treaty Flood ProtectionWRDA directs the Army Corps to study one of the key pillars in the efforts to modernize the Columbia River Treaty regime: flood control in the Columbia River Basin. The Columbia River Basin experiences high annual runoff, variation in flows and a limited amount of water storage in the United States portion of the Columbia River Basin. The WRDA bill authorizes a study to evaluate how to improve water storage and flood control in the Columbia River Basin.Army Corps Aquifer Recharge and Water Supply Conservation: Directs the Army Corps to evaluate alternative water storage processes, such as aquifer recharge and groundwater storage, when addressing flood storage and water conservation projects. This will lead to innovative solutions to water conservation and storage challenges that Washington state and states throughout the West face.Expanding Mitigation Banking:Allows for more entities to use mitigation banking credits and help process mitigation banking credits. A mitigation bank is a wetland, stream, or other aquatic resource area that has been restored, established, enhanced, or preserved for the purpose of providing compensation for unavoidable impacts to aquatic resources when there are port, flood control or water supply projects. This is a big deal for our ports that undertake many types of projects that require mitigation banking to support supply chain efficiency and resilience, safety, job growth, and economic development which benefits the community and promotes stability of the region. Columbia River Village Development Plan:Requires the Army Corps of Engineers to revise and complete the village development plan for Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Washington and Oregon to address the impacts to Indian villages and housing sites that resulted from construction of multiple dams by the Corps in the Columbia River Basin. When the Dalles Lock and Dam in Oregon was constructed in the 1950s, Tribal villages in Celilo, Oregon and Spearfish, Washington were inundated and lost. The Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the construction of a replacement village to compensate the four Columbia River Treaty Tribes: the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation; the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation; the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation; and the Nez Perce Tribe. Columbia River Ecosystem Restoration Study:Directs the Army Corps to study salmon recovery and restoration throughout the Columbia River Basin and its tributaries.A one-page summary on WRDA 2022 is available HERE, a section-by-section summary is available HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/us-senate-approves-biggest-ever-investment-in-american-tech-innovation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the U.S. Senate passed the Chips and Science Act, a nearly $250 billion package of historic federal investments in American science and technology research, innovation and manufacturing led and negotiated by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA).""We know that innovation is in the DNA of Americans. We know it's helped us win the world wars, it's helped us cure disease, it's helped create millions of jobs,"" Sen. Cantwell said. ""We don't know exactly what innovations will come out of this, but we do know this: America will be more competitive because of it. And we do know this, that we will be able to grow our economy for the future, because of the investments that we've made today.""Sen. Cantwell, who serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, is a key architect of the bill’s provisions. She led the conference committee, and over the past few weeks she helped rally a last-minute bipartisan push for keeping investments in science in the legislation. The Act passed the Senate by a 64-33 vote.This historic $250 billion investment aims to make America safer and more prosperous. Here’s how:1) Protects U.S. Consumers, Industry, and our Armed Forces from Future Semiconductor Shortages: The Act delivers $76 billion to develop the next generation of semiconductor technologies and to re-establish U.S. strengths in semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductors are the oil of the 21st century – they’re found in a huge variety of products, from vehicles, medical devices, and cell phones to advanced national security technology. But only 12% of chips are manufactured in the United States, down from 37% in the 1990s.Chips shortages have damaged U.S. manufacturing capabilities in the automotive sector, harmed American agriculture, and contributed to inflation. Even worse, advanced military systems do not work without trustworthy semiconductors. The U.S. cannot risk falling further behind.2) Turns U.S.-Funded Innovations Into Products Faster:The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) new Technology Directorate will invest $20 billion over five years to support pioneering research in technology areas critical to U.S. economic and national security leadership.The Directorate will help researchers and universities translate their innovations into patent-protected, market-ready products. These investments will help ensure that American innovation isn’t co-opted by other nations, but is instead turned into products that can be made in America, benefitting American businesses and creating American jobs.3) Funds Pioneering Research to Secure Energy Supplies and Help Cool Down the Planet:The Act will increase funding for the Department of Energy’s cutting-edge research, development, and deployment activities by $16.9 billion. This pioneering research is vital to America’s energy security, and for discovering and testing new approaches to combat climate change.Much of this work is performed by DOE’s 17 National Laboratories, including the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) in Richland, which is one of the largest employers in Washington state.The Act also includes an additional five-year, $50.3 billion reauthorization for the DOE Office of Science, supporting a broad range of range of basic science research programs in areas like quantum computing, artificial photosynthesis, coastal zone research, high energy physics, and climate and earth modeling.4) Trains Hundreds of Thousands of New STEM Workers:No amount of investment in research and technology can be successful without a strong American workforce. The Act therefore puts more than $13 billion into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development. By 2030, the U.S. is on track to have 3 million fewer technically-trained workers than we need. For the first time, Congress will direct the NSF to identify and address workforce needs across a range of ten critical fields, such as cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing, by issuing scholarships and traineeships.The Act also directs nearly $2 billion to minority serving institutions (MSIs) and other emerging research institutions around the country, including Tribal colleges and universities, a major investment in institutions with a proven track record of helping grow a diverse workforce.5) Turns More Towns into Tech Hubs:The Act creates a new $10 billion Department of Commerce program to nurture locally-driven innovation regions and the good-paying jobs that come with them. Just five U.S. metro areas—Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, and San Diego—accounted for 90 percent of growth in the innovation sectors between 2005 and 2017.This program will encourage this growth across the country, creating new opportunities for other regions that are primed for technology leadership with the right investment. This program will create new collaborations between local governments, universities, labor, and the private sector to expand innovation capacity nationwide and accelerate the economic development that the nation needs to remain competitive.6) Triples Support for American-Made Tech:The Act triples funding, from $158M to $550M annually, for the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which supports small- and medium-sized manufacturers with cybersecurity, workforce training, and supply chain resiliency. Impact Washington, the MEP Center in Washington state, has helped create and retain 19,000 jobs since its founding in 1997.SENATOR CANTWELL’S REMARKS ON THE SENATE FLOOR AVAILABLE HERE, AUDIO HERE, AND FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-protect-the-right-to-contraception-nationwide,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined 29 Democratic colleagues in introducing the Right to Contraception Act to codify the right to contraception access established by the Supreme Court ruling Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965. The bill would also protect healthcare providers who prescribe contraceptives and information on contraception; and allow the Department of Justice, providers, and patients to bring legal action should this law be violated.“The right to access birth control has ensured life-changing social and economic freedom for women. An overwhelming majority of Americans believe birth control should remain legal and accessible, but far-right politicians and judges across the country are trying to weaken or overturn this precedent — one that should be long past settled,” said Sen. Cantwell. “I will continue to defend women’s right to privacy and choice in light of these attacks.”After the reversal of Roe v. Wade, many conservative states have introduced legislation to ban or limit access to contraceptives, including Plan B and intrauterine devices, (IUDs). Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Missouri have already barred Planned Parenthood from their state Medicaid programs, severely limiting access for residents in those states.The Right to Contraception Act would protect against these attacks and uphold access to contraception by:Following the Dobbs decision, Justice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion urging the Supreme Court to revisit other rights grounded in the long standing interpretation of the 14th amendment, ensuring the constitutional right to privacy which protects the right to contraception.The Right to Contraception Act is endorsed by: Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Women’s Law Center, National Organization for Women, Power to Decide, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Reproductive Health Access Project, Catholics for Choice, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Upstream USA, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Partnership for Women & Families, Jewish Women International, Positive Women’s Network-USA, National Council of Jewish Women.ICYMI: Last week, GOP members blocked the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-warns-of-chilling-effect-of-idahos-criminal-penalties-for-abortion,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined several Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor to speak in support of the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act. During her floor remarks, Sen. Cantwell emphasized the need to protect providers in pro-choice states like Washington from being prosecuted for providing care to patients traveling from bordering anti-choice states. In March, Idaho’s governor signed a bill modeled after Texas’s SB8, which allows private citizens to sue doctors for providing abortion care services.  Sen. Cantwell posed this question to one of the authors of the bill, Sen. Cortez Masto (D-NV): “What is happening now with the chilling effect to providers and their anxiety over people pursuing them for seeing patients from states in which Roe v. Wade is not fully protected?”Responded Sen. Cortez Masto: “What I hear from my providers is that, ‘we want to help women, we want them to come to our state, but if their state is going to pursue legislation or criminalize, or penalize, or prosecute us, or a private citizen can come after us from that state -- then we're having second thoughts about this,’ because they do not want to be embroiled in some sort of litigation.”Sen. Cantwell continued, “We were joined by the American Medical Association who also expressed this concern. They are speaking on behalf of the providers that want to provide reproductive choice in states that have passed this law and they are concerned. We need to get this legislation passed.”Earlier this week, Sen. Cantwell joined 33 of her Democratic Senate colleagues in introducing the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022. The legislation clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to penalize or prosecute providers offering services in states where reproductive health care is legal, or limit travel for patients to receive abortion services in these states. The bill would empower the U.S. Attorney General or the impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict an individual’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.Last week, Sen. Cantwell called on the U.S. Department of Justice to provide clarity on current law and potential federal actions to protect patients and providers at a press conference at UW Medical Center. At the press conference, Sen. Cantwell said, “With these new laws restricting rights, many states have concerns about our health care community and how they will continue to practice if those services are challenged by patients who traveled from states where abortion has been criminalized.”Sen. Cantwell continued, providers, “should continue to provide reproductive choice, without the concern that someone from another state, an Attorney General, or law enforcement officer is going to try to pursue them or their license…We need to provide certainty so they can provide the full range of health care services, regardless of where that patient comes from.”At a roundtable event at Planned Parenthood – Spokane Health Center last month, Planned Parenthood officials noted to Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-heralds-six-washington-state-partners-chosen-to-be-national-apprenticeship-ambassadors,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, six Washington state workforce development organizations were chosen by the Department of Labor (DOL) to join the inaugural group of Apprenticeship Ambassadors, a program created through the DOL to promote, expand, and diversify apprenticeships to grow the U.S. workforce.The following six organizations were chosen to serve as Apprenticeship Ambassadors from Washington state:Organization Name City ApprentiIssaquahApprenticePathRedmondApprenticeship and Nontraditional Employment for Women (ANEW)RentonMicrosoftRedmondSpokane Community CollegeSpokaneThe Alliance for Media Arts + CultureSpokaneAccording to the Department of Labor, in FY 2021, Washington state had 17,676 active apprentices across 239 active apprenticeship programs. In that same year, 2,758 apprentices completed their training and 7,027 new apprentices started their programs.In November 2021, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh announced the Apprenticeship Ambassador Initiative to bring together industry, labor, education, equity and workforce leaders to partner with the department’s Office of Apprenticeship to promote Registered Apprenticeships as a valuable workforce strategy in high-demand industries to develop and expand opportunities for people historically underserved.The DOL Apprenticeship Ambassador program will consist of community based organizations, educators, employers, equity partners, industry associations, labor organizations, State organizations, program sponsors, and workforce partners.Sen. Cantwell has been a champion for apprenticeship programs and investments for workforce development opportunities. In 2017, Sen. Cantwell introduced bipartisan legislation to create strong incentives for businesses who invest in apprenticeship programs that would benefit both employers and workers.The full list of Apprenticeship Ambassadors is available HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-protect-abortion-patients-and-providers-from-prosecution,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined 33 of her Democratic Senate colleagues in introducing the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022. This legislation clarifies that it is illegal for anti-choice states to penalize or prosecute providers offering services in states where reproductive health care is legal, or limit travel for patients to receive abortion services in these states. The bill would empower the U.S. Attorney General or the impacted individuals to bring civil action against those who restrict an individual’s right to cross state lines to receive legal reproductive care.Last week, Sen. Cantwell called on the U.S. Department of Justice to provide clarity on current law and potential federal actions to protect patients and providers at a press conference at UW Medical Center. At the press conference, Sen. Cantwell said, “With these new laws restricting rights, many states have concerns about our health care community and how they will continue to practice if those services are challenged by patients who traveled from states where abortion has been criminalized.”Sen. Cantwell continued, “[Health care officials] should continue to provide reproductive choice, without the concern that someone from another state, an Attorney General, or law enforcement officer is going to try to pursue them or their license…We need to provide certainty so they can provide the full range of health care services, regardless of where that patient comes from.”Legislation introduced in Missouri and draft legislation proposed by anti-choice extremists make clear that interstate travel for reproductive health care is under attack. The Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 underscores the Constitutional protections for interstate travel and provides redress for patients whose rights are violated. The legislation would also protect health care providers in pro-choice states like Washington from prosecution and lawsuits for serving individuals traveling from other states.At a roundtable event at Planned Parenthood – Spokane Health Center last month, Planned Parenthood officials noted to Sen. Cantwell that they have already seen a 60% increase in patients traveling across state lines from Idaho. In March 2022, Idaho’s Governor signed an abortion ban modeled after Texas’s SB8, allowing private citizens to sue doctors for providing abortion care services.  Sen. Cantwell is also a co-sponsor of the My Body, My Data Act, which would create a new national standard to protect personal health care data by minimizing personal data from being collected, retained, disclosed, or misused. A summary of the bill is available HERE.Prior to Dobbs decision release, Sen. Cantwell joined 24 Senate colleagues in a letter urging President Biden to take immediate federal action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights and prepare for the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade.In addition to Sen. Cantwell (D-WA), the Freedom to Travel for Health Care Act of 2022 is cosponsored by Senators Durbin (D-IL), Schumer (D-NY), Blumenthal (D-CT), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Padilla (D-CA) Klobuchar (D-MN), Menendez (D-NJ), Stabenow (D-MI), Reed (D-RI), Duckworth (D-IL), Feinstein (D-CA), Murphy (D-CT), Hirono (D-HI), Smith (D-MN), Bennet (D-CO), Baldwin (D-WI), Coons (D-DE), Markey (D-MA), Warnock (D-GA), Van Hollen (D-MD), Wyden (D-OR), Kaine (D-VA), Warren (D-MA), Luján (D-NM), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (I-VT), and Tester (D-MT). The legislation is led by Senators Cortez Masto (D-NV), Whitehouse (D-RI), Murray (D-WA), and Gillibrand (D-NY).This legislation is endorsed by National Women's Law Center, American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and Advocates for Youth. Video of Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/new-levee-project-in-grays-harbor-to-help-protect-region-from-intense-flooding,"ABERDEEN, WA — Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) attended the groundbreaking of the Aberdeen-Hoquiam Flood Protection Project yesterday and celebrated the major step forward to protect homes and businesses in Grays Harbor County from severe flooding, spurring future opportunities for economic growth.“More than 10 percent of Grays Harbor’s population lives within this flood plain, and the local residents and business owners have to face these difficulties,” Sen. Cantwell said. “Many local businesses have said it’s too expensive to even rent space because of the insurance premiums, and residents here in Aberdeen and Hoquiam pay over $2 million in flood insurance a year. This is just simply unacceptable – too high, if we’re going to help this community grow and develop.”The Aberdeen-Hoquiam Flood Protection Project is composed of two levees designed and placed in order to protect the region’s low-lying areas from floods, improve storm drainage and reduce the economic burden of flooding disasters. Once completed, the project will remove more than 3,100 properties from FEMA’s mapped Special Flood Hazard area.Currently, the area is vulnerable to intense flooding. The financial burdens of rebuilding, the increased costs associated with flood insurance, and reduced development and investment opportunities in the community have negatively impacted the local economy; in the past four years, Aberdeen and Hoquiam have lost an estimated 842 jobs due to floods.“The cities of Aberdeen and Hoquiam have been battling flooding for well over 100 years,” said Nick Bird, city engineer for the city of Aberdeen. “Once this facility is in operation, the area behind us, there will be a noticeable reduction in flood hazards upstream.”The total project will cost $202.8 million; so far, it’s secured $54.8 million, including $29.9 million from the Washington State Legislature, $15 million in city funding and $9.95 million in FEMA Congressionally Directed Spending. The project is under consideration for $34.65 million in funding through a FEMA Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant requested by the City of Hoquiam. Sen. Cantwell also helped request $5 million in Congressionally Directed Spending for this project for the 2023 fiscal year.A transcript of the event can be found HERE. Audio can be found HERE."

Maria Cantwell, (D-WA) Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Spokane International Airport and Pullman-Moscow Airport have been awarded a combined $32.8 million in grant funding from the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) new Airport Terminal Program to support infrastructure upgrades and modernization projects.  The funding was made possible through the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law.“As our airports are seeing a pre-pandemic level of passenger demand, it’s important that we continue to invest in our airport infrastructure to prepare for future growth,” said Sen. Cantwell. “This $32.8 million in new funding to upgrade airport terminals will expand service in Spokane by adding gate capacity that will bring new flights to additional destinations, construct a brand new airport terminal building in Pullman, and improve the traveler experience in Seattle.”“Our airports are critical to our economic success in Washington state and this investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help modernize airports across the state,” said Sen. Murray. “The upgrades at terminals in Seattle, Spokane, and Pullman will accommodate new passengers, increase accessibility, and improve energy efficiency. These kinds of investments will also help strengthen our supply chains as we work to get goods where they need to go as quickly as possible to lower costs on shelves. As Washington state continues to lead and grow as a hub for travel and commerce, I’m going to keep working to make sure our airports have the resources they need to deliver world class service for everyone who lives in and passes through our state.”Yesterday, Sen. Cantwell visited Spokane International Airport to underscore the need for federal funding to support efforts to renovate and add additional gates to Terminal C in order to increase flight frequency for existing routes and connect Eastern Washington to new nonstop destinations. Sen. Cantwell previously provided a letter of support for the airport’s grant application to the Department of Transportation.The following Airport Terminal Program grants were awarded:$11 million for Spokane Airport Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX).   With ATP funding, the airport can begin Phase I, which will add three additional gates, expand the existing ticketing area, upgrade mechanical and HVAC systems and consolidate the baggage system, improving overall accessibility.  The project is shovel ready with construction starting in August this year.   $11.8 million for Pullman-Moscow Airport Terminal Project.  The $57.1 million terminal project includes a five-fold increase in current terminal capacity, with the ability to accommodate two gates and one charter, compliant security checkpoints, extended airline space, and concessions, while allowing for future expansion.  Construction began in July of this year.  $10 million for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Restroom Modernization Project.  The project includes renovation of five sets of restrooms within concourses B, C, and D which have not been remodeled since 1992.  Deteriorating infrastructure has resulted in a poor customer experience.   Last year, Senators Cantwell and Murray worked hard to secure funding for air travel infrastructure nationwide as part of the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law. With their support, the infrastructure package provided a total of $25 billion for airport improvements, including $5 billion for the Airport Terminal Program, $5 billion for Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control facilities, and $15 billion in Airport Infrastructure Grants. Senators Cantwell and Murray also helped to secure $16 million for Spokane Regional Airport in Airport Rescue Grants to help weather the COVID-19 pandemic.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-calls-on-dot-to-help-fund-spokane-international-airport-terminal-expansion,"SPOKANE, WA – Today, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) held a press conference at Spokane International Airport highlighting the facility’s need to expand its air travel capacity to keep up with the region’s rapid growth.In remarks alongside airport leaders and regional economic stakeholders, Sen. Cantwell voiced her ongoing support for a project to renovate and add additional gates to Terminal C, which would aid in increasing flight frequency for existing routes and connecting Eastern Washington to new nonstop destinations. “We know very well that companies like to locate close to airports. It helps cuts down on costs, it helps them to reach markets,” Sen. Cantwell said. “We need to make sure that Congress continues to make investments in these important projects.”“Modern, resilient and sustainable airports will help strengthen our supply chain, help our U.S. businesses compete in a global economy, and get our consumers where they need to go,” Sen. Cantwell continued. “I'm proud to support this application, and hope that the Department of Transportation will act very soon, hopefully within the next few days, to let us know about this investment request.”Spokane International Airport has applied for an Airport Terminal Program (ATP) grant, which is a competitive grant program funded through the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law, to help fund its multiphase Terminal Renovation and Expansion project (TREX). Sen. Cantwell previously provided a letter of support for the airport’s grant application to the Department of Transportation.Work on the TREX project is scheduled to begin in August. With ATP funding, the airport can begin Phase I, which will add three additional gates, expand the existing ticketing area, upgrade mechanical and HVAC systems and consolidate the baggage system, improving overall accessibility. “It is remarkable to note that this project is the first substantial investment in terminal building expansion and renovation in over 23 years. The TREX project will deliver substantial benefits to our community. First and foremost, it gives us more gate capacity to help our airline partners to expand service to new cities or to increase frequencies within their existing networks,” said Larry Krauter, CEO of the Spokane Regional Airport.“Not only is this project mission-critical to the Spokane Airport – it is economically impactful to the city of Spokane, to our local region and to the State of Washington. This project incorporates a wide variety of work that’s going to require specific skills from craftsmen represented by all building trades,” said Hollis Barnett, Vice President of Garco Construction. “The airport is a key driver of our region’s economic success, and the impacts of this exciting project will be immediate and long lasting. The TREX project will create more than 1,600 direct and indirect construction jobs,” said Mark Mattke, CEO of the Spokane Workforce Council. “Spokane is actually one of the fastest growing areas in the U.S. – Spokane County’s population has grown three times as fast as Washington state overall in the last year, and 10 times as fast as the rest of the U.S.” Last year, Sen. Cantwell worked hard to secure funding for air travel infrastructure nationwide as part of the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law.

Maria Cantwell (D-WA) sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for clarity on current law and potential federal actions to protect patients and providers following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.In a press conference at the Brotman Surgery Pavilion at UW Medical Center alongside medical providers, Planned Parenthood leaders and abortion advocates, Cantwell said that healthcare providers and patients in pro-choice states like Washington need clarity on three points:“We need to provide certainty so they can provide the full range of healthcare services, regardless of where that patient comes from,” Sen. Cantwell said. “They’re going to provide women who desperately need this care the comfort and the knowledge that they can have these healthcare discussion is in our state – but we need to protect our healthcare delivery system here in Washington state.”“When abortion becomes illegal in Idaho and many, many more patients start crossing the border for care, we don’t know what it’s going to mean for our system,” said Jennifer Allen, Chief Executive Officer at Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates.“Many of our providers have expressed concern regarding the attempts to criminalize abortion and punish abortion providers, and have legitimate concerns about their own safety from people who are acting as vigilantes,” said Dr. Barbara A. Goff, MD, UW Professor, Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology.“(Health care workers) are already starting to see women travel from as close as Idaho to as far away (as) Texas to receive care. These are patients who are scared, who are confused. They want to know why they can't receive the care they need close to home,” said Dr. Nariman Heshmati, OB-GYN, Washington State Medical Association. “While the OBGYNs here and all the healthcare workers are committed to providing that care, there's worry about what this is going to do to access -- what this is going to do for delays in care. We could see a fivefold increase in the number of reproductive age women (for whom) their closest abortion provider is right here in Washington state.”According to the Guttmacher Institute, Washington state could see a 385% increase in patients seeking abortions, with most potentially coming from neighboring Idaho that has a trigger law to ban abortions.Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coastal-communities-in-wa-threatened-by-climate-change-are-eligible-for-225-million-in-federal-grants,"SEATTLE, WA — U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, encouraged Washington state, counties, municipalities and Tribes to apply for $225 million in funding opportunities made possible by the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law for coastal resilience projects that restore habitat, enhance coastal zone management and the National Estuarine Reserve System, and remove marine debris.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) this week announced the Climate Ready Coasts initiative to increase coastal resilience by funding landscape-scale habitat restoration, and capacity building for under-resourced coastal communities and communities most vulnerable to climate impacts. It includes seven Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) and three Requests For Applications (RFAs).These programs are part of a $2.855 billion investment in salmon habitat recovery and coastal resilience investment championed by Senator Cantwell in the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law that was signed into law last year.All of these funding sources will be available to Washington state’s orca and salmon recovery networks, nonprofit organization, local and state agencies, and Tribal governments to immediately implement habitat restoration and climate resilience projects in communities throughout Puget Sound, the Columbia River System and the coast.NOAA Coastal Habitat RestorationUp to $95 million is available for planning and implementation of coastal habitat restoration projects. A total of $85 million will support transformational projects that restore habitat for our nation’s fisheries and protected resources, while also strengthening the resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems. An additional $10 million will be available for building capacity for underserved communities to help identify, design and implement new restoration projects.In Washington state, Community-Based Restoration Program grants have funded more than 250 projects since 1996, such as the Meadowdale Beach Park Estuary Restoration Project in Snohomish County, and the Cathlamet Bay Watershed Connectivity and Tidal Restoration project in the Columbia River Estuary. NOAA Coastal Zone ManagementUp to $40 million is available for projects funded through coastal zone management grants to help address threats of climate change such as rising sea levels, larger-than-usual storm surges, and more frequent, more destructive storms.The funding will also enable coastal management programs to deliver increased support for communities most vulnerable to climate impacts, including those which have historically been underserved and lack access to resources.In Washington state, this additional funding could fill the a critical gap of adding technical assistance capacity for under-resourced coastal communities to chart and implement their path to building coastal resiliency.  -          Project engineering, design and planning projects between $200,000 and $500,000.-          Habitat restoration projects between $2 million and $6 million.-          Land conservation projects between $1 million and $4 million over the award period. -          Applicants may propose projects with a federal funding request less than or more than these amounts, up to $6 million.NOAA National Estuarine Research ReservesUp to $15 million is available for habitat conservation and restoration projects funded through National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) grants to advance the climate and resilience priorities of the research reserve system.  The funding will also enable research reserves to deliver increased support for communities most vulnerable to climate impacts, including those which have historically been underserved and often lack access to resources, and support diversity and inclusion.Estuaries are like huge sponges -- absorbing pollutants, silt, and protecting upland areas from crashing waves and soil erosion. In Washington state, estuaries also play an important role in the life cycle of Pacific salmon, enabling young salmon to grow and get strong before they migrate into the open ocean.In Washington state, the Padilla Bay reserve protects one of the nation's largest eelgrass beds (nearly?8,000 acres),?and?plays a key role in cleaning up Puget Sound waters, acting as a sink to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, as well as supporting salmon, shellfish and other species that rely on healthy estuary habitat.-          Project engineering, design and planning project between $200,000 and $350,000.-          Habitat restoration projects between $2 million and $4 million.-          Land conservation projects between $500,000 and $1.5 million over the award period. -          Applicants may propose projects with a federal funding request less than or more than these amounts, up to $4 million.NOAA Marine Debris RemovalUp to $75 million is available to funds to remove existing marine debris, and prevent future debris. Marine debris is dangerous pollution that can impact fish, marine mammals, sea birds and the habitat that those animals depend on. Debris can also damage boats and fishing gear.In Washington?state, previous grants have been awarded to address derelict fishing gear, tsunami debris, and other habitat restoration efforts.? The University of Washington Sea Grant program will?be eligible to compete for $18 million of the funds.The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for these programs is HERE. ### "
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-schrier-hold-pharmacy-roundtable-on-lowering-prescription-drug-costs,"SEATTLE, WA – Today, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier (D-WA-8) were joined by local pharmacists, industry stakeholders, and others affected by skyrocketing costs of medications in Seattle for a roundtable discussion and press conference to advocate for legislation that would lower prescription drug costs. Sen. Cantwell also highlighted her bipartisan bill that would hold pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) accountable for their unfair and deceptive practices.“Everybody knows that drug pricing is way too high. What people don’t understand is that someone who now controls about 80 percent of the market  – three companies --  are impacting that by using unfair and deceptive practices,” Sen. Cantwell said. “The pharmacists that are here today who advocated on behalf of our delivery system have made it clear: They can’t continue to exist or do business if these kinds of profit centers end up controlling the marketplace.“Pharmacy benefit managers -- who basically negotiate big discounts but keep all the discounts, or most of the discounts – are not helping us lower drug pricing,” Sen. Cantwell continued. “It's too much concentration of power, not enough transparency, and not enough policemen on the beat calling out unfair and deceptive practices.” Said Rep. Schrier: “This something that’s been on my mind for a long time as many of you know, because I have Type I diabetes and I’ve seen the cost of insulin skyrocket from about $40 a bottle to now up north of $300 a bottle for no reason -- and with a medicine that costs about $10 to produce. This is a manipulated market … Nobody should have to choose between paying for their medication and putting food on the table.”Sen. Cantwell introduced the bipartisan Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2022 in May. The bill would ban unfair pricing schemes, prohibit arbitrary “clawbacks” of payments made to pharmacies, and require PBMs to report to the FTC how much money they make through spread pricing and pharmacy fees. The bill advanced out of committee last week, and the next step is the full Senate for consideration. Senator Cantwell introduced similar legislation in 2021 to empower the FTC to conduct a study into whether PBMs provide actual value to the drug distribution chain, and whether PBMs are engaging in anticompetitive behavior leading to increased costs for consumers.PBMs were initially formed in the 1960’s to process claims and negotiate lower drug prices with manufacturers. Now, PBMs administer prescription drug plans for hundreds of millions of Americans, and three PBMs control nearly 80% of the prescription drug market. They serve as middlemen, managing every aspect of the prescription drug benefits process for health insurance companies, self-insured employers, unions and government programs.PBMs operate out of the view of regulators and consumers — setting prescription costs, deciding what drugs are covered by insurance plans and how they’re dispensed — and pocket unknown sums that might otherwise be passed along as savings to consumers, undercutting local independent pharmacies. This lack of transparency makes it impossible to fully understand if and how PBMs might be manipulating the prescription drug market to increase profits and drive up drug costs for consumers.Text of the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2022 is available HERE. Section-by-section HERE.   “Pharmacy benefit managers are the Goliaths of health care. They own the pharmacies, the specialty pharmacies, mail order pharmacies. They own health clinics as well as the health carriers. They have lost track of what they were designed to do. And instead of designing formularies to optimize patient outcomes, they have gotten to the point where they are just optimizing shareholder profits, and they need regulations introduced to really get back to basics and to optimize patient outcomes,” said Jenny Arnold, CEO of the Washington State Pharmacy Association.“This particular practice from pharmacy benefit managers-- when it comes to dictating the price of medication, dictating how medication will get to patients, which kind of medication will be accessible to patients – the group or community that’s most impacted continues to be the marginalized community,” said pharmacist and State Rep. My-Linh Thai (D-Bellevue). “Standing here as a state representative who cares deeply about our health care system, I want to make sure that we continue this line of work in collaboration between state and federal, with really the focus on patient safety and ensuring that our health care delivery system continues to be patient-centered.”“PBM business practices represent a real threat to patient access to care,” said Ryan Oftebro, President of the Washington State Pharmacy Association. “What we see happening on a daily basis is that PBMs, through their business practices, are creating barriers to care and access by making medications more expensive than they should be. We see seniors who are paying more out of pocket for generic medications than they need to, with that money going direcly back to the PBMs, and it’s impacting pharmacies’ ability to remain viable and serving our communities.”Video from today’s event is available HERE, audio HERE, and a full transcript HERE.###"

The funding was made available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which made historic investments in the nation’s air travel system. Pullman/Moscow Regional Airport is receiving $1,045,754 to help pay for a new terminal building. This grant funds the eighth phase, which consists of baggage sorting and delivery areas.Ephrata Municipal Airport is receiving $159,000 to reconstruct 275 feet of the existing Taxiway A2 pavement that has reached the end of its useful life.Ocean Shores Municipal Airport is receiving $110,000 to remove tree and shrub obstructions from the Runway 33 approach path.When statewide grant recipients were announced in December, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, made the following statement.“Washington airports are continuing to grow, and getting much-needed infrastructure dollars to help secure future capacity is important.”Last year, Senator Cantwell worked to include $25 billion nationwide for airport infrastructure improvements in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The AIG program specifically aims to modernize the nation’s infrastructure through capital investment in airports. AIG funds can be invested in runways, taxiways, safety and sustainability projects, as well as terminal, airport-transit connections and roadway projects.###."

Millions of Americans are losing their rights to control their own bodies and their own healthcare.“Despite decades of Republican Supreme Court nominees coming before the Judiciary Committee and saying that they believe Roe v. Wade is settled law, they have taken a sledgehammer to the right to privacy.“Some of our state’s biggest employers could be asked to give personal reproductive data to states that criminalize abortion. That’s why, as one step, I co-sponsored the My Body, My Data Act, which would give Americans strong, enforceable rights to protect their most sensitive health information.“We know that 70% of Americans did not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. They want these rights upheld. Mainstream Americans have counted on this right, depended on this right, exercised this right, and now several justices on the Supreme Court are going back on their word and upending settled law to take this right away.“Americans could now be criminalized for exercising their personal right of if and when to start a family, and be at risk of suffering life-altering pregnancy complications or death — and their doctors and nurses could be thrown in jail. “I am hopeful that Americans will respond, as we always have when our rights are taken away. The 70% of Americans who agree must have their voices heard on the constitutional right to privacy. I’m calling on all Americans who believe in this right to exercise their voice and their vote. Every legislative tool and initiative process should be considered.“As we face attempts to shut down vital health services, now more than ever we need to give our support to the patients who depend on them and the medical professionals who provide them.”###"

It also would require equal payment for medical care, travel and expenses. The bill applies to 50 different sports’ national governing bodies, and it requires the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) to conduct oversight and report on compliance with the legislation.In July 2019, Sen. Cantwell held press conference with U.S. Women’s National Team Captain, Megan Rapinoe, and introduced similar legislation to ensure equal pay for American athletes who represent team USA in global athletic competitions.In February 2022, the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team settled their longstanding gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation, receiving $24 million in back pay and compensation. In May 2022, the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team reached a landmark agreement ensuring that U.S. Women’s and U.S. Men’s soccer players will receive equal compensation when competing in international matches and competitions. As of now, this agreement would expire in 2028. Sens. Cantwell (D-WA) and Capito (R-WV) introduced the bipartisan legislation in July 2021. Sens. Klobuchar (D-MN), and Lummis (R-WY) are also co-sponsors. Sen. Cantwell has been a consistent advocate for gender equity in athletics. Sen. Cantwell cosponsored the Gender Equity in Education Act in the 117th, 116th, and 115th Congresses. As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell led multiple hearings on NCAA athletes’ rights and protections.In 2020, Cantwell introduced a bipartisan resolution honoring women athletes and in 2017, Cantwell repeatedly fought back against Trump administration attempts to eliminate Title IX protections.A list of organizations supporting the Equal Pay for Team USA Act is available HERE.Read the full bill text HERE. "

Cantwell championed the legislation which includes major investments for Washington state’s $21.4 billion maritime economy. At today’s Senate Commerce Committee Executive Session, Sen. Cantwell said the following:“This bill would invest $1.6 billion to make critical improvements in our maritime workforce, small shipyards, and port infrastructure that are key to keeping our supply chains moving. It will create a new Maritime Innovation Center to explore cleaner fuels and maritime technology innovation to propel America's maritime industry into the future.“The bill would also strengthen protections against sexual assault and sexual harassment at sea and I'm glad we were able to work in a bipartisan fashion to send a strong signal that we must invest in and protect our maritime workforce, especially midshipmen at the start of their careers at sea.”The Maritime Administration operates under the Department of Transportation and is tasked with promoting the U.S. maritime industry, improving port infrastructure to help speed the shipment of freight and goods, and investing in America’s maritime workforce and shipyards.What’s included for Washington state:The MARAD Reauthorization Act of 2023 would also strengthen protections against sexual assault and sexual harassment at sea and require for mariners’ licenses to be revoked if found guilty. In October 2021, Sen. Cantwell sent a letter to Acting Administrator of the Maritime Administration demanding answers following allegations of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA).Sen. Cantwell also championed a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 to reform the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to address sexual assault in the military.Sen. Cantwell has consistently championed Washington’s ports and secured $750 million in the MARAD 2023 for the Port Infrastructure Development Program. In 2019, Sen. Cantwell co-authored the legislation that reauthorized the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP).Most recently, the program was reauthorized in the 2021 National Defense Reauthorization Act, a provision authored by Cantwell. As Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen. Cantwell worked to include a record $2.25 billion for the program in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and in September 2021, Sen. Cantwell led a letter calling for increased funding for the PIDP program to help address the ongoing issues with port congestion.Video from today’s Commerce Executive Session is available HERE, audio HERE, and a full transcript HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-advances-bipartisan-bill-to-combat-rising-prescription-drug-prices-and-root-out-unfair-practices-by-pharmacy-benefit-managers-,"Today, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation advanced Senator Maria Cantwell’s (D-WA) Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act, which would increase drug pricing transparency and hold Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) accountable for unfair and deceptive practices that drive up prescription drug costs at the expense of consumers. The Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General would be empowered to enforce the Act. The legislation was approved 19-9 and will head to the full Senate for approval. Senator Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said the following before today’s vote:   “Senator Grassley and I introduced Pharmacy Benefit Manager transparency legislation to shine a brighter light on drug pricing marketplace and to prevent unfair and deceptive practices by PBMs that drive up the cost of medications at the expense of consumers. Since 2014, prescription drug prices have gone up 35% while the cost of the goods and services jump just 19%.“Take insulin for example, a drug that has been available for patients for over 100 years. Insulin price hikes have become a matter of life or death for many Americans with diabetes. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, a middleman in the drug pricing supply chain, today three PBMs control 80% of the prescription drug market operating out of the view of regulators and consumers. PBMs set prescription drug prices to determine whether drugs are covered by an insurance plan and pocket unknown sums of money that might otherwise be passed along to savings to consumers.“During our subcommittee hearing, we learned how PBMs engaged in spread pricing, which they reimburse pharmacists less than what they would charge insurance plans and keep the difference as profit. In some cases, the pharmacy is reimbursed below the drug purchase price forcing these small businesses to close.“Our legislation will make it clear that the FTC should use its authority to stop spread pricing, unfair claw backs and other deceptive practices. We've received letters from organizations representing millions of seniors, pharmacists and oncologists, biotech companies and consumers who've long called for increased transparency in today's PBM market.”The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2022: Text of the legislation is available HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-backs-my-body-my-data-bill-to-protect-womens-health-privacy-in-senate,"In response to the leaked draft decision revealing the Supreme Court’s plans to overturn Roe v. Wade, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), a leader in the fight for strong federal privacy legislation, joined Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate to introduce the My Body, My Data Act, which would protect personal reproductive health data.   ""Women, and all individuals, need strong, enforceable rights to protect their most sensitive health data, especially regarding their personal and private reproductive or sexual health information,” said Sen. Cantwell, Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation which oversees federal data privacy policy. “This legislation does that, and I am glad to support it.”The bill would create a new national standard to protect personal reproductive health data, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. By minimizing the personal reproductive health data that is collected and retained, the bill would prevent this information from being disclosed or misused.If Roe is overturned, abortion providers in Washington will likely start treating more patients traveling from other states. According to reporting on projections from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy research organization, Washington could see a 385% increase in patients from out of state seeking care.The leaked draft Supreme Court decision has raised serious concerns that data collected by apps and websites could be used to target or arrest people if abortion is criminalized. This includes location data, search histories, and reproductive health data collected by menstruation, ovulation, and pregnancy tracking apps each month. Recent reporting has also revealed the prevalence with which consumers’ personal reproductive health information – often our most personal information – is disclosed and monetized.Currently, few protections exist to prevent personal reproductive health data or information about people seeking reproductive health services from being collected, retained, or disclosed to third parties. With at least 26 states likely or certain to ban abortions if Roe is overturned, this bill is the first Congressional action to strengthen digital privacy and protect our personal reproductive health information specifically.The Senate legislation is led by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and has a total of 10 cosponsors, including Senators Cantwell, Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-N.Y.).  A companion bill was introduced in the House by Congresswoman Sara Jacobs (CA-53) along with 43 cosponsors. The bill is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), NARAL Pro-Choice America, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), National Partnership for Women & Families, the National Abortion Federation (NAF), Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE), and Feminist Majority.A summary of the My Body, My Data Act can be read HERE.

As Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell co-sponsored the bill and acted fast to shepherd its passage through the Commerce Committee to combat rising shipping costs faced by Washington farmers, agricultural exporters, and consumers.Sen. Cantwell joined President Biden for the bill signing ceremony. She released the following statement:“Today marks a significant step forward in our effort to lower costs facing consumers,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Our bill will ensure that our farmers can get their products to the global marketplace, and will provide the Federal Maritime Commission the tools it needs to crack down on exorbitant fees that hike up shipping costs. With President Biden’s signature, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act will level the playing field between big international shipping lines and American businesses and consumers.”Last year, Washington state exported nearly $22 billion in agricultural products, and more than $14 billion of those products relied on maritime shipping to get to market. Over one third of those Washington state exports, valued at $7.7 billion, were grown or processed in the state.On March 18th, Sen. Cantwell spoke with Washington state growers at the Port of Seattle to discuss the impacts of the Ocean Shipping Reform act and announced a new pop-up storage facility to help reduce delays, operational hurdles, and costs for Washington growers to help boost exports.The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is charged with protecting the interests of U.S. businesses that rely on ocean transportation under the Shipping Act, which was last amended in 1998. The bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 will level the playing field for American exporters and importers by providing the FMC the tools it needs for effective oversight of international ocean carriers. These oversight and enforcement tools will help the FMC eliminate unfair charges, prevent unreasonable denial of American exports, and crack down on other unfair practices harming American businesses and consumers.The Ocean Shipping Reform Act will:Port congestion that began during the COVID-19 pandemic left exporters, including American farmers, struggling to get their products to global markets because of unpredictable sailings, ocean carriers denying American cargo, and skyrocketing freight costs. For example, shipping rates for a 40-foot container went from $1,300 before the pandemic, up to $11,000 by September 2021. Shipping costs continue to increase. This week, shipping costs remain 41% higher globally compared to this time last year.A one-page explainer of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and a list of bill supporters is available HERE.

Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor immediately after the Senate passed the OSRA in March: “Right now, the supply chain isn't working. Our ports have been clogged, shipping companies have struggled to keep up with demand, and the cost of American exporters, who are trying to get hay, milk, and apples to the global market, have gone through the roof,” said Sen. Cantwell. “It is hurting our consumers here at home as I see prices increase, and hurting our exporters when they're looking at products they are trying to get to market.”Sen. Cantwell continued, “American exporters and their products are being left on the docks, and that's why we wanted to act quickly, because the American farmer, with growing season upon us, can't afford to wait another minute for the Federal Maritime Commission to do it’s job and help police this market…getting this legislation on to the president's desk could not be more important.”At the March 3, 2022 hearing to examine the legislation, Sen. Cantwell said, “We are going to fight for these shippers who need to get their product to international markets, and as a very trade dependent state, I will make this the biggest priority of this Committee, if it's what it takes.”On March 22, Sen. Cantwell led an executive session of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to advance the Act.Sen. Cantwell has consistently championed Washington’s ports and coauthored the 2019 legislation that reauthorized U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP).Most recently, the program was reauthorized in the 2021 National Defense Reauthorization Act, a provision authored by Cantwell.

The large bridge projects are eligible for multiyear grants. An additional $20 million in funding is available for planning projects, and $40 million set aside for Tribal transportation facility bridges.In April, Senator Cantwell visited the 105-year-old Interstate Bridge over the Columbia River, and cited the Bridge Investment Program as a possible source of funding for its replacement. The bridge – which serves as a vital interstate connector for people and commerce handling more than 130,000 crossings each day – is seismically unsound and would likely be substantially damaged beyond repair in a major earthquake.Among the bridges that would be eligible for the grants:I-5 Bridge Replacement, Clark County: This 105-year-old bridge is a key freight and commuter link over the Columbia River, handling more than 130,000 crossings each day.US 2 Trestle, Snohomish County: A critical, aging link for freight and commuters that handles 3,600 vehicles per hour at peak times.I-90 over Latah Creek, Spokane County: Connects Spokane to Spokane International Airport, handles 43,937 crossings per day. Considered structurally deficient, with a “poor” ranking from the Federal Highway Administration because expansion joints on the bridge deck are under strain.SR 285 over Wenatchee River, Chelan County: Connects the city of Wenatchee to US 2, handles 19,988 crossings per day. Considered structurally deficient.North Fork Bridge, Clark County: Important link on I-5 corridor, required emergency repairs earlier this month to repair a hole that had formed in the center lane. Considered structurally deficient.Fishing Wars Memorial Bridge, Pierce County: Linking the cities of Fife and Tacoma, the Washington State Bridge Inventory System ranks the bridge at a 6 out of 100. Phase 2 of this project improves access, safety, and accommodation for multimodal travel.According to the National Bridge Inventory, Washington state has identified 6,894 bridges in need of repair.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-colleagues-urge-immediate-federal-action-to-prepare-for-post-roe-america_,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined 24 Senate colleagues in signing a letter delivered to President Joe Biden today urging immediate federal action to protect Americans’ reproductive rights and prepare for the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court.In the letter, the Senators wrote: “These proposals are only starting points in a federal apparatus that affects millions of Americans every day. The entirety of the federal government must be engaged in the Administration’s efforts and must act as swiftly as possible.”The letter specifically asks the President to consider six initiatives that would increase access to abortion and protect reproductive rights. They are:1. Direct federal agencies to increase the accessibility of medication abortion (e.g. Mifepristone) and ensure availability of accurate information on medication abortion.2. Direct federal agencies to explore options to provide travel vouchers, child care services, and other forms of support for people who are seeking abortion services that are unavailable in their home state.3. Establish a reproductive health ombudsman at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to educate the public on and analyze data collected by HHS about access to reproductive health services.4. Direct HHS to enforce federal requirements that guarantee Medicaid beneficiaries have access to family planning services from their provider of choice.5. Direct HHS’s Office of Civil Rights to clarify how websites or mobile applications that collect information related to reproductive health (e.g. period trackers) should protect personally identifiable information and other sensitive data.6. Encourage federal departments and agencies to explore using federal property and resources to increase access to abortion services.In May, Sen. Cantwell warned against the “brain drain” for federal agencies located in states poised to restrict access to abortion. Banning essential reproductive health care services would be “ludicrous” for employers and workers, she said in remarks delivered at the press conference, linked HERE.The day after the SCOTUS draft ruling was leaked, Sen. Cantwell joined Democratic colleagues on the steps of the Senate and pledged to fight for the constitutional right to privacy in a statement linked HERE.In December 2021, Sen. Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor in response to the U.S. Supreme Court starting oral arguments on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which could roll back decades of precedent upholding the right to reproductive health care.In September, she joined 47 Democrats in the Senate and 188 in the House in filing a bicameral amicus brief in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, urging the Supreme Court to uphold the nearly 50 years of precedent in Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to abortion care.Sen. Cantwell is a cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) that was introduced in June. The WHPA guarantees a pregnant person’s right to access an abortion — and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services — free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below. Dear Mr. President:We write to urge you to immediately issue an executive order directing the federal government to develop a national plan to defend Americans’ fundamental reproductive rights, including their right to an abortion.Abortion access is under attack in the United States and already completely eliminated in swaths of the country. After decades of activism by Republican extremists, the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, reversing nearly 50 years of settled law and eviscerating the right to a legal abortion.[1] Anti-abortion violence is on the rise, with assaults and threats of harm against abortion providers more than doubling between 2016 and 2020.2 Anti-abortion politicians have introduced nearly 550 abortion restrictions in 42 states and passed radical laws completely banning abortion and placing bounties on providers offering medical services.[2] And if Roe v. Wade is gutted by this right-wing Supreme Court, Republican leaders have already signaled their next move: a nationwide ban on abortion in all 50 states.[3][4]Americans across the nation and at every level of government must stand up against this unprecedented assault on women and their right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives. But as President of the United States, you have the unique power to marshal the resources of the entire federal government to respond.You have already mobilized the full weight of the federal government on behalf of several key Administration priorities. On your first day in office, you issued an executive order directing “the whole of the federal government to advance an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda,” prompting more than 90 federal agencies to develop over 300 concrete strategies and commitments to address systemic racism.5 On the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, you issued an executive order instructing “the head of each federal agency to submit . . . a strategic plan outlining ways their agency can promote voter registration and participation within 200 days.”[5][6]  And on July 9, 2021, you issued an executive order establishing “a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy,” ordering more than a dozen federal agencies to implement 72 initiatives to tackle our nation’s most urgent competition problems.[7]Now is the time for equally bold action to protect the right to an abortion. The Biden-HarrisAdministration has led on issues of reproductive rights with the establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council, the release of the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, and the launch of a whole-of-government response to Texas’s draconian law depriving residents of their constitutional right to an abortion.[8] Nevertheless, the dramatic escalation of attacks on abortion access— spearheaded by right-wing justices, lawmakers, and activists—demands comprehensive and creative strategies from every corner of the federal government. We encourage you to consider the following ideas:These proposals are only starting points in a federal apparatus that affects millions of Americans every day. The entirety of the federal government must be engaged in the Administration’s efforts and must act as swiftly as possible.As extremist judges and Republican politicians intensify their efforts to strip Americans of their basic reproductive freedoms, you can demonstrate to the country and women everywhere that you will do everything in your power to fight back. With each day that passes, this crisis will only worsen: if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, 26 states could instantly move to ban abortion, leading 36 million women to suddenly lose access to abortion and causing maternal mortality—which already disproportionately affects women of color—to drastically increase.[10] We urge you to immediately issue an executive order instructing the leaders of every federal agency to submit their plans to protect the right to an abortion within 30 days. Americans across the country are at risk of losing their fundamental rights, including their constitutional right to abortion protected for generations. They deserve no less than a whole-of-government response.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###[1] Politico, “Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights, draft opinion shows,” Josh Gerstein and Alexander Ward, May 2, 2022, https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473. 2 NBC News, “Abortion clinics are bracing for protests, harassment and violence if Roe falls,” Jon Schuppe, May 4, 2022, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/abortion-clinics-protests-security-rcna27270.[2] Guttmacher Institute, “2022 State Legislative Sessions: Abortion Bans and Restrictions on Medication AbortionDominate,” Elizabeth Nash, Lauren Cross, and Joerg Dreweke, May 6, 2022, https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/03/2022-state-legislative-sessions-abortion-bans-and-restrictionsmedication-abortion.[3] Washington Post, “The next frontier for the antiabortion movement: A nationwide ban,” Caroline Kitchener, May[4] , 2022, https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/02/abortion-ban-roe-supreme-court-mississippi; NPR,“White House: Serious risk of nationwide abortion ban after McConnell floats the idea,” Deepa Shivaram, May 9, 2022, https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097614463/white-house-responds-to-protests-over-leaked-supreme-courtdraft-opinion-on-roe.[5] White House, “FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Releases Agency Equity Action Plans to Advance Equity and Racial Justice Across the Federal Government,” April 14, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefingroom/statements-releases/2022/04/14/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-agency-equity-action-plans-toadvance-equity-and-racial-justice-across-the-federal-government.[6] White House, “Fact Sheet: President Biden to Sign Executive Order to Promote Voting Access,” March 7, 2021, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-signexecutive-order-to-promote-voting-access.[7] White House, “FACT SHEET: Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” July 9, 2021, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-onpromoting-competition-in-the-american-economy.[8] White House, “FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Celebrates First Anniversary of the Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council,” March 8, 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statementsreleases/2022/03/08/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-celebrates-first-anniversary-of-the-establishment-of-thewhite-house-gender-policy-council.[9] See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a; 42 C.F.R. § 431.51.[10] Bloomberg, “Supreme Court Could Jeopardize Abortion Access for 36 Million People,” Kelsey Butler, Mathieu Benhamou, Rachael Dottle, Jeremy C.F.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/whats-causing-inflation-treasury-sec-yellen-points-to-semiconductor-shortage-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, at a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing on the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, Sen. Cantwell (D-WA) asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about the importance of passing the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) to combat the semiconductor chip shortage hurting American consumers. During the hearing, Sen. Cantwell raised that American consumers are seeing massive increases in the price of used cars due to the national shortage of semiconductor chips. “We have our trucking industry saying that they can't even ship built trucks, because they don't have the chips to put into the trucks. So every aspect of our economy is now more expensive, just because shipping costs are going up,” said Sen. Cantwell. Sen. Cantwell then asked Secretary Yellen how passing USICA could help combat the automobile shortage. “It is very important, I think, to pass USICA and to make the investments in semiconductors that will keep the United States in the lead in this critically important industry, and to make sure we have the capacity to produce advanced chips at home,” said Secretary Yellen. “I think this is a national security issue, as well as an economic issue and I think USICA is a very important bill that I would very much like to see passed.”Secretary Yellen continued, “We found ourselves in an almost unimaginable situation where the pandemic resulted in such an explosion of demand for chips globally as people switched increasingly to digital work and communications that our auto factories found themselves unable to get chips. And so here you have something that's caused a significant piece of the inflation we face that really results from structural shifts induced by the pandemic and insufficient capacity at home to build semiconductors.”Sen. Cantwell added, “Just to be clear, you’re saying the chip shortage has added to our inflation woes?”Secretary Yellen replied, “Absolutely. Look, I believe for about a third of U.S. inflation is new and used cars and manufacturers have been forced to actually cut production of cars when they face absolutely record demand for those vehicles, and it is all due to a shortage of semiconductors.”As Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell championed the Senate passage of USCIA in 2021, and again in 2022. The final bill is now being negotiated by a bipartisan conference of House and Senate members. Sen. Cantwell has consistently fought for increasing domestic semiconductor manufacturing. In March, Sen. Cantwell led a Commerce Committee hearing on how the semiconductor shortage hurts American consumers, pointing to the soaring cost of used cars as buyers are forced to wait months for new cars. According to Cars.com, used car prices rose by 45% between January 2021 and January 2022.Sen. Cantwell previously spoke on the Senate floor to call attention to the alarming rise in used-car prices hurting American consumers: “The price increase for our consumers is 41% increase in the cost for a used car today…We're talking about real impacts that are happening in real people's lives today.”The attached chart provided by the Washington Auto Dealers Association shows the average prices for used vehicles across Washington state from 2019-2022:Video of Senator Cantwell’s remarks with Secretary Yellen are available HERE, audio HERE, and a transcript HERE.

Spokane International Airport was awarded $5,335,200 to fund two projects. The grant funds the first phase of construction of a new 1,120-foot taxilane at Spokane International Airport. The new taxilane will allow for more takeoffs and landings at the airport. The grant also funds the first phase of construction of a 30,000 square yard expansion of the existing west terminal apron. The apron is the area used for parking, loading, unloading, and refueling airplanes. A larger apron means that the terminal can accommodate more activity.Walla Walla Regional Airport was awarded $375,000 to fund two projects. The grant will be used for lighting and safety enhancements to the airport’s Runway 2/20, as well as upgrading signage to meet FAA standards.As Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Cantwell has long supported airports throughout the State of Washington. Earlier this month, she celebrated the allocation of $38.68 million in FAA Airport Improvement Program grants for airports in Washington, including $21 million to construct the terminal building and a 48,000 square yard terminal apron at Pullman-Moscow Airport, as well as $2.67 million to construct a 6,000 square-foot snow removal equipment building at Bellingham International Airport.In June 2021, Senator Cantwell announced more than $217 million in grants from the Airport Rescue Grants program awarded to Washington airports to help keep people safe and employed by reimbursing operational expenses, debt service payments, and costs related to combating the spread of COVID-19.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/western-wa-airports-get-49-million-from-faa-to-improve-airport-infrastructure-,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded three grants to fund critical infrastructure projects at Western Washington airports.Bellingham International Airport was awarded $2,912,192 in funding from the Airport Infrastructure Grant (AIG) program to help fund the construction phase of a project reconfiguring Taxiway F, moving it to a new location to better meet FAA design standards. The AIG program aims to modernize the nation’s infrastructure through capital investment in airports. AIG funds can be invested in runways, taxiways, safety and sustainability projects, as well as terminal, airport-transit connections and roadway projects.Bellingham’s grant was awarded as part of the first round of funding dispensed through 2021’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) package. The BIL marked a historic investment in the nation’s air travel system, allocating a total of $25 billion for aviation infrastructure improvements including approximately $15 billion for airport infrastructure projects through grant programs overseen by the FAA’s Office of Airports.Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was awarded $1,926,518 to fund reconstruction of apron pavement at SEA’s cargo facilities. The grant funds replacement of 4,200 square yards of apron pavement at the Cargo 2 facility. The apron is the area used for parking, loading, unloading, and refueling airplanes. The pavement has reached the end of its useful life.Jefferson County International Airport was awarded $150,000 to fund a new connector Taxiway A3, which will eliminate the need for aircraft to back-taxi on the runway. The grant funds phase one of the project, which consists of design.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-we-owe-it-to-those-firefighters-to-make-sure-they-have-the-very-best-data,"SPOKANE, WA – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) visited the National Weather Service’s Spokane Forecasting Office to review the region’s new summer wildfire outlook, tour the Eastern Washington facility and discuss her new bill to improve the tools available to wildfire forecasters and emergency responders.Sen. Cantwell also viewed new fire and smoke forecasting equipment provided to the region by 2021’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), including a ceilometer that will be installed at Spokane International Airport to provide advanced accurate smoke predictions. The BIL included historic investments in wildfire prevention, forecasting and suppression tools.Sen. Cantwell delivered comments in a press conference alongside a panel of stakeholders, including a meteorologist, fire expert, emergency manager and clean air advocate. The latest National Interagency Fire Center wildfire forecast, which was publicly released today, predicts an elevated wildfire risk in Central and Eastern Washington in July and August.“We know we will face a significant fire threat. Each year wildfires result in irreplaceable loss of life and homes and property. They destroy our crops and timber -- and obviously smoke damage,” Sen. Cantwell said. “Here at the Spokane National Weather Service, dedicated forecasters are constantly evaluating those weather conditions and the threat of fire. During last year's fire season, this office produced a record number of 1,193 spot forecasts needed to fight those fires. You cannot fight these fires without NOAA’s critical service. And when the wildfires occur, these brave men and women are deployed right along the first responders to ensure that the firefighters on the line have the best data and information they need to get the job done and to stay safe. We owe it to those firefighters to make sure that they have the very best data.”“For many, many years, the National Weather Service has been an essential partner to emergency management in all phases of disaster preparedness,” said Spokane County Emergency Management Deputy Director Chandra Fox. “One of the specific issues in this bill that I am very excited about is the additional support being provided to our Incident Meteorologist program. Having the ability to have the meteorologists in the field with our fire personnel actually watching what is happening in that fire environment is key… A shift in wind direction or a drop in humidity can drastically change fire behavior, and mean the difference between containment and the fire making a run into a populated area.”“Some suppression tactics (we can) utilize -- such as direct line construction, aircraft operations, and backfiring operations -- may not be available during periods of inclement weather due to safety. And so having an accurate and available forecast that's readily available gives us a view into those windows of opportunities so we can take those tactical opportunities to suppress the fire,” said Spokane County Fire District 8 Assistant Chief Chris Wyrobek.“Summer’s almost here,” said Spokane Regional Clean Air Agency Executive Director Scott Windsor. “Some now refer to it as smoke season, unfortunately. Outdoor event planners, summer camp coordinators, childcare center directors, parents, coaches, employers and so many more rely on good quality forecasts during a wildfire smoke season to provide the most timely and accurate air quality forecasts to them, that are vital for the health and the well-being of our residents and visitors.” After the press conference, Sen. Cantwell viewed a demonstration from National Fire Weather Science and Dissemination Meteorologist Robyn Heffernan, who used the station’s existing wildfire system modeling technology to illustrate potential wildfire and smoke scenarios. Sen. Cantwell also toured the full facility, including the Doppler radar dish serving the region, and released a weather balloon with Incident Meteorologist John Fox.  Two weeks ago, Sen. Cantwell introduced the Fire Ready Nation Act of 2022, a bill to improve wildfire forecasting. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) already performs vital fire season functions; this new bill would formalize and fund those duties, enhancing the agency’s capacity to help prevent and fight wildfires. Sen. Cantwell’s legislation would:·       Establish a fire weather services program within NOAA;·       Fund the research and acquisition of technology to better forecast wildfire conditions;·       Deploy new tools to fight fires like unmanned drones that can gather chemical information and survey damage;·       Codify the Incident Meteorologist Service (IMET), a group of forecasters that are deployed to fire lines and other disasters to provide real-time lifesaving forecasts to emergency responders;·       Ensure that IMETs’ long deployments spent helping the specially-trained NOAA forecasters who embed with fire teams for weeks at a time receive fairer compensation.Last year’s BIL included $8.25 billion for more than 20 federal programs to reduce fuel with prescribed burns and rebuild areas destroyed by wildfires. The package also included $5 billion to upgrade the nation’s grid infrastructure, reducing the risk of outdated equipment sparking destructive fires. $180 million of these funds went to NOAA, including $13.5 million in funding for 900 ceilometers that detect smoke in the atmosphere and $10 million for upgraded IMET laptops and weather instruments, like weather balloons used in fighting fires.In 2021, 674,249 acres burned in wildfires, which is 40 percent above the 10-year average (407,449 acres). Drought and wildfires combined to cause an estimated to a $665 million loss to agricultural businesses in WA. Video of Sen.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/western-wa-gets-138-million-for-rail-infrastructure-to-prevent-landslides-and-improve-passenger-rail-service-,"SPOKANE, WA.— Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) announced a total of $14.8 million in federal grants has been awarded to two important rail infrastructure projects in Western Washington. The funding comes as part of a dramatic increase in rail infrastructure spending included in the President’s infrastructure package and spearheaded by Cantwell. Sound Transit’s Pierce County Rail Capacity and Reliability Improvement Project received $10 million from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program. The project encompasses a series of track and signal improvements between DuPont and Tacoma to increase passenger and freight rail capacity, which will allow double-tracking along the corridor. Once completed, the project will allow for between 4 and 16 additional daily trains along the Amtrak Cascades line, reduce the average 30 minute delays on Sounder Commuter Rail, and increase service reliability. The funding will support preliminary engineering and environmental review.""As I-5 congestion continues to increase, Puget Sound commuters and travelers need reliable rail service between south Pierce County to Tacoma, Seattle and beyond,” said Senator Cantwell. “This $10 million grant will help eliminate three rail bottlenecks between Tacoma and DuPont, allowing Amtrak to run trains more efficiently between Seattle and Portland and reducing delays for the Sounder commuter rail.” The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) will also receive a $3.8 million to fund the fourth phase of WSDOT’s rail landslide mitigation program. These landslide reduction projects include installation of catchment walls to stop debris from reaching tracks, slope stabilization, drainage improvements and slide warning fences. “Winter storms cause frequent landslides on the rail tracks between Everett and Seattle, at times causing Sounder rail service to be suspended for several hours while the tracks are cleared. So WSDOT has embarked on this larger project to shore up the hillsides along the route to prevent the landslides from reaching the tracks. This grant, for the fourth phase of the project, will build three catchment walls along the route that will keep the earth in place during wet weather events,” said Senator Cantwell.The grant comes from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program (CRISI). CRISI helps fund capital projects that improve intercity passenger and freight rail transportation safety, efficiency, and reliability. Nationwide, the FRA allocated $368,577,000 for 46 projects. At Senator Cantwell’s urging, funding for CRISI was quadrupled for FY22 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, from $362 million in 2021 to $1.5 billion in 2022.  As chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell is a strong proponent of improving rail infrastructure in Washington state and nationwide. In December, she wrote to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in support of the Pacific Northwest Corridor Reliability - Landslide Mitigation project.Phase I of the WSDOT landslide mitigation project was completed in 2016 and invested more than $17 million in federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to reduce the risk of landslides at six landslide prone sites between Seattle and Everett. Phase II of the program invested more than $10.9 million of federal, state and private sector funding for landslide mitigation measures at six additional sites. In 2020, Sen. Cantwell announced the award of $3.72 million in FRA funding for Phase III, which will serve a busy section of the rail corridor south of Mukilteo that has a history of slides leading to rail line closures.Since completion of these improvement projects, no landslides have reached the tracks in those upgraded areas to disrupt train service.### "

Admiral Fagan is the first woman, and first mother, to lead any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.Admiral Fagan began her 36-year career as a deck watch officer on the Seattle-based heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star. In 2000, she earned a Master of Science in Marine Affairs from the University of Washington. Admiral Fagan is believed to be the first University of Washington graduate to lead a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.Senator Cantwell led Admiral Fagan’s nomination hearing in April. In her opening statement, Sen. Cantwell told Admiral Fagan: “This is a historic moment for our country and for women in the Armed Services. It will be the first time that a woman will lead one of the six branches of the Armed Services. I am hoping that your leadership will also will lead to more progress on getting women recruited and retained in the Coast Guard. That with your help and focus on important issues, like childcare, healthcare, and education that ‘Coasties,’ like your daughter, can have a long career in the Coast Guard.”In May, Senator Cantwell authored an editorial in the Seattle Times lauding Admiral Fagan’s career milestone titled: “Breaking the U.S. Military’s Glass Ceiling.”Senator Cantwell also praised Admiral Fagan at the time of her nomination: “From her career beginnings as a deck watch officer on the Seattle-based icebreaker Polar Star, Admiral Fagan has shown strong leadership and a commitment to service that make her an outstanding choice as the Coast Guard’s 27th Commandant,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Upon confirmation, she will become the first woman and mother to lead any branch of the Armed Forces. This nomination proves the value of enacting laws that provide family leave, childcare, and health care access to support talented women in the Coast Guard who have dual roles as service members and parents. Admiral Fagan’s nomination will inspire generations of American women to strive to serve at the highest level in the Armed Forces.”Video of Senator Cantwell’s opening statement at Admiral Fagan’s nomination hearing is available HERE, audio HERE.Video of Senator Cantwell’s floor speech prior to Admiral Fagan’s confirmation by the Senate is available HERE, audio HERE, and a full transcript HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-we-have-proof-now_that-there-is-manipulation-in-oil-markets,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, took to the Senate floor today to call for immediate action to pass the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act, which would greatly enhance federal oversight of petroleum markets that drive the prices consumers face at the pump.“I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to pretend that this issue doesn't exist,” Cantwell said. “I ask them, go home and face your constituents and tell them you voted to do nothing, nothing to bring more transparency into the gas markets that are affecting them today, and see what their reaction is.” On Wednesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) announced that the oil trading firm Glencore will pay $1.186 billion resulting from charges that their traders manipulated oil markets from 2008-2017. Glencore has pled guilty to the charges, including an effort by traders to manipulate a fuel-oil benchmark price.In Washington state, the retail price of gas is often determined by a similar benchmark price.“Let's find the answers,” Cantwell said. “Let's do something as basic as passing a law about transparency, on a product, petroleum, that is so critical to our economy.”Senator Cantwell has a long record of exposing energy market manipulation and legislating durable solutions. She was instrumental in giving the CTFC authority to monitor oil markets, authority which was used to root out Glencore’s trading schemes. The Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act would greatly enhance the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ability to monitor and police physical fuel markets. Yesterday, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to advance Cantwell’s bill, and Senate Majority Leader Schumer has publicly committed to a Senate floor vote on the measure.“My colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Feinstein, and I have prosecuted these issues,” Cantwell said. “We have asked for more information transparency. In both instances when we were successful with electricity and natural gas, we did find behavior that needed to be rooted out and here we have proof now in this Glencore case that there is manipulation in oil markets.”A full transcript of Senator Cantwell’s remarks is available HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwells-11-year-fight-to-protect-bristol-bay-reaches-major-milestone,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— A long-sought priority of U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) came closer to reality today when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it will pursue using its Clean Water Act 404(c) authority to permanently block the Pebble Mine as proposed at Bristol Bay, Alaska.In September 2011, Senator Cantwell became the first U.S. Senator to call on the EPA to consider the use of the Clean Water Act to protect Bristol Bay. The Senator has long cited the potential damage to Washington state’s $30 billion maritime industry, the potential loss of fishing jobs, as well as the devastating effect of salmon run declines on commercial, subsistence, charter and recreational fisheries.“Our region’s fishing and outdoor economies depend on healthy wild salmon runs,” said Senator Cantwell. “The science is clear: the Pebble Mine would poison the fragile Bristol Bay watershed, destroying millions of salmon and the thousands of jobs that rely on them. I commend the EPA  for advancing permanent Clean Water Act protections for Bristol Bay, and I urge them to move swiftly to finalize these protections and ensure Bristol Bay salmon are protected forever.”The Pebble Mine threatens to irreparably harm the Bristol Bay watershed, the 40-60 million salmon that return to it every year, and the fishermen and industries that rely on these salmon. A three-year study by the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2014 found that the mine as proposed would, even in the course of normal, safe mine operations, destroy 24 to 94 miles of pristine waterways and salmon habitat and contaminate an additional 48-62 miles of streams with toxic mine waste. The report also noted that the Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world.Under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, the EPA may restrict, prohibit, deny, or withdraw the use of an area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material if the discharge will have unacceptable adverse effects on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.The EPA rarely uses this authority. They have issued only 13 such determinations since the authority was granted in 1972. Senator Cantwell has long fought to protect the Bristol Bay watershed and its important environmental and economic place in the Pacific Northwest.In the aforementioned September 2011 letter, to former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, Cantwell became the first U.S. Senator to call on the EPA to use its Clean Water Act 404(c) authority to block any large development project in Bristol Bay if science determined that the project would “have unacceptable adverse impacts on water quality and the fish stocks that depend on it.”In January of 2014, she called on the Obama Administration to protect Bristol Bay from mining after a report showed the proposed mine would threaten salmon runs and damage the commercial fishing industry.In October of 2017, Cantwell and other members of the Washington state congressional delegation urged President Trump to listen to Washington fishermen and businesses before removing protections from Bristol Bay.In July 2019, Cantwell slammed the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw protections for Bristol Bay.And in September 2020, Cantwell called for a Justice Department investigation when leaked audio taped indicated possible discrepancies between Pebble Mine company executives’ private statements and what they had attested to in legally-binding permitting documents.A fact sheet about the EPA’s 404(c) authority can be found HERE. The EPA’s 2014 Bristol Bay assessment can be found HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-statement-on-the-uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement in response to breaking news that 14 children and 1 teacher were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.“Today 14 children and a teacher tragically lost their lives in yet another preventable mass shooting. Far too many Americans have experienced the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence.“It's long past time for action.“The majority of Americans support common sense measures to combat gun violence such as background checks and red flag laws. I call on my colleagues to finally come together to pass legislation that will save lives.”###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-fight-unfair-drug-pricing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced bipartisan legislation today that would empower the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to increase drug pricing transparency and hold pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) accountable for unfair and deceptive practices that drive up the costs of prescription drugs at the expense of Washingtonians and consumers nationwide.The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2022 would ban unfair pricing schemes, prohibit arbitrary “clawbacks” of payments made to pharmacies, and require PBMs to report to the FTC how much money they make through spread pricing and pharmacy fees. Sen. Cantwell introduced the bill alongside U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA).“The increasing cost of prescription drugs has a devastating effect on the pocketbooks of American consumers,” Sen. Cantwell said.  “PBMs are the middlemen in the prescription drug supply chain and it’s time for Congress to give the FTC the ability to shine a brighter light on any deceptive and abusive practices.” PBMs were initially formed in the 1960’s to process claims and negotiate lower drug prices with manufacturers.  Now, PBMs administer prescription drug plans for hundreds of millions of Americans.Today, three PBMs control nearly 80% of the prescription drug market. They serve as middlemen, managing every aspect of the prescription drug benefits process for health insurance companies, self-insured employers, unions and government programs. They operate out of the view of regulators and consumers—setting prescription costs, deciding what drugs are covered by insurance plans and how they’re dispensed— and pocket unknown sums that might otherwise be passed along as savings to consumers and undercutting local independent pharmacies. This lack of transparency makes it impossible to fully understand if and how PBMs might be manipulating the prescription drug market to increase profits and drive up drug costs for consumers.In Washington state, a study from the Office of the Insurance Commissioner found that six PBMs provide pharmaceutical management services to 98% of the enrollees in the state’s fully insured commercial market.“Small pharmacies are losing money to deceptive, opaque PBM practices. Here in the San Juan Islands, all three of the pharmacies that serve the community are independent. In order to qualify for rebates, these PBM companies force us to purchase the brand-name versions of vital medications like epinephrine pens and inhalers that often cost up to three times more than the generic versions – without explanation or recourse,” said Dr. Holly Whitcomb Henry, a pharmacist at Friday Harbor Drug and the former president of both the Washington State Pharmacy Association and the National Community Pharmacists Association.“This bill is going to shed much-needed daylight on the PBM practices that have for decades caused irreparable harm. It will help Washington’s small business pharmacies, and more importantly, our customers who deserve access to affordable medication.”Some PBMs have been known to engage in “spread pricing,” in which a PBM charges a health insurance plan more to process a prescription than it reimburses the pharmacy and pockets the difference – the spread.  For example, when a pharmacist fills a prescription, a PBM handles the process, informing the pharmacy it will be reimbursed $90. The PBM then charges the health insurance plan $100 for processing the same prescription and keeps the $10 spread.  According to a recent CBO report, eliminating spread pricing in just the Medicaid program would result in approximately $900 million in savings over 10 years.In some cases, PBMs reimburse pharmacies for less than a drug actually costs. This practice drives independent pharmacies out of business and creates pharmacy deserts, increasing costs for health plans that can result in higher premiums.  PBMs can also practice unfair “clawbacks,” or retroactively rescinding reimbursement payments made to pharmacies based on arbitrary guidelines and evaluations.The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2022 will:“PBM-insurers have manipulated our complex health care system so they can set their competitors’ prices, dictate their competitors’ reimbursements, use competitors’ data to steer patients to PBM-affiliated retail, specialty and mail-order pharmacies, and limit where and what consumers can buy,” said National Community Pharmacists Association CEO B. Douglas Hoey, pharmacist, MBA. “There are plenty of PBM actions for policymakers and regulators to address in order to ease the havoc they have wreaked on patients and small business independent pharmacies. NCPA is grateful to Sens. Cantwell and Grassley for their ongoing support of PBM reform. We’re proud to endorse their latest effort, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act, and will work to help it advance.”“Senator Cantwell and Senator Grassley’s critical legislation will help stop PBM abuses and bring much-needed transparency to the shroud of secrecy they operate in,” said Ted Okon, executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance. “The top PBMs use their inordinate market leverage to delay and even deny patients their cancer medications, lowball payments to pharmacists resulting in pharmacy closures, and fuel drug health care costs for all Americans. The Senators’ leadership is so critical and appreciated.”As chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Cantwell has been working to lower drug prices for American consumers. Last year, she partnered with Sen. Grassley to reintroduce legislation requiring the FTC to study the merger activity of PBMs, including possible anticompetitive behavior. Earlier this month, Sen. Cantwell spoke at a subcommittee hearing in the Commerce Committee about the need to increase transparency of PBM drug pricing practices. That video can be viewed HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-statement-on-senate-vote-to-replenish-the-covid-19-restaurant-revitalization-fund-,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement after the Senate failed to pass additional funding for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. The final vote was 52-43.“Thousands of restaurants and bars in the State of Washington -- and across the country -- have been desperately waiting for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to be replenished so that they can get the help they were promised. I’m deeply disappointed that more of my Republican colleagues didn’t vote for this bill,” Senator Cantwell said.The American Rescue Plan established the RRF to provide $29 billion funding for restaurants and bars to cover operating costs, including payroll, and the construction of outdoor seating, to help keep their doors open. In Washington state, 7,236 restaurants submitted RRF grant applications and only 3,247 of them, less than half, received funding before the RRF ran out of money in May 2021. In the first year of the pandemic, over 2,300 restaurants throughout the State of Washington have closed.Senator Cantwell has been a strong and consistent advocate for providing COVID relief to restaurants during the pandemic, from speaking on the Senate floor urging the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act to advocating for more relief when funds ran out last summer. At a 2021 Senate Small Business Committee hearing, Cantwell pressed U.S. Small Business Administrator Isabel Guzman about the need to provide more funding for the RRF.In January 2022, Senator Cantwell held a virtual roundtable with restaurant owners from across Washington state to discuss the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the need to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) established by the American Rescue Plan for addition relief amidst the recent omicron surge.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-bill-increasing-economic-opportunities-for-the-chehalis-tribe-passes-out-of-committee-moves-to-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, a bill introduced by U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that would add the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation to a list of Tribes authorized to hold leases of up to 99 years passed out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and will advance to the Senate floor.The bill -- Senate Bill 3773 -- would make a technical amendment to the Long-Term Leasing Act of 1955, which states that Tribes cannot lease out their land for more than 25 years (with one option to renew the lease for another 25 years). S. 3773 would extend that lease period to 99 years for the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation. Congress has granted similar authority to 59 other Tribes across the nation through comparable bills.During a meeting Wednesday of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Cantwell urged her colleagues to support her legislation, which she introduced alongside Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA). Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-WA), Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA) and Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-WA) have introduced companion legislation in the House.“This will open the door to more economic opportunities for the Chehalis tribe. It will allow the Chehalis tribe to lease their trust lands for up to 99 years, which will help them attract businesses create jobs for tribal members in the surrounding community. The bill will provide the tribe with the necessary level of flexibility to help finance and encourage economic development projects,” Senator Cantwell said.“The Chehalis tribe, or I believe any other tribes, should not be hindered because of the 1955 bill that limits a Tribe’s ability to lease their land.”The Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation are currently fielding multiple development proposals between Seattle and Portland to serve supply chain needs, but they cannot act on these proposals because the prospective lessees and their private financiers require lease terms of at least 50 years due to current market demands. Allowing the Tribe to enter into longer leases on lands held in trust will increase economic development opportunities and create more jobs for Tribal members and surrounding communities.In 2010, a similar bill authored by Senator Cantwell extended lease limits for the Swinomish Reservation, the Kalispel Indian Reservation and trust lands, and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians.A video of Senator Cantwell’s remarks can be viewed HERE, audio HERE and a full transcript HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-the-supreme-court-is-pretending-that-they-never-heard-of-settled-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) joined fellow Democratic women of the Senate speaking out against the ongoing push from Republicans and an activist Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and strip away access to reproductive care.In remarks to reporters at the Capitol, Senator Cantwell said that she’s heard from a record-breaking number of women reaching out to share their abortion stories and advocate for their constitutional rights.“A few weeks ago, a political earthquake did happen in the United States with a draft release of what could potentially be a ban on abortions for women in the United States of America. And we're here today to say: we need every American who cares about these privacy rights to call their representative, their senator, and say, ‘stop a ban on abortions,’” Senator Cantwell said.“Now, since this time a few weeks ago, what's happened? We have seen millions of Americans march in their local communities to say that they want to protect women's reproductive rights. We have heard from record numbers of women calling our offices, emailing us, sending us information, and saying that this is an unbelievable running over of their rights. We've heard heartbreaking stories of women who've talked about sexual assault, and they had no choice but to abort that fetus. And what they want to know is if we are going to stand with them and stand for the hard choices that they've had to make.So we're asking our colleagues to be clear here. Are they for upholding these constitutional rights, or are they going to continue to help a Supreme Court run over those constitutional rights?We know that 70% of Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, they want these rights upheld. So who are the Republicans talking about? 25% of the Americans? This clearly is not in the mainstream view. Mainstream Americans have counted on this right, depended on this right, exercised this right, and now the Supreme Court is pretending that they never heard of settled law, never heard of mainstream views, and never heard of constitutional rights to privacy.So the answer for this is for the American people to hold their elected representatives accountable, to make our voices heard, and to march with the young women that I have seen in my state marching. Because they want to know, are they going to grow up in a different era? An era they never imagined they were going to have to deal with, that makes them a second class citizen.I guarantee you that is not what Americans want, and if we raise our voices loud enough, get these members held accountable, ask about their voting records, their intentions, and ask them just a plain and simple question: Do you stand with a ban on abortion? And make it clear that if they do, then America does not stand with them.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the conference. Senator Cantwell was joined by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). A video of Senator Cantwell’s remarks can be viewed HERE, audio HERE, and a full transcript HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-introduces-bill-to-enhance-national-weather-service-firefighting-tools,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced new, bipartisan legislation to formalize and fund firefighting duties already performed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhancing the agency’s capacity to help prevent and fight wildfires. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) is co-sponsoring the bill.The Fire Ready Nation Act of 2022 will establish a fire weather services program within NOAA – authorizing engagement in wildfire response activities and providing funding for science and technologies to forecast weather conditions that cause and spread wildfires.“Washington state wildfires are growing more severe, burning hundreds of thousands of acres and threatening lives and property every year,” said Sen. Cantwell.  “With the 2022 fire season right around the corner, we need to maximize every tool available to prevent, track and fight wildfires. This bill will help our federal weather tracking agency – NOAA – deploy new technology that will boost computing power to improve wildfire forecasting and identify the impacts of changing weather conditions. It will test a new drone pilot program designed to gather critical fire information and survey post-fire damage – even at night – without endangering the lives of a pilot or crew members. And it will ensure NOAA has the resources to support our specially-trained forecasters serving alongside wildfire response teams.”NOAA is already a major player in wildfire preparedness and response. However, the agency has no defined statutory authority or mandate for its wildfire services and activities.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/spiking-west-coast-gas-prices-spur-cantwell-feinstein-wyden-to-introduce-bill-targeting-fuel-market-anomalies-hurting-consumers,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— With Americans facing record level gas and diesel price increases, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, introduced legislation that would significantly increase transportation fuel market transparency and directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to proactively monitor and prevent any fraud or manipulation that may be artificially inflating pump prices.  The legislation is co-sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR). The legislation will likely be considered at the Commerce Committee’s next Executive Session and Senate Majority Leader Schumer has publically committed to a Senate floor vote on the measure. “This legislation couldn’t come at a more needed time as drivers in Washington and all across the country face record breaking pump prices,” said Cantwell. “Americans are frustrated and bewildered by gasoline prices that keep going up even when oil prices drop and fossil fuel companies post obscene profits. Protecting American households and business requires forcing the same level of transparency in fuel markets that we successfully fought to secure in other energy markets. This legislation will put a full time policeman on the beat able to shine a bright light on the mysterious middle of gas markets and go after any bad actors that are exploiting consumers.”“Americans are paying record-high gas prices while gas companies are raking in record-high profits. It’s time for this to stop,” said Feinstein. “As we continue to work toward energy independence by investing in clean energy sources, we also need to ensure there is greater transparency in the oil and gas markets to prevent price gouging.”“The outrageous volatility of the oil and gas market goes far beyond legitimate free-market competition,” Wyden said. “This much is painfully clear: oil companies and middlemen are raking in profits while Americans from communities large and small struggle to afford record-high prices at the pump. This legislation provides much-needed transparency and oversight to reveal harmful price gouging that is devastating working families.”The Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act:A one-page summary of the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act is available HERE.Background information on Federal Anti-Market Manipulation Authority is available HERE.The full bill text is available HERE.Washington state currently has the fourth-highest gas prices in the country. According to AAA, today’s average price across Washington state is $4.92 per gallon, and just this week, gas prices soared above $5 a gallon for the first time in the Seattle-Bellevue metro area. According to a Seattle Times analysis of gas prices compiled by AAA, from 2017-2021, Washingtonians paid on average 45 cents more per gallon than the national average.On April 5, 2022, Cantwell chaired a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that revealed a lack of oversight and visibility into petroleum trades that affect prices at the gas pump. The committee heard from energy expert Robert McCullough, who testified that benchmark indices used to price petroleum contracts across the West Coast market are based on transactions that are not on an exchange, not public, and not well understood.  The Senator has long sought to protect consumers from unjustified energy prices. In the aftermath of Enron’s energy trading schemes, Cantwell authored an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that strengthened the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) authority to investigate and punish market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets.  Since then, FERC has built a permanent cadre of internal energy experts that continually monitor and investigate anomalous market trends and suspicious behavior. These policemen on the beat have uncovered numerous exploitive schemes, to date approving 127 settlement agreements, assessing over $790 million in civil penalties and disgorging over $521 million in illegal profits. In the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, Cantwell authored legislation that gave the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) similar anti-market manipulation authority and responsibilities in financially-settled energy commodity derivatives markets. Over the last decade, the Commission has used their anti-fraud and anti-market manipulation authority to prosecute more than 50 actions which have collectively imposed more than $4.5 billion in monetary relief.A Cantwell addition to the 2007 Energy Bill gave the FTC virtually identical anti-market manipulation authority and responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission to oversee wholesale crude oil and petroleum markets.  However, unlike FERC and the CFTC, the FTC has only used their authority sparingly. As described above, the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act would significantly enhance the 2007 authority and establish a new unit within the Commission dedicated to overseeing transportation fuel markets, as well as direct the Energy Information Administration to collect the market data necessary to effectively monitor and police markets. ###"

Admiral Fagan is the first woman to lead any branch of the United States military. Commandant Fagan will assume her role on June 1, 2022. Prior to the vote, Senator Cantwell (D-WA) spoke in support of Admiral Fagan’s confirmation: “Now more than ever, we must have a strong tested leader as Commandant. It is clear from her record that Admiral Fagan is the right woman for the job,” said Cantwell. “I look forward to working with her to ensure that the men and women in the Coast Guard have the tools they need to execute their mission and support their families.”A transcript of Senator Cantwell’s full remarks is available HERE.Prior to her confirmation, Admiral Fagan served as the U.S. Coast Guard’s Vice Commandant. She received a Master of Science in Marine Affairs from the University of Washington and previously served on the Seattle-based heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star. Admiral Fagan has served 36 years in the U.S. Coast Guard and is the longest-serving active duty Marine Safety Officer.As Commandant, Admiral Fagan will lead 55,700 active duty, reserve, and civilian members, and approximately 26,000 auxiliary volunteers. Washington state is currently home to 1,641 active duty Coast Guard service members deployed across 11 different stations. A total of 1,291 active duty, civilians, and reservists are based in Seattle.On April 28, 2022, As Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Cantwell led Admiral Fagan’s confirmation hearing. At the hearing, Cantwell said, “This is a historic moment for our country and for women in the armed services. It will be the first time that a woman will lead one of the six branches of the armed services. So I am hoping that your leadership will also will lead to more progress on getting women recruited and retained in the Coast Guard.”Senator Cantwell’s statement in response to Admiral Fagan’s nomination is available HERE.Video of Senator Cantwell’s floor speech is available HERE, audio HERE, and a full transcript HERE.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-republicans-want-a-ban-on-abortion,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) voted to uphold the freedom of American women to make decisions about their own reproductive health care.A Senate vote to pass the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA) – which would codify abortion access into federal law by applying the same standard established nearly 50 years ago by Roe v. Wade – ultimately failed 49-51.After the vote, Senator Cantwell released the following statement:“Republicans want a ban on abortion. And if the Supreme Court and Senate Republicans have their way they will succeed.  The health care decisions of women should be left up to individuals and their doctors. 70% of Americans agree.”Yesterday, Senator Cantwell delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling on her colleagues to reject Republicans’ extremist, anti-choice campaign to yank reproductive health care back to “the Dark Ages.”“What are you thinking when you are advocating for a return to pre-Roe? What, exactly, do you think is going to happen in the United States of America? I can tell you: You’re going to leave women without the ability to control their own bodies, without the ability for them and their doctor to make decisions,” she said in her speech, which can be viewed HERE.Last week, after the draft opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked, Senator Cantwell addressed reporters from the steps of the Senate. She pledged to fight against Republicans’ attempts to “foist on the American public an invasion of their rights to privacy.” Her full remarks can be viewed HERE.Last year Senator Cantwell cosponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021, a previous version of the legislation addressed today.  Like the bill voted on today, the 2021 version would have guaranteed a pregnant person’s right to access an abortion—and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services—free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship.###"

After this announcement, Senator Cantwell released the following statement:“The Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership program is a prime example of the invaluable conservation programs that we were able to permanently and fully fund last Congress. Upgrading these treasured green spaces will help promote physical fitness and boost urban outdoor recreation opportunities in King County.”According to Secretary Haaland, $61 million has been allocated nationwide for the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program this year. Since 2014, the ORLP has helped enable communities to create new parks and invigorate existing outdoor recreation opportunities in economically underserved communities through a competitive grant process.Washington’s three qualifying projects are located in King County. They include:Lakeland North Urban Park (official park name TBD) - $3,612,027Garfield Super Block - $2,170,902Be'er Sheva Park - $491,446The ORLP program is funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) State and Local Assistance Program. After funding for the LWCF expired in 2018, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) led Congressional efforts to reauthorize a permanent budget of $900 million per year and fully fund the program into the future.Since its creation, LWCF has supported more than 42,000 state and local projects in communities across the country. It’s helped fund more than 600 projects in Washington state, including popular recreation sites like Olympic National Park, Lake Chelan, and Riverside State Park. ###"

Senator Cantwell and her colleagues revived the bill so every American can see where their Senator stands on protecting the right to choose after a leaked draft majority opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization signaled that the Supreme Court of the United States will soon overturn Roe v. Wade.Speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Cantwell pointed out that the overwhelming majority of Americans do not want to see Roe overturned.“Seventy percent of Americans are in agreement,” Senator Cantwell said. “Anybody who thinks this isn’t about settled law or about mainstream views in America is wrong. It’s about almost 50 years of settled law —it’s about what mainstream Americans believe are their Constitutional rights.”“It's been the fight of the other side of the aisle all along to try to say they are going to control women's bodies and women's health care choices,” she added.“We’re not going to get rid of abortions ... They will happen — it will go back to any back-alley approach,” Senator Cantwell continued. “I ask my colleagues: What are you thinking when you are advocating for a return to pre-Roe? What, exactly, do you think is going to happen in the United States of America? I can tell you: You’re going to leave women without the ability to control their own bodies, without the ability for them and their doctor to make decisions.”“Do you believe the rights of privacy exist within the Constitution? Or are you like the Supreme Court — you don’t believe in the decisions of previous Supreme Court Justices?” Senator Cantwell asked.“If they didn’t believe in these rights of privacy, they should have told everybody clearly,” she said.“I would listen and pass this legislation tomorrow. Because I guarantee you, if it's not just this privacy right, why are you going to trust them on any other privacy decision in the future if they're not going to be fighting to uphold your privacy rights on women's reproductive health?” Senator Cantwell concluded.Last week, Senator Cantwell warned against the “brain drain” for federal agencies located in states poised to restrict access to abortion. Banning essential reproductive health care services would be “ludicrous” for employers and workers, she said in remarks delivered at the press conference, linked HERE.The day after the SCOTUS draft ruling was leaked, Senator Cantwell joined Democratic colleagues on the steps of the Senate and pledged to fight for the Constitutional right to privacy in a statement linked HERE.In December 2021, Senator Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor in response to the U.S. Supreme Court starting oral arguments on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which could roll back decades of precedent upholding the right to reproductive health care.In September, she joined 47 Democrats in the Senate and 188 in the House in filing a bicameral amicus brief in Dobbs v.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-warns-of-political-earthquake-and-brain-drain-from-federal-agencies-in-states-that-ban-abortion-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), joined Senate Democrats in announcing next week’s Senate vote on legislation that would federally codify Roe v. Wade. At the press conference, Cantwell emphasized the fact that the end of Roe would cause an economic disaster as millions of Americans would be faced with a potentially life or death decision – whether to leave their jobs and move to a state where the right to abortion and reproductive freedoms are still protected.  “We know that as employers…anybody who you wanted to attract to come work for you wanted to know what your health plan was, and their spouse wanted to know what your health plan was. They wanted to know whether you covered IVF or now we're going to say that those are the kinds of things that aren't going to get covered in the future.“What are we going to do as employers here in the United States Senate? What are we going to do about federal agencies? Do you think people are going to want to go and work in NASA in Florida or Texas if that state precludes a woman's right to choose? “Are we going to have extra money in the budget so people can travel to a state so they can get their health care rights? Or are we going to have a brain drain because people aren't going to want to work for federal agencies located in a state that doesn't protect a woman's right to choose? This is ludicrous.”Earlier this week, Cantwell spoke on the steps of the Senate, saying democrats, “are going to fight,” to protect reproductive health care rights.  In response to the news of the leaked SCOTUS majority opinion, Senator Cantwell released a statement linked HERE.In December 2021, Senator Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor in response to the U.S. Supreme Court starting oral arguments on Dobbs v.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, signaling the Supreme Court of the United States will soon overturn Roe v. Wade. On the steps of the U.S. Senate, Cantwell said the following:“Democrats have been fighting for Americans’ health care rights, and Republicans have been trying to overturn them.“They've tried to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and we have stopped them. And now you don't hear them talking about that, because they now want to talk about taking away women's reproductive health care rights.“We are going to fight in the United States Senate to make sure that every American understands that 50 years of settled law, 50 years of Republican nominees coming before the committee and saying that they believe this is settled law, to now foist on the American public an invasion of their rights to privacy and pretend that those rights of privacy do not exist in the Constitution.“These people are dead wrong. The American people know that those rights to privacy affect so many aspects of their lives. They affect every aspect, whether it's the government intruding on their lives, whether it's other individuals or corporations, they believe that we can make laws to protect an individual right to privacy, and that also is part of determining what we as women do with our own bodies.“So the American people, the majority, as my colleague just said, the majority of American people support this policy as settled law. The majority of states support this as settled law. And now we just need a few men on the Supreme Court to come clean about the intentions that they never made clear to a Senate Judiciary Committee, and have our Republican colleagues come clean about this because they are overturning your constitutional right.“And we in America, the women of America, will march to protect these rights on behalf of all of us.”Last night, in response to the breaking news of the leaked opinion, Senator Cantwell released this statement linked HERE.In December 2021, Senator Cantwell spoke on the Senate floor in response to the U.S. Supreme Court starting oral arguments on Dobbs v.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/commerce-committee-report-underscores-need-for-congress-to-restore-ftc-authority-to-return-billions-to-consumers-ripped-off-by-scams-fraud-deception_,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, (D-WA) Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, released a new Committee report which validates the urgency for Congress to restore the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) decades-long authority to return money to consumers victimized by illegal scams, fraud and other unfair or deceptive practices.  In April 2021, the Supreme Court slashed the FTC’s “Section 13(b)” authority which had been utilized in cases resulting in the return of $11.2 billion dollars to consumers in the five years prior to the decision.“This report makes very clear what’s at stake for consumers if Congress fails to act,” said Sen. Cantwell. “If the FTC remains disarmed of this critical authority, millions of consumers and small businesses who’ve been scammed, swindled, or locked out of competitive marketplaces will never be made whole.”The report highlights the implications of the Supreme Court’s April 2021 decision in AMG Capital Management LLC v. FTC that gutted the FTC’s enforcement authority under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. For more than 40 years, the Commission had relied on this authority to go to federal court to refund billions of dollars illegally taken from consumers and small business owners through unfair and deceptive acts including telemarketing fraud, unfair or anticompetitive practices, data security and privacy scams. Before the Supreme Court’s decision, the FTC’s 13(b) enforcement authority had been especially critical in addressing Big Tech and Pharma’s ability to harm consumers and fledgling businesses. The report outlines a series of successful FTC cases against technology and pharmaceutical companies including Amazon, Uber, AT&T, Teva and Tracfone, which returned millions of dollars to victims of illegal conduct.Immediately following the Supreme Court action, even FTC cases that had been decided in favor of consumers were halted, allowing corporations to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in redress owed to victims.“The loss of the FTC’s 13(b) authority is hitting the pocketbooks of consumers today,” said Sen. Cantwell.  “Consumers will not see $493 million in refunds a Federal trial court ordered pharma companies AbbieVie and Besins Healthcare to pay as a result of their scheme to keep lower-priced generic versions of AndroGel off the markets.  As a result, consumers paid hundreds of millions more for an expensive brand-name drug, instead of generic drugs.  Now, instead of giving the money back to consumers, AbbVie and Besins will get to keep the money.”“This is unconscionable,” Sen. Cantwell added.  “Congress can act to stop this from happening in the future and restore this vital authority to the FTC so it can help return money back to consumers’ pockets.” Sen. Cantwell will introduce legislation this week that would fully restore the FTC’s ability under Section 13(b) to allow the FTC to sue scammers and other bad actors in federal court to return the money they took from consumers as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. The legislation would: authorize monetary remedies for consumers who were harmed by consumer protection violations; ensure that the FTC may sue for injunctions and consumer redress for prior conduct; affirm that the FTC must argue its cases in front of a neutral federal judge, with full due process and opportunity to appeal; and create a statute of limitations of 10 years on FTC suits.The table below shows FTC data of the increasing number of consumer fraud reports in the State of Washington.Year Total Number of ReportsTotal $ Reported Lost Median Reported Loss 202157,453$135,700,000$500202048,448$70,500,000$399201939,466$45,500,000$395201828,326$28,300,000$350Sen.

If confirmed, Admiral Fagan would be the first woman, and first mother, to lead any branch of the United States Armed Forces.Admiral Fagan currently serves as the U.S. Coast Guard’s Vice Commandant and is the longest serving active duty Marine Safety Officer. She received a Master of Science in Marine Affairs from the University of Washington and previously served on the Seattle-based heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star.At the hearing, Senator Cantwell asked Admiral Fagan, “Since obviously you have a big footprint in Seattle. Are you committed to getting good [childcare] facilities there for the Seattle Coast Guard community?”Admiral Fagan replied, “We're excited about what's going on in Seattle. We look forward to working with you to ensure that you know childcare is a primary area of focus as we moved to homeport the Polar Security Cutters there,” said Admiral Fagan. “And look forward to working with you and making sure that Coast Guard families have access to the child care that they need.”Nearly 40% of all U.S. Coast Guard academy enrollees are women, which is the highest percentage among all service academies. As Commandant, Admiral Fagan will lead 55,700 active duty, reserve, and civilian members, and approximately 26,000 auxiliary volunteers.Washington state is currently home to 1,641 active duty Coast Guard service members deployed across 11 different stations. A total of 1,291 active duty, civilians, and reservists are based in Seattle. During the question and answer, Senator Cantwell also secured a commitment from Admiral Fagan for the Coast Guard to help protect Southern Resident orcas in Puget Sound: “Southern Resident orcas are a very big part of sustainability issues for us in Puget Sound…Will you commit to work with us on a system for Puget Sound…to reduce vessel strikes, noise impacts, and other issues?”“We remain committed to working with you on the issue of preservation of the killer whales as it pertains to Puget Sound,” said Admiral Fagan.Senator Cantwell is an ardent supporter of U.S. Coast Guard families. In 2021, Cantwell championed two provisions that were included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $309 million for repairs and new construction of Coast Guard owned housing and infrastructure across the country and $120 million to build Coast Guard owned and operated childcare centers, which are critical to the retention of women serving in the Coast Guard.In 2017, Senator Cantwell advocated for Coast Guard paid family leave policies to be expanded to include LGBTQ+ couples, adoptive parents, and secondary caregivers. The U.S. Coast Guard announced the expansion of their paid family leave policy in June 2018. In 2015, Senator Cantwell authored an amendment to ensure Coast Guard members were not receiving less maternity leave than other branches of the military, such as the Navy. This resulted in paid maternity leave for Coast Guard members being doubled from 6 to 12 weeks.When Admiral Fagan’s nomination was announced, Senator Cantwell released the following statement: “From her career beginnings as a deck watch officer on the Seattle-based icebreaker Polar Star, Admiral Fagan has shown strong leadership and a commitment to service that make her an outstanding choice as the Coast Guard’s 27th Commandant. Upon confirmation, she will become the first woman and mother to lead any branch of the Armed Forces. This nomination proves the value of enacting laws that provide family leave, childcare, and health care access to support talented women in the Coast Guard who have dual roles as service members and parents. Admiral Fagan’s nomination will inspire generations of American women to strive to serve at the highest level in the Armed Forces.”Video of Senator Cantwell’s opening statement is available HERE, audio HERE.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/washington-state-labor-leader-max-vekich-sworn-in-as-a-federal-maritime-commissioner,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Max Vekich, labor leader and Aberdeen, Washington native, had his official swearing in ceremony as a commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). In February, Commissioner Vekich was quickly sworn-in following his Senate confirmation so he could immediately get to work on the supply chain crisis. Vekich spent more than 40 years working in the maritime industry, and is the first commissioner who served as a member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union’s (ILWU) executive board, and is the first FMC commissioner from Washington state. His confirmation secures a Democratic majority on the Federal Maritime Commission, which is responsible for regulating agreements between American exporters and the shipping companies that carry their goods to ensure they are fair and competitive. At the official swearing-in ceremony, Senator Cantwell said the following: “Max, as a commissioner on the Federal Maritime Commission, will bring a view about why it's important to get these issues done in a timely fashion. Why? Because he's worked so hard for so long on those same issues. He knows what it takes to deliver a product in a timely fashion…We couldn't be more excited that we're also giving the Federal Maritime Commission new tools to crack down on unfair detention and demurrage charges and an authority to take action that helps U.S. exporters get their products to overseas markets.”Senator Cantwell helped champion the recently passed bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022, which aims to level the playing field for American exporters and importers by providing the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) the tools it needs to improve oversight over international shipping lines, and crack down on rising shipping fees. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act now goes to the House for final passage. In February 2022, Vekich was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 51-43. Cantwell spoke on the floor of the Senate to push for Vekich’s confirmation just prior to the vote. In the Senator’s remarks, Cantwell stated, “Mr. Vekich knows what it takes to move product from the heartland. He knows that in our Washington ports we are helping U.S. farmers get their products to market. So I know whether that’s wheat or soybeans, or other ag products, he knows what it takes to move them and what it takes for us to continue to improve the efficiency of our ports.”Vekich served four consecutive terms as the representative for the 35th Legislative District in Washington state’s House of Representatives from 1983-1991. During Vekich’s tenure, he served as Chair of three committees: Agriculture, Trade & Economic Development, and Commerce & Labor. In 2004, Vekich joined the Port of Seattle to supervise the loading and unloading of vessels. He also served as a member of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union’s executive board. Vekich is married to Marcee Stone, they have three adult children and four grandchildren. Two of his children are longshore workers and his daughter-in-law is currently in training. Video of Senator Cantwell’s floor remarks ahead of Vekich’s confirmation vote is available HERE.

The Commission is responsible for regulating agreements between American exporters and the shipping companies that carry their goods to ensure they are fair and competitive.“It is great to have an experienced Pacific Northwest voice on the Federal Maritime Commission to help sort out supply chain issues, support American exporters, and to help keep ports and freight moving,” said Cantwell.Vekich was confirmed last week by the Senate with a vote of 51-43. Cantwell spoke on the floor of the Senate to push for Vekich’s confirmation just prior to the vote. In the Senator’s remarks, Cantwell stated, “Mr. Vekich knows what it takes to move product from the heartland. He knows that in our Washington ports we are helping U.S. farmers get their products to market. So I know whether that’s wheat or soybeans, or other ag products, he knows what it takes to move them and what it takes for us to continue to improve the efficiency of our ports.”The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented port congestion and supply chain disruptions. Businesses and Americans are feeling the pinch of rising prices and shortages on everyday products. At this critical time in our country, the Commission plays an important role in oversight, investigations and regulation of detention and demurrage, information flow, and enforcement of unfair practices by foreign shipping companies.“The perspective and experience that Mr. Vekich will bring to this position of Commissioner is needed in this moment,” Cantwell said at the nomination hearing in October. “He has a unique career first serving as a member of the Washington Legislature, followed by a long career as a longshoreman in Grays Harbor and in Seattle. Mr. Vekich knows port and shipping communities firsthand. He spent his life working in the maritime industry, and knows the challenges faced by the maritime and intermodal transportation system. And I know he understands the importance of what a maritime economy is to the State of Washington's economy and knows how important it is to our national economy as well.” Max Vekich is a native of Aberdeen, Washington. He served four consecutive terms as the representative for the 35th Legislative District in Washington state’s House of Representatives from 1983-1991.

https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-statement-on-president-bidens-executive-order-to-safeguard-old-growth-forests,"SEATTLE, WA – Today, on Earth Day, President Biden joined U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and members of the Washington state congressional delegation in Seward Park to sign an Executive Order to strengthen America’s forests, boost wildfire resilience, and combat global deforestation. Senator Maria Cantwell released this statement following President Biden’s remarks:""Preserving America's last remaining wild forestlands is one of the greatest Earth Day gifts we can give. One old-growth stand in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest stores more than 900 tons of carbon per acre, more than twice as much as the average tropical rainforest. This Executive Order is a smart, nature-based way to combat climate change and wildfires, increase outdoor recreation opportunities, and strengthen our sustainable forest products industry.""###  "
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-attends-groundbreaking-of-new-pnnl-premier-energy-storage-research-center-,"RICHLAND, WA – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony of Pacific Northwest National Lab’s (PNNL) new Grid Storage Launchpad facility in Richland, WA. The innovative Grid Storage Launchpad will serve as a collaborative setting for national laboratories, universities, and industry to speed innovation and deployment of grid-scale energy storage technologies.“Energy storage is going to be one of the largest economic opportunities of the 21st century. By the end of 2030, analysts predict there will be 20 times more energy storage online than at the end of 2020. At that scale, it will require more than a $262 billion investment,” said Cantwell. “This facility that we are going to break ground on, will help us insure that we are in a positon to create those opportunities for people here in the United States.”Cantwell has consistently advocated for PNNL’s energy storage R&D efforts and has supported federal appropriations for the new Grid Storage Launchpad, totaling $75 million since the 2019 fiscal year. During Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s confirmation hearing, Cantwell secured a commitment from Granholm to prioritize funding for the Grid Storage Launchpad. She has also promoted the Launchpad and PNNL’s capabilities with numerous other top Energy Department officials over the past few years including former-DOE Secretary Dan Brouillette, former-DOE Undersecretary Paul Dabbar, and current nominee for the Office of Electricity Maria Robinson.Cantwell also authored much of the relevant legislation authorizing the R&D that will likely occur at the new facility, including the Grid Modernization Act of 2019 which was enacted into law in December 2020, and the Smart Grid Title of the 2007 Energy Bill. When the Department of Energy approved the construction of facility in 2021, Cantwell applauded the announcement.At the groundbreaking, Dr. Steve Ashby, Director of PNNL said, “Today we celebrate an exciting milestone in our shared vision of a clean energy future that will serve our nation for generations to come…The GSL as we call it, will bring together critical scientific research and testing capabilities to accelerate this development, testing and validation of advanced grid scale energy storage systems.”A recording of the groundbreaking ceremony is available HERE.A full transcript of Senator Cantwell’s remarks is available HERE."
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/puget-sounds-latest-major-transit-expansion-shows-snohomish-county-getting-ready-for-growth-says-cantwell,"LYNNWOOD, WA —U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, called for increased investment in public transit as she joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Representatives Rick Larsen (D, WA-02) and Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Administrator Nuria Fernandez, and Governor Jay Inslee at the groundbreaking of Community Transit’s newest Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line.“We know that Snohomish County is one of the fastest-growing parts of our state. It grew 37% over the last 20 years and by 2040 we expect to have 1 million people living here in Snohomish County,” said Cantwell. “Investing in [the] Orange Line bus rapid transit system is Snohomish County getting ready for the growth that we know is going to happen in our region.”The new transit line, the Swift Orange Line, will be the first BRT to light rail connection in Snohomish County. In 2019, Cantwell wrote a letter of supportfor Community Transit to receive $37 million from the FTA Capital Investment Small Starts grant program. According to Community Transit, the Swift Orange Line will provide a direct connection between the two existing Swift lines and the Lynnwood Link light rail station scheduled to open in 2024. The Swift Orange Line will serve as a key route connecting Edmonds Community College, Lynnwood City Center, Alderwood Mall, and Mill Creek Town Center. It is also scheduled to open in 2024.“People from Mill Creek, Lynnwood, and Edmonds will be able to get this reliable service, leaving every 10-12 minutes, taking them to Seattle in about 28 minutes,” said Cantwell. “And that is the reliable service they deserve.” The $37 million grant that is helping Community Transit start construction now is part of the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) championed by Cantwell. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill, Cantwell led the charge to fund the program at a historic $8 billion in advanced appropriations, or $1.6 billion annually. Then, in the 2022 Omnibus spending bill in Congress earlier this year, Cantwell helped win an additional appropriation of $2.3 billion for the CIG program.As a result, there is $3.9 billion in CIG funding available for 2022, an 88.7% increase from last year.Earlier this month, Senator Cantwell announced $370 million in federal funding for Washington state transit agencies from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The funding amount represented a 33.7% increase over last year.As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Cantwell has long been a champion of investment in Washington state’s transportation infrastructure and has helped secure federal funding for important infrastructure and transit expansion projects throughout the state. Cantwell has been a strong supporter of robust increases to competitive transit grant programs such as the Capital Investment Grant Program, the Low or No Emission (Low-No) Grant Program, the Bus and Bus Facilities Grant Program, and the Passenger Ferry Grant Program.###"
https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/the-west-coasts-4th-worst-freight-bottleneck-is-primed-for-a-federally-funded-fix-says-cantwell,"VANCOUVER, WA —Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, stood next to the 105-year-old Interstate Bridge and explained how the Megaproject Grant Program passed under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law can finally spur its replacement.“As we were considering the infrastructure bill getting through our committee, we wrote this language for megaprojects with the I-5 bridge in mind,” said Cantwell. “We thought there were projects that were so costly, but had regional significance to the nation, that they deserved a category of funding all their own. So the race is on now to meet that criteria and qualify this project for those federal dollars.”The bridge, which spans the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, is a bottleneck along the west coast’s vital I-5 freight corridor linking Washington with Oregon and California. Traffic congestion and bridge raises cause slowdowns at the aging span. According to a February 2022 report by the American Transportation Research Institute, the bridge is the 4th-worst freight bottleneck on the West Coast, and 33rd-worst in the nation.Senator Cantwell authored the Megaprojects Grant Program to support highway, bridge, transit, passenger rail, or freight transportation projects that are critical to our economy, but are too large or complex for existing funding programs. A total of $5 billion will be available nationwide.  The Department of Transportation released funding criteria for the Megaproject Grant Program less than a month ago, in March. In her remarks, Senator Cantwell noted that the Interstate Bridge Replacement project meets virtually every requirement graded for competitiveness. The requirements that the project meets include:The Interstate Bridge Replacement was also listed in a 2017 U.S. Department of the Treasury report that named 40 U.S. infrastructure projects of major national significance.The Senator also noted that the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program may also be a source for federal investment. The competitive grant program will fund bridge replacement projects on the National Bridge Inventory, which the I-5 Bridge is listed on. Funding criteria for this program will be released in May.According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, a total of $97 billion in goods will travel by truck either from Washington to Oregon or California, or from Oregon or California to Washington in 2022.“Shipping costs can be one of the most expensive parts of doing business, and a reliable efficient transportation network will help companies be more competitive,” said Julianna Marler, CEO of the Port of Vancouver, at the event. “This includes goods that we move at the Port of Vancouver today like wind blades to eastern Oregon, Washington, and Canada. We also move Subarus throughout the Northwest and as far east as Ohio.”West Coast Trucked Freight Value 2022 Projections (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)Direction of Trucked FreightValue of Trucked FreightWashington to California$14.2 billionWashington to Oregon$24.0 billionOregon to Washington$33.7 billionCalifornia to Washington$25.0 billionTotal Value$96.9 billionCalifornia to Washington Trucked Freight TradeOregon to Washington Trucked Freight TradeThe bridge’s replacement will improve international trade as well. In 2021, nearly $2 billion worth of goods were trucked from California to Canada via the I-5 corridor.

These grants are funded in part by $100 million that Cantwell helped secure in the American Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021. Thanks to this grant provision, the projects will not have to pay the usual local match. “With Washingtonians taking to the skies again, investing in our airport infrastructure has never been more important,” said Cantwell. “This $5.9 million for Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport to construct a new terminal apron is critical for the airport to meet the existing and future needs of its users as the airport accounts for an increase in takeoffs and landings.”Pullman/Moscow Regional Airport will receive $5,986,068 for the second phase of construction of a new 48,000 square yard terminal apron. This phase will consist of 14,880 square yards of construction. Senator Cantwell has long supported airports throughout the State of Washington. Through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Senator Cantwell has helped airports throughout Washington state get funding. In June, Cantwell announced over $217 million in grants from the Airport Rescue Grants program awarded to Washington airports to help keep people safe and employed by reimbursing operational expenses, debt service payments, and costs related to combating the spread of pathogens at the airport.In August of 2021, Cantwell announced $22 million in AIP funding going to airports in Wenatchee, Bremerton, Richland, Snohomish, and Yakima. In May 2021, Cantwell announced $23 million in AIP funding going to Sea-Tac, Bellingham, Walla Walla, and Pullman-Moscow airports.

These grants are funded in part by $100 million that Cantwell helped secure in the American Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021. Thanks to this grant provision, the projects will not have to pay the usual local match. “As one of the fastest growing airports in the country, federal infrastructure dollars are crucial for Sea-Tac to meet future demand,” said Cantwell. “This $16.7 million grant will allow Sea-Tac Airport to perform upgrades to its tarmac by reconstructing existing taxilanes, helping improve the efficiency of aircraft operations as the demand for air travel continues to grow.”Seattle-Tacoma International Airport will receive $16,773,933 to reconstruct taxilane pavement in the south satellite, north satellite, and Cargo 2 areas. The pavement has reached the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced. The taxilane is the portion of the aircraft parking area used for access between taxiways and aircraft parking positions.Senator Cantwell has long supported airports throughout the State of Washington.
