https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-introduces-legislation-to-improve-freight-rail-service-for-american-businesses,"Baldwin’s Reliable Rail Service Act will help Made in America products get to market more efficiently and lower costs for consumersWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Reliable Rail Service Act to help address the unreliable service and high costs of rail shipping for American businesses. The legislation, which is supported by members of the agriculture industry, labor organizations, energy producers, and manufacturers, ensures the largest freight railroads provide American businesses reliable services at reasonable rates, delivers Made in American products to market more efficiently, and helps bring down costs for consumers.   “American farmers, producers, and manufacturers are paying sky-high prices for subpar rail service to get their goods to market, and consumers seeing the impact on their pocketbooks,” said Senator Baldwin. “In order to build a strong Made in America economy and also lower costs for consumers, we need to ensure our agriculture, energy, and manufacturing businesses have reliable rail service. My Reliable Rail Service Act will keep our Made in America economy moving forward.”  The Reliable Rail Service Act will help American-made products get to market more dependably by defining the “common carrier obligation.” The “common carrier obligation” is a requirement that rail carriers serve the wider shipping public “on reasonable request,” a provision of the 1980 Staggers Act that passed in response to the railroad industry’s financial woes that threatened the long-term viability of freight rail transportation in the country. But, as a report from Transportation Research Board found, “the common carrier service obligation remains poorly defined” despite it being more than four decades old. Failure to define this principle has contributed to insufficient rail services and exorbitant costs for American products to get to market. Clearly defining this ambiguous principle has taken on greater importance as the railroad industry faces consolidation and has undertaken Wall Street practices that reduce capacity on the rail network.“The Wisconsin Farm Bureau appreciates the work of Sen. Baldwin to address the definition of common carrier service obligation and increase the authority of the Surface Transportation Board to address agricultural rail needs. The pandemic made it clear that Wisconsin farmers are dependent on the movement of agricultural goods by rail and we hope this increased authority will lead to greater efficiency within the rail industry,” said Kevin Krentz, President, Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation.  “For years, America’s freight railroads have shaped a freight rail network that cannot reasonably respond to the country’s supply chain challenges. In some cases, they even created new challenges in the supply chain, such as when they cut 29% of the industry's workforce in the last six years. Now, unreasonable service is a nationwide crisis for freight rail customers, including farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and energy producers. We applaud Senator Baldwin for introducing the Reliable Rail Service Act to help remedy the freight rail service crisis by clearly defining the reasonable service obligation and providing the Surface Transportation Board with more effective mechanisms to enforce this obligation,” said Greg Regan, President, Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.  “Our growers cannot make a living without consistent rail service. With this bill, Senator Baldwin is taking a step towards ensuring that we are delivered more reliable service while maintaining our strong partnership with the railroads,"" said Mark Hoffmann, President, Wisconsin Corn Growers Association.  “The Wisconsin Soybean Association appreciates Senator Baldwin’s work on these critical transportation issues,” said Joe Smentek, Executive Director, Wisconsin Soybean Association. “When farmers are harvesting they need to be sure that common carriers are held accountable in their crucial role in the transportation system and ensuring timely delivery.  The Wisconsin Soybean Association fully supports Senator Baldwin’s efforts on this issue”  “Manufacturers and consumers can’t keep being subjected to one rail crisis after another – we need Congress to act,” said Chris Jahn, President and Chief Executive Officer, American Chemistry Council. “Senator Baldwin has put together a sensible solution aimed at addressing ongoing freight rail service failures. This is a problem everyone should be interested in solving. We urge Democrats and Republicans to come together to pass legislation that will ensure railroads live up to their obligation to provide reliable service.”  The legislation is supported by the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, National Grain and Feed Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, Growth Energy, Corn Refiners Association, International Dairy Foods Association, USA Rice, Freight Rail Customer Alliance, Western Coal Traffic League, National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, The Fertilizer Institute, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, American Chemistry Council, Consumer Brands Association, North American Millers’ Association, National Industrial Transportation League, American Pulse Association, USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council, U.S. Pea and Lentil Trade Association, National Grange, Private Rail Car Food and Beverage Association American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA), Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED)-IBT, Brotherhood of Railway Carmen (BRC), Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS), International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers (IBB), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), National Conference of Firemen and Oilers, SEIU (NCFO), Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Mechanical Division (SMART-MD), Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division (SMART-TD), Transportation Communications Union (TCU), Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), Transportation Trades Department (TTD), AFL-CIO.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-calls-on-uscis-to-address-backlog-for-refugees-seeking-work-authorizations,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) sent a letter today urging the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediately address the existing backlog for Afghan and Ukrainian refugees seeking their employment authorization document (EAD). Many refugees in Wisconsin and across the country are currently struggling to provide for their families as they face months-long wait times for their applications to be processed. “Afghan and Ukrainian refugees in Wisconsin are facing unacceptably long waits for EADs necessary for them to provide financially for their families and fully integrate in their new communities,” Senator Baldwin wrote. “Communities across the state of Wisconsin have banded together to welcome Ukrainian and Afghan refugees fleeing instability and violence. We owe it to these communities, and the refugees they have welcomed, to help these migrants find the work and fill job openings that will help them contribute to and fully integrate into these communities.”As of September 26, USCIS estimates a processing time of 7 months for the I-765 application categories that frequently apply to Afghan and Ukrainian refugees, 4 months longer than its 3-month cycle time goal. In addition to this letter, Senator Baldwin is also supportive of Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patrick Leahy’s request for an additional $457 million in USCIS funding for FY2023 to further reduce processing timesFull text of the letter can be found below or here.Dear Director Jaddou:I write to express concern regarding ongoing employment authorization document (EAD) processing backlogs at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and to urge immediate action to address the adverse effects of these backlogs on Afghan and Ukrainian refugees and the communities in Wisconsin where they now live.Wisconsin welcomed individuals and families fleeing Afghanistan and Ukraine with the assistance of Wisconsin’s six refugee resettlement agencies. These agencies, in partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families, help connect refugees with the resources they need to acclimate to entirely new surroundings and integrate into their new local communities. While these agencies serve an invaluable role, they rely on the work of USCIS and other federal agencies to connect refugees to the documentation and authorizations necessary to obtain legal work. Afghan and Ukrainian refugees in Wisconsin are facing unacceptably long waits for EADs necessary for them to provide financially for their families and fully integrate in their new communities.As of September 26, USCIS estimates a processing time of 7 months for the I-765 application categories that frequently apply to Afghan and Ukrainian refugees, 4 months longer than its 3-month cycle time goal. I appreciate the steps that USCIS has taken to reduce processing times, including extending work authorizations for permit renewals and streamlining work authorization processing for Afghan evacuees. Nevertheless, these delays persist and continue to impede Afghan and Ukrainian refugees seeking to contribute to Wisconsin communities. I support Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Leahy’s Chairman’s mark for FY2023 USCIS funding, which would include an additional $457 million above the fiscal year 2022 funding level to further reduce processing times. This funding, paired with additional investments and accountability requirements included in the FY2022 funding bill, should position USCIS well to further reduce EAD wait times.Communities across the state of Wisconsin have banded together to welcome Ukrainian and Afghan refugees fleeing instability and violence. We owe it to these communities, and the refugees they have welcomed, to help these migrants find the work and fill job openings that will help them contribute to and fully integrate into these communities. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please communicate any additional resources that USCIS needs to help meet its 3-month cycle time goal.Sincerely,Tammy BaldwinUnited States Senator"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-works-to-bring-first-minority-business-development-center-to-wisconsin,"U.S. Department of Commerce awards North Central Minority Supplier Development Council $1.6M grant WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin announced that Wisconsin is receiving federal funding to establish the state’s first Minority Business Development Center. The U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) has awarded the Wisconsin North Central Minority Supplier Development Council (NCMSDC) $1.61 million through the MBDA’s Business Center Program to operate Wisconsin’s first Business Center to assist minority-owned business.Wisconsin is currently served by offices in Detroit and Chicago, but now NCMSDC, whose Wisconsin office is based in Milwaukee, will join a network of MBDA Business Centers and partners from around the country to provide high quality, technical assistance to Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) – including counseling and mentoring, assisting with access to capital, contracts and grants, and supporting job creation and retention. The goal of the MBDA’s Business Center Program is to promote the growth and global competitiveness of America’s MBEs.“I worked to bring a new Minority Business Development Center to Wisconsin and now we are going to have additional resources and services in our state to provide direct support to our minority business community,” said Senator Baldwin. “By investing in expanded access to the MBDA’s Business Center Program, we can build a stronger and more diverse small business economy in Wisconsin.”""To give Wisconsin's minority-owned businesses the access they need to succeed, we need to meet people where they are,” said Don Cravins, Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce for Minority Business Development. “The greatest obstacle facing minority-owned businesses is access: access to capital, access to contracts, and access to markets. Expanding MBDA's national network of business centers is critical to breaking down those barriers. The North Central Minority Supplier Development Council understands the unique challenges Wisconsin businesses and entrepreneurs of color face. We are ecstatic they will be operating the state's first MBDA business center, not only to strengthen Wisconsin businesses, but to further MBDA’s evolution as a leader for America's 9.7 million minority-owned businesses. We are proud Wisconsin will now have an MBDA business center to call their own.""""This is the epitome of a public/private partnership at scale,"" said Heather Olson, President & CEO of North Central Minority Supplier Development Council (NCMSDC). ""Operating the Wisconsin Minority Business Center in collaboration with our integrated ecosystem of partners will systemically leverage minority businesses' access to contracts, capital, and markets. This is a game changer for achieving socioeconomic growth in Wisconsin! We are thankful for Senator Baldwin’s pivotal support in bringing a minority business center to Wisconsin. NCMSDC fully embraces this great challenge and opportunity.”“Wisconsin’s selection for a new Minority Business Center will further enhance our efforts to ensure diverse businesses have the resources they need to prosper,” said Missy Hughes, secretary and CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), the state’s leading economic development organization. “WEDC is pleased North Central Minority Supplier Development Council has been selected to lead this effort, and we look forward to supporting this vital service.”Senator Baldwin worked to include the bipartisan Minority Business Development Act of 2021 as an amendment to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), making the MBDA permanent and increasing its funding and reach. The legislation provided a provision to award assistance of at least $250,000 through the agency’s MBDA Business Center Program to eligible entities to operate centers that support minority businesses in accessing capital, contracts, and grants and creating jobs. The infrastructure law also authorized $550 million over five years for the MBDA, or $110 million in annual funding through Fiscal Year 2025 – more than double the agency’s 2021 appropriation of $48 million.As Chair of the Commerce Committee’s subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Minority Business Development Agency, bringing a MBDA Business Development Center to Wisconsin has been Senator Baldwin’s priority. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce announced it would expand into six additional states using funding from the FY22 omnibus. Senator Baldwin pressed Under Secretary Cravins during his appointment hearing to ensure Wisconsin would be included in that list of new states. Her office also assisted NCMSDC to shepherd their application across the finish line."
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-bipartisan-group-introduce-legislation-to-ban-us-recognition-of-any-ukrainian-territory-annexed-by-russia,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act to bolster support for Ukraine and defend against efforts to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory. The legislation would require U.S. policy to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine.  “The United States must continue standing strong with Ukraine and provide them the support they need to defend against Putin’s war against freedom and help address the tragic humanitarian crisis for millions of innocent Ukrainians,” said Senator Baldwin. “This legislation has earned the support from Senators on both sides of the aisle because we are united in our stand against Russia’s unjust war and need to make clear that the U.S. will not recognize Russia’s claim to any Ukrainian territory it has illegally annexed.”  The legislation comes as Vladimir Putin announced plans to hold referendums in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine with the goal of annexing these regions into the Russian Federation. Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.  The legislation was led by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and also cosponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Cornyn (R-TX), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Casey (D-PA), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO).

The Senate resolution highlights the many contributions and economic benefits of the logging industry in the United States.“I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort with Senator Collins to spotlight the importance of logging businesses and workers who keep our forests healthy and support our Made in America forest products supply chain,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin’s logging economy provides good-paying jobs and revenue for rural communities and the National Forest System. Healthy forest management also provides public recreational opportunities that make the Wisconsin way of life a national treasure. With this bipartisan Senate Resolution, we are showing our commitment to the loggers who work hard to advance what has been a cultural tradition in the United States for centuries.”“Throughout Maine’s history, our forest products industry has supported good-paying jobs, driven local economies, strengthened rural communities, and protected our natural environment.  I come from a six-generation forest-products family and know of no other enterprise that requires more faith in the future and respect for the past,” said Senator Collins. “I am proud to join Senator Baldwin in honoring the skilled and resilient loggers in Maine and across the country.  I have strongly supported these hardworking men and women by advocating for workforce development programs and securing financial assistance during the pandemic, and I look forward to continuing to be a strong partner on issues to protect this resilient industry and its talented employees.”This resolution is supported by the American Loggers Council and Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association. Full text of the Senate Resolution is available here and below:Designating October 12, 2022 as “National Loggers Day”. Whereas, the logging industry has served as an economic driver and cultural tradition in the United States for centuries;Whereas, the logging industry creates rural jobs and provides revenue for local and state governments, and  ; Whereas, loggers provide renewable material for products used by Americans every day;Whereas, loggers are the first link in the $300 billion domestic forest products supply chain;Whereas, loggers are the means by which healthy forest management plans are accomplished;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests that maintain our vital animal habitats;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests which protect our watersheds;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests which sequester carbon;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests which provide public recreational opportunities;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests which reduce loss of life and property from wildfires;Whereas, logging provides for healthy forests through regeneration, including planting 2.5 billion trees annually.Resolved, That the Senate—(1)  designates October 12, 2022, and annually thereafter, as “National Loggers Day”; and(2)  encourages the President of the United States to officially designate October 12th as “National Loggers Day”.###"

While current law requires the manufacturing of products stemming from federally funded research to be made in the U.S., the requirement is routinely waived for products to be manufactured overseas. The legislation would require any waivers to be issued in accordance with the new Buy America reporting requirements passed in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   “To me, it is simple: If American taxpayers funding the research that leads to an invention, American manufacturers should be making the products,” said Senator Baldwin. “Building on our Buy America standards we championed in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, our Invent Here, Make Here Act will create and sustain good paying jobs here at home and ensure that the high-tech products are Made in America.""  “When the government spends American taxpayer money on inventing a product, it’s common sense that product should be made in America and not by our adversaries,” said Senator Portman. “This bipartisan legislation will work in accordance with the Buy America reporting requirements I authored in the bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act to ensure that coming infrastructure projects across America use American-made iron, steel, and manufactured products.”  The legislation specifically addresses the products invented as a result of funding provided by the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T). The Invent Here, Make Here for Homeland Security Act would also prohibit these taxpayer-funded inventions from being manufactured in foreign countries like China, North Korea, Iran, or Russia.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-bipartisan-group-of-39-senators-push-for-increased-action-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined a bipartisan group of 39 Senators in sending a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House officials urging increased funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) testing and remediation. The letter also calls to improve PFAS-related planning to make use of the higher funding levels Congress is willing to appropriate to address the pervasive issue.The Senators wrote, in part, “As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products.”The Senators went on to detail the findings of a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increase risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The Senators then continued to detail the robust amount of federal dollars provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure. They closed their letter by urging the administration to put greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants. The Senators wrote, “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.”The letter was led by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) and also signed by Senators Hassan (D-NH), Braun (R-IN), King (I-ME), Brown (D-OH), Blumenthal (D-CT), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), Peters (D-MI), Lujan (D-NM), Gillibrand (D-NY), Durbin (D-IL), Kaine (D-VA), Bennet (D-CO), Sinema (D-AZ), Murray (D-WA), Feinstein (D-CA), Booker (D-NJ), Warnock (D-GA), Padilla (D-CA), Casey (D-PA), Rosen (D-NV), Duckworth (D-IL), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Heinrich (D-NM), Kelly (D-AZ), Cantwell (D-WA), Cardin (D-MD), Ossoff (D-GA), Stabenow (D-MI), Schatz (D-HI), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sanders (I-VT), Leahy (D-VT), Manchin (D-WV), Wyden (D-OR), Merkley (D-OR), and Markey (D-MA).  Full text of the letter can be found here. ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-29-colleagues-in-urging-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined 29 of her Senate colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators.In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. In June, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities  from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.The letter was led by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and also signed by Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (D-IL), Durbin (D-IL), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Hirono (D-HI), Kaine (D-VA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Luján (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Padilla (D-CA), Reed (D-RI), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (I-VT), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Stabenow (D-MI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warner (D-VA), Warren (D-MA), and Wyden (D-OR).The Senators’ full letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Becerra:Since the Supreme Court’s decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion, patients across the country have lost access to reproductive health care, and providers have scrambled to adapt to the immense confusion, fear, and upheaval this ruling has caused. In some states, legislators and prosecutors have already sought to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. To protect patients, and their providers, from having their health information weaponized against them, we urge you to take immediate action to strengthen education on and enforcement of federal health privacy protections, and to initiate the rulemaking process to augment privacy protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.Every day, health care personnel across this nation care for patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This care may include anything from an annual check-up to obstetrical visits to emergency care. In order for patients to feel comfortable seeking care, and for health care personnel to provide this care, patients and providers must know that their personal health information, including information about their medical decisions, will be protected. Recognizing this critical need, in 1996, Congress passed HIPAA, which directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue privacy regulations for personal health information. HHS issued corresponding privacy regulations (the “HIPAA Privacy Rule”) in 2000, with several subsequent updates over the years.The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has caused widespread confusion among health care providers on health privacy protections, and whether they are required to turn over health information to state and local law enforcement. Stakeholders have told us about providers who have felt uncertain about whether they must turn over personal health information to state and law enforcement officials, including cases where providers believed they had to turn over information when doing so is only permitted—but not required—under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In other cases, providers did not know that certain disclosures are actually impermissible. Stakeholders have even described clashes between providers and health care system administrators on whether certain information must be shared. Many of these issues seem to arise from misunderstandings of what the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires of regulated entities and their employees.This confusion is likely to grow as state lawmakers continue to implement a patchwork of laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Already, some states have laws in effect criminalizing abortion providers, and some states have enacted laws that penalize anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion, potentially exposing everyone from a referring provider to a receptionist to legal liability. Some state legislators have even proposed to bar women from traveling to another state for abortion care. And even before Dobbs, states had already prosecuted women following their abortions or miscarriages. In many cases, these laws have been used to disproportionately criminalize or surveil women of color for their pregnancy loss.Actions to prohibit abortion access and undermine health privacy are likely to have devastating consequences for women’s health. Out of concern that their reproductive health information may be used against them, women may delay or avoid disclosing a pregnancy or obtaining prenatal care. They may fear initiating treatments for conditions like cancer or arthritis, where treatment could impact a pregnancy, even as health care providers may hesitate to provide them. And women who experience complications from a pregnancy or abortion may avoid seeking desperately needed emergency care, risking devastating health consequences and even death. These concerns are not without justification – in recent years, numerous medical providers have reported women to law enforcement for seeking care following an abortion, a miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related medical issue.HHS has the tools to protect patients and health care providers, even in the wake of this devastating decision. For over twenty years, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has protected the privacy of individuals’ health information, laying out when health information may or may not be shared without a patient’s explicit consent. In addition, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has long recognized that stronger protections may be needed for particularly sensitive health information, such as psychotherapy notes. We commend you for the actions the Department has already taken to clarify privacy protections in the wake of the Dobbs decision, including the issuance of additional guidance on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, given the growing likelihood that women’s personal health information may be used against them, HHS must also take proactive steps to strengthen patient privacy protections.To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information. In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.In addition, while HHS moves forward with the rulemaking process, the Department should take the following steps to improve awareness and enforcement of current privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule:Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-calls-on-la-private-equity-firm-to-restore-health-coverage-pay-for-hufcor-workers-in-wisconsin,"Janesville, Wis. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) sent a letter today to Andrew Nikou, founder and CEO of OpenGate Capital, asking the Los Angeles-based private equity firm to honor their agreement with former Hufcor employees in Wisconsin. After laying off all 166 workers at Hufcor’s Janesville plant, OpenGate Capital drove the company into bankruptcy leaving workers without health coverage and pay they were promised.“As a result of your mismanagement, dozens of former Hufcor workers—some of whom have life-threatening illnesses—are without health coverage,” wrote Senator Baldwin. “Others never received the retention bonuses they were promised in exchange for continuing to work for the company after you announced that the Janesville facility would be closing.”Hufcor was an integral part of the Janesville community for nearly 120 years. In stark contrast, OpenGate Capital has a history of shutting down businesses and giving workers pink slips in Wisconsin. In 2013, OpenGate Capital shut down the Golden Guernsey plant in Waukesha and laid off workers.“I write to ask you, as the CEO of OpenGate Capital, to stand by the agreement your portfolio company negotiated with its employees,” Senator Baldwin continued. “Restore their health coverage, pay them for the work they’ve done, and make them whole for any losses they’ve suffered as a result of the bankruptcy that you caused.”In 2021, Senator Baldwin met with Hufcor workers in Janesville who were facing layoffs and penned a letter to Mr. Nikou questioning the private equity firm’s plan to shut down the Janesville manufacturing plant and lay off Wisconsin workers. Senator Baldwin has taken a strong stance against the predatory private equity industry, introducing the Stop Wall Street Looting Act  to level the playing field by forcing private investment firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over.Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below.Dear Mr. Nikou,I write to you again on behalf of the 166 former employees of the Hufcor manufacturing plant in Janesville, Wisconsin. As I feared, these workers lost their jobs because your Los Angeles-based private equity firm, OpenGate Capital, shut down their Wisconsin facility in an attempt to outsource their jobs to Mexico.Making matters worse, Hufcor has now been driven into bankruptcy, rendering the agreement between the company and its workers—which included a requirement to provide the separated workers health insurance—worthless. As a result of your mismanagement, dozens of former Hufcor workers—some of whom have life-threatening illnesses—are without health coverage. Others never received the retention bonuses they were promised in exchange for continuing to work for the company after you announced that the Janesville facility would be closing.I write to ask you, as the CEO of OpenGate Capital, to stand by the agreement your portfolio company negotiated with its employees. Restore their health coverage, pay them for the work they’ve done, and make them whole for any losses they’ve suffered as a result of the bankruptcy that you caused.In the letter I sent you in June of 2021, I relayed the accounts of Hufcor workers who I met with in Janesville last year. Unfortunately, many of the fears they shared with me then have come true. I have heard from Michelle and Jeff, both of whom worked at Hufcor and had dreams of retiring there. They are currently without health coverage and unable to get medications they need. They are unable to continue saving for their child’s college education and are working new, lower-paying jobs.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-hoeven-call-on-fema-to-distribute-funds-to-inland-states-for-climate-resilient-infrastructure,"Senators Baldwin, Hoeven Call on FEMA to Distribute Funds to Inland States for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve the funding distribution from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program for non-coastal states for climate-resilient infrastructure. In the program’s first two years of funding, coastal states often had an unfair advantage over inland ones in the application cycle, resulting in the lack of resiliency funding for inland states. “Wisconsin communities have been hit hard by repeated storms, flooding and severe weather events, and I’ve seen firsthand how these storms have washed out roads and damaged our highways and bridges, threatening Wisconsinites’ ability to get to work, to get their goods to market and to keep our economy moving forward. As the climate crisis brings more extreme weather, I’m working to ensure our communities are given a fair chance at receiving the resources needed to protect themselves from future severe weather events like flooding,” said Senator Baldwin. “The distribution of funding from the BRIC program cannot leave non-coastal states like ours behind. Federal help for Wisconsin communities to build stronger and more climate resilient infrastructure is a top priority for me, and we need modifications to this program to ensure that the distribution of resources provides inland states the necessary tools to combat severe weather events with resilient infrastructure that is built to last.”“ASFPM supports efforts to modify BRIC to not only recognize and reward state floodplain management standards that go beyond NFIP minimums delivering more effective flood loss reduction than even the most modern building codes, but also to recognize that all states and territories have critical hazard mitigation priorities, Increasing the state set-aside can bring more balance to the BRIC program and ensure that state priorities are being met. We applaud Senator Baldwin and Senator Hoeven’s efforts to shed light on this issue,” said Chad Berginnis, Association of State Floodplain Managers Executive Director.Full text of the letter can be found below or here.Dear Administrator Criswell:Thank you for your ongoing work to protect communities across the country from severe natural disasters. As your agency considers future rounds of funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, we ask that you consider modifications to the program so that all states, communities, and tribes--particularly inland communities--are able to compete for mitigation funds in order to take the steps needed to protect their communities from future severe weather events like flooding. As part of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA), Congress provided significant resources to pre-disaster mitigation, recognizing the positive return on investment from mitigation activities.[1] To administer the funds, FEMA created BRIC to replace the Pre-disaster Mitigation (PDM) program. Although Congress did not prescribe priority changes in DRRA from the agency’s previous mitigation efforts in the PDM program, FEMA created a new set of priorities to implement the BRIC.We are concerned that the technical criteria put forth by FEMA has placed inland communities at a serious disadvantage for this program. Based on an evaluation of the awards, there appears to be a significant bias towards coastal over non-coastal states. In both rounds of funding, a significant majority of the number of projects and levels of funding have gone to coastal states rather than non-coastal ones. In the first round of funding, no competitive grants were awarded in FEMA Regions 5, 6, 7, or 8, and only one project in a non-coastal state was successful in receiving competitive funds.[2] In the second round, out of the 53 applications selected, there was only one successful application in FEMA Regions 5, 6, and 7. Further, over 65% of the money for projects in non-coastal states went to only one state, leaving the rest of non-coastal states to receive under 10% of the competitive funds.While we strongly support the program’s goals to strengthen the resiliency of states, territories, tribes, and communities, we are concerned that technical criteria will continue to take a narrow approach to recognizing resilience efforts and give preference towards communities with certain mitigation practices, particularly those within states, territories, and tribes that have adopted recent versions of the International Building Code (IBC) and the International Residential Code (IRC), while ignoring other categories like state floodplain management practices that go above federal minimums established in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), participation in the Community Rating System (CRS) or Firewise USA,[3] and other important aspects of comprehensive state mitigation programs.[4] For example, Wisconsin, along with 14 other states, earned FEMA’s approval for an enhanced state mitigation plan, yet applicants within the state were not recognized for this work when applying for competitive BRIC grants.[5] Further, states with strong hazard mitigation offices, like Wisconsin, are also constantly working with sub-applicants to prevent subpar applications being filed to FEMA and ensure federal dollars are spent wisely on resiliency projects, as evidenced by effectively using PDM dollars in years past.We remain concerned that future rounds of BRIC funding will continue to demonstrate a heavy bias toward projects in coastal states at the expense of non-coastal ones. To ensure more inland communities are able to take the mitigation measures necessary to protect themselves from future disasters, we urge you take appropriate steps to ensure a more equitable distribution of competitive grant funding to inland communities. As part of this change, we ask that you consider other mitigation practices, like land use practices, hazard-specific zoning practices, and enhanced statewide mitigation plans, to provide a more complete assessment of the efforts already taken by non-coastal states. Finally, we believe you should consider raising the state/territory and tribal set-aside allocations in BRIC in order to give states, territories, and tribes the resources they need to respond to the mitigation priorities of their local communities.We ask you to consider modifications to the program and that you engage with non-coastal states and communities, hazard mitigation officials and organizations, and Members of Congress representing non-coastal states to ensure their voices are at the table during those considerations. We look forward to working with you to ensure communities across the country are prepared to meet the challenge of more frequent and severe natural disasters to come.Sincerely, ###"

The bipartisan legislation comes amid a spike in use of the hotline that launched in July, with a 45 percent increase in calls in August 2022 compared to August 2021. The 988 Coordination and Improvement Act would help coordinate the work of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) when it comes to providing behavioral health crisis care, promote access to specialized services for high-risk populations, and allow for appropriate oversight of the 988 Lifeline.The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline was made possible by Senator Baldwin’s National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, bipartisan legislation that passed Congress and went into effect nationwide this summer. The 988 Lifeline is a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the United States. 988 has already allowed thousands of individuals of all ages who are experiencing a crisis—whether that is thoughts of suicide, a mental health concern or substance use issue, or any other kind of emotional distress—to get help for themselves or a loved one by connecting them with a trained crisis counselor. “Mental health crises and suicide impact every community across the country and the 988 Lifeline is already showing promise in reaching more Americans who are suffering,” said Senator Baldwin. “After working to get my bipartisan legislation signed into law and launched, this legislation will strengthen the 988 Lifeline and help ensure the call centers have the support needed to give people the timely care and services they want and need.”“When Americans experiencing a mental health crisis and in need of emotional support reach out for help, it is vital that we make sure someone is there to listen, provide resources, and send assistance immediately if needed,” said Senator Collins.  “The 988 Lifeline is an invaluable tool that has saved countless lives.  By improving coordination, enhancing oversight, and expanding access to services for high-risk populations, our legislation would strengthen the hotline to ensure that more Americans can receive timely, effective assistance.”“Senator Baldwin’s 988 Coordination and Improvement Act provides much needed access to resources that will strengthen state crisis care systems and support the implementation of best practices. The bill also aligns with Wisconsin’s efforts to ensure that people who are at higher risk for a behavioral health crisis can get crisis care when they need it most. I applaud Senator Baldwin for introducing this bill to help build crisis care and suicide prevention infrastructure for all states,” said Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Karen Timberlake.“In the face of a growing national mental health crisis, it is essential that the newly launched 988 lifeline is supported with the infrastructure and resources required to provide safe, accessible, and equitable care to serve those in need,” said Preston Mitchum (he/him), Director of Advocacy and Government Affairs at The Trevor Project. “The Trevor Project's 2022 National Survey found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year — yet 3 in 5 could not access the mental health care they desired. This bill will help enhance oversight and coordination of the 988 Lifeline while ensuring access to specialized services for high-risk populations, such as LGBTQ individuals. Thank you to Senator Baldwin for prioritizing the improvement of our nation’s crisis care system and for introducing this critical legislation.”The 988 Coordination and Improvement Act would:The 988 Coordination and Improvement Act is supported by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Children’s Wisconsin, Community Medical Services, Crisis Text Line, Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the Trevor Project, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness, Vibrant Emotional Health, Pathfinders Milwaukee, Black Space, and Office of Milwaukee County Executive.A summary of the legislation is available here.Full text of the legislation is available here.### "

The Survivor Outreach and Support on Campus Act, or S.O.S. Campus Act, would require every college and university that receives federal funding to have an independent advocate dedicated to campus sexual assault prevention and response.  “As Wisconsin students are back on campuses, I am working to ensure our universities are equipped to prevent sexual assault and support the brave survivors,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our legislation will make sure sexual assault survivors have access to the proper medical, mental health, and legal services they need at our places of higher education.”  Sexual violence on college campuses is largely underreported. A 2020 report published by the Association for American Universities (AAU) found that 13% of graduate and undergraduate students have experienced rape or sexual assault. Among undergraduate students, AAU found that 26.4% of females and 6.8% percent of males experienced rape or sexual assault. Previous studies have shown that more than 50% of college sexual assaults occur between August and November.  The S.O.S. Campus Act would require the independent advocate to conduct public information campaigns on sexual assault prevention and ensure survivors of sexual assault have access to:Local rape crisis centers and other community-based organizations are currently providing many of these services in communities and on campuses around the nation. The legislation recognizes the importance of these partnerships by requiring that universities either consult with or partner with these organizations to ensure that survivors get the services they need.  The S.O.S. Campus Act is led by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and is cosponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI).   Full text of the legislation is available here.###"

The legislation will improve State Opioid Response (SOR) grants – an important tool for communities’ comprehensive response to this public health crisis epidemic – by providing additional investments in and flexibility for states and Tribal communities.  “As the opioid and substance use disorder crisis continues to plague American families, I am working to ensure local and Tribal communities have the resources and flexibility they need to support prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts,” said Senator Baldwin. “Washington needs to step up and better address the opioid and use disorder crisis, and this legislation helps strengthen the partnership with state and local communities and helps them effectively respond to this epidemic.”“For years, the State Opioid Response Grant Program has been an essential tool for states like New Hampshire that are on the frontlines of this crisis. That’s precisely why I’ve worked to create flexibility within the program to adapt to how this epidemic evolved over the years. And that’s why I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Baldwin to authorize the lifesaving SOR grant program to continue providing resources and flexibility to fight this scourge,” said Senator Shaheen. “We cannot take our eyes off the substance misuse crisis, and I’ll keep fighting to ensure New Hampshire gets its fair share of resources to protect future generations from succumbing to addiction.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 100,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States during the 12-month period ending in April 2021.Specifically, the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act would:“I support Senator Baldwin’s proposed legislation that will provide states and tribal nations with additional resources under the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act. By expanding state opioid response grants to allow these funds to also address the use and misuse of stimulants, we will be able to build a stronger prevention, treatment, and recovery system of care for people who need these services. I applaud Senator Baldwin’s strategy to ensure funding for communities that have been hit the hardest by overdose fatalities,” said Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Karen Timberlake.“The SAMHSA State Opioid Response grant program has proven to be a vital tool in our nation’s ongoing struggle to address opioid and substance use disorders, providing critical support for evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery support services,” said American Psychiatric Association CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A.. “In providing this essential program with enhanced funding and flexibility, the State Opioid Response Authorization Act would help to immediately reduce unmet treatment needs across the country, and critically, reduce overdose-related deaths. The American Psychiatric Association enthusiastically supports this important legislation and urges Congress to swiftly take it up for consideration.”“Saving lives from the scourge of the opioid epidemic is an issue that should receive support from both sides of the aisle. Opioid addiction doesn’t distinguish between your political affiliation, age, race, or zip code. Since the onset of the pandemic, we’ve seen an increase in demand for life-saving resources from both first responders and families in neighborhoods across Milwaukee County. I’m glad Senator Baldwin understands the urgent need for resources and is introducing important legislation to help communities like ours respond to the opioid crisis and save lives,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.The State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act is supported by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, Connecticut Certification Board, Faces and Voices of Recovery, International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC), Addiction Professionals of North Carolina, California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Providers (CCAPP), CADA of Northwest Louisiana, Milwaukee County Office of the County Executive, American Psychiatric Association, Drug Policy Alliance, and Wisconsin Department of Health Services.The legislation comes a week after Senator Baldwin introduced the Naloxone Education and Access Act to increase states and Tribal communities’ access to life-saving opioid overdoses reversal drugs like naloxone, the medication that can reverse overdoses from heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids.

For the first time, the USCG Authorization Act will also include a standalone Great Lakes subtitle in the bill. The only other geographic area that has a standalone section is the Arctic. This section includes:“Our United States Coast Guard members protect and secure our Great Lakes and are a crucial piece to keeping Wisconsin’s maritime economy moving forward,” said Senator Baldwin. “Inadequate icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes costs us thousands of American jobs and millions in business revenue, and this bipartisan legislation invests in the icebreaking resources needed to support our maritime industry and our Made in America economy. This critical legislation will help mitigate devastating climate-related events, invest in climate resilient Coast Guard infrastructure at places like Sturgeon Bay and will increase support for childcare, housing, and education needed to do right by our service members and veterans.”“The Coast Guard keeps our maritime economy moving and our ports and waterways secure. This bill makes the investments needed to support that core mission, and will also help the Coast Guard crack down on illegal fishing, improve oil spill response, and bolster our nation’s presence in the Arctic,” said Senator Cantwell. “The bill also invests in the Coast Guard’s most valuable resource: its people. We must expand training and education opportunities for Coasties and improve housing, childcare, and medical services so that the Coast Guard can recruit and retain a cutting edge and diverse workforce.”“The American people depend on the U.S. Coast Guard now more than ever,” said Senator Wicker. “The Coast Guard can always be counted on to save American lives, protect our homeland, and keep maritime transportation flowing safely, but it is time we do better for our service members.

In Wisconsin, nearly 415,000 people live in 13 counties that have been assigned to an out-of-state market, in either Minnesota or Michigan.Senator Baldwin’s Go Pack Go Act would require cable, satellite and other video providers to provide their Wisconsin subscribers with access to programming from the broadcast television stations in a Wisconsin media market. The legislation ensures that every Wisconsin cable or satellite subscriber who lives in these 13 counties has the choice of receiving an in-state broadcast for every major network, so they would always have access to Wisconsin based news, information and sports, including Packers games.Packers fans in the following Wisconsin counties would benefit from Senator Baldwin’s Go Pack Go Act: Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland, Iron and Sawyer Counties in the Duluth-Superior media market; Burnett, Washburn, Polk, Barron, St. Croix, Dunn and Pierce Counties in the Twin Cities media market; and Florence County in the Marquette, Michigan media market.More information about Senator Baldwin’s Go Pack Go Act is available here.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-joins-colleagues-to-introduce-the-nationwide-right-to-unionize-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) to reintroduce the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, legislation that would support the right to unionize by prohibiting states from banning union security agreements through “right-to-work” laws.Twenty-seven states including Wisconsin have enacted “right-to-work” laws that prevent unions from collecting dues from non-union members who are covered under a union-negotiated contract. These laws make it more difficult for workers to form unions and fight for higher wages and better working conditions in the states that adopt them, resulting in a 5% decrease in unionization rates and a decrease in average wages for all full-time workers of 3.1%, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, or about $11,000 a year, according to a report released by Rep. Sherman’s office. This bill was originally introduced in 2017 as the Protecting Workers and Improving Labor Standards Act and again in 2020. A similar proposal is included in the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which the lawmakers support and would protect American workers’ right to organize and negotiate for better wages and working conditions.“Wisconsin has a proud tradition of respecting hard work and rewarding it by giving workers a strong voice,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to stand with labor unions and this legislation will strengthen the economic security of working families and move Wisconsin’s tradition of supporting workers forward.”“Republicans and their corporate interest backers have imposed state laws with only one goal: destroy unions and discourage workers from organizing for higher wages, fair benefits, and safer working conditions,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren. “At a time when labor unions are growing in both size, popularity, and delivering real wins for workers, Democrats are making clear that we stand in solidarity with workers everywhere, from Starbucks baristas to Google cafeteria workers and everyone in between.”“So called ‘right-to-work’ laws are designed to make it difficult to organize a union,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “This impacts not only workers who want a union – but general wage levels throughout the state. In an ill-conceived effort to attract business, one state after another has adopted these anti-union laws in a race to the bottom. That is why today I’m proud to partner with Senator Warren to reintroduce the National Right to Unionize Act – legislation I’ve introduced in every session of Congress since 2008.”This legislation is also co-sponsored by Senators Duckworth (D-Ill.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Luján (D-N.M.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Booker (D-N.J.), Markey (D-Mass.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Hassan (D-N.H.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Cardin (D-Md.), Brown (D-Ohio), Hirono (D-Hawai’i), and Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Representatives Lynch (D-Mass.), Norton (D-DC), Garamendi (D-Calif.), Cárdenas (D-Calif.), Swalwell (D-Calif.), Moulton (D-Mass.), Speier (D-Calif.), Raskin (D-Md.), Brownley (D-Calif.), Kildee (D-Mich.), Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Jayapal (D-Wash.).It has received support from the following advocacy and expert organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Steelworkers, Transport Workers Union of America, International Union of Operating Engineers, Communications Workers of America Union, Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, International Association of Machinists, United Food & Commercial Workers Union, and Aerospace Workers, Economic Policy Institute, Worker Power Coalition, and National Employment Law Project.The full bill text is available here. ###"

The legislation provides grants to states and Tribal entities to promote education, dispensing and distribution of opioid overdose reversal drugs and devices.“The opioid epidemic and substance use disorder crisis continues to touch every community across the country. Along with focusing on prevention and treatment for substance use disorder, combating drug trafficking, and providing support for individuals and families impacted by this epidemic, we also must provide the life-saving drugs that reverse overdoses and poisoning,” said Senator Baldwin. “This legislation is an important step forward to give communities the tools and resources they need to save lives.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than 100,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States during a 12-month period ending in April 2021, an increase of 28.5% from the same period the year before.

Reducing harm from opioid use is a necessary step toward our greater goal of saving lives and helping people with substance use disorder get on the path to treatment and recovery.""“The Ho-Chunk Nation is evidence that health professionals providing Naloxone and training saves lives. Naloxone can help keep someone alive while treatment facilities are unavailable because they already exceed capacity. Opioid addiction doesn’t discriminate but access to resources will determine whether or not someone will live long enough to recover. The Ho Chunk Nation appreciates Sen. Baldwin introducing this key legislation,” said Ho Chunk Nation Vice President Karena Thundercloud.“Ending opioid deaths is an issue that deserves bipartisan support. The opioid epidemic reaches communities in all parts of the state – it crosses all socio-economic, demographic and age ranges. Since the onset of the pandemic, we’ve seen an increased demand for life-saving opioid overdose reversal drugs and devices here in Milwaukee County. Thank you to Senator Baldwin for introducing this important piece of legislation which will help communities like ours access these essential tools and save lives,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.“Equitable and cost-effective strategies to increase access to all forms of naloxone is the next step in addressing the opioid overdose and addiction epidemics,” said Jesse Heffernan, RCP, of Appleton, Wisconsin, a recovery coach and person in recovery. “Naloxone should be in every household, business and campuses across the country in the same way we have smoke detectors, AEDs, and first AID Kits. When families and individuals are equipped with it, people are given opportunities to move into recovery and treatment. Overdose is preventable and reversible. Thank you to Senator Baldwin and her colleagues for her important leadership in increasing access to naloxone.”The Naloxone Education and Access Act is supported by Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Big Cities Health Coalition, Ho-Chunk Nation, Milwaukee County, Helios Recovery, Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, National Alliance on Mental Illness, NASTAD, and National Community Pharmacists Association.Earlier this year, Senator Baldwin led a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers in sending letters to seven major manufacturers of naloxone urging them to apply for over the counter (OTC) status for their products. Despite the effectiveness of naloxone to reverse active opioid overdoses and the Food and Drug Administration’s public support for making the product available over the counter, the medication is not currently available over the counter because drug manufacturers have resisted applying.

I was proud to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act to support our producers who are moving our Made in Wisconsin economy forward with home grown energy,” said Senator Baldwin. “I’ve been a proud advocate for Wisconsin’s strong biofuels industry and will continue my work to provide certainty for our farmers and our Made In Wisconsin renewable fuels economy, so we can maintain and create more good paying jobs in small towns and rural communities like Necedah.”“Marquis Energy – Wisconsin was honored to host Senator Baldwin today to share more about ethanol’s important role for rural economies. Thoughtful climate policies, like the Inflation Reduction Act, will help drive further innovation and incentivize the industry to continue to decarbonize, reducing global greenhouse gas emissions,” said Dustin Marquis, Director of Government Relations & Employee Outreach at Marquis Energy. “Marquis Energy appreciates the Senator’s continued advocacy for biofuels, for agriculture, and for Wisconsin.”“Ethanol offers a positive energy balance. The amount of energy used to produce ethanol has decreased including the amount used by our Wisconsin corn growers to actually grow the corn,” said James Giese, Director at Wisconsin Corn Growers Association from Alma Center. “Marquis Energy along with the seven other ethanol plants in Wisconsin, give our local farmers a way to contribute to a sustainable future.”Senator Baldwin supported The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law today. The law provides a once-in-a-generation investment in a suite of renewable energy options, including biofuels. The legislation extends tax incentives for the biofuels industry which increases the demand for ethanol and reduces energy costs for Americans for years to come. The bill also invests $500 million in building out our biofuels infrastructure so retailers and consumers can get greater access at the pump.Earlier this year, Senator Baldwin co-sponsored the bipartisan Defend the Blend Act, legislation to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from reducing the minimum applicable volume of biofuels that must be blended into transportation fuel once those levels, known as Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), are finalized for any given year. This legislation would ensure corn growers and ethanol producers, like Marquis, have marketplace certainty for their product.Ethanol production in Wisconsin generates $4.2 billion in economic activity, impacting 19,000 jobs, with $982 million in wages according to the Wisconsin Corn Growers. The Marquis Energy plant in Necedah has a 106 million gallons-per-year capacity output.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-moore-pocan-and-kind-request-resources-for-wisconsin-to-respond-to-monkeypox-crisis,"Wisconsin Democratic delegation highlighted the disproportionate impact on the LGBTQ+ community and need to reduce stigmatizationWISCONSIN – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Representatives Gwen Moore (D-WI-04), Mark Pocan (D-WI-02), and Ron Kind (D-WI-03) requested that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provide additional resources for the state of Wisconsin to respond to the monkeypox outbreak, including vaccines. With the virus disproportionately impacting members of the LGBTQ+ community, the Wisconsin democratic delegation urged HHS and CDC to work with stakeholders and members of the LGBTQ+ community to reduce stigmatization and misinformation.   “Although the risk of widespread transmission remains low, it is essential that we have supplies on hand to both prevent new cases and provide care for those who contract this virus,” said the members of Congress. “Unfortunately, nationwide, access to testing remains a challenge, which has prevented us from having a full understanding of the reach and spread of this virus. This is unacceptable. It is imperative that the Administration act without delay to remove barriers to testing to help us better understand how monkeypox is spreading nationally.”Full text of the letter can be found below or here.  Dear Secretary Becerra, Director Walensky, and Assistant Secretary O’Connell,  Following the declaration of a public health emergency for monkeypox on August 4 by Secretary Becerra, we write to request additional resources for the state of Wisconsin, including additional vaccine doses. Further, we request that the Administration continue to prioritize outreach and public education, conducted in close collaboration with the LGBTQ+ community to prevent stigmatization.As of August 11, 2022, the state of Wisconsin had identified 38 cases of orthopoxvirus, presumed to be monkeypox. Although the risk of widespread transmission remains low, it is essential that we have supplies on hand to both prevent new cases and provide care for those who contract this virus. Unfortunately, nationwide, access to testing remains a challenge, which has prevented us from having a full understanding of the reach and spread of this virus. This is unacceptable. It is imperative that the Administration act without delay to remove barriers to testing to help us better understand how monkeypox is spreading nationally.In addition, we must capitalize on the availability of a vaccine. Unlike COVID-19, we already have an FDA-licensed vaccine indicated for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox that can also serve as a post-exposure prophylactic. Further, the state of Wisconsin has been able to effectively utilize the “hub and spoke” model for COVID-19 vaccine distribution to make monkeypox vaccines available to those at high risk. Demand for the vaccine, however, far outpaces the state’s allotment. We are concerned by the reported missteps that have contributed to delays in making distributions to states and jurisdictions, resulting in limited access to vaccine doses. Although we support efforts to extend vaccine availability, more clinical research is needed to ensure the safety of the new intradermal vaccine protocol, and more communication and training must be done to ensure that vaccines are administered safely. State officials and vaccinators need more information about this update, as well as reliable information regarding when and how many additional doses of vaccine will be allocated. Further, there needs to be more public education to mitigate apprehension regarding this method of administration, and to provide information regarding safety and effectiveness. As of August 12, 2022, the state of Wisconsin had been allocated enough vaccine doses for less than 3,400 residents. This is a fraction of the state’s demand. We need more doses, and we need HHS to exercise all available authorities to make sure that individuals at increased risk are protected.Finally, it is essential that the Administration’s response to the outbreak of monkeypox be informed by stakeholders and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Although monkeypox can infect anyone, the virus has had a disproportionate impact on men who have sex with men (MSM). Numerous reports indicate that individuals have faced significant obstacles in accessing testing and treatment, and a recent CNN investigation revealed that large commercial laboratories were denying drawing blood from patients who might have the virus. As you know, health care services are too often inaccessible for members of at-risk communities, and these reports are all too reminiscent of the nation’s initial response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We must address this crisis, and those at the highest levels of government must make clear that stigma and misinformation will only allow the virus to spread further.Sincerely,###"

The SEC created the 10b5-1 “safe harbor” in 2000 to allow corporate executives, who often have continuous access to material nonpublic information about their companies, to sell their stock holdings without running afoul of insider trading laws. However, initial trades set up by 10b5-1 plans often appear to be based on material nonpublic information, and executives can and do modify or cancel their plans in response to inside information to increase their own profits.  “While these plans were designed to prevent insider trading, evidence indicates that corporate insiders have misused them to obtain huge windfalls making questionable trades at the expense of ordinary investors,” wrote the lawmakers. “We urge you to consider additional, strong rules that would prevent these abusive practices and protect the integrity of our capital markets, and that you implement them without delay.” A recent report in the Wall Street Journal identified “scores of examples where company insiders adopted a plan when a quarter was nearly complete and sold stock under the plan before that quarter’s results were announced,” and found that “insiders who sold within 60 days reaped $500 million more in profits than they would have if they sold three months later,” indicating that the abuse of 10b5-1 plans is widespread and costly, further underscoring the urgent need for stronger rules.  “Corporate insiders cannot be allowed to continue to trade based on insiders’ knowledge with impunity,” wrote the lawmakers. “The SEC must act swiftly to ensure that Rule 10b5-1 is no longer 'viewed as a ‘get out-of-jail-free card.’”  The lawmakers are also encouraging the SEC to consider strengthening its proposed rule by:“If corporate insiders were willing to profit off of their own failed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, they will likely continue to exploit safe harbor rules to line their own pockets,” concluded the lawmakers. “The SEC should consider all options to prevent all such abuses and finally level the playing field for ordinary investors.”  Full text of the letter is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-visits-schneider-in-green-bay-to-discuss-expanding-women-in-trucking,"GREEN BAY – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin visited Schneider in Green Bay to discuss initiatives to get more women into the trucking industry. In 2019, Senator Baldwin introduced the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act to support women in the trucking industry, which passed as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“In Wisconsin, we make things, and we need to ensure we have a strong workforce to transport our goods to market. Together with companies like Schneider, we can create more job opportunities for Wisconsin women to provide more economic security for working families and strengthen our supply chain,” said Senator Baldwin. “Women currently make up less than 15 percent of the truck driving workforce, and removing the barriers that get in the way of women pursuing and retaining careers in trucking is key.”“We are committed to supporting and advancing careers for women in transportation,” said Schneider Executive Vice President of Human Resources Angela Fish. “We are extremely proud that the number of women in driver and leadership roles at Schneider has increased across our organization. That is a trend we expect to continue and will work hard to remove obstacles and elevate women in our industry.” Currently, women make up 47 percent of the United States’ labor force, yet represent 24 percent of America’s trucking workforce and only about 13 percent of drivers. In 2019, Baldwin introduced the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act to support women in the trucking industry and direct the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to establish a “Women of Trucking Advisory Board.” The legislation was passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, signed into law last year. The board will identify barriers to entry for women in the trucking industry, work across organizations and companies to coordinate formal education and training programs and help identify and establish training and mentorship programs for women in the industry.Schneider is a premier multimodal provider of transportation, intermodal and logistics services. Offering one of the broadest portfolios in the industry, Schneider’s solutions include Regional and Long-Haul Truckload, Expedited, Dedicated, Bulk, Intermodal, Brokerage, Warehousing, Supply Chain Management, Port Logistics and Logistics Consulting. ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-pushes-for-stronger-federal-response-to-monkeypox-public-health-emergency,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is urging a more robust federal response to the ongoing Monkeypox Public Health Emergency.Senator Baldwin joined a group of senators led by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) urging the Senate to include critical funding to address the monkeypox (MPV)/orthopoxvirus Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. In their letter, the Senators spotlight that the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting constituents to necessary medical care and resources. Yet this system continues to be strained by the COVID-19 pandemic and underfunded. “MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner,” the Senators wrote. “Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.” Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jack Reed (D-RI), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also signed the letter, which can be found here.As more MPV cases spring up across the country, Senator Baldwin also joined a group of Senators led by U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) in a letter urging the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell to improve MPV awareness and education among the general public and health care providers.Many providers currently lack familiarity in identifying and treating MPV infections, resulting in some patients seeing multiple health care professionals in order to be tested. This may lead to an increased infection risk for patients and increased spread within their families and providers.In the letter, the Senators write, “Our response to COVID-19 highlighted the importance of clear and early communication from public health experts. It’s imperative that we apply this lesson to improve MPV awareness and education among the general public and health care providers.”The Senators are also calling on the CDC and HHS to ensure that the general public understands that MPV can spread among any population through direct contact with lesions, use of shared objects, and respiratory secretions in extended periods of close contact. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) also signed the letter, which can be found here.These letters come less than a month after Baldwin joined 22 colleagues on a separate letter sounding the alarm on MPV vaccine access inequities."

I voted for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and supported these projects through the appropriations process to put people to work rebuilding our infrastructure,” said Senator Baldwin. “Bringing this federal funding home to Wisconsin delivers more results for communities across our state.”The following Wisconsin communities will receive support: The RAISE Discretionary Grant program invests in road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve national objectives. The program was formerly known as the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants. Senator Baldwin supported the two pieces of legislation that fund RAISE Discretionary Grants. The Infrastructure Innovation and Jobs Act included $1.5 billion for this program for 2022. Additionally, $775 million was designated for RAISE Grants in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-and-ernst-reintroduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-and-expand-rural-internet-access-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) reintroduced bipartisan legislation to protect and expand access to high-speed internet in our rural communities and encourage investment in rural broadband. The legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND).The Access to Capital Creates Economic Strength and Supports (ACCESS) Rural America Act would provide regulatory relief to rural telecommunications service providers by allowing them to submit streamlined financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These small companies—many of which are the sole service providers in their region—could be put out of business by looming regulatory costs. Specifically, this bipartisan legislation would increase the number of investors that triggers SEC public reporting requirements for rural telecommunications companies. This will save these small companies from costly SEC reporting requirements that were never intended for them.“Reliable high-speed broadband is essential to Wisconsin families, students, small businesses, and farmers. Unfortunately, rural telecom companies are getting hit with costly reporting fees that are intended for much larger companies, threatening to upend their business and stop the vital service they provide to their communities,” said Senator Baldwin. “This bipartisan legislation will ease the burdensome regulations for small broadband service providers, helping our efforts to ensure that all Wisconsinites have access to high speed internet, regardless of where they live.”“Access to high-speed internet and quality broadband services is crucial to families, small businesses and communities in rural Iowa. And yet, our rural telecom providers are hindered by bureaucracy, making it more difficult to invest and expand broadband access. This bipartisan effort cuts that red-tape and unleashes our local telecom companies to make quality internet available in every corner of the state, and across the country,” said Senator Ernst.  “Federal Securities and Exchange Commission registration and reporting requirements intended for larger, publicly-traded firms pose significant challenges for, and can impose substantial burdens on, smaller, locally-owned companies with limited resources.  NTCA therefore greatly appreciates the leadership of Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Joni Ernst, Kyrsten Sinema, and Kevin Cramer in introducing the ACCESS Rural America Act, which will help relieve these burdens and enable small providers to focus more on their core mission of deploying and operating advanced broadband networks in rural areas,” said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO of NTCA–The Rural Broadband Association.The legislation is supported by the Wisconsin State Telecommunications Association.Full text of the legislation is available here.### "

This letter comes ahead of the deadline set by the President Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services.  For more than two decades, people have used Mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion. Years of research have shown that medication abortion is both safe and effective, and medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all abortions nationwide. Right-wing state legislatures across the country have passed laws banning the use of FDA-approved medication, further stripping away women’s access to abortion care and undermining the FDA’s authority to protect the nation’s public health.  In response to the Supreme Court’s devastating decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned nearly 50 years of judicial precedent, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing HHS to take action to protect access to medication abortion and to submit a report on those efforts within 30 days, which is this Sunday, August, 2022. Recommendations offered by the lawmakers could help the administration reach this goal.  In the letter, the lawmakers commended President Biden’s executive order and outlined seven powerful steps that HHS could take in accordance with President Biden’s order to expand  access to medication abortion: “We support your efforts to take all possible actions to protect abortion access, and as you work to meet this goal, we urge you to consider these options, which we believe will have the greatest impact on expanding access to medication abortion across the nation,” concluded the lawmakers.

As climate change brings more extreme weather, we need to make sure that when we rebuild our infrastructure, that we are not only using American workers and American-made products, but also that we are rebuilding stronger infrastructure that is more resilient to damage from flooding, extreme weather and natural disasters,’ said Senator Baldwin. “This federal investment from the infrastructure law will help Wisconsin communities build stronger and more climate resilient infrastructure that will better withstand extreme weather events. This federal funding for Wisconsin will help make sure our infrastructure is built to last and save taxpayer dollars.”In an ongoing effort to combat the effects of climate change and address the growing costs of extreme weather events negatively impacting communities, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced new guidance and $7.3 billion in PROTECT Formula Program funding to help states and communities better prepare for and respond to extreme weather events like flooding, extreme heat, and wildfires. This is a first-of-its-kind program, made possible by infrastructure law that Senator Baldwin voted for.The new PROTECT Formula Program funding is available to states over five years to make transportation infrastructure more resilient to future weather events and other natural disasters by focusing on resilience planning, making resilience improvements to existing transportation assets and evacuation routes, and addressing at-risk highway infrastructure.  In general, eligible projects include highway and transit projects, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and port facilities including those that help improve evacuations or disaster relief.  States are encouraged to work with regional and local partner organizations to prioritize transportation and emergency response improvements, as well as address vulnerabilities.Eligible resilience improvements can involve adapting existing transportation infrastructure or new construction to keep communities safe by bolstering infrastructure’s ability to withstand extreme weather events and other physical hazards that are becoming more common and intense. Eligible project choices may include the use of natural or green infrastructure to buffer future storm surges and provide flood protection, as well as aquatic ecosystem restoration. PROTECT projects can also help improve the resilience of transportation networks that serve traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities, particularly during natural disasters and evacuations.PROTECT builds on other USDOT actions to address the climate crisis and that support the Biden Administration’s whole-of-government approach to reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 2030.  Other USDOT actions include a proposed rule for states and municipalities to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the Carbon Reduction Program, which will provide $6.4 billion in formula funding to states and local governments to develop carbon reduction strategies; and the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which will provide $5 billion to states to build out a national electric vehicle charging network, an important step towards making electric vehicle charging accessible to all Americans.For more information about the new PROTECT Formula Program and guidance, please see FHWA's website and fact sheet. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act established both the PROTECT Formula and Discretionary Grant Programs."

While civilians can receive contraception without a copay through the Affordable Care Act and active duty servicemembers can receive health care—including basic contraceptive services—without copays through TRICARE, VA healthcare only waives contraception copays for a limited number of veterans. The Senate legislation is led by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) and the House legislation, which was approved by a bipartisan vote of 245-181 in June, was authored by U.S. Representative Julia Brownley (D-CA).  “We have a responsibility to do right by the troops who bravely defended our freedom, and that includes ensuring they all are able to get the family planning health care services they deserve,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act supports our women veterans by ensuring that they can get their contraception without a copay, just like active duty service members and other women on private insurers receive.”  Under current law, only a restricted group of veterans, including 50 percent disabled veterans and veterans below specific income levels, are exempt from copayments for contraception. This legislation will eliminate out-of-pocket costs levied against countless veterans, including women who make up the fastest growing group of veterans enrolling in the VA healthcare system.  The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The Senate resolution honors the memory of 7 worshipers whose lives were taken in the mass shooting. It also recognizes those who were injured and thanks the bravery of first responders. In addition, Baldwin’s resolution praises the Sikh community for their relentless optimism and work to bring people together after the attack.  “I am proud to lead this Senate resolution remembering the tragic attack a decade ago on Wisconsin’s Sikh community and honor the victims, first responders, and impacted community members,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am continually inspired by the Sikh community’s resilience in the face of tragedy and ability to heal. I stand in solidarity with Sikh community in Wisconsin and nationwide today, and every day.”The resolution is cosponsored by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and a similar companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Bryan Steil (R-WI), Gwen Moore (D-WI),  Mark Pocan (D-WI), Ron Kind (D-WI), Glenn Grothman (R-WI), Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Thomas Tiffany (R-WI), and Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI).  Full text of the Senate Resolution is available below and here.   Whereas the freedom of religion is protected in the Constitution, and no religious institution should be subject to violence, hate, intolerance, or religious and racial discrimination;  Whereas, on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a shooting took place that resulted in the death of 7 worshipers who were at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, a gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin;  Whereas the attack occurred as members of the congregation prepared a free community meal served to all congregants arriving for Sunday services;  Whereas several worshipers were injured including a responding officer, Lieutenant Brian Murphy, who was shot 15 times at close range;  Whereas Lieutenant Brian Murphy, Officer Savan Lenda, and all the first responders to the gurdwara in Oak Creek demonstrated great courage in their quick response to the shooting, saving countless lives;  Whereas the Oak Creek shooting was a senseless act of violence and tragedy that should never befall any house of worship;  Whereas the Sikh community responded to the shooting in Oak Creek with compassion and stayed true to the Sikh principle of chardi kala, which roughly translates to “relentless optimism”;  Whereas, 10 years later, the effects of this shooting are still being felt and will be felt for years to come; and  Whereas the community of Oak Creek will continue to overcome the tragedy and become stronger than before: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—(1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific attack that occurred at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin on August 5, 2012;(2) honors the memory of Paramjit Kaur Saini, Suveg Singh Khattra, Satwant Singh Kaleka, Ranjit Singh, Sita Singh, Prakash Singh, and Baba Punjab Singh who died in the attack;(3) offers its heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who died in the attack;(4) recognizes the Sikh community for demonstrating unwavering courage, strength, and resilience in response to the attack;(5) applauds the bravery of Lieutenant Brian Murphy, Officer Savan Lenda, and other first responders who prevented the gunman from potentially taking more lives and quickly treated those who were wounded; and(6) condemns intolerance, including religious and racial discrimination, and calls for unwavering resolve to prevent and seek justice for acts of hate and terrorism.###"

The legislation would make big corporations and wealthy hedge funds pay a fairer share of taxes; cut the deficit; lower the cost of prescription drugs and reduce health insurance premiums; lower household energy bills and invest in American clean energy to take on the climate crisis  “As families and businesses face rising costs, this legislation will reduce inflation and lower out of pocket costs for energy, prescription drugs, and health care. Our tax reforms make big corporations and wealthy hedge funds pay a fairer share of taxes so we can cut the deficit and reduce inflation for working families. Our legislation will lower energy costs for consumers and invest in boosting the production of clean energy here at home to take on the climate crisis and create jobs,” said Senator Baldwin.Making Big Corporations and Wealthy Hedge Funds Pay A Fairer Share of TaxesThe most profitable corporations in the country abuse loopholes in the tax code to pay little to no taxes. Year after year, these companies report record profits to shareholders and pay a lower tax rate than every other small business in America. Nurses, firefighters, cops, and teachers often pay higher tax rates than companies with $1 billion in profit per year. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 would make big corporations with $1 billion in profit per year pay a fairer share of taxes with a 15% Corporate Minimum Tax.The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also closes the carried interest tax loophole that largely benefits wealthy money managers on Wall Street. The tax reform would generate $14 billion in savings. Previously, Senator Baldwin authored the Carried Interest Fairness Act in 2021to close this loophole and require carried interest income to be taxed at ordinary rates.“To me this is simple, we need to bring fairness to a rigged tax system that favors big corporations and wealthy Wall Street hedge fund managers, allowing them to pay a lower tax rate than many Wisconsin workers,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our tax reforms make those at the top pay a fairer share of taxes so we can cut the deficit and make investments that will lower costs for working families in Wisconsin.”Cutting Prescription Drug Costs and Reducing Insurance Premiums for Working Families The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 empowers Medicare to begin negotiating directly for the price of prescription drugs in 2023, making sure our seniors and most vulnerable can afford the drugs they need and projecting the government to save nearly $300 billion. The new policy will ensure that patients with Medicare get the best deal possible on high-priced drugs and caps Medicare patients out of pocket costs at $2,000 a year. Senator Baldwin has long fought to allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drugs, sponsoring legislation since she first was elected to the Senate.   The Baldwin-backed American Rescue Plan expanded premium tax credits for low-and middle-income Wisconsinites and lowered health insurance premiums for working families who buy insurance through the ACA marketplace. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extends these tax credits for three additional years, lowering health care costs for Wisconsin families and expanding access to affordable health care for millions of Americans  “No one should go bankrupt just to get the medications or health care they need to live a healthy life. The Inflation Reduction Act gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices to reduce costs for people and save taxpayers money,” said Senator Baldwin. “The American Rescue Plan included a reform to reduce health insurance premiums and now we are extending tax credits for working families to prevent premium spikes and deliver lower health care costs.” Cutting Energy Costs, Taking on the Climate Crisis, Creating JobsThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will bring down consumer energy costs and invest American clean energy manufacturing, while substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The legislation would put the U.S. on a path to roughly 40% emissions reduction by 2030. The proposal lowers energy costs for Americans on electricity bills and helps consumers afford technologies that will lower emissions and energy prices. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 boosts American energy security by supporting more reliable and cleaner energy production and creating American manufacturing jobs in the clean energy economy. The legislation will make historic investments in American clean energy manufacturing. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 supports resilient rural communities by investing in farmers and forestland owners to be part of growing climate solutions, and by ensuring rural and communities are able to better adapt to a rapidly changing climate and the increasing extreme weather events the climate crisis brings.  “This legislation will lower energy costs, and we are finally taking bold action to confront the climate crisis. We are making investments in a Made in America clean energy economy to boost production here at home that is powered by American-made technologies and products,” said Senator Baldwin.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-supports-legislation-to-protect-americans-right-to-contraception,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined a group of her colleagues in introducing the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that would put into law Americans’ right to contraception, which the Supreme Court first recognized more than half a century ago in its decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. The introduction follows Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization—which overturned Roe v. Wade—in which he urged the Court to reconsider its 1965 Griswold decision. Several states have already restricted access to contraception by cutting off public funding for it, erroneously defining abortion in such a way to include contraception.  Senate Democrats pushed for the passage of this legislation but Senate Republicans blocked the effort to enshrine the right to contraception.“People in Wisconsin do not want politicians making decisions about their own reproductive health care, and they don’t need political interference making it harder to get contraception,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to support the Right to Contraception Act because regardless of where someone lives, they should have the same access to contraception.”  The Right to Contraception Act would uphold access to contraception by:The legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Tim (D-VA), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Kathy Manning (NC-06), Nikema Williams (GA-05), Sara Jacobs (CA-53), and Angie Craig (MN-02).The Right to Contraception Act is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Women’s Law Center, National Organization for Women, Power to Decide, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Reproductive Health Access Project, Catholics for Choice, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, Upstream USA, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Partnership for Women & Families, Jewish Women International, Positive Women’s Network-USA, and the National Council of Jewish Women.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-applauds-bipartisan-legislation-moving-forward-to-support-farmers-families-agriculture-and-rural-communities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, is applauding movement of the fiscal year 2023 appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration, which provides discretionary funding of $27.072 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion over fiscal year 2022.“Our bipartisan funding legislation respects the hard work of farmers and ranchers and bolsters economic growth for our Made in America agriculture economy. We worked across party lines to increase our investments in rural development and conservation that support the long-term health of our working lands. This legislation increases funding for child nutrition programs, rural broadband, housing, utilities, and businesses. We also found common ground on the need to increase investments for the Food Safety Inspection Service and the Food and Drug Administration,” said Senator Baldwin.Key Points & Highlights – The programs and activities funded in the agriculture bill are important to every American. This bill makes investments in rural communities and provides the necessary resources so our most vulnerable can access safe, affordable, and healthy food options. During these uncertain times, the bill provides a much needed safety net for our nation’s farmers and ranchers. The Food and Drug Administration ensures the safety of our food and drug supply, and this bill provides the agency much needed resources to continue to address emerging and known challenges. Finally, the bill provides an historic level of funding for international food aid programs.Agriculture Research: Total funding for agriculture research is $3.9 billion, or a $248 million increase over fiscal year 2022.Farm Production and Conservation:Rural Development: The programs funded within Rural Development serve as a lifeline for many communities in rural America through housing, community facilities, infrastructure and electric programs, and small business programs. Total funding for the Rural Development mission area is $4.4 billion, or a $401 million increase over fiscal year 2022.Nutrition: Overall discretionary funding for nutrition programs is $6.8 billion, an increase of $56 million over fiscal year 2022. The bill includes funding to meet anticipated participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Child Nutrition programs.Foreign Food Aid: The world is seeing record global hunger. In 2021 up to 828 million people went hungry and that number continues to rise. In response, the bill provides $1.8 billion, a record level of funding, for the Food for Peace program and $250 million for the McGovern-Dole program.Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Total discretionary funding for FDA $3.545 billion, an increase of $229 million over fiscal year 2022. Included in these increases are $43.5 million for food safety; $49.8 million for medical product safety; and $85 million for cross cutting activities. The bill also includes $5 million to implement the ALS ACT. In response to the current infant formula crisis, the bill includes additional resources for maternal and infant formula health.Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Program (AQI): The bill includes $250 million for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) AQI. This funding supports joint effort between APHIS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prevent the introduction of invasive species and diseases to the country. Because AQI is still experiencing reductions in fees collected due to the pandemic, this additional funding is necessary to ensure all international air and cargo vessels continue to be inspected.Priorities for Wisconsin“I am particularly proud that our work together will make investments that support the Dairy Business Innovation Program, the Institute for Rural Partnership, and research priorities for our dairy, specialty crop, and organic farmers. This bipartisan legislation delivers results that will help our agriculture economy expand markets for high quality American products and fuel the local economies in rural communities across the country,” said Senator Baldwin.The Agriculture Appropriations bill includes significant funding to address the challenges faced by Wisconsinites. The bipartisan funding legislation includes:# # #"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-votes-to-pass-water-infrastructure-legislation-with-investments-for-wisconsin,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin worked to include a number of measures in the 2022 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) to strengthen our supply chain and address storm water challenges in Wisconsin. The Senate passed the bipartisan legislation today on a 93-1 vote. WRDA is generally passed every two years and includes important provisions on US Army Corps activities relating to flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration.“The provisions I supported in this bipartisan legislation will support Wisconsin in dealing with the impacts of climate change while investing in our water highways that are so essential for our Made in Wisconsin economy,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud that we are working together to change how communities respond to water crises and improve the health and infrastructure of our water ways system for Wisconsin farmers, businesses and future generations.”Milwaukee Storm Water Management: The 2022 Water Resources Development Act authorized $4.5 for storm water management in Milwaukee. The funding will help provide a reduction of combined sewer overflows and better help Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewage District respond to the impacts of climate change.Fox-Wolf Basin Watershed Study: The bipartisan legislation also includes funding for the US Army Corps to conduct a study on the Fox-Wolf Basin Watershed. The Upper Fox and Wolf River Basins are two separate basins that converge within a series of pool lakes in Winnebago County before finally flowing collectively into Lake Winnebago. The study will provide valuable insight for water resource management, given the recent rise in Lake Winnebago during storm events and following spring snow melt.Water Level Management on Upper Mississippi River: The WRDA legislation will require U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to submit a report on opportunities to expand the use of water level management on the Upper Mississippi River for ecosystem restoration. The Upper Mississippi River is a vital ecosystem and artery for commerce and recreation for Wisconsin.Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project: Funding will be increased for the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project, with the federal cost share being raised from 80 percent to 90 percent. This project is critical to stopping invasive species like Asian Carp from reaching the Great Lakes, which threatens the region’s economic and ecological livelihood.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-colleagues-urge-va-to-immediately-begin-offering-abortion-services-to-veterans-and-eligible-dependents_,"Following the Supreme Court’s ruling overturning the right to an abortion, millions off veterans live in states where the right to abortion remains uncertainWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined 24 of her colleagues in calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to take immediate administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to veterans and eligible dependents. Following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, over 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions. The effort was led by Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).  Under current VA regulations, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is prohibited from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. In a letter sent to VA Secretary Denis McDonough, the members highlight that because the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions, they therefore must immediately begin a rulemaking process to change the current regulations and update the VHA’s medical benefit package to provide abortion and abortion-related services. The letter highlights that Secretary McDonough also recently expressed that the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions.  “Last month’s disastrous Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant,” write the lawmakers. “This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.”   “We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources,” the lawmakers continue. “The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary ‘shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed’ to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.”In addition to Senators Baldwin, Hirono, and Warren, the letter is also signed by Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Edward J.

The full text of the letter is below and can be found here.  Dear Secretary McDonough,  Last month’s disastrous Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant. This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.   Current regulations of the VA prohibit the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. Additionally, CHAMPVA, the VA’s insurance program for certain dependents and survivors of veterans, does not cover abortion services, unless the life of the mother is endangered.  We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources. The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary “shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed” to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.  Moreover, we agree with your testimony to the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee stating that the VA has the power to offer abortion services and abortion counseling “as a regulatory matter.” As you explained last week, “[i]t is a long-held view of the VA general counsel that [the Department is] not statutorily prohibited from providing abortion counseling or abortion services.”  Finally, the VA has the authority to “provide medical care” to the dependents and survivors of veterans through CHAMPVA “in the same or similar manner” to dependents and survivors of service members.   In FY 2020, approximately 550,000 women veterans used VA health care, and over 400,000 dependents and survivors accessed care through the CHAMPVA program. The VA must do everything in its power to provide critical reproductive care to veterans and their dependents across the country.   We call on you to take swift and decisive action to ensure all of our veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can access abortions and all abortion-related services.### "
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-grassley-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-american-farmers-and-rural-communities-from-foreign-investors-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) introduced the Farmland Security Act to increase scrutiny over foreign investments in American agricultural land. The legislation ensures that the American people and Congress can address the impacts foreign investments have on family farms, rural communities, and the domestic food supply.  “I am proud to advocate for our agriculture industry by introducing the American Farmland Security Act,” said Senator Baldwin. “This bipartisan legislation will provide the tools we need to protect the longevity of American family farm operations for generations to come.”  “I’ve been sounding the alarm on the increase in foreign-own farmland for decades and was the original author of the Agriculture Foreign Investment Disclosure Act. Foreign buyers, especially those backed by governments like China, buying up prime farmland here in the U.S. raises serious national security concerns – and the American people have a right to know about it. By requiring the USDA to report these purchases in real-time, we can keep better track of the impact these acquisitions could have on our rural communities. The Farmland Security Act will also help protect domestic food production and our national security interests,” Grassley said.  The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act requires foreign entities to disclose their purchases of American agricultural land. Current reporting shows that foreign-owned agricultural acreage has nearly doubled in the past decade, however, the data that has been collected is incomplete and inaccurate.  To protect American farmers, rural communities, and our food supply chains, the Farmland Security Act includes the following provisions:A one pager on the legislation is available here.

I voted for this legislation because it will not only support Wisconsin manufacturing, but it will also strengthen our domestic supply chain and help lower costs for businesses and consumers. To me, it’s simple—we need Made in America chips to better support our Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin has strong potential to be a growth center because we have world-class research universities and a Made in Wisconsin manufacturing workforce that knows how to make products.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-introduces-bill-to-protect-healthcare-professionals-from-workplace-violence-during-national-nurses-week,"Legislation creates standards requiring health care and social service employers to implement workplace violence prevention plan and protect employees from violent incidentsWASHINGTON, D.C. – As the nation celebrates National Nurses Week, U.S. Senator Baldwin, a member of the Senate Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee, introduced legislation to protect health care and social services employees from workplace violence.The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act directs OSHA to issue a standard requiring health care and social service employers to write and implement a workplace violence prevention plan to prevent and protect their employees from violent incidents.  “Our nurses, doctors, social services workers, and health care professionals deserve to work in a safe environment free from violence,” said Senator Baldwin. “Health care workers have faced unprecedented obstacles just to stay healthy and do their jobs through the pandemic, and on top of it all, they have seen senseless violence against them. It is unacceptable and we must provide basic protections and safety standards to a workforce that serves people during some of their most vulnerable times.”Incidents of violence against health care and social service workers are on the rise, with the pandemic only exacerbating the issue. Workers in the healthcare and social service industries experience the highest rates of injuries caused by workplace violence. A 2016 GAO study reported that rates of violence against health care workers are up to twelve times higher than rates for the overall workforce, and 70% of nonfatal workplace assaults in 2016 occurred in the health care and social assistance sectors.The Workplace Violence Prevention in Health Care and Social Services Act would ensure that health care and social service workplaces adopt proven prevention techniques and are prepared to respond in the tragic event of a violent incident.The bill is also supported by Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tina Smith (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Christopher Coons (D-DE), and Bob Casey (D-PA).The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act received support from a host of health care and social service professionals, as well as unions representing workers in these sectors, including National Nurses United (NNU), American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), Emergency Nurses Association (ENA), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Government Employees, International Association of Fire Fighters, United Steelworkers (USW), Public Citizen, and American Nurses Association.“This groundbreaking legislation will hold health care and social service employers accountable for the safety of their workers,” said Bonnie Castillo, RN and executive director of NNU. “It’s time for employers to stop putting people’s lives in danger. Everyone deserves to be safe in their workplace, and that includes hospitals, clinics, and social service settings that are so crucial now more than ever given the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. We are grateful for the leadership of Sen. Baldwin and Rep. Courtney for spearheading this important legislation.”“Health care and social service workers, especially women, are at greatest risk of violence on the job,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. “These workers are on the front lines, serving as caretakers to our families, friends and those in need. This bill is about protecting the lives of these brave heroes, and every single member of Congress should support this critical, life-saving legislation.”“Our nurses and health industry workers care every day for the sick, the elderly and the mentally ill, yet they often feel unsafe or unprotected themselves from the assaults that occur in hospitals and other healthcare-related settings,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. “While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has left these workers vulnerable, incidents of workplace violence continue to rise with 69 percent of reported cases occurring in healthcare settings. Thankfully, this bill addresses this increasing trend head-on and provides long-needed protections and specific and enforceable safety standards for people who work in front-line healthcare jobs.”“There are too many terrifying and disheartening stories about health care workers assaulted on the job,” said ACEP President Gillian Schmitz, MD, FACEP. “Physical and verbal attacks would not be tolerated in any other workplace —they should not be allowed in a health care setting. Emergency physicians are grateful for the leadership of Sen. Tammy Baldwin and others in Congress who are leading important efforts to protect the professionals on the front lines so that they can focus on patient care without worrying about their personal safety.”“Alongside the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace violence and harassment in health care facilities continues to be on the rise all across our nation,” said Dr. Ernest Grant, PhD, RN, FAAN—President, American Nurses Association. “Nurses have experienced everything from verbal and physical abuse to sexual harassment and bullying from patients and even family members. Tolerating assaults at work is not in any nurse’s job description. Nurses were hailed as heroes earlier in the pandemic and we should treat them as such. I am thrilled that Senator Baldwin and others in Congress understand this and are doing something about it. ANA applauds the members of Congress who remain committed to keeping this issue at the forefront and working toward a solution for the well-being of our nation's nurses.”“Every emergency nurse has lived through the physical and emotional pain caused by violence in the emergency department. When these incidents are dismissed as ‘part of the job,’ it minimizes the human toll on health care professionals who are injured merely because they went to work to care for patients,” said ENA President Jennifer Schmitz, MSN, EMT-P, CEN, CPEN, CNML, FNP-C, NE-BC. “When we say No Silence on ED Violence, it’s a call for more health care professionals to speak up about their experiences so that hospital leaders, law enforcement, prosecutors and legislators can’t ignore the chorus calling for change.”“From bites and scratches to life-threatening attacks, workplace violence is a serious problem for our nation’s health care and social service workers,” said USW International President Tom Conway. “The USW applauds the reintroduction of the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, which would require OSHA to finally hold employers accountable for addressing workplace violence. These workers selflessly put their lives on the line to care for the sick and vulnerable. We owe it to them to act quickly and decisively to help keep them safe on the job.” “Health care and social service workers often put themselves in harm’s way to provide invaluable services to our communities,” Lee Saunders President of AFSCME said. “For their devotion and sacrifice, these everyday heroes deserve safe workplaces – with enforceable standards and practices in place – to ensure that they return home to their families when their shifts are over. Senator Baldwin respects these front-line heroes and we applaud her for her leadership on their behalf.”A one pager on the legislation is available here.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-and-cassidy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-preserve-access-to-treatments-for-rare-disease-patients-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) introduced bipartisan legislation, the Retaining Access and Restoring Exclusivity (RARE) Act, which responds to a 2021 court decision and helps preserve access to treatments for rare disease patients, especially children.  On September 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued its decision in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, and ruled in favor of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., turning a decades-long practice by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding “orphan drug exclusivity” on its head. As a result, FDA was forced to withdraw marketing approval for a drug that provides the only approved treatment option for children with a rare disease called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or LEMS.  “The court’s decision in Catalyst has far-reaching, adverse impacts, especially for children with rare diseases and our bipartisan legislation aims to fix it so that patients aren’t locked out of approved treatments they should have access to,” said Senator Baldwin.“Vague laws can be exploited, resulting in fewer patients getting the treatments they need to survive. This bill clarifies the law to ensure incentives to innovate continue to produce lifesaving cures for our rarest diseases,” said Dr. Cassidy.Because of the 2021 court decision, drug companies are currently incentivized to seek the broadest orphan drug designation as possible and then focus clinical studies only on the narrowest patient populations that would support approval. In so doing, companies could then rely on the broader designated orphan disease and block approval for any different uses or other patient populations.   The bipartisan RARE Act would fix this issue by codifying the FDA’s longstanding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 to ensure that the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity is clarified to apply only to the same approved use or indication within such rare disease or condition instead of the same disease or condition. This would give FDA the necessary authority to approve the same drug from different manufacturers if they aim to serve different patient populations and combat manufacturers’ efforts to take advantage of the Court’s ruling in Catalyst.  “NORD applauds Senator Baldwin and Senator Cassidy for recognizing the urgent need to safeguard the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) and preserve the original intent of the law, which has benefited millions of Americans with rare diseases and their families,” said Peter L. Saltonstall, President and CEO, National Organization for Rare Disorders. “This narrowly targeted legislation will simply codify the decades-long interpretation and practice by the FDA to award exclusivity only for the specific approved use of rare disease drugs. Since more than 90% of the 7,000 known rare diseases still have no treatment or cure, it is critical the robust incentives, as envisioned by the ODA, continue to exist so that new orphan drugs are developed into the future.”  Baldwin and Cassidy’s bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Organization for Rare Disorders, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Patients for Affordable Drugs Now.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-visits-kuhn-north-america-in-brodhead-to-highlight-legislation-to-build-a-made-in-america-supply-chain,"BRODHEAD, WI – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) toured Kuhn North America, Inc. in Brodhead to discuss passing legislation that will support Wisconsin manufacturers and strengthen our Made in America economy. Kuhn North America is a leading innovator in agricultural and industrial equipment manufacturing for hay and forage, livestock, and crop production.“Companies like Kuhn North America are critical to not only moving our Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy forward, but also to ensuring our farmers have the tools they need to bring their products efficiently to market,” said Senator Baldwin. “As we work to finalize legislation to build a Made in America supply chain and bring manufacturing jobs back to America, I was excited to visit Kuhn today to highlight how we can better support Wisconsin manufacturers who help move our agriculture economy forward. I look forward to passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act because it will accelerate the domestic production of critical components for Kuhn’s equipment.”Last month, Senator Baldwin was named as a member of the conference committee which will negotiate the differences between the Senate-passed United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) and the House-passed America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act and work toward the final passage of the Bipartisan Innovation Act to improve America’s global competitiveness by investing in innovation, creating good-paying jobs, strengthening supply chains, and lowering costs.Kuhn is a strong supporter of a reform backed by Senator Baldwin to provide $52 billion to fund and amend the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act. The legislation Baldwin is working to pass would provide federal investments for domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing, ensuring the U.S. has a self-sustaining supply of semiconductor chips. Like many Wisconsin manufacturers, semiconductors are a key component for the tools Kuhn manufactures.“KUHN was honored to host Senator Baldwin at our Brodhead facility,” said Greg Petras, President of KUHN North America, Inc. “Thanks to the support of leaders like Senator Baldwin, we can continue to manufacture the equipment that feeds America. We are encouraged to hear about her efforts to strengthen America's supply chains and build the next generation of skilled workers, allowing our company and our industry to thrive in Wisconsin and across the United States.”“During her tenure in Congress, Senator Baldwin has been a tireless advocate for the millions of Americans making the equipment that builds, powers, and feeds the world,” said Megan Tanel, President of Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM). “She is a reliable partner for our industry and AEM is grateful for her efforts to strengthen the equipment manufacturing industry. We look forward to continuing our work with her as she turns her attention to the Bipartisan Innovation Act and works across the aisle to send the bill to the President’s desk.”An online version of this release is available here. ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-leads-senate-resolution-commemorating-workers-memorial-day,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced a resolution honoring Workers’ Memorial Day, an international holiday commemorating workers who were killed, disabled, injured, or made unwell on the job. Workers’ Memorial Day is observed annually on April 28, the anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) going into effect.“I was proud to lead this resolution honoring Workers’ Memorial Day because I stand with labor to honor and remember victims of workplace-related death, injuries and disease,” said Senator Baldwin. “Across the country, we’ve seen a renewed interest in union organizing to give workers a voice at some of America’s largest employers. Together, we will continue to stand in solidarity with labor to ensure every workers’ safety is protected on the job.”“Workers’ Memorial Day is a solemn reminder of all of the workers who have been lost tragically on the job. They’ve left family and loved ones behind, and we must honor their memories by strengthening safety and health protections,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler. “There is still work to do to ensure that every worker has the right to go home safe at the end of a shift. We strongly urge the Senate to support this resolution.” Baldwin’s resolution is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Pat Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-ND).A full text of the resolution is available here."
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-takes-action-for-rural-wisconsinites-responds-to-drinking-water-health-concerns,"The Healthy H20 Act Would Ensure Rural Residents Have Affordable Tools to Test Water and Make it SafeWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced The Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act, or The Healthy H2O Act, to provide grants for water testing and treatment technology directly to individuals, non-profits and local governments in rural communities. Water quality improvement systems installed at the faucet or within a building can provide immediate and ongoing protections from known and emerging water contaminants, like PFAS, lead, nitrates and manure.“Every Wisconsin community deserves access to clean drinking water and an environment free of toxic chemicals. Across our state, communities are struggling to identify and treat known and emerging chemicals that endanger our health, especially for children,” said Baldwin. “My legislation will cut costs and expand access to water testing and treatment for families in rural communities so that when we turn on the faucet, we can be confident our drinking water is safe.”The Healthy H2O Act would provide grants for water quality testing and the purchase and installation of point-of-use or point-of-entry water quality improvement systems that remove or significantly reduce contaminants from drinking water. Grants would be provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directly to individuals and to non-profits or local governments to help people go through the process of testing and then finding and installing a water treatment product to address their situation.  Across the United States and in Wisconsin, communities face threats to their drinking water from a number of contaminants, including lead, arsenic, nitrates, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PFOA, PFOS, hexavalent chromium-6, and others. While public water systems monitor for these threats and treat water before it is distributed to points of use, nearly 43 million households primarily in rural communities rely exclusively on groundwater delivered through private wells for their drinking water. This water is not subject to the same regular oversight and testing for contamination, which can delay identification of and response to health threats. The Healthy H20 Act will provide grants for rural communities to increase access to the many technologies for testing and water treatment at the point of use.   “We applaud Senator Baldwin for introducing The Healthy H2O Act to get effective water treatment technology directly to the people who need it most,” said Pauli Undesser, Executive Director of the Water Quality Association. “Point-of-use and point-of-entry filtration can be especially helpful to rural areas whose households rely primarily on private wells, might need help dealing with newly discovered contaminants in their communities, and have often been overlooked by recent federal investments.”“Private water wells and decentralized systems are a cornerstone of water access in rural America,” said Terry S. Morse, CAE, CIC, CEO of the National Ground Water Association. “Those who rely on these systems are too often left out of the policy conversation in Washington, DC. By increasing access to safe and clean water in our rural communities, The Healthy H2O Act will provide much needed assistance to people who may struggle to provide this basic need for themselves and their families. We applaud Senator Baldwin for her efforts and look forward to working with Congress to pass this important bill.”“When it comes to accessing clean water, some of the most vulnerable citizens in our nation reside in rural communities. For that reason we appreciate the strong leadership that Senator Baldwin has provided in introducing The Healthy H2O Act to help rectify this situation,” said Dean Amhaus, president & CEO of The Water Council. “Lower income rural households often lack access to the technology associated with our nation’s utilities that helps make our water safe for human consumption. That’s why we need to bring these critical point-of-use or point-of-entry water filtration systems to them.""“NSF thanks Senator Baldwin for introducing this important legislation that will help reduce health risks for millions of Americans by providing assistance to rural families to test for contaminants in their drinking water, and importantly, providing funding to install drinking water treatment systems certified to meet NSF/ANSI standards to reduce specified contaminants that may be detected,” said Dave Purkiss, Vice President of Global Water Division, NSF International.“The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) believes that everyone should have access to clean water and sanitation. This is why we support the introduction of The Healthy H2O Act and applaud Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this issue,” said Dain Hansen, Executive Vice President of Government Relations for the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials. “IAPMO has long championed solutions around the globe that lead to lasting quality water and sanitation services. Today, many communities across the United States face challenges with their drinking water - an issue that is only compounded in underserved neighborhoods. Water filtration technologies play an important role meeting those challenges immediately. We recognize this as an essential piece of legislation that helps our country take a critical step in closing the clean drinking water access gap in the U.S.”“The American Supply Association (ASA) in its continuing mission of providing clean water to all Americans is pleased to support The Healthy H2O Act. This legislation would address the critical needs of underserved, rural communities to obtain grants for testing and water filtration solutions,” said Stephen Rossi, Director of Government Affairs, American Supply Association. “This funding would help bring parity for those areas that may have been overlooked by previous legislative efforts and help continue to provide clean, fresh drinking water for years to come.”The Healthy H2O Act is supported by The Water Quality Association (WQA), The National Ground Water Association (NGWA), The Water Council, NSF International, International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), American Supply Association (ASA), Water Systems Council, Water Well Trust, and The Groundwater Foundation.The full text of this legislation is available here.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-joins-colleagues-asking-department-of-education-for-its-plans-to-provide-a-fresh-start-to-student-loan-borrowers-in-default,"In April and November 2021, Senators called on Biden administration to give relief to borrowers in defaultWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, United States Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined colleagues, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Raphael Warnock (D-GA), in sending a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, asking the Department of Education (ED) for details on its plan to give a “fresh start” to student loan borrowers in default before loan payments resume after August 31, 2022. Their letter follows the recent announcement ED is extending the student loan payment pause through August 2022 and plans to provide a “fresh start” to borrowers in default by eliminating the impact of delinquency and default and allowing these borrowers to enter repayment in good standing. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also joined in signing the letter.   “More than 7 million federal student loan borrowers are currently in default on their federal student loans. A disproportionate number of these borrowers are low income, people of color, first generation college students, veterans, student parents, students with disabilities, and people who did not complete college. Removing these borrowers from default when student loan payments and collections resume means that millions will not be immediately subject to wage garnishment, tax refund withholding, and aggressive collections practices that threaten to undermine their economic security. It also makes these borrowers eligible to enroll in Income-Driven Repayment plans,” wrote the senators.Many borrowers in default have been subject to collections for a lengthy amount of time. More than 2.1 million borrowers who were in default or at least 91 days delinquent on their federal student loans at the end of 2019 had been in repayment for 20 years or more, and another 3.4 million borrowers in default or delinquent had been in repayment for between 10 to 20 years. The senators argue that the data suggests that borrowers who remain in default even after ED has garnished their wages, tax returns, Social Security, and other benefits for years may remain in default because they do not have money to be collected, not because they are choosing not to make payments. The Higher Education Act of 1965 gives ED the clear authority to automatically remove those with federally managed loans from default status and to discharge cases of long-term default. The senators also argue that ED could grant borrowers in long-term default further relief by enforcing the Federal Claims Collections Standards, which states that agencies may compromise a debt if “the debtor is unable to pay the full amount due in a reasonable time…or the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.”The senators are calling on ED to answer a set of questions about its plans to implement the “fresh start” program for borrowers in default before the payment pause expires and its plans to provide further relief to borrowers in long-term default by May 5, 2022.In April 2021, Senator Baldwin joined a group of Senate colleagues, led by Senators Warren and Warnock, in a letter urging ED to take swift action to automatically remove all federally-held student loan borrowers from default. In November 2021, Senator Baldwin joined her colleagues in a letter urging Secretary Cardona to use his authority to automatically remove all student loan borrowers in default on federally-held loans from their default status and to develop a policy to discharge debt for borrowers who have been in default for an extended period of time. Full text of the letter can be found here.###"

The Strategy includes major elements championed by Senator Baldwin to combat the substance misuse epidemic.“The opioid epidemic and substance use disorder crisis continues to touch every community across Wisconsin and the pandemic has only made this epidemic worse. Now is the time for bold action to save lives,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to stand with the Biden Administration in taking action to combat this epidemic with a comprehensive plan to support individuals and families facing addiction.”The Strategy focuses on two critical drivers of the epidemic: untreated addiction and drug trafficking. It instructs federal agencies to prioritize actions that will save lives, get people the care they need, go after drug traffickers’ profits, and make better use of data to guide all these efforts. The United States reached new records in the number of drug overdose fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 100,000 lives lost to drug overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021.Included in the plan are several components Senator Baldwin has championed to help address the opioid and addiction epidemic:A fact sheet on the Strategy is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-joins-colleagues-in-calling-on-administration-to-expand-access-to-affordable-child-care,"Head Start Provides High-Quality, Affordable Child Care to Lower-Income Wisconsinites and AmericansWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined her colleagues, led by Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand eligibility for the Head Start Program to help ensure that more families in Wisconsin and across the country can access affordable, high-quality child care and preschool services. Along with Senators Baldwin and Hassan, the letter was signed by Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Smith (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-CA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).“We write to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education by using your existing authority to ensure that more young children and families are eligible for Head Start programs,” the Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.  The Senators continued, “For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible.”The Senators are urging Secretary Becerra to expand eligibility for the program to include families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).“It is clear that the eligibility criteria have become increasingly detached from the needs of children and families across the nation. Adding SNAP and WIC to the categorical eligibility list is a simple and swift action we can take to mitigate the increasing barriers that children and families face,"" said National Head Start Association Executive Director Yasmina Vinci. “More children and families need access to the quality comprehensive services and early care and education that define Head Start and Early Head Start,” said Jennie Mauer, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association. “Expanding Head Start eligibility to include SNAP and WIC participation is a common sense way to connect more families to Head Start.  The Wisconsin Head Start Association and our forty member Head Start grantees urge Secretary Becerra to make this change that will support the lives of so many children and families in Wisconsin and across the country.”The American Rescue Plan, which Senator Baldwin helped pass into law, included more than $579 million for child care providers nationwide. Senator Baldwin also introduced the Child Poverty Reduction Act of 2021, which would establish a national goal of reducing child poverty by half in 10 years and require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Census Bureau to annually track the progress toward that goal.To read the Senators’ letter to Secretary Becerra, click here or see below:Dear Secretary Becerra,We write to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education by using your existing authority to ensure that more young children and families are eligible for Head Start programs.For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible.Currently, families are eligible for Head Start programs when they meet up to 100 percent of the Department FPL, and 35 percent of slots can be designated for children and families earning up to 130 percent of the FPL. The FPL is equivalent to $27,750 for a family of four. Additionally, Section 645 [42 U.S.C. 9840] of the Head Start Act makes children eligible when their families receive certain public assistance, as defined by the Department. Under current Head Start requirements, this so-called “categorical eligibility” applies to families that receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), but does not include other public assistance programs used by some of our country’s most high-need families.We ask the Department to expand Head Start’s public assistance categorical eligibility to include children in families that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Adding SNAP and WIC will also underscore the critical links between nutrition support and early childhood education, and help connect pregnant WIC recipients to Early Head Start services at a critical and vulnerable juncture in their lives. We hope that the Department will make this change so that more high-need families and their young children can more easily access critical Head Start programs across the country. Thank you for your consideration.### "

Wisconsin is recognized nationwide for its diverse agricultural production and valuable agricultural research. The plant breeding facility needed upgrades to current facilities that are housing germplasm materials of national significance to ensure continued advancement in agriculture research.  Funding for the facility will help ensure farmers across Wisconsin and the country have the tools and research they need to be as productive and effective as possible, while managing a wide array of specialty crops. The new facility will accommodate more than 50 faculty members, including 10 USDA scientists and provide hands-on training opportunities to over 150 postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students.    Senator Baldwin then toured the UW Odyssey Project and met with students and staff to discuss $500,000 she secured in federal funding. The Odyssey Project provides free college courses and wrap-around support to adult learners in need, as well as support courses for incarcerated learners. The federal funding will help  support humanities classes for adult students facing economic barriers to college. Odyssey takes a whole family approach to breaking the cycle of generational poverty by increasing access to education, giving adult and youth learners a voice, and increasing confidence through reading, writing, and speaking.  Both projects at the UW are part of more than $187 million Senator Baldwin worked to bring home to Wisconsin in federal funding legislation signed into law by President Biden.Senator Baldwin then joined Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway and Madison Metro Transit to highlight $6.4 million in federal funding the city is receiving for Madison Metro Transit through the Federal Transit Administration. The federal funding will make the public transportation system in Madison more efficient, safer and better equipped for the future. The funding will assist the City with bus rapid transit, Metro’s redesign and the conversion of the City's fleet to electric buses.###"

In total, nearly $17 billion will be invested by the Infrastructure Law in our ports and waterways through the Department of Transportation, Army Corps of Engineers and Coast Guard.  In addition, Senator Baldwin highlighted her work to secure funding for an additional Great Lakes Icebreaker to support our supply chains and the Made in Wisconsin economy.Senator Baldwin also joined Brown County Executive Troy Streckenbach, De Pere Mayor James Boyd, local officials, and members of the Oneida Nation at De Pere City Hall to highlight $5 million in federal funding she brought home to Wisconsin for the South Bridge Regional Connector Project. The funding will be used to design and construct a new bridge over the Fox River. The bridge will create a direct connection between large businesses, industrial parks, Interstate 41 and other highways, while extending high-speed broadband access to rural portions of Brown County. With increased traffic over the Fox River in De Pere and anticipated growth in southern Brown County, community leaders expressed that an additional crossing over the Fox River is needed. The new bridge will allow the new business parks being built on either side of Interstate 41 to avoid the city of Green Bay for transportation of goods, allowing goods to get to market more efficiently and help reduce costs for consumers.###"

Maloney (D-NY), Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, along with Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Angus King (I-ME) and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA),  led a bicameral, bipartisan group of colleagues in sending letters to seven major manufacturers of naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, urging them to apply for over the counter (OTC) status for their products to help increase access and save lives. Despite the effectiveness of naloxone to reverse active opioid overdoses and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) public support for making the product available over the counter, the medication is not currently available over the counter because drug manufacturers have resisted applying. This step is expected to lower the cost of the medication and increase access both at the pharmacy counter and for community organizations working to distribute this life-saving tool.   “One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay,” said the Members of Congress. “Further, a formal switch to OTC status will help reduce stigma and encourage the widespread use of this critical medication.”The Members of Congress continued, “Now the responsibility lies with manufacturers to submit the paperwork needed to make this switch. By doing so, [the drug manufacturer] will be taking an important step in the ongoing effort to prevent deadly opioid overdoses.”The series of letters comes as the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder crisis in this country, with the United States experiencing more than 100,000 overdose deaths in a 12-month period for the first-time ever last year. A study found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent.The letters were sent to the CEOs of Pfizer, Emergent Biosolutions, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Hikma, Akorn, Adamis Pharmaceuticals, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.   The letter was also signed by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV),  Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Representatives Mark Desaulnier (D-CA), Peter Meijer (R-MI), Katie Porter (D-CA), Mariannette J.

But such actions are not enough. Now is the time to designate a naloxone product as an over-the-counter medication, and ASAM thanks Senator Baldwin and others members of Congress for their leadership on this issue.”“Much of the creativity for reducing barriers to naloxone access can be traced back to harm reduction programs,” said Maya Doe-Simkins, Director of the Remedy Alliance. “We eagerly await the strategic and innovative ways that naloxone access barriers- including cost and prescription status barriers- can be further dismantled with the help of pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors. We thank these Members of Congress for championing naloxone access in their letters.”“Equitable and cost-effective strategies to increase access to all forms of naloxone is the next step in addressing the opioid overdose and addiction epidemics,” said Jesse Heffernan, RCP, of Appleton, Wisconsin, a recovery coach and person in recovery. “Naloxone should be in every household, business and campuses across the country in the same way we have smoke detectors, AEDs, and first AID Kits. When families and individuals are equipped with it, people are given opportunities to move into recovery and treatment. Overdose is preventable and reversible. The expedited advancement of an OTC version will save lives and reduce the discrimination toward individuals with a substance use disorder. Thank you to Senator Baldwin and her colleagues for her important leadership in increasing access to naloxone.”Full text of the letters can be found here or below:Dear [CEO],  Given our nation’s alarming opioid overdose rates, we write to urge [company name] to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter (OTC) status for your naloxone product, a desperately needed step to ensure widespread and affordable access to this critical overdose reversal medication. We ask that you act quickly given the scale of need at this moment. Lives are at stake.   The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid and substance use disorder epidemic in this country, with reported overdoses and deaths spiking to historic levels. In fact, alarming data show that last year, the United States experienced a record 100,306 overdose deaths. These trends show no signs of abating as overdose deaths continue to rise.  Given the scale of need at this moment, it has never been more important to adopt opioid overdose prevention and reversal strategies on a wide scale. This includes steps to increase access to affordable naloxone, which is a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses, and deaths. A study conducted in Massachusetts found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent. With the support of naloxone manufacturers, we can significantly increase access to the medication and help mitigate the worsening crisis of drug overdose deaths.   One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay. While many states have standing orders and workarounds that allow individuals to acquire naloxone without a prescription, regulatory hurdles continue to create unnecessary barriers. Further, a formal switch to OTC status will help reduce stigma and encourage the widespread use of this critical medication during emergencies. Additionally, market prices for naloxone remain prohibitively high, putting additional financial strain on community organizations working to reduce overdoses. Creating additional OTC naloxone options will help to reduce prices for those who need it, as well as for first responders and other good Samaritans, and increase the supply in at-risk communities.   The FDA strongly supports this change and has proactively created, tested, and validated the key labeling information and data needed to approve an OTC version of naloxone. As part of this effort to expedite the application process, the FDA has provided model OTC labels and usage instructions for the nasal spray and auto-injector versions of naloxone. Now the responsibility lies with manufacturers to submit the paperwork needed to make this switch.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-visits-southwest-wisconsin-to-discuss-7-million-investment-in-platteville-fire-station-and-funding-for-workforce-development-programs,"WISCONSIN – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin visited the Platteville Fire Station and Southwest Technical College-Fennimore to highlight federal funding she worked to bring home for Platteville and workforce development in Southwest Wisconsin. At the Platteville Fire Station, Senator Baldwin discussed the $7 million investment she secured for the fire station in federal funding legislation that was signed into law by President Biden last month. At the Fire Station, Senator Baldwin met with Adam Ruechel, Platteville City Manager, Barbara Daus, City Council President, Eileen Nickels, City Council President Pro-Tem, Ryan Simmons, Platteville Fire Chief, and Casey Pickel, Platteville Fire Inspector.  Senator Baldwin also visited Southwest Technical College (SWTC) in Fennimore to learn about how federal funding from the American Rescue Plan that she voted for is helping to address workforce needs. Baldwin joined SWTC staff, students, and Rhonda Suda, CEO of the Southwest Wisconsin Workforce Development Board (SWWDB), to tour the Essential (Child) Care program, funded through the American Rescue Plan. The Essential (Child) Care program will fund tuition and subsidized or unsubsidized job placement for 20 participants entering childcare or early childhood education training programs.   SWWDB was awarded over $1.6 million in American Rescue Plan grant funding to serve several projects, including Essential (Child) Care; Accelerated Industrial Maintenance; Power Skills: Transferable-Employability Program; Truck Driver Short-Term Training; and Construction Up, which will offset costs of apprenticeship training up to $5000 and will also provide a participation stipend of $1000 after 1000 hours of training. Senator Baldwin met with SWTC President Jason Wood, staff and students, to learn how American Rescue Plan funding has been used together with private funding for the Charger Tech 360 program, which offers laptops to enrolled students plus software and technical assistance.Baldwin also toured the SWTC nursing program. During the pandemic nursing staff and students at SWTC have filled a critical role in COVID-19 vaccinations locally and throughout the state. For years, Southwest Tech has been a strong partner with the Grant County Health Department, Grant Regional Health Center in Lancaster, and Southwest Health in Platteville.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-joins-bipartisan-group-calling-for-expansion-of-eating-disorder-treatment-for-service-members-and-military-families,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of bipartisan colleagues, led by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Thom Tillis (R-NC), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in sending a letter to Dr. David Smith, Acting Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and LTG Ronald Place, Director of the Defense Health Agency, urging the Department of Defense (DoD) to implement provisions secured in the fiscal year (FY) 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that authorize expanding eating disorder treatment coverage to TRICARE beneficiaries. This language was based on the SERVE Act, which Baldwin cosponsored.The Senators wrote, “As you know, service members and military families are affected by eating disorders at elevated rates compared to the civilian population due to risk factors unique to their military experience. Studies show that diagnoses of eating disorders among military personnel rose 26 percent from 2013 to 2016. Moreover, 21 percent of children and 26 percent of spouses of service members are symptomatic of an eating disorder. Additionally, the suicide rate for those affected by eating disorders is 23 times higher than the rate for the general population, which is particularly concerning given that service members already experience heightened rates of suicide.”The letter went on to underscore that their provisions in the FY22 NDAA authorize the Secretary of Defense to expand and build infrastructure to identify, treat and rehabilitate service members and military families affected by eating disorders. The Senators pointed out that while the FY22 NDAA expands this coverage for active-duty military families, it should be further expanded to include retiree families, which is especially critical amid the mental health crisis impacting American families.The letter is also signed by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Patty Murray (D-WA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Tina Smith (D-MN).Full text of the letter is below and here.Dear Assistant Secretary Smith and Director LTG Place:We write to you with concern over the impact of eating disorders on active-duty and retired military families. Eating disorders are a serious mental illness that affect almost 30 million Americans and have the second-highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition, accounting for one death every 52 minutes. When left untreated, eating disorders can lead to heart and kidney failure, osteoporosis, Type II diabetes, stroke, gastric rupture, hypoglycemia, and other medical injuries, sometimes causing death.As you know, servicemembers and military families are affected by eating disorders at elevated rates compared to the civilian population due to risk factors unique to their military experience. Studies show that diagnoses of eating disorders among military personnel rose 26 percent from 2013 to 2016. Moreover, 21 percent of children and 26 percent of spouses of servicemembers are symptomatic of an eating disorder. Additionally, the suicide rate for those affected by eating disorders is 23 times higher than the rate for the general population, which is particularly concerning given that servicemembers already experience heightened rates of suicide. The problem is accelerating as recent studies have shown that 16 percent of female veterans have an eating disorder, and a 2020 report from the Defense Health Board revealed that active-duty servicewomen are disproportionately affected by eating disorders, impacting their readiness and health.Title VII Section 701 of the Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorized the Secretary of Defense to expand and build infrastructure to identify, treat, and rehabilitate servicemembers and military families affected by eating disorders. Today, we write to urge the Department of Defense (DOD), including the Defense Health Agency (DHA), to take actions to implement these provisions to expand eating disorders treatment coverage under TRICARE. While the FY22 NDAA expands eating disorder treatment coverage for active-duty military families, we urge DOD to expand this coverage to retiree families. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this expansion would cost just $2 million over ten years. Given the nation’s current mental health crisis, this will undoubtedly provide significant cost savings to DOD and our health care system in the long run.Therefore, we ask you to use your existing authorities to expand eating disorder coverage to retiree families and improve DOD’s infrastructure around eating disorders accordingly. We request a timely written response on the actions DOD can take to expand eating disorder treatment coverage. Thank you for your attention to this request.Sincerely,  An online version of this release is available here. ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-expand-medicare-coverage-of-chiropractic-services-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) introduced the Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act to ensure Medicare patients have full coverage of chiropractic care. As medical professionals have reported seeing more neck and back pain in their patients over the pandemic, this bipartisan legislation would expand Medicare’s coverage of chiropractic services, ensuring Medicare patients have access to chiropractic care as a non-drug alternative for pain management.   “The more than 1.1 million Wisconsinites on Medicare should have the option to receive safe chiropractic care should they want it,” said Baldwin. “I am proud to join this bipartisan legislation to ensure Medicare covers this non-drug approach to pain management for its recipients.”  “This bill will make it easier for seniors to get the chiropractic care they need for their pain,” said Blumenthal. “Burdensome regulations currently in place are an onerous obstacle for Medicare patients seeking necessary treatment. By expanding Medicare coverage to all chiropractic services, this measure will ensure seniors have alternative means of treatment when managing their pain—a substitute to potentially addictive opioid prescriptions.”  “Chiropractors can provide patients with a wide range of health care services, but current restrictions under Medicare prevent them from offering seniors a full scope of treatments or ordering diagnostic services. This is particularly an issue in rural areas. Our bill, the Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act, provides care options from chiropractors for Medicare patients suffering from back or neck pain, and ensures they can receive the care they need,” said Cramer.  “Chiropractic services can make a world of difference for patients suffering from chronic pain,” Wicker said. “I am glad to join this bipartisan effort to expand access and improve flexibility for Medicare patients who want an alternative to narcotics for pain management.”  Medicare has covered some chiropractic care since 1972, but outdated regulations require beneficiaries to seek diagnostic tests elsewhere and then return to the chiropractor for covered care. By removing obstacles that do not exist under most private insurance plans, the legislation would expand Medicare coverage to allow access to all chiropractic care, such as x-rays and other diagnostic services, that are needed to determine and prescribe appropriate treatment. It would also provide access to alternative means of treatment for patients suffering from back or neck pain that may be otherwise be treated by opioid prescriptions.  The Chiropractic Medicare Coverage Modernization Act is supported by the American Chiropractic Association.  The text of the Senate version of the legislation is available here. U.S. Representative Brian Higgins (D-NY) introduced companion legislation in the House. ###"

The Senate and House have both passed legislation, and now we need to bring it together to make sure we build a Made in America supply chain, instead of having it outsourced abroad. I look forward to working in a bipartisan way on this conference committee to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make strong investments in research and development. Wisconsin has strong potential to be a growth center because we have world-class research universities and a Made in Wisconsin manufacturing workforce that knows how to make products. We are leaders in bioenergy research and water technology, so, Wisconsin is well positioned for growth in emerging industries. Passing this legislation can really help support the R&D we are doing and help create job growth for our state.”  In addition to Senator Baldwin, other Democrats on the conference committee are Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Chair, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Jon Tester (D-MT), Chairman, Committee on Veteran’s Affairs, Mark Warner (D-VA), Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Mark Kelly (D-AZ), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Raphael Warnock (D-GA).###"

The new funding from the Baldwin-supported infrastructure law will enable transit agencies statewide to buy new buses and railcars, address repair backlogs, modernize fleets, and transition to new technologies to reduce costs and address environmental impacts. These upgrades will support the expansion of U.S. manufacturing due to Buy America requirements that Senator Baldwin championed in the legislation that apply to steel, iron and other materials used in public transportation projects that receive federal assistance.   “I voted for the infrastructure law because it will create jobs and put Wisconsin to work rebuilding our infrastructure and updating our transit systems,” said Senator Baldwin. “This investment from the Biden-Harris Administration in Wisconsin will allow communities to modernize outdated, costly bus and trains fleets and invest in more cost efficient technologies, all while supporting our Made in America economy. I am especially proud of working across party lines to lead the effort to ensure we included strong Buy America standards in the infrastructure legislation because when we rebuild our infrastructure and update our transit, we need to support American workers, manufacturers, and businesses.”In 2019, Senator Baldwin secured a bipartisan amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act to strengthen Buy American requirements when the federal government is investing in rail or buses, preventing federal funds from being used by transit agencies to buy rail cars or buses manufactured by Chinese state-owned, controlled, or subsidized companies.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-pushes-for-an-investigation-into-mckinseys-potential-conflicts-of-interest-in-relation-to-opioid-crisis,"Senators’ Request Follows Revelations that McKinsey Consulted for FDA on Opioid-Related Projects While Working for Opioid Manufacturers Like Purdue PharmaWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of her colleagues, led by Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), in calling for an investigation into the failure by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to disclose potential conflicts of interest when the company was working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on issues related to opioids, while simultaneously working for numerous opioid companies, including Purdue Pharma. As the opioid crisis continues to devastate communities, the Senators are calling for a Health and Human Services (HHS) Inspector General investigation into the FDA’s work with McKinsey and FDA’s contracting policies to ensure that contractors adequately disclose all potential conflicts of interest in the future.“While working for clients involved in manufacturing, distributing, and selling opioids, McKinsey simultaneously worked on projects for FDA, including projects for the FDA center responsible for approving new drugs, like opioids. Government contracting databases show that since 2008, McKinsey has been hired by FDA on numerous occasions, earning more than $140 million,” the Senators wrote to Christi A. Grimm, Inspector General for the Department of HHS.In their letter, the Senators continued, “Despite these reports, FDA did not conduct any additional contract reviews or discuss with McKinsey conflicts of interest and the firm’s failure to disclose them in earlier contract applications. Furthermore, it is unclear whether FDA has altered or improved its processes and procedures to prevent similar nondisclosures of conflicts of interest in future contracts.”The Senators are calling on the Inspector General to review the actions of McKinsey and FDA as it pertains to these conflicts of interests and McKinsey’s failures to disclose them, and what actions the agency should take to help ensure that these failures don’t occur in the future. In addition to Senators Baldwin and Hassan, the letter was signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). Senator Baldwin also joined her colleagues recently in calling on the DOJ to investigate whether members of the Sackler family personally engaged in criminal conduct in connection with Purdue Pharma’s admitted criminal wrongdoing in fueling the devastating opioid epidemic.To read the full letter, click here or see below.Dear Inspector General Grimm:We are writing to request that the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services open an investigation into the failure of consulting firm McKinsey & Company (“McKinsey”) to disclose potential conflicts of interest when McKinsey entered into contracts with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on issues related to opioids while simultaneously working for numerous opioid companies. We also write to request that your office review FDA’s contracting policies and procedures and determine how the agency can ensure that future contractors adequately disclose all potential conflicts.For more than a decade, McKinsey has advised companies throughout the opioid industry. McKinsey recently settled with 49 states Attorneys General for $573 million due to actions that exacerbated the opioid epidemic, including advising Purdue Pharma on how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin.  Former clients also include opioid manufacturers Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt, and Endo International, as well as major opioid distributors and retailers.While working for clients involved in manufacturing, distributing, and selling opioids, McKinsey simultaneously worked on projects for FDA, including projects for the FDA center responsible for approving new drugs, like opioids. Government contracting databases show that since 2008, McKinsey has been hired by FDA on numerous occasions, earning more than $140 million.  The firm was deeply involved with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), FDA’s principal center for approving new drugs, including opioids: at least 17 of McKinsey’s FDA contracts, totaling more than $48 million, call on the firm to work with CDER.  In 2008, McKinsey began working with Purdue on how to develop its FDA-mandated proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), a drug safety program overseen by CDER, that required manufacturers to communicate safety risks to patients, pharmacists, and other health care providers.  McKinsey built a strategy for Purdue and other opioid manufacturers to “play, delay, pre-empt, and band together,” by “jointly develop[ing] FDA response strategy,” “shar[ing] abuse mitigation strategies,” and “formulat[ing] arguments to defend against strict treatment by the FDA.”  When the finalized REMS for opioid products was announced in 2012, it was largely devoid of the restrictions that FDA had initially proposed.FDA requires that contractors such as McKinsey agree to its Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) policy, as set out by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Last August, some of our offices sent a letter to FDA, requesting further information about these conflicts of interest and whether McKinsey disclosed the required OCI to the agency during the contracting process. FDA responded to our letter two months later on October 22, 2021, and stated that “FDA is not aware of any disclosures made by McKinsey vis-a-vis OCI in relation to these orders. FDA cannot speculate on why McKinsey did not consider any actual or apparent OCI to be sufficient to require reporting as directed by the contract requirements.”  Despite the conflicts implicit in its simultaneous work for opioid companies and for the FDA, McKinsey apparently never notified the agency of potential OCI.  And as FDA stated in its recent letter, the responsibility for identifying conflicts of interest fell entirely on McKinsey: “FDA relies on the contractor to assess and report potential OCI and submit mitigation plans for review.”  Despite the requirements in its contracts, McKinsey failed to make any disclosures to FDA with regard to its many conflicts of interest and in fact repeatedly warranted just the opposite – that it had no such conflicts.In its response, FDA also stated that it only became aware of McKinsey’s past work for opioid industry clients in early 2021, when these ties were widely reported on in the media.  However, the first reports on McKinsey’s extensive work for Purdue Pharma surfaced in early 2019.  In the interim, McKinsey continued to perform work for FDA; contracting databases show that from February 2019 to January 2021, the firm received more than $20 million in new contracts from the FDA.  Despite these reports, FDA did not conduct any additional contract reviews or discuss with McKinsey conflicts of interest and the firm’s failure to disclose them in earlier contract applications.  Furthermore, it is unclear whether FDA has altered or improved its processes and procedures to prevent similar nondisclosures of conflicts of interest in future contracts.The Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health & Human Services is uniquely situated to review the actions of McKinsey and FDA as it pertains to these conflicts of interests and the failures to disclose them. As part of your review, we ask that you specifically address the following issues:At a time when the opioid epidemic is still raging nationwide, we must hold those who fueled it accountable and take action to prevent similar failures in the future. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.An online version of this release is available here.###"

Her historic nomination is a long overdue step in ensuring our armed forces’ leadership look more like our nation as a whole. I was honored to host Admiral Fagan in Sturgeon Bay last year to visit with members of the Coast Guard to discuss their critical icebreaking missions on the Great Lakes that support thousands of American jobs and millions in business revenue. Admiral Fagan has my full support and as chair of the Coast Guard’s oversight subcommittee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get her confirmed as soon as possible. I am excited to work alongside her to better support Coast Guard members and veterans, ensure our nation’s maritime safety, and boost our icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes.”Last week, Senator Baldwin, Chair of the Oceans Subcommittee which oversees the Coast Guard, led a letter to the Biden administration urging the prompt nomination of the 27th Commandant of the USCG, underscoring the importance of the position for national security, ocean shipping supply chain resiliency, and environmental protection.Senator Baldwin hosted Admiral Fagan in Sturgeon Bay, WI in 2021 to meet with a USCG unit to discuss the unique challenges that units experience, such as access to affordable childcare and a shortage of housing options for Coast Guard members and families. Additionally, they talked about the Coast Guard’s icebreaking missions on the Great Lakes and the need for an additional Great Lakes Icebreaker to support our supply chains and the Made in Wisconsin economy.Senator Baldwin has secured initial funding for an additional Great Lakes Icebreaker for the past six years. In 2021, Senator Baldwin reintroduced the Great Lakes Winter Commerce Act in the Senate, bipartisan legislation that will update the USCG’s icebreaking mission on the Great Lakes and increase the icebreaking capacity of the Great Lakes fleet.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-attends-white-house-trucking-event,"Infrastructure Law Included Baldwin’s Legislation to Support Women in TruckingWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin attended an event today at the White House focused on investments in the trucking industry, including her Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act, which was part of the bipartisan infrastructure law signed by President Biden.“In Wisconsin, we make things, and we need to ensure we have a strong workforce to transport our goods to market,” said Senator Baldwin. “Women currently make up less than 10 percent of the truck driving workforce, and removing the barriers that get in the way of women pursuing and retaining careers in trucking is key. More job opportunities for Wisconsin women will lead to more economic security for working families. And more women truckers will strengthen our supply chains and help lower costs for businesses and consumers.”Currently, women make up 47 percent of the United States’ labor force, yet represent 24 percent of America’s trucking workforce and only about seven percent of drivers. Baldwin’s bipartisan legislation, which she introduced in 2019, supports women in the trucking industry and directs the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to establish a “Women of Trucking Advisory Board.” The board will identify barriers to entry for women in the trucking industry, work across organizations and companies to coordinate formal education and training programs and help identify and establish training and mentorship programs for women in the industry. The legislation also requires the FMCSA Administrator to submit a report to Congress on the board’s findings and recommendations. At the White House event, President Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg highlighted the administration's ""Trucking Action Plan,"" launched last December by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Labor to increase the supply of truck drivers by creating new pathways into the profession, including through the Women of Trucking Advisory Board, as well as by cutting red tape to expand high quality training through Registered Apprenticeship, and laying the foundation for improving job quality to keep people in the profession.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-introduces-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-increase-tribal-public-health-security-and-preparedness,"Legislation would ensure Tribal Nations have equal access to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resources to prepare for public health emergenciesWASHINGTON, D.C. – United States Senator Tammy Baldwin joined the bipartisan, bicameral Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Tribal Public Health Security and Preparedness Act, legislation that would ensure that Tribes have equal access to funding through the CDC to prepare for public health emergencies. Currently, Tribal Nations are not eligible to apply for the CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement program that provides grants to state and local public health departments to help them prepare for emergencies. This bill would change that.   The CDC PHEP program is a critical source of funding for eligible state, local, and territorial public health departments, helping them build and strengthen their ability to respond to public health threats and associated emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Many heavily rely on these funds to meet needs related to staffing, supply procurement and management, planning, and training, but under the current program, no Tribal public health departments are able to apply for these funds.   “For COVID-19, and future pandemics, Tribal nations deserve access to the same public health resources to keep their communities safe that our state and local governments have access to,” said Senator Baldwin. “This bipartisan legislation will address just that, helping support our Native communities combat public health emergencies and reduce the persistent health inequities in Indian Country.”  ""For decades, states have received federal public health funding to help them prepare for and respond to public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, while tribal governments have had to fend for themselves despite the already significant health disparities in our communities,"" said Tehassi Hill, Chairman of the Oneida Nation. ""This bill recognizes the role tribal governments have in protecting the health of our people and is an important step towards honoring the federal trust responsibility to tribes. The Oneida Nation is very thankful for Sen. Baldwin's continued leadership on this and other efforts to support tribal governments.""  The CDC Tribal Public Health Security and Preparedness Act is led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Martin Heinrich (D-MN) and Representatives Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Tom Cole, Co-Chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus and Member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, (R-OK). Along with Senator Baldwin, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).   The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Indian Country, in part worsened by inequities in access to public health prevention and mitigation resources.

The letter was led by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and was also signed by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Patty Murray (D-WA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Deb Fischer (R-NE) Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA). The Senators wrote, “While we are not surprised that the Taliban has once again dismissed the rights of girls and young women, we are alarmed by the implications of their decision for 50 percent of the population and the future of Afghanistan. To this end, we urge you to convey clear consequences to the Taliban for their actions, and take immediate steps to bolster support for Afghan women and girls.”The Senators went on to address how this latest decision by the Taliban is part of a broader assault on women’s rights and freedom. In the eight months since the Taliban overthrew the legitimate Afghan government in 2021, women have been banned from most jobs, are required to be accompanied by a male relative and are restricted in where they can travel. Most seriously, when women protest this treatment, they are arrested, beaten and disappeared.In their letter, the Senators conveyed their support for the Biden administration’s decision to suspend engagements with the Taliban due to the reversal on girls’ access to secondary school, and urged for additional action in response. These actions include reinstating travel bans under the United Nations Security Council sanctions regime, and working with Congress on additional measures to provide access to primary, secondary and tertiary education.The Senators also addressed the dire humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and called for the administration to, “…engage the women of Afghanistan as our partners in mobilizing the provision of food assistance, maternal and child health needs and education, not only for women and girls but for all Afghans. The humanitarian crisis has crippled Afghanistan and left 95 percent of Afghans hungry. In the face of such unprecedented strife, it is the Afghan women who have developed assistance networks and communal groups to support their families and communities. The U.S. and the international community must tackle any obstacles to engaging women activists and fully empower women’s groups in decision-making and programming to funnel assistance to those who need it most.”In closing, the Senators reiterated how critical it is to protect the two decades of progress on women’s rights that Afghan women fought to secure.Their letter can be read in full here. ### "
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-flexibilities-to-feed-children,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act to extend the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed. The bill will also help schools transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. USDA requested this authority be extended in the omnibus.“We cannot allow millions of children to lose access to school meals, and we must extend school meal flexibilities to make sure no child goes hungry,” said Senator Baldwin. “I have heard directly from parents, teachers and education leaders about the challenges schools still face trying to move past the impacts of this pandemic, and this bipartisan legislation recognizes some of those challenges. Let’s get the job done on this legislation to prevent disruptions to school nutrition programs and make sure kids have access to healthy meals. We can’t let them down, we should work together to lift them up by making sure no child has to face hunger.”The legislation was led by led by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). The bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by 50 members of Congress including Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Carper (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Schumer (D-NY), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA).Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the Senators’ bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children.“School meal programs, a crucial source of nutritional support for millions of families nationwide, face tremendous immediate and long-term challenges in the absence of these child nutrition waivers,” said Beth Wallace, president of the School Nutrition Association. “Acute supply chain disruptions, persistent labor shortages and escalating costs make it impossible for these programs to return to normal operations next school year. This legislation is absolutely critical to sustaining school meal programs, ensuring children have access to nutritious school meals and preventing substantial financial losses for schools nationwide.”“The sooner the USDA is authorized to extend child nutrition waivers, the sooner schools and community organizations can plan meal programs for summer and next school year,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Schools and community meal providers continue to face extreme pandemic-related challenges like supply chain disruptions, rising food prices and staffing shortages. Without waivers, they will have a difficult time responding to these challenges in real-time, impacting their ability to safely and effectively reach kids with the nutrition they need and stunting their ability to transition to normal operations as those challenges subside.”“Nearly 12 million children struggle to know where their next meal will come from, disrupting their ability to reach their full potential. Fortunately, child nutrition waivers have helped provide year-round access to much-needed nutrition. If the waivers aren’t extended, millions of children will lose that access, with Black, Latino, and Native American children, and children in rural areas, being hit hardest,” said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer, Feeding America. “Because of the delay in extending the waivers, some site sponsors will have to close summer and after-school meal sites, translating to taking away meals that families are relying on to keep their kids nourished. Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, applauds the introduction of this bill to extend child nutrition waivers, continuing this critical lifeline for children. We urge Congress to act immediately to ensure our children don’t face hunger this summer and beyond.”A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-supports-senate-resolution-celebrating-international-transgender-day-of-visibility,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of 17 senators in introducing a resolution to recognize the achievements and courage of the transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse communities around the world, and to celebrate International Transgender Day of Visibility.    “The increase in discrimination and attacks on the trans community come at a time when LGBTQ youth are at increased risk for bullying and are more likely to consider and attempt suicide. This is unacceptable and we must do better. International Transgender Day of Visibility provides us an opportunity to make it clear that words and actions matter and I’m proud to join my colleagues on this resolution,” said Senator Baldwin. “Today, and every day, my message is simple—I see you, I am with you, and I stand with the trans community to celebrate the courage and dignity of living life as who you are. Together, we will create a future where all Americans have the freedom of full equality because trans rights are human rights.”  The resolution was introduced by U.S. Senators Baldwin, Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai‘i), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky  Rosen (D-Nev.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).  “International Transgender Day of Visibility is about celebrating the transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse communities around the world – their achievements, their courage, and their right to live authentically and openly. But it is also about raising awareness of the discrimination and violence they still face today. While we have made significant progress over the years – thanks to the bravery of many transgender leaders – the work for full equality, acceptance, and civil rights protections continues,” said Senator Schatz.  “No one should face discrimination based on who they are, or have to live in fear. Trans rights are human rights,” said Senator Markey. “Our job in Congress is to advocate for and celebrate every American, and today on Trans Day of Visibility – and every other day of the year – we recommit to the work of creating a more equitable and inclusive society.”  “At a time when trans rights are under attack in state houses and by school boards, it is more important than ever to support transgender people and especially children. On International Transgender Day of Visibility, I am especially proud of Pennsylvania’s own Dr. Rachel Levine, a renowned physician and the highest-ranking transgender official ever to serve in the federal government. She has transcended hate and bigotry throughout her time in public service and has never wavered in her leadership or her commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians and Americans,” said Senator Casey.  “Despite the progress we’ve made toward equality, trans people—particularly trans people of color—continue to face discrimination and attacks. On this International Transgender Day of Visibility and always, I stand in solidarity with trans people everywhere and celebrate their perseverance, vibrance, and the important contributions they make to our society. I’ll keep fighting until all transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse people have the freedom to live authentically,” said Senator Hirono.  “Transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals still face violence, harassment, and discrimination based on their gender identity and gender expression – that must end. Recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility is an important step in celebrating their rights to live openly, and their contributions to our country and the world. We have to keep fighting for full equality and to protect individuals from targeted violence and persecution based on gender identity or expression – I’m glad to be with Senator Schatz in this fight,” said Senator Warren.  “On this International Transgender Day of Visibility and always, we celebrate the resilience of transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming Americans and their basic right to be their most authentic selves without fear, shame or discrimination,” said Senator Duckworth. “As the transgender community continues to endure horrific, targeted violence and with a wave of anti-transgender bills being proposed in states across the country, I’m proud to join Senator Schatz and my colleagues to introduce this resolution to commemorate Transgender Day of Visibility and send a strong, unified message to our fellow Americans: we see you, we hear you and we will never stop working to advance true equality for all of us.”  “The transgender community is diverse, resilient, and strong,” said Senator Rosen. “I'm proud to help introduce this resolution recognizing Trans Day of Visibility and raising awareness of the discrimination and violence the trans community still endures. No one should have to ever live in fear or experience violence for being who they are.”  “On Transgender Day of Visibility, I’m reminded of the strength and bravery of all transgender individuals — especially our nation’s trans youth. Everyone in this country deserves to be seen, respected, and loved. Sadly, this is not the case for many, as transgender Americans continue to face intolerance, violence, and barriers to opportunity. Today, and every day, we must continue to lift up these brave individuals to ensure their stories are heard and that they have equal protection under the law,” said Senator Carper.  “Today, we celebrate the lives—the joy, the contributions, the perseverance and so much more—of trans and non-binary people here in the United States and around the world,” said Senator Wyden. “As attacks against the LGBTQ+ community continue to plague our nation, we are reminded today of our shared humanity and goals for a more equitable world. Today and every day, I am fighting tooth and nail to protect the rights of trans youth, veterans, and folks in Oregon and across the country to get the gender-affirming care and treatment they seek to continue to be their true selves.”  “International Transgender Day of Visibility is an opportunity for us to celebrate the contributions, successes and resilience of trans people,” said Senator Bennet. “As the transgender community continues to face an onslaught of bigoted, reprehensible attacks on their humanity, I'll continue working in the Senate to take much-needed steps to protect trans people in Colorado and across the country.”  International Transgender Day of Visibility was founded in 2009. Since then, the transgender community has seen many visible leaders in both government and popular culture.A similar resolution was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Jennifer Wexton (D-VA).

This would prevent the EPA from retroactively reducing 2020 or future finalized RVO levels.The Defend the Blend Act was introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Angie Craig (D-MN), and Ron Kind (D-WI).“Wisconsin’s farmers and producers put food on our tables and fuel in our tanks, and they deserve certainty and stability from the government,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am proud to support this legislation that will provide certainty for our farmers and our Made In Wisconsin renewable fuels industry, helping create and keep good paying jobs in small towns and rural areas.”###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-works-to-deliver-225-million-to-rebuild-wisconsin-bridges-,"Wisconsin has nearly 1,000 bridges rated in “poor” condition according to Department of TransportationWashington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin announced that Wisconsin will receive the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the inter-state highway system, $225 million over the next five years, made possible by the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law she voted for, which was signed into law by President Biden in November. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 979 Wisconsin bridges are in poor condition and in need of repair. “I voted for the bipartisan infrastructure legislation because it will create good paying jobs and put Wisconsin to work fixing our bridges,” said Senator Baldwin. “With 979 bridges in poor condition and in need of rebuilding, this investment will help Wisconsin fix the bridges most in need of repair. When we invest in fixing our bridges and roads, we are strengthening our supply chains, which will help lower the cost of goods for businesses and consumers.”Wisconsin is slated to receive $45 million for Fiscal Year 2022 under that Bridge Formula Program. In addition to providing funds to states to replace, rehabilitate, preserve, protect, and construct highway bridges, the Bridge Formula Program has dedicated funding for Tribal transportation facility bridges as well as “off-system” bridges, locally owned facilities which are those not on the federal-aid highway system. Earlier this year, Senator Baldwin announced that Wisconsin is receiving a $996.8 million in Fiscal Year 2022 from the FHWA under bipartisan infrastructure bill, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This funding will help reduce the backlog of major repairs for highways and bridges and increase the number of communities that have strategies to reduce traffic deaths and serious injuries.Baldwin previously announced Wisconsin will receive $997 million to upgrade Wisconsin roads and bridges, $142.7 million in infrastructure funding to rebuild the state’s water infrastructure, and at least $100 million to expand and improve broadband across the state. In total, the bipartisan infrastructure legislation is expected to provide Wisconsin with over $5 billion in federal highway formula funding over the next five years for highways and bridges. On an average annual basis, this is about 27 percent more than the State’s earlier Federal-aid highway formula funding.###"

As Vladimir Putin escalates his provocative aggression toward Ukraine, we must stand firm and hold the Kremlin accountable for their past actions and develop tools to deter future aggression. We are right to issue sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to punish Russia for using energy exports through existing pipelines as a destabilizing political tool against our European Allies and for its increasingly provocative military buildups on Ukraine’s border, and only reassess these sanctions if Russia’s actions improve. In addition, Congress should make clear that we will unleash more comprehensive sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine as a deterrent to Putin and that is why I also support the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022. Finally, I applaud the Biden Administration for working with our allies, including Germany, to make clear that if Russia does invade Ukraine, Nord Stream 2 will never become operational and Russia will face consequences for their actions with a punishing set of financial, technology and military sanctions.”###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-calls-on-fda-to-change-discriminatory-blood-donation-policies-to-address-national-blood-supply-shortage,"The Red Cross declared its first-ever national blood supply shortage this week, posing risk to patientsWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin led a group of Senators formally calling on Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Becerra and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Acting Commissioner Woodcock to act on the most up to date science and update its discriminatory blood donor deferral policies for men who have sex with men (MSM). With the Red Cross declaring its first-ever national blood shortage that is posing risks to patient care, with as much as one-quarter of hospital blood needs not currently being met, the FDA can take the long overdue step to remove the discriminatory practice, increasing the eligible blood donor base and helping address the crisis.In addition to decreasing the eligible donor base and depriving patients of needed blood, the current three month donor deferral blood donation policy for MSM unnecessarily stigmatizes and harms the LGBTQ+ community. The broad consensus among the medical community indicates that the current scientific evidence does not support these discriminatory restrictions, and that a policy focused on individual risk assessment rather than an effective ban on gay and bisexual men would be far more appropriate.“In light of the nation’s urgent blood supply crisis and to ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions during the pandemic, we urge you to swiftly update your current blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, based on individualized risk factors, and allow all potentially eligible donors to do so free of stigma. We also request a briefing in the next 30 days on the agency’s plan to update its MSM blood donation policies,” the Senators wrote. “Every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs a blood transfusion to survive. But right now, the FDA continues to use archaic, discriminatory criteria to determine an individual’s eligibility to donate blood based solely on their sexual orientation – not their individual risk factors – which is not rooted in science, limits access to crucial blood products, and stigmatizes one segment of society,” said David Stacy, Government Affairs Director of the Human Rights Campaign. ""The FDA instead should focus its considerations for blood donor deferrals based on risky behavior by any potential donor, regardless of one’s sexual orientation. This would both best ensure a safe blood supply and maximize the pool of blood donors. We thank Senator Baldwin and her colleagues for their leadership on this issue.”This letter is also signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Angus King (I-ME), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Tina Smith (D-MN), Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Alex Padilla (D-CA).A full version of this letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary Becerra and Acting Commissioner Woodcock,We write to express our alarm at the nationwide shortage of blood and blood products, which has placed patient care and safety at risk. For the first time, the nation’s leading blood donation organizations, including the Red Cross, have declared a national blood supply crisis due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We urge the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to quickly act on the best available science and update its outdated and discriminatory blood donor deferral policies for men who have sex with men (MSM), a long overdue step that would dramatically increase the eligible donor base.It is critical that all patients have access to the health care services they need during this pandemic, and for many, the availability of blood and blood products is a necessary component of care. Unfortunately, a significant drop in the number of donations during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of available blood. The Red Cross, America’s Blood Centers, and AABB, formerly the American Association of Blood Banks, have declared a nationwide blood supply crisis for the first time, as the nation experiences its worst blood shortfall in over a decade.  In recent weeks, hospitals have had less than a single day’s supply of critical blood products, and these organizations have had to limit distribution to health facilities in need. In fact, the Red Cross has reported that as much as one-quarter of hospital blood needs are not currently being met.While no single solution can fully solve these challenges, the FDA has the ability to take a simple and science-based step to dramatically increase the donor base and help address this crisis. In fact, the agency responded to our previous correspondence and took an encouraging step in the right direction during the early days of the pandemic, shortening the deferral period for MSM from 12 months down to three months in March of 2020.However, any policy that continues to categorically single out the LGBTQ+ community is discriminatory and wrong. Given advances in blood screening and safety technology, a time-based policy for gay and bisexual men is not scientifically sound, continues to effectively exclude an entire group of people, and does not meet the urgent demands of the moment. And further, with increased uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which significantly reduces the likelihood that an HIV-negative individual will acquire HIV, many more gay and bisexual men are aware of their HIV status and are taking steps to eliminate their personal risk. Instead of the current categorical deferral guidelines, we must adopt evidence-based policies focused on assessment of an individual’s risk, not inaccurate and antiquated stereotypes.All over the world, other countries have led on this issue by scrapping their discriminatory blood donation policies. In October of last year, Israel removed all restrictions on MSM blood donation.  And just last month, Canada’s blood regulatory agency proposed removing all screening questions focused on gender and sexuality.  The tide is turning, and the data support this change.In light of the nation’s urgent blood supply crisis and to ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions during the pandemic, we urge you to swiftly update your current blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, based on individualized risk factors, and allow all potentially eligible donors to do so free of stigma. We also request a briefing in the next 30 days on the agency’s plan to update its MSM blood donation policies.Thank you for your attention to this important issue.###"

Particularly in the context of rising COVID-19 caseloads stemming from the spread of the Omicron variant, our nation’s health care workers deserve a permanent, enforceable standard that will ensure their health and safety as they continue to work on the front lines of the pandemic response,” the Senators wrote.In June of 2021, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect the workers who have shouldered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide clear standards detailing health care employers’ responsibilities to the safety of their workers. The standard required employers to identify and control COVID-19 hazards in the workplace, provide access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and adequate ventilation systems, and ensure workers are notified of workplace exposures to COVID-19. This standard also gave health care workers a tool against which to measure their workplace practices, and recourse to OSHA if they felt their workplace was out of compliance.On December 27, 2021, six months after promulgation of the ETS, OSHA announced it was not ready to issue a permanent rule, and let the non-recordkeeping portions of the temporary standard expire. When OSHA issued the ETS in June 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that 491,816 health care workers had contracted COVID-19 and 1,611 had died. Today, those numbers have nearly doubled, with the CDC reporting that 848,028 health care workers across the nation have contracted COVID-19. Without a permanent rule, the health and well-being of our nation’s health care workers are at risk.The letter, led by U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), calls on OSHA to reverse course and put forth a permanent, enforceable standard, given the fact that health care workers still face serious safety challenges and workplace risks. Today, more than 120,000 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 nationwide, further straining overworked health care workers and hospitals facing severe staffing shortages. Recent reporting shows that overworked doctors, nurses, and staff have been forced to continue working in unsafe conditions and are concerned for their health and safety.This letter is also signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Chris Murphy (D-CT). Congresswoman Dingell led a similar letter in the House of Representatives that has more than 100 co-signers.This letter is endorsed by the AFL-CIO, NYS AFL-CIO, SEIU, 1199SEIU, 32BJ SEIU, and National Nurses United.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-supports-legislation-to-give-every-american-lifesaving-n95-masks,"More than 50 Democratic Colleagues Sponsor the Masks for All Act in the House and SenateWASHNGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is supporting lifesaving legislation to manufacture and distribute highly-protective N95 masks to every person in America.The Masks for All Act, reintroduced by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and supported by more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives, would provide every person in the U.S. a free package of three N95 respirator masks. This includes individuals who are experiencing homelessness or living in group settings such as prisons, shelters, college dorms, and assisted living facilities, as well as all workers in health care settings, including doctors, nurses, clinical staff, and support staff from administrative and janitorial, to food service.“Since the beginning of this pandemic I’ve been calling on the U.S. government to increase the national production of the medical supplies we need to fight this public health crisis. I have long supported unlocking the full power of the Defense Production Act to scale up production of Made in America personal protective equipment and medical supplies, including N95 masks,” said Senator Baldwin. “As Americans are urged to upgrade the quality of the masks they wear, I want to make sure everyone has access to an American-made N95 mask, and this legislation will help make that happen and save lives.”Developed in consultation with health experts, the Masks for All Act would require the federal government to use all available authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to eliminate shortages of N95 respirator masks and distribute them to the public as soon as possible. The proposal would use the United States Postal Service for distribution and set up pick-up sites at convenient community locations that are already providing essential services, such as Post Offices, pharmacies, schools, public transportation stations, and COVID-19 testing sites. It would also end the U.S. reliance on China and other countries for this essential lifesaving equipment.“As we face the rapidly spreading omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal,” said Senator Sanders. “Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N95 masks, one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the Covid virus. It is an absolute scandal that in the richest country in the history of the world, high-quality masks are not more readily available to frontline workers, health care workers, and all Americans. We are proposing that we do what our public health experts and scientists say we must do: provide all of our people with high-quality, N95 masks without cost, which could prevent death and suffering and save huge amounts of health care dollars.”According to recent reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering updating its mask guidance to recommend N95 or KN95 masks. When the CDC initially issued mask guidance in 2020, N95 masks were reportedly not recommended for the general public out of concern of shortages for health care workers. Health officials now say there is not a N95 shortage. However, the public and health care facilities continue to experience access issues, and counterfeit masks remain a problem.Studies have shown that the widespread use of face masks could prevent tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, while other studies indicate universal mask wearing could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. Today, the benefits of widespread N95 use would be even greater. According to recent data, an N95 respirator mask provides the individual wearer with at least 2.5 hours of protection against an unmasked person infected with the Omicron variant, compared to just 20 minutes of protection if they are wearing a cloth mask or 30 minutes if they are wearing a surgical mask.To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over 60 million Americans and killed more than 841,000, and just this week, the U.S. reported a record-breaking 1.35 million new coronavirus infections in one day – the highest daily total in the world.The legislation is also co-sponsored by Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Ed Markey (MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-calls-for-tps-designations-for-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined 32 of her Senate Democratic colleagues in formally requesting that the Biden administration grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) re-designations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a new TPS designation for Guatemala.In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the senators expressed their concern with the worsening humanitarian conditions across Central America being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple devastating natural disasters, all of which have contributed to an uptick in outmigration from the region.“The crisis in Central America is urgent. ... TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration,” the senators wrote. “It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration.”Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.“Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. … Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media,” the senators continued. “The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region.”The letter was led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and it was also signed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Tina Smith (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jack Reed (D-RI), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tom Carper (D-DE), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL).A copy of the letter is available here and below. Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken,We write to express our concerns about ongoing humanitarian needs in Central America and to appeal for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and a new TPS designation for Guatemala. It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration. The Guatemalan government has requested a TPS designation, and U.S. Embassies have issued disaster declarations for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in recognition of the urgent needs. TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. Lastly, such designations would be consistent with the Administration’s commitments to address climate migration.The crisis in Central America is urgent. In the past year, the region has experienced extreme weather events, including two hurricanes followed by a months-long drought. According to the World Food Program (WFP), farmers in the region face the worst dry farming season in 35 years. Hunger in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua has increased almost fourfold over the past two years, according to WFP, from 2.2 million people in 2018 to close to 8 million people in 2021. Eight in ten households are resorting to crisis coping measures, selling their lands, tools, and livestock, and missing meals or eating less nutritious meals. It will take years to repair damage to roads, schools, bridges, wells, and other physical infrastructure caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which continue to impede citizens’ livelihoods. The pressures have led to an uptick in outmigration from the region. In January, 15 percent of people surveyed by WFP said they were making concrete plans to migrate — double the number two years ago. Media report that the region’s citizens are having to choose between migrating or facing hunger. Despite U.S. Embassies’ disaster declarations, which activated the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance, 8.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in July 2021, including 5.5 million who were in desperate need of food as of September 2021, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network.The International Monetary Fund says that remittances initially supported the region’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but tropical storms Eta and Iota interrupted progress, damaging crops and halting manufacturing. In 2020, Honduras’ GDP dropped nine percent, El Salvador’s GDP dropped nearly eight percent, Nicaragua’s dropped two percent, and Guatemala’s by 1.8 percent. The IMF supported the region with emergency financing to cope with these shocks. However, the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging vaccination campaigns, especially in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, will prolong the region’s economic recovery.Combined, the effects of the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly exacerbated food insecurity, violence, and led to rising social tensions. Forced displacement continues to plague the region. Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. On November 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights named El Salvador the most dangerous Latin American country for women. Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media.TPS is a humanitarian tool used by both Democratic and Republican administrations to provide relief for individuals who are unable to return to countries facing extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region. They would also provide immediate and tangible humanitarian benefits to new status holders and help mitigate the factors driving dangerous outmigration by securing life-saving remittances.It is our view that El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua meet the standards for TPS. We look forward to working closely with and supporting the Biden administration as it take this important step to uphold humanitarian protections, safeguard U.S. national security interests, and defend American families. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-applauds-enforcement-of-usmca-dairy-provisions-victory-for-wisconsin-dairy-farmers-and-cheesemakers," Baldwin called on the Trump administration to enforce the USMCA dairy provisions in 2020WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin is applauding an announcement that a dispute settlement panel brought under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has ruled in favor of the United States and found that Canada violated its commitment by reserving most of its dairy tariff-rate quota for the exclusive use of Canadian processors. The decision means Canada must change the way it grants special access to its shielded dairy market. In 2020, Senator Baldwin called on Trump administration to enforce the USMCA dairy provision to ensure fair market access for American dairy products. Fairness in market access honors commitments made to Wisconsin farmers, whose milk makes Wisconsin cheeses and other products renowned—and in demand—around the world.“I am proud to have fought to ensure that our trade deals are delivering on their commitments to our farmers and providing real, usable market access for Wisconsin’s high-quality dairy products,” said Senator Baldwin. “I appreciate the trade panel’s decision in holding our partners accountable to their commitments because our carefully negotiated trade deals must actually create the opportunities for new markets in order to make a difference for rural Wisconsin. This is a welcome win for our hardworking farmers and Wisconsin’s agriculture economy.”“The USMCA Panel’s decision to enforce the allocation of additional market access is a major step forward for Canadian consumers to be able to enjoy world class cheese from United States cheesemakers. We have had many Canadian Retail outlets wanting more cheese, we will now have a more cost-effective way of expanding our exports to Canada,” said Jeff Schwager, Chief Executive Officer, Sartori Company, headquartered in Plymouth, Wisconsin.“The equitable allocation of import quota is critical to ensuring that U.S. dairy processors have fair access to Canadian markets and consumers. This report confirmed the United States’ concern that Canada violated the USMCA when it limited access to import quotas almost exclusively to its own dairy and food processors,” said John Umhoefer, Executive Director, Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association.###"

As the nation continues to battle the spread of the Delta variant and confronts the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant, easy access to free rapid COVID-19 tests will be even more important.” The letter was also signed by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). You can read the letter here and below.The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryDepartment of Health and Human Services200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201Dear Secretary Becerra:Thank you for your continued leadership to combat the spread of the Omicron variant and a new winter strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We appreciate your continued work to improve the federal response to COVID-19 and your plan’s prioritization of expanded access to free at-home COVID-19 testing.  As you work to draft guidance to allow Americans with private health insurance to be reimbursed for rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests, we urge you to take steps to make this process as seamless as possible for individual patients.  Rapid tests are a critical tool in slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.  These tests can help people learn if they have COVID-19, and are critical to informing when they should stay home to protect themselves and others.  Furthermore, rapid tests can identify 98 percent of cases in which a person is still infectious with COVID-19.  As the nation continues to battle the spread of the Delta variant and confronts the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant, easy access to free rapid COVID-19 tests will be even more important. We appreciate that the Administration recognizes the importance of making tests more accessible, including the recent announcement that the federal government will purchase 500 million rapid COVID-19 tests and distribute them for free to Americans who order them online.  We look forward to receiving additional information about this initiative in a forthcoming briefing with the White House COVID-19 Response Team.In addition, we appreciate that the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury will issue sub-regulatory guidance to allow individuals who purchase over-the-counter (OTC) rapid COVID-19 tests to seek reimbursement from their private health insurance plans.  Finally, we applaud the Administration’s announcement that the federal government will provide 50 million rapid COVID-19 tests to people without health insurance through community health centers, rural health clinics, and other community sites.  These points of access will be critical for individuals who do not have access to reliable, high-speed internet.   As you move to draft new regulations and implement policies to expand access to rapid COVID-19 tests, we seek answers to the following questions.  We ask for your responses by January 13, 2022. Thank you again for your work to expand access to rapid COVID-19 tests and to lead us out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  We look forward to reviewing your responses to our questions.###"

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-supports-reintroduction-of-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-guarantee-tribal-health-authorities-access-to-the-strategic-national-stockpile,"Indian Health Service and other tribal health organizations currently lack guaranteed, direct access to federal repository of drugs and medical supplies for emergenciesWashington, D.C. – United States Senator Tammy Baldwin is supporting the reintroduction of the Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act. The bipartisan and bicameral legislation would guarantee that the Indian Health Service (IHS), tribal health authorities, and urban Indian organizations have access to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), a federal repository of drugs and medical supplies that can be tapped if a public health emergency could exhaust local supplies.Currently, IHS and tribal health authorities' access to the SNS is limited and is not guaranteed in the SNS statute. In contrast, states' and large municipalities' public health authorities have ready, direct access to the SNS. “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic demands that our tribal communities in Wisconsin have direct access to critical medical supplies, medications, and equipment that can save lives,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act will support our Native communities, prevent supply shortages, and reduce health disparities that this pandemic has exposed.”“Tribes have been exercising self-governance and self-determination for hundreds of years, and tribal governments have proven time and again that we have the ability to self-govern,” said Tehassi Hill, Oneida Nation Chairman. “Given the dramatic health disparities in our communities, it is beyond the pale that we still do not have direct access to the lifesaving resources from the national stockpile. I am grateful for Senator Baldwin’s decision to support this bill.  She has always been a vocal defender of our sovereignty and used her time in the Senate to address long-standing inequities such as those that would be remedied by the Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act.”The Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act was reintroduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Representatives Tom Cole (R-OK), Co-Chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus, and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), a member of the Congressional Native American Caucus. The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tina Smith (D-MN), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS), Co-Chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus.The Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act is supported by the National Indian Health Board, the National Congress of American Indians, the National Council of Urban Indian Health, United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, Seattle Indian Health Board, and the Friends Committee on National Legislation.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-urges-hhs-to-address-unmet-mental-health-needs-of-transgender-youth,"Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, joined a letter led by Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT), urging the Department of Health and Human Services’ Behavioral Health Coordinating Council (BHCC) to take steps to address an unmet need in caring for transgender and gender expansive youth by providing guidance for best practices for inpatient mental health care.U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) also signed the letter.“Nationally, adolescent mental health providers have expressed concern for the increasing need for adolescent behavioral health services. We have also heard from health care providers about the need to answer an urgent call for the unmet mental health needs for transgender and gender expansive (TGE) adolescents, including exploring, non-binary, agender, genderfluid and queer youth,” the senators wrote. “Our goal is to help mental health providers offer the best care they can to the nation’s TGE youth without a delay in treatment.”The senators continued: “While behavioral health and pediatric organizations have published resources regarding TGE health care, we have heard from hospital providers they are seeking guidance on best practices for serving gender diverse youth in community residential and inpatient mental health settings. Reports addressing gender-affirming care largely focus on care beginning at the front desk, the importance of educating staff, congruent documentation practices in electronic medical records, understanding terminology, pronoun usage, and acknowledging patients by their chosen names and not their given or legal names whenever possible.”“As the BHCC works to bring together leadership across the Department to provide more equitable behavioral health care, we ask that you consider ways to improve and communicate best practices for inpatient and residential mental health care for boarding adolescent TGE youth. Importantly, we ask you include the voices of these youth at the table,” the senators concluded.The full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Assistant Secretaries Levine and Delphin-Rittmon,Nationally, adolescent mental health providers have expressed concern for the increasing need for adolescent behavioral health services. We have also heard from health care providers about the need to answer an urgent call for the unmet mental health needs for transgender and gender expansive (TGE) adolescents, including exploring, non-binary, agender, genderfluid and queer youth. As co-chairs, we encourage the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council (BHCC), along with experts in the field of adolescent transgender care, to offer guidance on best practices for adolescent inpatient mental health care for these youth. Our goal is to help mental health providers offer the best care they can to the nation’s TGE youth without a delay in treatment. The focus of this request is for the pressing needs of hospital or residential care even as we recognize the need for guidance across all settings of mental health care.The Trevor Project released the National Survey of LGBTQ Youth Mental Health and noted alarming data that more than half of transgender and non-binary youth seriously contemplated killing themselves in 2020. The survey participants were diverse: 45 percent youth of color and 38 percent identifying as transgender or non-binary. There was variation in the rates of suicide attempts across youth depending on participants’ race and culture, with 12 percent for white youth compared to 31 percent for Native/Indigenous youth, 21 percent for Black youth, 21 percent for multiracial youth, 18 percent for Latinx youth, and 12 percent for Asian Pacific Islander youth.While behavioral health and pediatric organizations have published resources regarding TGE health care, we have heard from hospital providers they are seeking guidance on best practices for serving gender diverse youth in community residential and inpatient mental health settings. Reports addressing gender-affirming care largely focus on care beginning at the front desk, the importance of educating staff, congruent documentation practices in electronic medical records, understanding terminology, pronoun usage, and acknowledging patients by their chosen names and not their given or legal names whenever possible. There is a dearth of guidance relative to boarding TGE adolescent patients for inpatient or community-based residential mental health care. As a result, providers report delays in psychiatric emergency departments while administrators explore where to place TGE youth needing inpatient care due to questions such as who might be an appropriate roommate and what restroom a patient should use.Approximately 2 percent of youth identify as transgender.  In the United States, over 1.9 million youth are estimated to be LGBT between 13-17 years of age, with almost 150,000 self-identifying as transgender. TGE youth may experience a host of mental health burdens including anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts, largely due to societal stigma and lack of access to care. Transgender youth  who are 15 and older can be particularly vulnerable, and would benefit from specialized support beyond their mental health needs.  They experience homelessness, unemployment, poverty, uninsured status, and physical and verbal abuse at higher rates than cisgender individuals. The need for guidelines for inpatient, residential care, and specialty care is essential for TGE youth to receive equal treatment and access to care. Alongside this is the opportunity to improve the quality of patient data collected, including sexual orientation and gender identity data, so that health providers, researchers, and advocates can better understand the prevalence of and need for mental health care for TGE youth.There are examples of the federal government providing such guidance. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration promulgated guidelines for organizations treating substance abuse for LGBT individuals. Also, regulations for youth experiencing homelessness includes provisions for best practices, including respectfully asking all youth to identify their gender on forms, including terms such as transgender, and to assign housing based on gender identity. Lastly, the Office of Refugee Resettlement provides guidance for unaccompanied children and requires providers to consider gender self-identification for housing placements.As the BHCC works to bring together leadership across the Department to provide more equitable behavioral health care, we ask that you consider ways to improve and communicate best practices for inpatient and residential mental health care for boarding adolescent TGE youth. Importantly, we ask you include the voices of these youth at the table.Thank you for your consideration.###"

Harmon and Private John R. Peirson Post Office.” The legislation honors Captain Robert C. Harmon and his half-brother, Private John R. Peirson, who were both killed during World War II.Captain Harmon, on his 51st mission, was shot down over France a week before the D-Day invasion in Europe. A year later, Pt. Peirson was killed during the Easter Day assault on the island of Okinawa. Though Captain Harmon's remains were never found, the brothers are buried side-by-side at the Fort Snelling Military Cemetery in Minneapolis.“Captain Robert Harmon and Private John Peirson heroically gave their lives serving our country during World War II,” said Senator Baldwin. “I’m proud to do right by them and their family by designating this New Richmond post office in their name. These brave American heroes deserve to have their service and sacrifice to our nation honored.”“Thank you Senator Baldwin and Senator Johnson for recognizing these two American heroes who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation during World War II. We, in the New Richmond community and around the country are incredibly proud of the service of Captain Harmon and Pt. Peirson and offer our eternal gratitude to their family” said Fred Horne, Mayor of New Richmond.“We are thankful to Senators Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson for their bipartisan leadership on efforts to rename the New Richmond Post Office after brothers Captain Robert C. Harmon and Private John R. Peirson,” said the Harmon and Peirson families. “This is indeed a big day for our family, but it’s a huge day for veterans. As it shows that our city, our state and our grateful nation have not and will not forget the sacrifices the men and women of our Armed Forces have made on behalf of all of us.”“Captain Robert Harmon and Private John Peirson were local American heroes who gave the ultimate sacrifice to preserve and defend American during World War II,” said Karol Simon, Commander of the Butler Harmon American Legion Post 80. “I am pleased to see Senators Baldwin and Johnson coming together to honor these two brave half-brothers and demonstrate that we have not forgotten the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make every day.”On September 13, 2021, the City of New Richmond passed a resolution in support of renaming the New Richmond USPS after the half-brothers. In addition, the American Legion Butler-Harmon Post 80, St. Croix County Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 10818 and the New Richmond Chamber of Commerce also support this effort.In the last Congress, Baldwin and Johnson first introduced their bipartisan legislation and it passed the Senate in November 2019 but it did not move forward in the House of Representatives so the Senators are reintroducing the bill this Congress.

For months, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 60,000 individuals, has been negotiating a new contract with the producers.“The key issues in this negotiation, as we’ve come to understand them, are about worker dignity and basic human necessities. We are unified in our belief in the importance of living wages, sustainable benefits, and reasonable rest periods between shifts and during the workday,” the members wrote in the letter. “We ask that the AMPTP negotiate collaboratively with these workers to reach a fair contract and address the basic human needs that will allow them to do their jobs safely and with dignity.”Click here to read the letter from 119 members of Congress or read the full text below:Dear Ms. Lombardini:As the elected representatives of constituents who make a living working behind-the-scenes in motion picture and television production, we urge you to negotiate fair successor contracts with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). We support the principles of adequate sleep, meal breaks and living wages for all workers.These workers have risked their health and safety for the last year, working through the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that the motion picture and television production industry emerged intact. Production has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, due in no small part to the essential role these workers play in the creative process. The entertainment you jointly produce is helping to heal our nation.The current contract under negotiation covers approximately 60,000 motion picture and television production workers across the country. Failure to reach an agreement would threaten not only the livelihoods of these workers, but also their family members who rely upon work in your industry, sending shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy and the industry.The key issues in this negotiation, as we’ve come to understand them, are about worker dignity and basic human necessities. We are united in our belief in the importance of livable wages, sustainable benefits, and reasonable rest periods between shifts and during the workday.Reportedly, IATSE members are mobilizing in preparation for a nationwide strike authorization vote on October 1, 2021, because of the announcement that AMPTP does not intend to make a counteroffer. A strike would dramatically disrupt the industry, the economy, and the communities we represent. We are hopeful that both sides can negotiate in good faith and reach a consensus agreement, which necessitates both parties continuing to participate in ongoing negotiations.We ask that the AMPTP negotiate collaboratively with these workers to reach a fair contract and address the basic human needs that will allow them to do their jobs safely and with dignity.Sincerely,Members of CongressCC: The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees### "
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-helps-unveil-new-captured-courts-report-on_texas-assault-on-reproductive-rights,"Senate Democrats reveal dark-money scheme behind anti-abortion crusadeWashington, DC – United States Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of Senate Democrats in releasing a new report in their Captured Courts series on the corrosive effect of a Supreme Court controlled by dark-money interests on women’s reproductive freedom.The new report focuses on the “shadow docket” ruling by Republican appointees to the Court that permitted Texas’s S.B.8 anti-abortion law to proceed—virtually banning abortion care and, as Justice Sotomayor said in her dissent, “deputiz[ing] the state’s citizens as bounty hunters, offering them cash prizes for civilly prosecuting their neighbors’ medical procedures.” Right-wing donor interests have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to stack the Court with anti-abortion justices like Amy Coney Barret, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, who have already pushed abortion care almost entirely out of reach for one in ten U.S. women of reproductive age with the Texas ruling. Now, the Court is delivering for those donors, and appears poised to strike at the heart of reproductive freedom—the decades-old precedent of Roe v. Wade.“We cannot allow our courts to be used as a political tool, especially when constitutionally-protected, reproductive health care rights are threatened across the country,” said Senator Baldwin. “This report sheds light on the massive dark-money campaign that has funneled millions of dollars into influencing our judicial system, tipping the scales of justice in favor of powerful special interests and big donors who are attacking the reproductive freedom and health of women across the country.”“The vast majority of Americans don’t want government intruding on a woman’s fundamental constitutional right to her own reproductive health care choices. That’s why the dark-money forces behind S.B.8 engineered an anti-abortion majority on the Supreme Court – to do things the American people won’t abide from elected branches of government,” said Senator Whitehouse. “Our report reveals the massive dark-money campaign to guarantee outcomes favoring right-wing donors, and sheds light on the secretive ‘shadow docket’ that Republican justices use to shield their decisions from scrutiny.”“Every woman in our country has the right to make her own reproductive health choices. The Supreme Court’s decision on Texas’ harsh abortion ban was an appalling attack on these personal freedoms,” said Senator Stabenow. “This report shines a bright light on how Republicans and well-funded groups are using our judicial system to take away the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions.”The new report shows how millions in funding from corporate special interests and ultra-wealthy donors like the Koch brothers fed challenges to women’s access to reproductive care. For decades, that network of donors invested in groups and activities with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Koch-funded groups like the Concerned Women for America, Americans United for Life, and the Judicial Crisis Network drafted anti-abortion legislation for state legislatures and funded ad campaigns to support the confirmation of anti-abortion judges and justices. They also guided the Trump administration to appoint swaths of conservative judges who often lack basic qualifications, but are wholly committed to advancing the conservative agenda.Now, that exorbitant spending is paying off. According to the Guttmacher Institute, over 500 abortion restrictions have been introduced this year across 47 states, and over 90 of those have already been passed and signed, including 11 bans on abortion. Meanwhile, the new 6-3 Republican majority on the Court is now set to hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to reconsider whether pre-viability abortion bans are constitutional, despite clear precedents settling that question for almost 50 years.The report details actions Congress should take now to protect abortion access, including passing the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021. This bill would establish a statutory right for health care professionals to provide abortion care and the right for their patients to receive care, free from bans and medically unnecessary restrictions that single out abortion care. Congress should also pass measures, such as the Judicial Ads Act, to combat dark money influence over judicial nominations.Read the new report here.###"

The bill would establish a formal commission to investigate, document, and acknowledge past injustices of the federal government's Indian Boarding School Policies. This includes attempts to terminate Native cultures, religions, and languages; assimilation practices; and human rights violations. The commission would also develop recommendations for Congress to aid in healing of the historical and intergenerational trauma passed down in Native families and communities and provide a forum for victims to speak about personal experiences tied to these human rights violations.“As a nation we must do a better job at acknowledging the lasting trauma and pain caused by the Indian Boarding School Policies,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Truth and Healing Commission is a critical first step for mending the wounds caused by these harmful actions and I am proud to support this legislation. We cannot gloss over this dark and tragic period of our nation’s history and I am grateful for the work and support of my colleagues to ensure that we never forget the great injustices committed against Native communities.”""The Indian Boarding School Policies are a stain in America's history, and it's long overdue that the federal government reckon with this history and its legacy. These policies and practices caused unimaginable suffering and trauma for survivors, victims, and the thousands of Native families who remain impacted by them. This is why Congresswoman Davids, Congressman Cole, and I are introducing legislation that would establish a Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies. This Commission would formally investigate the past wrongs of the federal government's attempts to terminate the cultures, religions, and languages of Native communities and respond to the ongoing historical and intergenerational trauma devastating tribal communities today,” said Senator Warren. “The U.S. Indian Boarding School Policies stripped children from their families and their cultures—actions that continue to impact Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities today. Our country must do better to acknowledge its legacy and understand the full truth of these policies,” said Representative Davids. “This commission is a critical step to allow Native families and communities to begin to heal from the intergenerational trauma. I am proud to introduce this bill in the House alongside Congressional Native American Caucus Co-Chair Tom Cole and our colleagues.”“Establishing the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policy will provide an important step toward resolving and healing from one of our nation’s darkest periods,” said Congressman Cole, Co-Chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus. “While we cannot erase this difficult chapter in our history, studying and understanding the societal, cultural and personal impact of forciblya removing Native American and Alaskan Native children from their homes, families, communities and heritage for nearly a century is certainly worth investigating. I am proud to support the creation of this investigative commission to provide answers for these communities.”“We are in a moment in history where the wound of unresolved grief from Indian boarding schools is being ripped wide open. The truth is being unearthed and yet so much more is still unknown,” said Christine Diindiisi McCleave, CEO of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS) & Citizen of Turtle Mountain Ojibwe Nation. “It is time for a federal Truth Commission to provide answers to the thousands of relatives of those children who were taken, went missing, or died at these schools. The Truth and Healing Commission on U.S. Indian Boarding School Policies will be the beginning of profound healing for the Indigenous Peoples of this country.”The Indian Boarding School Policies were implemented by the federal government to strip American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children of their Indigenous identities, beliefs, and languages by forcibly removing children from their tribal lands and families. According to NABS, it is estimated that by 1926, nearly 83 percent of AI/AN children, as young as 3 years old, were enrolled in one of at least 367 currently known Indian boarding schools across 30 states, resulting in human rights violations, including spiritual, physical, industrial, psychological, and sexual abuse, neglect, and trauma. The full effects of the Indian Boarding School Policies have never been appropriately addressed, resulting in long-standing historical and intergenerational trauma, cycles of violence and abuse, disappearance, premature deaths, and additional undocumented psychological trauma. Furthermore, the residual impact of the Indian Boarding School Policies remains evident in a lack of culturally inclusive and affirming curricula and historically inaccurate representation of Native people, history, and contributions. For generations, the federal government has failed to reckon with this history, or its legacy and the ongoing historical and intergenerational trauma. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act is an attempt to address this disgraceful chapter in history and begin healing for Native communities.This bill will build on steps that Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland has taken to address this need. On June 22, 2021, Secretary Haaland announced that the Interior would conduct an initial investigation of the Indian boarding school policies and their consequences, marking the start of the federal government’s reckoning with this painful legacy. This morning, the Department of the Interior announced that the Department will begin tribal consultations on this Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act is supported by a broad coalition of tribal nations, tribal organizations, educators, and human rights groups. “The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the U.S. Act would provide an important avenue for an investigation about the losses that occurred through the Indian Boarding School Policies and the lasting consequences of the violence of this attempted genocide. Only through a formal investigation which includes meaningful consultation with Tribal Nations and significant input from survivors and their descendants, can the US begin to reconcile with the past and can tribal communities begin to move toward healing from the egregious abuses which occurred,” said Juana Majel Dixon, NCAI Board Secretary and Traditional Councilwoman of the Pauma Band of Mission Indians, in a written statement. “National Congress of American Indians commends the bipartisan efforts of Senator Warren and Representatives Davids and Cole to address the systematic destruction of tribal cultures and communities, something which is long overdue.”“The National Indian Child Welfare Association greatly appreciates the efforts of Senator Warren and Representatives Davids and Cole to introduce the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act,” said the National Indian Child Welfare Association in a statement. “As we witness the international shock and outrage at the identification of mass burial sites and unmarked graves of Indigenous children in Canada who were residents of residential schools, we see the parallels to the boarding school era in the United States and the accounts from survivors of the horrific abuse they experienced. The legacy of those policies and practices is evident in Native communities today. This legislation is critical to exposing the truth about the individual and collective trauma that was imposed upon Native communities and furthering the process of healing for all Native people.”""Native communities have suffered loss of traditional thought and philosophy, culture, language, identity, land, and resources since 1491. The purpose of the act is respected, however over 500 years of broken promises and failures to uphold the trust responsibility will require more than just written policies,” said the National Indian Education Association (NIEA). “For this act to make effective and lasting change, Native communities and the US government MUST communicate, collaborate, and trust to determine the most appropriate ways for healing to begin for Native people. â€‹We are encouraged by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland's announcement on June 22, 2021 of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, and this codification in law of such an initiative will ensure that this investigation and documentation continues under future administrations.""“The Office of Hawaiian Affairs thanks Senator Warren, Representative Davids, and Representative Cole for introducing this bill to begin addressing the more than two-hundred-year history of American assimilation policies and practices that the federal government adopted in its treatment of generations of Native Americans, including Native Hawaiians,” said Carmen Hulu Lindsey, Chair, Board of Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. “We are particularly appreciative of the bill’s inclusion of Native Hawaiians in the Commission’s scope and on the Advisory Committee with at least two representatives of our community. We look forward to working with Senator Warren to not only bring to light the history of what happened in the Indian Boarding Schools and the boarding and day schools in Hawai‘i, but also take steps to address the lasting effects and inequities that these policies continue to have on Native children and communities across the country.”""The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), which comprises the nation's 37 Tribal Colleges and Universities, commends Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Congresswoman Sharice Davids (D-KS), and Congressman Tom Cole (R-OK) for their leadership in proposing a long overdue commission to study, document, and identify strategies for addressing the continuing traumatic impacts of the federal government's Indian boarding school policy,” said Carrie L. Billy, AIHEC President and CEO of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. “As TCUs, we believe strongly in the power of place-based and Tribal Nation-focused education rising from within us - from our own culture and language and connected to the air, land, water around us. That is the foundation of our future. But we cannot move forward unless we acknowledge and address all aspects of our past, including centuries of oppression, segregation, and even annihilation - the legacy of the boarding school experience. This landmark legislation will provide much-needed support for our transformative journey of healing, knowledge creation, and identity.""""USET SPF continues to insist that the United States atone for centuries of sins against Tribal Nations and Native people. Our hearts remain heavy with the weight of lasting intergenerational trauma caused by the horrors our ancestors faced at U.S.-run boarding schools. Hundreds of thousands of Native children were forcibly removed from their people and lost their culture, language, innocence-even their lives-at the hands of the federal government,” said Chief Kirk Francis, President of the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund. “The time is long overdue for the federal government and the American people to engage in honest reconciliation with the atrocities of the past, so that we can all move forward as citizens of a more just and honorable nation. Rep. Congresswoman Davids’ and Senator Warren's bill would not only provide an opportunity for this reckoning, it would also provide for the examination of modern-day assimilationist policies resulting in the continued theft of Native children from their Tribal communities. We offer our full support to this legislation.""“Federally funded boarding schools ripped AI/AN children from their families and their Tribal communities and contributed to the urbanization of AI/AN populations,” said Francys Crevier (Algonquin), CEO of the National Council for Urban Indian Health. “Today, over 70% of AI/AN people reside in urban areas, but only 1% of all Indian Health Service funding is for urban Indian health. We are pleased to see Senator Warren, Congresswoman Davids, and Congressman Cole introduce this legislation to create a commission to begin to heal the decades of historical trauma inflicted on our people and hope this will usher in a new era where the trust responsibility is better upheld to all Indigenous people.”“I thank Representative Davids and Cole and Senator Warren for amplifying the voices of boarding school survivors who speak truth to the grave injustices and intergenerational harm caused by the United States,"" said Abigail Echo-Hawk (Pawnee), Executive Vice President of the Seattle Indian Health Board and Director of the Urban Indian Health Institute. “These are the people that need to lead this effort. The ‘Truth and Healing Commission’ is a step forward, and we need to see more like it in order for our communities to heal.” “The time for this bill has long been coming since the founding of this country. It is time for the light to shine in the dark spaces of this country’s origins, its present reckoning, and the future of its soul as a country based on truth, justice, and healing. Will we live up to this aspiration?  Are we capable of doing so?  This bill gives us the opportunity to begin to do so,” said La quen náay Liz Medicine Crow (Haida/Tlingit), President and CEO of First Alaskans Institute. “As Alaska Natives our story is inextricably linked to all of our Indigenous relatives across this country. Every person freely brought to this country has benefited because of what has been done and is being done to our peoples, and worse our precious children bore the brunt of these atrocities. We need justice, we need love, and we need all those who now call this country home to stand beside us. Let us find all our children, bring them home, and help this country live up to its ideals and its promises to our Native Peoples.”“Today at Red Cloud, we openly acknowledge our institution was, at one point, explicitly involved in the destruction of the Lakota culture, language, and spirituality it now seeks to celebrate and revitalize. It is beyond time this nation acknowledges and reckons with the historical injustices experienced by Indigenous peoples due to the federal Indian Boarding School policy,” said the Red Cloud Indian School on the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act in a statement. “Healing is made possible when harm is admitted with unflinching honesty and work is done to right historical wrongs. The Truth and Healing Commission marks the beginning of a much-needed process in our nation. It is a process that we at Red Cloud Indian School have already begun locally. Our sincere hope is that this commission will spread awareness of this history, bring people to deeper understanding, and heal our community and Indigenous people across the country.”""Having run several boarding schools for American Indian and Alaska Native students ourselves, the Jesuits would welcome the opportunity to work with a federal Commission to shine the light of truth on this part of our own, and our country’s, history,” said Fr. Ted Penton, SJ, Secretary of Justice and Ecology of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States. “We participated fully with Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has proven an important step on the road towards right relationship with Indigenous peoples. A similar Commission is likewise essential in this country. We are greatly encouraged by the introduction of this bill and ask all members of Congress to support it.”“We cannot wait any longer. Our families have been suffering for too long. The Association on American Indian Affairs supports the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act so that we – as a nation – can finally begin the process of uncovering, accepting and healing from the forced assimilation and genocidal policies that our country once believed in,” said Shannon O’Loughlin, CEO of AAIA. “We must speak truth to these great harms of the past so that it never happens again to anyone’s children.”“The American Indian Catholic Schools Network believes this commission is an essential step for a meaningful movement of truth and healing. AICSN is honored to partner with NABS and other key players in this work as we commit each day to this work,” said the American Indian Catholic Schools Network (AICSN) in a statement.""The historical trauma resonating from this painful time in our collective history is not fully known by those outside of the American Indian community. The Inter Tribal Association of Arizona (ITAA) supports Senator Warren and Representative Davids in their efforts to bring healing to every American Indian family that still has the painful effects the Federal government's Indian boarding school policies,” said Maria Dadgar, (Piscataway), MBA, Executive Director, Inter Tribal Association of Arizona (ITAA). “The ""Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act,"" will create the pathway forward for national dialogue to take place and hopefully for the eventual healing of individuals and families that experienced trauma as result of the federal boarding school system. It is time to review the administrative history of this federal policy, its detrimental effects on the American Indian community, and the institutions that implemented this federal policy.”""The Fort Belknap Indian Community council strongly supports the proposed Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States Act. Boarding Schools were the government sponsored genocide of Indian people,” wrote Andy Werk Jr., President of Fort Belknap Indian Community in a letter of support. “We applaud the efforts of Senator Warren and U.S. Representative Sharice Davids in reviving this effort to document the boarding school policies and provide another avenue to help heal any past transgressions.”  ""The atrocities of the Indian Boarding School Policies can no longer be ignored, and the Federal Government must be accountable for the historical and intergenerational trauma inflicted on us by these policies,"" said Teri Gobin, Chairwoman of Tulalip Tribes“Our community is well aware of the damages our people suffered at the hands of the Indian Board School Policy adopted by the United States. The stories have been handed down and those impacts felt by many generations,” said Shelly R. Fyant, Chairwoman, Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribal Council. “The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes have embraced multiple efforts to heal ourselves and to improve our health and wellness overall. We support the creation of this committee to propel these efforts forward for the good of all people who have been impacted. We also do this to honor our ancestors who sacrificed so we could be here today.”View the complete list of supporters and their statements of support here. An online version of this release is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-passes-baldwin-rubio-resolution-for-national-spinal-cord-injury-awareness-month,"Washington, D.C. — The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan resolution from U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Marco Rubio’s (R-FL) designating September 2021 as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month. The resolution highlights the prevalence of spinal cord injuries and paralysis in the United States and applauds the work of those living with spinal cord injuries.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-bicameral-group-across-seven-states-in-urging-administration-to-increase-biofuels-usage,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a bicameral group of  lawmakers spanning seven states in a letter urging the Administration to increase biofuels usage and reject any reduction in biofuel blending requirements.After recent reports that the Administration may be considering lowering the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), the group raised serious concerns about the harm a reduction in biofuels usage could cause to the Administration’s clean energy goals and economic stability of the renewable fuels marketplace.“We have strong reservations about the potential for the Administration to destroy over 5 billion gallons of biofuel volume from the 2020, 2021, and 2022 RVOs. This action would directly undermine your commitment to address climate change and restore integrity to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” the Members wrote. “Every gallon of biofuels that is blended into our nation’s fuel supply displaces a gallon of oil and cuts carbon emissions…Reducing biofuel blending requirements will increase greenhouse gas emissions.”“Rather than exempting refiners of their obligations under the Clean Air Act, we urge the Administration to provide additional certainty and stability to the renewable fuels marketplace by issuing strong RVOs for 2021 and 2022, and declining to remand any gallons from the 2020 RVO. These actions will create jobs, drive American investment, and cut carbon emissions from the transportation sector,” the members continued.In September, Baldwin joined a bicameral group of colleagues on a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi urging them to include support for homegrown renewable fuels in the upcoming reconciliation package.Text of the letter is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-and-blumenthal-applaud-house-passage-of-the-womens-health-protection-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), lead sponsors in the Senate of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), applauded passage of the legislation in the House of Representatives, which approved WHPA in a 218-211 vote. With 48 cosponsors in the Senate, the legislation would guarantee equal access to abortion everywhere—and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services—free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship.“With passage of the Women's Health Protection Act in the House, we are sending a clear message that every woman in America, regardless of where she lives, deserves the freedom to make her own, personal decisions about her health care, her body and her family,” said Senator Baldwin. “When Roe v. Wade is under attack, as it is, millions of people are at risk of losing the freedom to make their own health care decisions, and women’s health is threatened. Our legislation creates a safeguard against the medically unnecessary bans and restrictions that are being placed on constitutionally-protected, reproductive health care. We must pass our legislation to protect the provider-patient relationship; protect the health care professionals that provide care, and protect the freedom, and right, of women to access this care without interference from politicians.”“A Senate vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act will hold lawmakers accountable for whether they will preserve access to abortion as a fundamental right,” Senator Blumenthal said. “The need for the Women’s Health Protection Act is indisputable in the face of cascading state restrictions eliminating access to abortion care. It is clear and straightforward in allowing medical professionals to decide to provide abortion care free from medically unnecessary restrictions. I applaud my partners in the House, led by Congresswoman Chu, on today’s strong showing of support and look forward to a vote in the Senate.”From Roe v. Wade in 1973 to Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized abortion as a constitutional right. However, anti-abortion advocates have worked for years at the state-level to pass laws meant to undermine or eliminate access to abortion care. In the last decade, state lawmakers have pushed through nearly 500 restrictive laws that make abortion difficult and, sometimes, impossible to access. Just this year, four states have passed bans on abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, before many people even know they’re pregnant. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Oklahoma attempted to ban abortion completely, and the Supreme Court recently decided to allow a restrictive Texas anti-abortion law to take effect, effectively outlawing abortion access in the state. WHPA would stop these attacks and ensure that abortion access first guaranteed under Roe is a reality for everyone, everywhere.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-bipartisan-group-urging-biden-to-press-bahrain-on-human-rights-violations,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin this week joined a bipartisan group of Senators in urging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to press Bahrain about their human rights abuses and pushing for more accountability.Joining Baldwin on the letter were Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.“For the past decade, the State Department and major human rights advocates have detailed a long list of serious and ongoing human rights abuses in Bahrain. These include, but are not limited to: arbitrary detention, torture, cruel and degrading treatment of prisoners, restrictions on freedom of the press, interference with peaceful assembly, and restrictions on political participation and religious practice. Recent reports by Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain and other organizations indicate that this disturbing record has grown worse since 2011, when Bahrainis took to the streets in peaceful protest and were met with violence,” the senators wrote.The senators asked Secretary Blinken to answer the following questions to help understand the Biden administration’s policy to improve the situation in Bahrain:“Bahrainis continue to call for agency and accountability, often at great risk to their safety and that of their families. We stand with them in urging you and the Biden-Harris administration to promote reform and respect for basic human rights in Bahrain and greater stability in the region,” the senators concluded. A copy of the full letter is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-bicameral-group-of-lawmakers-to-champion-inclusion-of-life-saving-medicaid-fix-in-reconciliation-legislation,"Baldwin: “Our Build Back Better Budget is the best opportunity we have to make a federal investment to expand access to quality health care coverage for working families”Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) joined a bicameral group of lawmakers to underline the critical importance of addressing the Medicaid coverage gap in the forthcoming reconciliation package.The lawmakers, all co-sponsors of the Medicaid Saves Lives Act originally introduced by Senator Baldwin and Senators Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA), highlighted the benefits of Medicaid, which in addition to saving lives has been proven to improve health outcomes, bolster health systems and strengthen public health.The news conference also follows Senators Baldwin, Warnock and Ossoff’s push last week to Senate leadership urging them to address closing the coverage gap as negotiations on the reconciliation package progress. Senators Baldwin, Warnock, and Ossoff were joined by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-SC) and Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-GA).Watch Senator Baldwin’s remarks here.A transcript of her remarks can be found below.Good morning!I want to start by thanking my colleagues from Georgia, Reverend Warnock and Senator Ossoff, for being steadfast partners in this fight to save lives and expand necessary health care coverage to some of our most vulnerable citizens.As many of you know, Republicans in 12 states, including Wisconsin and Georgia, have refused to fully expand Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act.For nearly a decade in Wisconsin, Republicans have rejected federal investments in BadgerCare, our health care coverage program for low-income Wisconsin residents, that would make 91,000 Wisconsinites eligible for high quality health care. Wisconsin Republicans have turned away $1.6 billion in federal funding that could provide BadgerCare coverage for some who are currently uninsured.To put this into perspective, that means they are denying the quality coverage that BadgerCare provides to someone working and only making $13,000 a year. $13,000 a year.That’s just wrong.I teamed up with my colleagues from Georgia so we could open the door to those who have been shut out and expand access to affordable health care, including preventive care, that people want and need.Waiting for Republicans in Wisconsin and the eleven other states that have refused to do the right thing is no longer a viable option.Our Build Back Better Budget is the best opportunity we have to make a federal investment to expand access to quality health care coverage for working families.By closing the coverage gap, studies show we would save an estimated 7,000 lives each year and could reduce $2 billion of medical debt.Health insurance isn’t just about coverage. It can improve so many different aspects of a person’s life and right now we have the opportunity to get it right, guided by our belief that health care should be a guaranteed right in America.In light of one of the greatest public health crises in the last century, a crisis that has had a disproportionate impact on our most vulnerable communities, the time to act is now. We must make sure that we provide affordable quality health care coverage to 91,000 people in Wisconsin, and the millions more who have suffered under Republican obstruction.The Build Back Better legislation that we are working to pass is focused on tax cuts for working families, lowering the costs of child care, health care, and prescription drugs, and creating good paying jobs.Our budget legislation will make the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes so we can invest in the economic security of working families. That includes making investments to expand health coverage.We face an urgent choice: do we keep an economy that serves the wealthiest and biggest corporations – or finally give working families a fair shot? This is our moment to prove to the American people that their government works for them – not just those at the top.I am grateful for the work of my colleagues here today and feel confident that we can get this done. ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-murray-pocan-reintroduce-tyler-clementi-higher-education-anti-harassment-act-to-address-campus-bullying-and-harassment,"The bill would require colleges and universities to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religionWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Patty Murray (D-WA), and Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) re-introduced the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2021, legislation to address bullying and harassment—including cyberbullying—at colleges and universities around the country. The lawmakers introduced the bill on the anniversary of the death of Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who tragically lost his life to suicide in 2010 after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him due to his sexual orientation.The bill would require colleges and universities to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion, and require schools to recognize “cyberbullying” as a form of harassment.""No student should live in fear of being who they are at school,"" said Senator Baldwin. ""By reintroducing this legislation, we are taking a strong step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to learn and succeed in safe and healthy environments. Everyone at our colleges and universities deserves to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.""“Every student deserves to feel safe, full stop. But for too many students, campus bullying and harassment just devastates their mental, emotional, and physical health—in particular LGBTQIA+ students, who are nearly twice as likely to face this type of abuse. And this is all in the middle of a pandemic that has made mental health issues even worse,” said Senator Murray. “Our legislation would require colleges to establish strong policies that ensure everyone—no matter who they are or who they love—can pursue higher education free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. I’m proud to join my colleagues in honoring Tyler Clementi’s life by working to make sure what happened to Tyler, never happens to another student.”“Today we honor the life of Tyler Clementi by reintroducing this critical legislation. No one should be bullied because of who they are or who they love,” said Rep. Pocan. “This bill will help ensure that students can learn in peace and not have to worry about living in fear or humiliation for being themselves.”                    Today, bullying and harassment are still widespread in higher education—and LGBTQIA+ students are nearly twice as likely to experience it as their non-LGBTQIA+ peers. The consequences can be severe for students’ mental health, particularly in light of the pandemic, which has compounded existing mental health challenges. In fact, throughout the pandemic, 65% of LGBTQIA+ college students faced moderate or severe mental health challenges—and 22% felt that they had no social or emotional support system.The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2021 would help address campus bullying and harassment and keep students safe by: “We are grateful to Congressman Pocan and Senators Murray and Baldwin for reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, and fully supporting this legislation,” said Jane Clementi, Tyler’s mother and CEO and Co-Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation. “We believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. Because every student deserves a positive educational experience in a safe environment free of harassment, bullying or humiliation, where they can learn, study and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school’s care.""“The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is an important step toward making America’s colleges and universities safer and more affirming for LGBTQ+ students by requiring the establishment of policies that prohibit harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity,” said JoDee Winterhof, Human Rights Campaign Senior Vice President, Policy & Political Affairs. “Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan’s steadfast leadership championing this crucial bill will not only save lives, the legislation will support institutions in fostering inclusive and supportive learning environments that allow all students to thrive.”“All students deserve to learn with safety, dignity, and respect,” said Emily Martin, Vice President for Education & Workplace Justice at the National Women’s Law Center. “This bill ensures schools treat harassment against all students seriously, including online harassment, which has unfortunately increased during the pandemic. No student should have to endure what Tyler Clementi experienced, and we are proud to support this important bill.”A fact sheet for the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act can be found here.The full bill text can be found here.###"

Jackson Women’s Health Organization Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined 47 other Democrats in the Senate and 188 in the House in filing a bicameral amicus brief in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, urging the Supreme Court to uphold nearly 50 years of precedent in Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to abortion care.After the Court refused to block the dangerous, cruel abortion ban in Texas from going into effect, Dobbs represents yet another case that could undermine nearly 50 years of precedent and potentially overturn Roe. Dobbs is a challenge from Mississippi’s sole remaining abortion provider against H.B. 1510, the state’s extreme law banning all abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape and incest, and only narrow, inadequate exceptions for a medical emergency or in cases of a severe fetal abnormality. The law is blatantly unconstitutional under Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which held that individuals have the right to decide whether or not to be pregnant prior to fetal viability. In 2019, the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court decision halting the Mississippi law’s implementation. “This Court has made clear that abortion bans like H.B. 1510 are unconstitutional because they violate the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability; the decision below should be affirmed on that basis alone. But as a matter of public policy, it is also important to recognize that laws like H.B. 1510 do not merely encroach on individual liberty and autonomy; they also do so in a way that disproportionately imperils the health and economic security of vulnerable populations,” wrote the lawmakers.The lawmakers stressed that the only thing that has changed since Casey and Roe were decided is the composition of the Court—which is not a compelling reason to re-examine Roe. Therefore, the members emphasized that overturning Roe would represent a disregard for settled law, our legal system, and the Constitution.“Respect for precedent—a fundamental principle that is essential to our legal system, the legitimacy of judicial and legislative institutions, and the rule of law—compels affirmance of the decision below,” continued the lawmakers.The lawmakers also noted that the abortion rights codified in Roe and Casey have been settled law for nearly 50 years and 30 years respectively, highlighting that, “adherence to Roe and Casey is even more necessary to protect the settled expectations and reliance interests of multiple generations of individuals who have rightly understood the freedom to decide to terminate a pregnancy before viability as a firmly established constitutional right, and who have never known a world without Roe’s constitutional guarantee.” The Supreme Court has upheld the Constitutional right to an abortion as recently as 2016, in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, and again just last year in June Medical Services LLC v. Russo.Read the amicus brief here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-baldwin-reverend-warnock-ossoff-call-on-senate-leadership-to-address-medicaid-coverage-gap-in-forthcoming-economic-package,"In a new letter, the Senators urge for provisions to create a permanent solution for states that have not expanded Medicaid to provide coverage for low-income communities and reduce racial and ethnic health disparitiesWashington, D.C. – This week, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA), co-leads of the Medicaid Saves Lives Act, called for Senate Leadership to include specific provisions of their legislation in the Build Back Better Act to address the Medicaid coverage gap and provide a permanent and immediate fix for individuals living in non-expansion states.The Senators urged that the provisions, which are currently included in the House’s version of the economic package, will create a permanent solution to provide coverage for those living in non-expansion states, benefitting 4.4. million individuals living in states like Wisconsin and Georgia that have not expanded Medicaid. The lawmakers also made clear that their proposal would be the “most effective policy to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities” in our country.“We are thankful that providing support to Americans in non-expansion states and closing the coverage gap is a top priority, and we believe the House’s provisions will provide more Americans with quality, affordable health care coverage. Additionally, this is the most effective policy to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities and would be a major step towards decreasing the high rates of uninsured Americans in non-expansion states. By providing support to individuals living in non-expansion states, we are demonstrating a commitment to advancing racial equity,” wrote the Senators.  The Senators continued, “We do not believe that access to health coverage should be dependent on where you live or the political or partisan decisions of state politicians. People should not be penalized for living in states that continue to deny them Medicaid. Now is the time for action.”The Senators are committed to expanding health care access to Americans in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid–including Georgia and Wisconsin–and ensuring all Americans have access to affordable health care, especially during this once-in-a-century pandemic.The full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell,We write to respectfully request that the provisions to address the Medicaid coverage gap and provide a fix for non-expansion states in the Build Back Better Act, which were recently marked-up and approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, be included in the Senate version of the Build Back Better Act.The House’s proposal creates a permanent solution to closing the Medicaid coverage gap and is specifically designed to benefit low-income individuals living in states that have not expanded Medicaid. We are thankful that providing support to Americans in non-expansion states and closing the coverage gap is a top priority, and we believe the House’s provisions will provide more Americans with quality, affordable health care coverage. Additionally, this is the most effective policy to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities and would be a major step towards decreasing the high rates of uninsured Americans in non-expansion states. By providing support to individuals living in non-expansion states, we are demonstrating a commitment to advancing racial equity.The House of Representatives’ proposal to address non-expansion states would provide affordable health care to 4.4 million low-income Americans, 60 percent of whom are individuals of color, immediately and permanently.  It is critical that the Senate version include the House language, which creates a federal Medicaid-like program based on our bill, Medicaid Saves Lives Act, S. 2315, that begins in 2025, along with immediate support to ensure these Americans receive more affordable coverage while the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stands up the new program.This program would provide all the same cost and coverage benefits as Medicaid — benefits that are not available on marketplace plans. Providing permanency would ensure stability for both the program and the individuals enrolled. Premature expiration of this program would limit HHS’ and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) ability to stand up this program and would have devastating effects on the health and wellbeing of enrollees. As CMS implements this program, we must also provide Americans access to health coverage immediately. Therefore, we further request that the Senate include provisions that expand tax credits below the 100 percent federal poverty line and provide robust cost-sharing provisions to address the high out-of-pocket costs that often prevent individuals from accessing care. These provisions will help ensure that those in the coverage gap can access affordable coverage right away.We do not believe that access to health coverage should be dependent on where you live or the political or partisan decisions of state politicians. People should not be penalized for living in states that continue to deny them Medicaid. Now is the time for action.Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we stand ready to work with you so we can finally fulfill our promise to the American people of providing quality, affordable coverage to everyone.Sincerely,###"

Clarke sent a letter to Congressional leadership requesting that the upcoming reconciliation package include investments in the palliative care and hospice workforce to keep pace with patient need and to help improve the well-being of Americans with serious illnesses and their families.“Palliative care and hospice care focus on relieving and preventing patients’ suffering and improving their quality of life. This interprofessional team-based approach focuses on the patients’ needs, explains treatment options and gives patients and their families a voice in realizing their treatment goals, and serves as a critical component of high quality, coordinated, person-centered care,” wrote the Members.“Unfortunately, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for quality palliative and hospice care has only grown more pronounced. Hospitals have treated thousands of seriously-ill patients under extremely stressful circumstances, and patients and their families have faced incredibly difficult decisions, often without the necessary guidance or expertise of a palliative care team,” the Members continued.“Now is the time to address the needs of patients facing serious illness and their families. To ensure access to palliative and hospice care for those who need it, we must support an interprofessional, team-based approach to care, and make the needed investments in the palliative care and hospice workforce,” the Members concluded.“As COVID-19 continues to spotlight the critical shortage of health professionals with knowledge and skills in palliative care, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) echoes the request by Sen. Baldwin and Rep. Clarke to include the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act in the reconciliation legislation,” said President of AAHPM, Nathan E. Goldstein. “We urge Congress to recognize the importance of a well-trained, interprofessional healthcare team to ensuring high-quality, coordinated, person-centered serious illness care and to act now to build a healthcare workforce more closely aligned with America’s evolving healthcare needs – including future pandemics. Advancing PCHETA will go a long way towards improving quality of care and quality of life for our nation’s sickest and most vulnerable patients, along with their families and caregivers.”""We thank Senator Baldwin and Congresswoman Clarke for their work to solve hospice and palliative care workforce issues, including their leadership on the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act. Every American who faces serious or life-limiting illness deserves the best care available,"" said President and CEO of National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Edo Banach. ""The government can help by supporting the hospice and palliative care providers who offer those services address long-term staffing challenges that have gotten worse during the pandemic. With increased awareness around the importance of palliative and hospice care, NHPCO is hopeful Congress will pass PCHETA to ensure our members can continue to provide the best possible care for patients and their families.”“PCHETA is a top priority of the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and we strongly believe it will help address the current gap in trained palliative care professionals, including those caring for patients with cancer” said ONS President, Nancy Houlihan. “ONS applauds Senator Baldwin and Representative Clarke for urging that the upcoming reconciliation package invest in a well-trained palliative care workforce to meet the needs of caring for patients with serious illness, including cancer.”“The National Coalition for Hospice and Palliative Care praises Senator Baldwin and Rep. Clarke for their steadfast leadership in introducing the Palliative Care Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA) and working now to incorporate these provisions in the Congressional reconciliation package,” said Executive Director of the National Coalition for Hospice and Palliative Care, Amy Melnick. “Senator Baldwin and Rep. Clarke recognize that as a nation we can do better to improve the equitable access and quality of palliative care for all those who need it. Patients and families deserve these necessary services that improve quality of life and reduces the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. Enhancing awareness of palliative care, training more doctors, nurses, social workers and spiritual care providers, and dedicating more research activities to improving the care of people with serious illness will avoid needless suffering.”“Palliative care provides a critical added layer of support for people living with serious illness,” said CEO of the Center to Advance Palliative Care, Brynn Bowman. “By meeting patients and families where they are, educating them on what to expect, and effectively managing symptoms and distress, it has been shown to improve quality of care, quality of life, and patient outcomes. Patients and families deserve palliative care – but analysis projects that will be a shortfall of up to 18,000 palliative care physicians by 2030 if nothing is done. Therefore, federal investment in the palliative care workforce is critical ensure that this care is available to everyone who needs it. We applaud Senator Baldwin and Congresswoman Clarke’s leadership and commitment to all Americans living with serious illness, and support their request to address this issue in the reconciliation.”“The Hospice & Palliative Nurses Association (HPNA) is very grateful for the efforts of Senator Baldwin and Congresswoman Clarke to grow, improve and sustain the palliative care and hospice workforce,” said Chief Executive Officer of the HPNA, Virginia Marshall. “Now more than ever, it is important for Congressional leadership to address this issue in reconciliation legislation because the pandemic has magnified the hospice and palliative care workforce challenges. The most important need at this time is to support and train the providers we need at the bedside to deliver care to patients and families dealing with serious illness.”“The pandemic has illuminated the importance of palliative care for those experiencing serious illness and its lasting effects, including those with cancer and survivors, and has similarly exposed the scarcity of these critical services due to existing palliative care workforce shortages,” said President of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Lisa Lacasse. “We applaud Senator Baldwin and Representative Clarke for their efforts to incorporate policies that ensure access to palliative and hospice care in the reconciliation package, and call on Congress to act on this request without delay.”Senator Baldwin has been leading the effort in the Senate to expand access to palliative and hospice care since 2016. In the 116th Congress, Baldwin led the introduction of the bipartisan Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA) which would increase the availability and quality of care by establishing palliative care and hospice workforce training programs, creating a national education and awareness campaign about the benefits of palliative care and available services and supports, and enhancing research on improving the delivery of palliative care.Baldwin was raised by her maternal grandparents and later served as her grandmother’s primary caretaker as she grew older.The full text of the letter can be found here and below. The Honorable Charles SchumerSenate Majority LeaderUnited States SenateWashington, DC 20510 The Honorable Nancy PelosiSpeaker of the HouseU.S. House of RepresentativesH-232 U.S. CapitolWashington, D.C. 20515Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi,The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the shortfalls in our health care system, including the need for improved access to, and understanding of, palliative and hospice care.

https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-colleagues-in-letter-urging-the-department-of-education-to-continue-to-bolster-federal-and-state-oversight-of-student-loan-servicers,"Washington, D.C. — United States Senator Tammy Baldwin joined seven of her colleagues in sending a letter to Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona in support of a recent re-interpretation of Department policy that will significantly enhance oversight and accountability of the student loan program and its contractors by ending federal obstruction of state-level efforts to protect student loan borrowers. The letter calls for the Department to expand this approach to state laws that protect student loan borrowers and contract negotiations with servicers.Under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department took the position that that state regulation of loan servicers was broadly preempted by the Federal government’s oversight role. Federal courts repeatedly rejected this position. This policy interfered with state regulators exercising their authority to protect consumers in their states and prevented states from conducting supervisory examinations of loan servicers. It also obstructed state enforcement actions by allowing student loan servicers to withhold from states the documents and data needed to identify misconduct.“We urge you to apply this strong preemption framework outlined to state laws that provide additional protections to student loan borrowers, such as requiring loan servicers to be licensed or have in place complaint processing protocols,” wrote the Senators. “When servicers or other contractors take positions that obstruct Federal or state oversight, they should face consequences under their current contracts and in future allocations and renewals. We strongly urge you to incorporate accountability for abusive and illegal consumer practices and for failure to cooperate with Federal and state regulators into the ongoing management of the student loan program.”Baldwin and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Tina Smith (D-MN), sent their letter in response to a request for public comment.The full text of the letter is available here and below.Secretary Miguel CardonaU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Ave, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20202Dear Secretary Cardona:We write in support of your recent revised legal interpretation of Federal preemption and joint Federal-state regulation and oversight of student loans and loan servicers.1 This welcome revision to the Department of Education’s (“the Department”) policy will significantly enhance oversight and accountability of the student loan program and its contractors by empowering state regulators to better protect borrowers and consumers.The previous Administration’s policy that state regulation of loan servicers was broadly preempted by the Federal government’s oversight role was legally flawed. Federal courts repeatedly rejected this position as unsound and an unjustified departure from the Department’s prior position. The previous Administration’s policy also interfered with state regulators exercising their authority to protect consumers in their states. This policy prevented states from conducting supervisory examinations of loan servicers. It also obstructed state enforcement actions by withholding from states the documents and data that they needed to hold loan servicers accountable for misconduct.The revised interpretation is not only legally sound, but will also have substantial benefits for borrowers. State attorneys general have been at the forefront of oversight of student loan servicers in recent years, uncovering widespread patterns of misleading and abusive conduct and winning significant settlements for borrowers in their states. For example, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey recently reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) requiring an audit and correction for any Massachusetts borrower who may have been harmed by PHEAA’s errors or misconduct, which could affect more than 200,000 borrowers. The Department’s revised interpretation also acknowledges that, in partnership with the Department’s own oversight and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state regulators play a crucial role in identifying and addressing misconduct that hurts borrowers and consumers. The revised interpretation of federal preemption will encourage stronger partnership to hold loan servicers and other student loan contractors accountable.We urge you to apply this strong preemption framework outlined to state laws that provide additional protections to student loan borrowers, such as requiring loan servicers to be licensed or have in place complaint processing protocols. By explicitly endorsing these partnerships, the Department can further align Federal and state actions to protect and support borrowers and consumers.Beyond this notice of interpretation, we strongly urge you to carry these preemption principles forward in your contract negotiations with loan servicers. When servicers or other contractors take positions that obstruct Federal or state oversight, they should face consequences under their current contracts and in future allocations and renewals. We strongly urge you to incorporate accountability for abusive and illegal consumer practices and for failure to cooperate with Federal and state regulators into the ongoing management of the student loan program. Future contracts must include meaningful incentives for transparency and improved service and protections for borrowers.Thank you for your work on this important issue. We look forward to working with you to improve the student loan system so that it puts students and borrowers first.Sincerely, ###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-joins-colleagues-in-call-to-bolster-ports-infrastructure-funding-in-the-upcoming-build-back-better-bill,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin joined her colleagues in calling on Congressional leadership to provide at least $2.5 billion to fund port infrastructure through the Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) in the upcoming Build Back Better budget reconciliation legislation. This funding is critical to the success of our nation’s ports, which are a major economic engine and vital to job creation.“We write to urge your support for addressing port congestion through funding the Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP). We ask that you provide at least $2.5 billion in reconciliation for MARAD’s PIDP to fund port infrastructure needed to improve freight mobility, address port congestion, and improve port competitiveness,” the Senators wrote. “Our nation’s ports provide critical connections between waterways, highways, pipelines, and railroads. Waterborne vessels moved 41 percent of freight value in 2019, over $1.7 trillion. Cargo activities at U.S. ports on our coasts and Great Lakes account for 26 percent of the U.S. economy, generating nearly $5.4 trillion in total economic activity and more than $378 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2018. U.S. ports also generate 30,770,769 jobs.”“Investments to modernize ports so they can handle bigger ships and address congestion at ports is critical to the American economy,” the Senators continued. “By 2037, the United States is projected to export more than 52 million shipping containers through U.S. seaports each year. Further, by 2045 port infrastructure investments could produce economy-wide returns of between $2 and $3 per every $1 spent, after adjusting for inflation.”Baldwin joined the letter with U.S. Senators Gary Peters, Maria Cantwell, Mazie K. Hirono, Dianne Feinstein, Jack Reed, Alex Padilla, Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden.The full text of the letter can be found below and here.Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi:We write to urge your support for addressing port congestion through funding the Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP).

As of August 26, 2021, 41 vessels are anchored outside the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach waiting for berth space, despite the fact the ports are showing record breaking productivity. In 2021, the Port of Los Angeles became the first port in the Western Hemisphere to ever handle 10 million containers in a calendar year. In May 2021, the Port of Los Angeles handled 1 million containers in month, a record in its 114-year history. The Northwest Seaport Alliance (Ports of Tacoma and Ports of Seattle) reported that in June 2021, they had a 19.9% increase in?cargo. For inland states, like Michigan, we are also seeing an increase in volumes. The Great Lakes Seaway Partnership saw a 4.64% increase in cargo from 2020 to 2021.Investments to modernize ports so they can handle bigger ships and address congestion at ports is critical to the American economy. $66 billion is needed over the next decade for port-related infrastructure to ensure U.S. job creation, economic growth, and tax fairness. By 2037, the United States is projected to export more than 52 million shipping containers through U.S. seaports each year. Further, by 2045 port infrastructure investments could produce economy-wide returns of between $2 and $3 per every $1 spent, after adjusting for inflation.The costs of not investing in U.S. port infrastructure is staggering. They include:The forthcoming reconciliation package provides a unique opportunity to revitalize and modernize our ports to handle the increasing volumes of cargo that is crucial as e-commerce continues to grow. The MARAD PIDP is the infrastructure grant program to help fund projects and improve the movement of goods and services at our ports. PIDP also has existing Davis Bacon and automation protections, which make it the priority funding mechanism to boost investment in port infrastructure.  Thank you for your consideration.###"

Baldwin discussed how President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda is providing targeted relief to working people in a wide variety of sectors across Wisconsin.Senator Baldwin was an original cosponsor of the bipartisan Save Our Stages Act, on which the Shuttered Venue Operator Grant (SVOG) program is modeled. Baldwin worked closely with the Small Business Administration during the implementation of the program to ensure that Wisconsin live event venues would be able to access the much-needed funds in a timely manner. Baldwin secured SVOG funding for the Pablo Center, as well as several other arts and culture venues in the state. Wisconsin received 218 grants worth a combined $169 million.“Independent venues were some of the first establishments to shut down last year—and as we’ve already seen—they’ve been some of the last to reopen,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Shuttered Venue Operator Grant program provided a lifeline to many of our arts and culture venues in Wisconsin and I was glad to tour the Pablo Center today to see how they put their funds to work.”“The Senator and her team have been staunch advocates for our creative economy, its impact on Wisconsin’s Tourism Industry and the industry-saving Save Our Stages legislation,” said Jason Jon Anderson, Executive Director of Pablo Center at the Confluence. “Through my role as the Wisconsin Precinct Captain on the advocacy committee for NIVA, the Senator deeply understands the impact of the $7.00 spent in the surrounding communities for every $1.00 spent in our venues/festivals. These initial awards ensure that our fastest economic catalysts have some relief for their ongoing operating expenses for the past 16 months of this pandemic.”Senator Baldwin worked to secure $4 billion for food supply chain resiliency in the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law in March. Baldwin met with local business owners and meat processors to discuss the challenges small and medium-scale meat processors face when getting started in meat processing, expanding, and meeting the ever-strengthening food safety requirements from USDA.“Sailer’s has been servicing Elmwood and the surrounding areas since 1923,” said Senator Baldwin. “It was great to visit a five generation Piece County family small business and discuss some of the unique challenges facing small meat processors. Business like ones I met with today are a cornerstone in regional and local economies and have made a huge impact on their local communities.”“It’s times like these that us small processors stood up to the challenge of when this country was really in need for protein,” said Jake Sailer, Owner of Sailer’s Food Market and Meat Processing. “With our demand being high, its programs like the American Rescue Plan funding that would help us to add on to our facility, build new, purchase modern equipment to process more protein and fulfill the gap between the small/very small and large processor.”Senator Baldwin helped the Village of Grantsburg secure a $1.4 million grant from the Economic Development Administration to construct road, water and sewer infrastructure to support a 26-acre expansion of the North Industrial Park and promote manufacturing sector growth. The development is expected to create 383 jobs, retain 43 current jobs, and generate $83 million in private investment.“The federal investments for the Village of Grantsburg will support efforts to rebuild our infrastructure and move our Made in Wisconsin manufacturing economy forward,” said Senator Baldwin. “This funding shows that President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo are committed to helping rural Wisconsin recover and build back better with job creation and economic development. I was thrilled to meet with local leaders today to discuss the planned expansion and look forward to what this funding can unlock for the community.”###"

The members are the lead sponsors of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA), bicameral federal legislation to guarantee equal access to abortion everywhere.“In the middle of the night, in an unsigned, one-paragraph order, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court effectively overruled Roe v. Wade by refusing to block Texas’ extreme, restrictive anti-abortion law. This dangerous decision outlaws a woman’s right to choose after six weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest—denying millions access to constitutionally protected health care before many of them even know they are pregnant, and disproportionately harming low-income Texans and people of color.”“This decision defies precedent, turns the clock back by decades, and offers cash bounties to anyone who wants to police the bodies and choices of their neighbors. Without action, abortion access in Texas will be functionally non-existent. Make no mistake about it—this extreme law and the Supreme Court’s decision is a cruel, calculated attack on health care and reproductive rights.”""We must stop these egregious attacks and clarify that our rights do not depend on zip code. Last night’s decision underscores the urgency of our legislation to guarantee a person’s right to access an abortion—and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services—free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship.” “Congress must act now and pass the Women’s Health Protection Act before other states follow the lead of Texas and institute restrictions that eviscerate reproductive health care and choice. We applaud Speaker Pelosi for her announcement that the Women's Health Protection Act will be brought to the floor for a vote when the House returns, and President Biden for his intent to use a whole-of-government effort to respond to the Supreme Court’s assault on reproductive rights”  Introduced with historic support in both chambers, the WHPA has 48 total co-sponsors in the Senate and 192 total co-sponsors in the House of Representatives.The text of the Senate bill is available here and the text of the House bill is available here.###"
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/baldwin-smith-call-for-continued-support-for-opioid-overdose-prevention-and-harm-reduction-in-covid-19-recovery-efforts,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Tina Smith (D-MN) sent a letter to Dr. Mariam Delphin-Rittmon, the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asking the Biden Administration to continue their strong commitment to addressing the opioid and substance use disorder (SUD) epidemic, which has significantly worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition to urging for additional support for SUD prevention, treatment and recovery efforts, they called for elevating the role of harm reduction and overdose prevention, including through syringe services and increased access to naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication.In the letter, the senators highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has, “dramatically exacerbated the opioid and SUD epidemic in this country, and the needs of patients and communities are clear. The nature of the public health emergency has increased social isolation and stress while decreasing access to treatment, supportive services and harm reduction, with significant repercussions for individuals facing addiction.”The ongoing opioid epidemic has significantly worsened during the pandemic, with reported overdoses and deaths spiking to historic levels over the past year. In 2020, the United States experienced 92,500 overdose deaths, up from 71,000 in 2019. Overdose deaths continue to rise in 2021.They continued later in the letter: “Given the scale of need at this moment, we must take an all-of-the-above, evidence-based approach to save lives. It has never been more important to follow the guidance of public health and addiction experts in adopting harm reduction strategies on a wide scale, including overdose prevention education, naloxone access initiatives, and syringe services programs (SSPs). These evidence-based approaches that focus on ‘meeting individuals where they are’ are a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses and deaths.”The letter also urged the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to quickly allocate $30 million in funding for SUD harm reduction efforts that was provided by Congress in the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117- 2), and called for input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so these funds can be distributed expeditiously to communities with the greatest need. They also requested that SAMHSA investigate and quickly take action in response to nationwide shortages of naloxone, which is a critical tool to reverse opioid overdoses.The letter also has the support of leading Wisconsin and national public health groups.""Senator Baldwin’s continued advocacy for treatment, recovery supports and harm reduction strategies is so important right now. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of Americans have struggled with substance use and mental health issues due to lost connections and barriers to support,” said Jesse Heffernan, RCP, of Appleton, Wisconsin, a recovery coach and person in recovery. “Harm Reduction is the umbrella for all pathways to and of recovery. Naloxone and syringe exchange programs are data driven, compassionate approaches to public health similar to CPR training and AED access. We look forward to the quick and targeted funding for Harm Reduction training, materials and strategies to help our communities save lives and bridge gaps in access to care.""“Harm reduction based programs and services have a profound, positive impact on the lives of individuals impacted by the ongoing opioid epidemic. From preventing the transmission of hepatitis and HIV to preventing needless overdoses, every day these programs save lives in communities across the nation,” said Bill Keeton, Chief Advocacy Officer of Vivent Health, formerly the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin. “The need for these programs has never been greater and Vivent Health applauds Senator Baldwin for her unyielding commitment to supporting these critical efforts while calling on SAMHSA to elevate harm reduction in their response.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has not only accelerated the already catastrophic loss of life due to the overdose crisis, but exposed the gross racial disparities in our nation’s response to people living with substance use disorder — many of whom are vulnerable to HIV,” said Jesse Milan, Jr., President & CEO of AIDS United. “It is essential that SAMHSA work with CDC and national harm reduction focused organizations to support syringe services programs and address rising overdose rates—especially in BIPOC communities — with evidence based, culturally competent care.”“Our nation suffered nearly 100,000 overdose deaths in 2020 and the death toll continues to rise in 2021.  Like COVID-19, this overdose crisis should be treated as a public health emergency warranting an urgent response,” said Grant Smith, Deputy Director, Office of National Affairs, Drug Policy Alliance. ""Senators Tammy Baldwin and Tina Smith appropriately urge the White House, HHS, and SAMHSA to increase its rapid response to this crisis and to include as a high priority in that response the expansion of life saving, effective, and evidence-based harm reduction interventions, such as syringe services programs and the wide distribution of naloxone to prevent drug overdose. The U.S. must respond more robustly now to save lives.”Full text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Assistant Secretary Delphin-Rittmon,We commend you and other leaders in President Biden’s administration for your strong commitment to addressing the opioid and substance use disorder (SUD) epidemic, which has significantly worsened during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We ask that you continue your strong federal support for SUD prevention, treatment and recovery efforts, and urge you to elevate and prioritize harm reduction as a key component of the needed response to this crisis.The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid and SUD epidemic in this country, and the needs of patients and communities are clear. The nature of the public health emergency has increased social isolation and stress while decreasing access to treatment, supportive services and harm reduction, with significant repercussions for individuals facing addiction, particularly in communities of color already disproportionately impacted by the epidemic. Reported overdoses and deaths have spiked to historic levels over the past year, with data showing that the United States experienced 92,500 overdose deaths in 2020, an astonishing increase from approximately 71,000 in 2019.  Overdose deaths continue to rise in 2021. Given the scale of need at this moment, we must take an all-of-the-above, evidence-based approach to save lives. It has never been more important to follow the guidance of public health and addiction experts in adopting harm reduction strategies on a wide scale, including overdose prevention education, naloxone access initiatives, and syringe services programs (SSPs). These evidence-based approaches that focus on ‘meeting individuals where they are’ are a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses and deaths. And further, SSPs provide a variety of services to reduce the rate of blood borne infections, including viral hepatitis and HIV, in individuals who engage in injection drug use (IDU). Recent IDU-linked outbreaks of hepatitis B and C and HIV demonstrate that it is critical to increase our investment in SSPS and reduce regulatory barriers to mitigate pathogen transmission and the rate of drug overdose. We were pleased to see $30 million in funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to engage in harm reduction efforts included as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2). We view this funding as a down payment on a much larger need for investment in harm reduction, as well as an urgent opportunity to quickly address the direst impacts of this tragically worsening crisis. As such, we request that SAMHSA act expeditiously to direct these funds to the communities and organizations that need them the most, in collaboration with key harm reduction stakeholders and partner agencies. In particular, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has significant expertise in providing support and technical assistance for harm reduction efforts through its Infectious Disease and the Opioid Epidemic Program, and we ask for strong coordination with Director Walensky and her team. SSPs are also effective at distributing naloxone - a drug that can prevent overdose deaths - both to people at risk of overdose and to other community members as a proactive measure. A study from Massachusetts found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent. With additional resources, SSPs can increase ready access to naloxone and its use, which would help reduce the dramatically increasing number of overdose deaths. We are concerned by reports that there is an ongoing shortage of generic intramuscular naloxone in some states caused by a disruption in production. We strongly urge SAMHSA to take measures to address this shortfall and ensure that naloxone can be delivered to states appropriately, in conjunction with harm reduction organizations that are currently on the ground providing such services.Finally, we request that you take every action to ensure maximal flexibility in SAMHSA’s various other block grants and targeted funding streams so that harm reduction is both eligible and emphasized as an allowable use of these resources. We will continue our push to eliminate harmful funding restrictions on SSP funding through the appropriations process, and we look forward to your continued partnership on the issue with your current authorities.We are facing an unprecedented addiction crisis in this country, and we thank you for your tireless leadership to stop the ongoing opioid and SUD epidemic. As a part of this response, we urge you to take every opportunity to center harm reduction as a vital part of the SUD services and care continuum. We appreciate your attention to this issue. "
https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wisconsin-supports-passing-bold-build-back-better-legislation,"Tax Cuts for Working Families, Investments in Pre-K, Child Care, and Paid Leave, Lower Costs for Health Care, Home Care, and Prescription Drugs, Take on Climate Crisis with Clean Energy Job Creation  Washington, D.C. – As Congress continues to work on passing a budget bill, leading Wisconsin organizations are speaking out in support of passing bold Build Back Better legislation that makes the super wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share of taxes so we can cut taxes for working families, invest in early childhood education and child care, lower the costs of health care, home care and prescription drugs, and create more clean energy jobs and a renewable energy economy that takes on the climate crisis.“The pandemic has laid bare the severe challenges that working women have faced for years,” said Christina Thor, Wisconsin State Director for 9to5. “Mothers cannot work to support their children without access to adequate, affordable child care. Over half of Wisconsin’s population lives in a child care desert. We need to improve working conditions for providers to grow the workforce and meet the demand. The average annual cost of infant care in a center is over $12,000. This is a huge barrier to women who want to work outside the home. We need to lower the cost to working families. Affordable, accessible, adequate child care is essential to unlocking the potential of Wisconsin’s working women. The pandemic has highlighted that workers need to be able to take paid leave to care for themselves and their families when they get sick. That was true before the pandemic and it is more true than ever during this pandemic. COVID-19, quarantines, or even run of the mill colds force many children to stay home from school or child care. This leaves too many parents to wrestle with an impossible choice: stay home and risk losing their paycheck or job, or go to work while their kids are home.”“Small businesses are demanding these programs, like paid leave and child care that will help ease the burden of high costs on working families and support entrepreneurs,” said Shawn Phetteplace, State Manager for the Main Street Alliance-Wisconsin. “It's past time to level the playing field, and make sure the ultra-wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share to make it happen. An investment in our overall care economy is an investment in small businesses, and our local community.”“Parents cannot work to support their children if they do not have access to or cannot afford safe, reliable and high-quality child care,” said Angela Lang, Executive Director of BLOC. “Workers have been forced to choose between going to work sick or caring for a loved one and taking time off without pay to care for themselves or others.  Even before the pandemic, far too many Wisconsin seniors and people with disabilities did not have access to the quality home or community care they need and the pandemic has exacerbated this challenge.  Meanwhile, home care workers continue to put in long hours of hard work but many still struggle to get ahead due to low wages. We need to lower the cost of child care for Wisconsin families, increase access to child care and help child care centers provide our children with the quality care they deserve. We need to establish a national program that will guarantee paid family and medical leave for Wisconsin workers so that no worker will have to choose between protecting their health, or paying their bills. We need to invest in Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care to ensure people can receive care while leading independent lives outside of institutional care settings and to support good paying jobs for home care workers. I applaud Senator Baldwin for championing these priorities and working to include them in the Build Back Better legislation.”“I recently became a parent for the first time to my precious daughter, Emery,” said Ramsses Lopez, an OSI worker in Fort Atkinson and member of UFCW Local 1473. “Earlier this year, Congress passed the Child Tax Credit which provides up to $3,600 for families with children. This funding allows my family to make sure that we have everything we need to take care of our daughter, from nutritious food to clothing. If this middle-class tax cut could be extended, that would make a big impact on so many working families’ lives, including mine. Congress should make the Child Tax Credit permanent to help all Wisconsin working families.”“The Build Back Better budget legislation will be a win for Wisconsin because it will cut taxes and lower costs for families and workers, create jobs, and combat climate change all paid for by making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share,” said Peter Drummond, Wisconsin State Director of For Our Future. “The legislation will support workers by providing tuition-free community and technical college, lowering child care costs, providing paid family and medical leave, and creating new job opportunities in the clean energy economy, while cutting taxes for the middle class.  It will allow for strong labor standards and provide a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. Senator Baldwin is working to include a reform to provide quality, affordable health care coverage for Wisconsinites who have been locked out of our BadgerCare program. Wisconsin has significant economic and health racial disparities and this legislation will make needed investments to strengthen the economic and health security of our communities of color. Extreme weather caused by climate change has caused damage and increased costs for Wisconsin communities and we need to take action to mitigate the harm climate change is causing our state. Wisconsin needs the Build Back Better legislation to support our communities, workers, and families and I thank Senator Baldwin for her work to pass this critical legislation.”“By failing to invest in care policies, we’ve left families to fend for themselves,” said Brita Olsen, State Director of Family Friendly Wisconsin. “This has taken a devastating toll on our families, communities, and economy. Across Wisconsin, parents struggle to work without safe and affordable child care, families fight to make ends meet when illness strikes because they don’t have paid family and medical leave, and seniors and people with disabilities lack access to quality home and community care. And, many struggle to afford their medicine because prescription drug costs are simply too high. These are problems that Congress must address so that we can rebuild from the pandemic and finally create an economy that puts families first. The Build Back Better Act would provide much needed relief for working families in Wisconsin without costing them a dime. Instead, it would be fully paid for by finally making the extremely wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. I applaud Senator Baldwin for championing care priorities and working to include them in the Build Back Better legislation.”“The Build Back Better legislation would boldly tackle drinking water contamination, air pollution, and the worsening impacts of climate change,” said David Tipson, VP Programs & Government Relations for Clean Wisconsin. “Access to a safe and healthy environment is a right, not a privilege for those able to pay.  But too often, lower-income Wisconsinites are exposed to more pollution.  Extreme weather caused by climate change has increased costs for Wisconsin communities, residents, and farmers and we need to take action to mitigate the damage climate change is causing our state.  This legislation includes a bold vision to tackle climate change and create new job opportunities in the clean energy economy while ensuring all communities in our state have access to a clean environment.  Clean Wisconsin applauds Senator Baldwin for her work in shaping a legislative package that will help working families while also investing in a livable future in the face of our rapidly changing climate.”“We are optimistic that our federal leaders see the importance of the moment to act on these climate issues,” said Matt Krueger, Executive Director of WI Land+Water. “We appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership in advancing conservation initiatives that will build Wisconsin’s climate resiliency.”“The Build Back Better plan hits on many of the issues our members have highlighted as priorities, outlining game-changing investments in infrastructure that would benefit small businesses, strengthen supply chains, and revitalize rural communities,” said Darin Von Ruden, President of Wisconsin Farmers Union. “It is also heartening to see the inclusion of investment in climate-smart agriculture and conservation programs. Many farmers have already proven themselves as innovators when it comes to land and water conservation, and this funding will help them continue to implement practices that are aligned with addressing the climate crisis. Many of our farmer members are also self-employed and have struggled with costly health insurance, so we are pleased to see efforts to address health care access and affordability.""###"
