A final decision must be based on the imperative to face rapidly evolving threats in space, especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s expansion of regional influence. We cannot afford to delay Space Command’s pathway toward reaching Full Operational Capability,” wrote Bennet and Hickenlooper. As the Air Force conducts a review of Space Command’s pathway to Full Operational Capability (FOC), as recommended by the Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) report, the senators urge the Air Force to examine previously neglected factors that would influence reaching FOC, including the cost of renovating existing infrastructure at Peterson and the cost of workforce relocation. In their letter, the senators highlight key findings from the DOD IG and Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports. Most notably, the reports make clear that senior military leadership recommended Peterson as the preferred choice for Space Command due to its ability to reach FOC faster than any other candidate location. Bennet and Hickenlooper also expressed their concern that Peterson’s ability to quickly reach FOC was not given full consideration in the basing process.The text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Kendall:We write to reiterate our concerns about the ongoing U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) basing process and urge you to consider critical cost and national security factors as you review Space Command’s pathway to Full Operational Capability (FOC), prior to the issuance of a final decision.The Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports make clear that senior military leadership recommended Peterson Space Force Base (SFB) in Colorado Springs as the preferred choice for USSPACECOM’s permanent headquarters due to its unique ability to achieve FOC faster than any other candidate location.The DOD IG directed the Secretary of Defense to review these well-documented concerns pertaining to FOC. It is our understanding that Secretary Austin has tasked the Department of the Air Force to conduct such a review.We urge you to address the following elements as you conduct your analysis of Full Operational Capability at Space Command: We request a briefing on your review prior to any final decision to understand how the Air Force has accounted for critical national security and cost implications. The Air Force must assure Congress and the American people that the final decision is rooted in defensible evidence. A final decision must be based on the imperative to face rapidly evolving threats in space, especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s expansion of regional influence. We cannot afford to delay Space Command’s pathway toward reaching Full Operational Capability. Sincerely,"

Bennet also hosted Beaudreau and Touton for a listening session with Colorado water users, where they discussed the challenges they have faced due to climate change-fueled drought and how they would like to see the $4 billion in funding for drought from the Inflation Reduction Act implemented, which Bennet secured in the law in August. “I’m grateful Deputy Secretary Beaudreau and Commissioner Touton joined me on the Western Slope to see the incredibly challenging conditions faced by our water users and to learn about ways they are working together to face a future with less water,” said Bennet. “I look forward to our continued work towards a long-term solution and sustainable future for the Colorado River Basin.”“I appreciate the opportunity to join Senator Bennet and Upper Colorado River Commissioner Mitchell to see the effects of this continued drought on the Colorado River Basin and reaffirm our collective focus on collaboration,” said Touton. “Reclamation remains fully committed to work in a consensus manner to implement meaningful water management and conservation actions across the Upper and Lower Basins, with Tribal Nations, and Mexico.”During the fly over, Bennet, Beaudreau, and Touton viewed drought conditions in the Colorado River Basin, viewing the Uncompahgre River, the Blue Mesa Reservoir, the headwaters of the Colorado River, the Paonia Reservoir and Dam, and the Grand Valley Project.Bennet then hosted Beaudreau and Touton for a listening session at Colorado Mesa University with Colorado water users including representatives from the Ute Mountain Ute and Southern Ute Tribes, water districts, irrigators, and other water leaders, to discuss the challenges they have faced due to drought and the ways they are adapting to a drier climate.Last week, Bennet led a group of Colorado and New Mexico lawmakers in urging BOR to prioritize funding for long-term, permanent solutions to the drought crisis in the Colorado River Basin as it allocates the $4 billion in new funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for Western drought.As the American West faces extreme drought, fueled by climate change, Bennet secured $4 billion in the IRA to address drought in the West by funding water conservation, habitat restoration, and mitigation. The IRA also includes a $370 billion investment to fight climate change, including $25 billion for forestry, conservation, and environmentally friendly farming, which falls under Bennet’s Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources.In June, Bennet chaired a subcommittee hearing to sound the alarm on the Western water crisis. Last year, he secured a historic investment in western water infrastructure in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He continues to work with his colleagues to build on the progress of the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address extreme drought, combat climate change, and protect Western water."

I believe Colorado is the most beautiful state in America – not only because of our beautiful public lands, but our shared commitment to pass them on to the next generation,” said Bennet in his video. “Colorado’s public lands define who we are as a state. They drive our economy, our heritage, and our way of life.”This week, Bennet delivered dozens of letters from Colorado veterans, state and local officials, conservation and outdoor recreation advocates, business owners, and descendants of the 10th Mountain Division to President Biden in support of the effort led by Bennet, Colorado U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper, Colorado Congressman Joe Neguse and Colorado Governor Jared Polis. Momentum for the lawmakers effort has surged as Coloradans across the state have raised their voices in support. This week, Jason Sewell, a rancher and the fifth-generation steward of Sunfire Ranch, wrote in favor of the lawmakers’ proposed 20-year administrative mineral withdrawal in the Thompson Divide in the Glenwood Post Independent, and Michael Browning, past chair of the Eagle Summit Wilderness Alliance, voiced his support for the national monument designation and other public lands protections in the Vail Daily. Newspapers across the state also have endorsed the effort, including the Grand Junction Sentinel and, just this week, the Durango Herald.Below is the full transcript of Bennet’s video message:Happy Public Lands day, Colorado!I believe Colorado is the most beautiful state in America – not only because of our beautiful public lands, but our shared commitment to pass them on to the next generation. Colorado’s public lands define who we are as a state. They drive our economy, our heritage, and our way of life.For the last decade, I’ve worked with Coloradans to write the CORE Act, a bill that would grow our outdoor economy and protect over 400,000 acres of public land – from Camp Hale, where U.S. soldiers trained to become America’s first military climbers and skiers, to the iconic Thompson Divide. Because of partisan dysfunction and gridlock in Washington, the bill -- which an overwhelming majority of Coloradans support -- has yet to receive a vote in the Senate. That’s why I’m asking President Biden to use his authority to make Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range a national monument, and protect other landscapes in the CORE Act. The CORE Act was written by Coloradans in every corner of our state, who came together to do something special for the next generation. And we have waited long enough.So on this Public Lands Day, I hope you’ll get outside and enjoy our Colorado’s treasured landscapes – and also join me in supporting this effort. Your voices make a difference here in Washington. Thank you."

Funding will go toward fuels management projects currently taking place on nearly 5,395 acres of federal lands across the state. Funds are being directed from the larger, $103 million investment announced by the Department of the Interior earlier this year. This additional funding will help complete fuels treatments on nearly 2 million acres nationwide this fiscal year, a substantial increase in comparison to prior years.The acreage includes 22 projects across 16 counties including; Dolores, Eagle, Grand, Gunnison, Kiowa, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Moffat, Montezuma, Montrose, Otero, Ouray, Rio Blanco, Routt, and San Miguel.“Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding continues to come Colorado’s way,” said Bennet. “As climate change fuels drought and more severe wildfire seasons, these funds will go a long way to protect Colorado’s communities, forests and watersheds.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law continues to deliver for the people of Colorado and for our communities impacted by the recent surge of wildfires across the West. This significant increase in funding will protect the families, businesses, and communities most threatened by these disasters and I could not be more grateful to see such widespread support for these vital programs,” said Neguse. “As climate change drives harsher heat waves, more volatile weather, and record drought conditions, we are seeing wildfire seasons turn to wildfire years, threatening communities, businesses, wildlife and the environment,” said Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau. “Through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are investing in Colorado communities, advancing wildfire resilience work across the country, improving resources for the heroic firefighting workforce, and reducing the risk of wildfire.” The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is bringing much-needed support to communities across the country to increase the resilience of lands facing the threat of wildland fires and to better support federal wildland firefighters. The law includes $1.5 billion for the Department over the next five years to invest in preparedness, fuels management, post-fire restoration, and fire science. It also directs major reforms for federal wildland firefighters, including temporary pay increases and a new occupational series classification more specific to firefighters. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments in wildland fire management in Colorado will increase fuels treatment in areas with high wildfire hazard potential, helping to protect homes and businesses in the wildland-urban interface and public drinking water. These efforts will promote climate resiliency across landscapes and communities and will employ Tribal members, youth, and veterans."

In the middle of a 22-year drought with a hotter, drier future on the horizon, it is imperative for the BOR to focus efforts on a long-term strategy that includes funding opportunities for projects on both a temporary and long-term timeline. However, no matter the timeframe of a project, the BOR needs to fund efforts that provide real, meaningful long-term reductions in water use from the River,” wrote the lawmakers.  In the letter, Bennet, Neguse, and their colleagues urge the BOR to direct resources through states, local governments, Tribes and public entities and deploy funds through competitive programs that are coordinated through state-approved or implemented programs and public entities, such as the Upper Colorado River Commission.In addition, the lawmakers ask the BOR to employ a consistent measurement of system-wide water losses in both basins of the River. They also encourage the BOR to look at innovative methods for reducing water use basin-wide, including using new data, technology, or programs.They concluded: “We look forward to working with you to find solutions for the immediate crisis of the River while working towards a long-term solution to the challenges posed by a changing climate and the emergence of mega-drought in our states and throughout the American West.”The text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Commissioner Touton:We write to you regarding the dire state of the Colorado River basin (the River), plagued by severe drought and heightened demand for water resources that do not exist. The River is the lifeblood of the American Southwest, with nearly 40 million people reliant on the water resources across seven states and 30 Tribes.We appreciate the Bureau of Reclamation’s (BOR) continued emphasis on the urgency of achieving water use reductions and encourage continued discussion among basin States, Tribes, municipal and agricultural water users, Mexico, and the conservation community to find an agreement. It is our hope that responsible use and implementation of the $4 billion from Section 50233 (Drought Mitigation in Reclamation States) of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will help alleviate some of the strains on the River system over the long term. Below are our priorities for implementation of the IRA’s Section 50233 funding, reflecting the needs of our states in the Colorado River basin:Resources need to flow through states, local governments, Tribes and public entities. We cannot underscore enough the need for the BOR to deliver money from the IRA in a manner that limits potential speculation or profiteering from those suffering from the consequences of drought. The funds made available through the IRA should be deployed through competitive programs designed to control price gouging and should be coordinated through state-approved or implemented programs and public entities like the Upper Colorado River Commission.The BOR needs to direct resources towards permanent solutions on the River. In the middle of a 22-year drought with a hotter, drier future on the horizon, it is imperative for the BOR to focus efforts on a long-term strategy that includes funding opportunities for projects on both a temporary and long-term timeline. However, no matter the timeframe of a project, the BOR needs to fund efforts that provide real, meaningful long-term reductions in water use from the River.The BOR needs to employ consistent measurement of system water losses in both basins of the River. Currently, the BOR only accounts for water evaporation in the Upper Basin. BOR funding should also be accompanied by system loss accounting in the Lower Basin. It is our hope that all projects funded by the BOR account for carryover for evaporation as soon as possible. This is consistent with the recent request by six of the seven basin States calling for BOR to account for system-based loss of the water.The BOR should look to new or innovative methods for reducing water use that leverages federal funds in an effective and efficient manner. While using the existing channels for deployment of these new funds, the BOR should encourage spending funds in a manner that allows for new data, technology, or programs with the ultimate goal of reducing overall water use basin-wide. For example, the BOR might consider using a portion of the $4 billion towards a potential request for proposals from States or other public entities to encourage creative solutions that work with local water users to incentivize long-term water reductions.We look forward to working with you to find solutions for the immediate crisis of the River while working towards a long-term solution to the challenges posed by a changing climate and the emergence of mega-drought in our states and throughout the American West.Thank you for your consideration of this request.Sincerely,"

The bill reforms and modernizes the outdated 1887 Electoral Count Act to ensure that electoral votes counted by Congress accurately reflect each state’s public vote for President and promote the orderly transfer of power. “The orderly and peaceful transfer of power is a cornerstone of our democracy,” said Bennet. “We should leave no room for anti-democratic forces to exploit ambiguities in our laws to undermine our elections and the will of the American people. This much-needed proposal makes overdue and commonsense reforms to the process for counting electoral votes to uphold the integrity of our elections and strengthen our democracy. I urge my colleagues to join this critical bipartisan legislation.”The legislation would reform and modernize the Electoral Count Act of 1887 by replacing ambiguous provisions in the 19th-century law with clear procedures that maintain appropriate state and federal roles in selecting the President and Vice President. Specifically, this bill will:Identify Official to Submit Slate. Identifies each state’s Governor, unless otherwise specified in the laws or constitution of a state in effect on Election Day, as responsible for submitting the certificate of ascertainment identifying that state’s electors. Congress could not accept a slate submitted by a different official. This reform would address the potential for multiple state officials to send Congress competing slates.Provide for Expedited Judicial Review. Provides for expedited review, including a three judge panel with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court, of certain claims related to a state’s certificate identifying its electors. This accelerated process is available only for aggrieved presidential candidates and allows for challenges made under existing federal law and the U.S. Constitution to be resolved more quickly.Modernizes Rules for Counting Electoral Votes. Requires Congress to defer to slates of electors submitted by a state’s executive pursuant to the judgments of state or federal courts.Clarifies Role of the Vice President. Affirmatively states that the constitutional role of the Vice President, as the presiding officer of the joint meeting of Congress, is solely ministerial and that he or she does not have any power to solely determine, accept, reject, or otherwise adjudicate disputes over electors.Raises Threshold to Object. Increases the threshold to lodge an objection to electors to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This change would reduce the likelihood of frivolous objections by ensuring that objections are broadly supported. Currently, only a single member of both chambers is needed to object to an elector or slate of electors.Protects Each State’s Popular Vote. Strikes an archaic, 19th century provision that state legislatures could use to override the popular vote in their states by declaring a “failed election.” Instead, this bill specifies that a state can move its presidential election day only if required by “extraordinary and catastrophic” events.Improves Access to Presidential Transition Resources. Allows more than one candidate to receive transition resources during a period of time when the outcome of an election is reasonably in doubt. Only one candidate, however, shall be eligible once there is a clear winner of the election.The text of the bill is available HERE. A one-page summary of the bill is available HERE."

As school starts across Colorado and the nation, state Medicaid agencies, local educational agencies, and school-based entities need clear guidance to reduce red tape and increase access to services that address the youth mental and behavioral health crisis. Schools are uniquely positioned to meet the mental and behavioral health needs of children. As of 2014, schools can use Medicaid funding to provide health services to students, but to date, less than half of states have expanded or started to expand Medicaid coverage in schools. This patchwork of policies has led to disparities in access to mental and behavioral health services at a time when students need them the most.“Updating federal guidance regarding Medicaid funding for services in school-based settings is long overdue and urgently needed to help address the youth mental and behavioral health crisis,” wrote Bennet in the letter to CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “Prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, up to 1 in 5 children ages 3 to 7 in the U.S. reported a mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral disorder. The pandemic has caused a surge in rates of depression, anxiety, trauma, loneliness, and suicidality among young people. In addition to these COVID-19 stressors, more than 140,000 children in the U.S. have lost a primary and/or secondary caregiver in the last two years.”The recently-passed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act instructed CMS to issue updated guidance for state Medicaid programs, local educational agencies, and school-based settings to implement and expand school-based health programs. This guidance will include best practices for accessing Medicaid funding, identifying eligible providers, and utilizing telehealth to deliver mental and behavioral health services in schools, helping more kids receive the support they need.“State Medicaid agencies, local educational agencies, and school-based entities need clear guidance and help reducing administrative burden to provide better support to kids during this crisis. To that end, I ask that CMS urgently work to issue the new guidance and provide my office with an expected timeline for release,” Bennet concluded. In September 2021, Bennet and U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) released “A Bold Vision for America’s Mental Well-being,” a white paper outlining a new framework for reimagining and redesigning how mental and behavioral health care is delivered in the United States. This framework included principles to better integrate mental health care and enhance delivery within local communities, including in school-based settings. The full text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Administrator Brooks-LaSure:In June 2022, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to address gun violence, improve school safety, and invest in mental and behavioral health. Under Section 11003 of the act, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has been tasked with issuing “guidance to State Medicaid programs, local educational agencies, and school-based entities to support the delivery of medical assistance to Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries in school-based settings.” Updating federal guidance regarding Medicaid funding for services in school-based settings is long overdue and urgently needed to help address the youth mental and behavioral health crisis.Prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, up to 1 in 5 children ages 3 to 7 in the U.S. reported a mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral disorder.[1] The pandemic has caused a surge in rates of depression, anxiety, trauma, loneliness, and suicidality among young people. In addition to these COVID-19 stressors, more than 140,000 children in the U.S. have lost a primary and/or secondary caregiver in the last two years.[2] In May 2021, Children’s Hospital Colorado underscored how suicide has become the leading cause of death for Colorado’s children and the increasing demand for health services by declaring a “State of Emergency” in youth mental health.[3] As CMS has previously found, schools can fill a critical role in identifying and connecting children with mental and behavioral health services.[4]While Medicaid expenditures for school-based health services have increased since CMS changed its guidance on “free care” in 2014, less than half of States have expanded or started the process of expanding Medicaid coverage in schools.[5],[6] New flexibility to expand Medicaid reimbursement has led to a patchwork of policies that provide different degrees of support for school-based health services. Students of color, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and kids living in rural areas are most negatively affected by disparities in coverage and access to services.I appreciate the recently released Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services Information Bulletin pointing to existing guidance and strategies,[7] however updated federal Medicaid guidance for school-based services is desperately needed. State Medicaid agencies, local educational agencies, and school-based entities need clear guidance and help reducing administrative burden to provide better support to kids during this crisis. To that end, I ask that CMS urgently work to issue the new guidance and provide my office with an expected timeline for release.I appreciate your timely consideration of this matter.Sincerely,[1] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Protecting Youth Mental Health: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory.” (2021).

https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=03492A57-C23A-4041-95FA-DD2DAADF6D69,"Denver –– Last month, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, and Colorado U.S. Representative Joe Neguse urged President Joe Biden to use his Presidential authorities, including the Antiquities Act, to protect the landscapes included in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act and make Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range a national monument. Since then, veterans, Colorado elected leaders, and conservation and outdoor recreation advocates have joined the lawmakers’ effort and called on President Biden to swiftly take action. On Tuesday night, Bennet spoke to President Biden about the importance of protecting our public lands and making Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range a national monument.Here’s what they’re saying about this effort:“Our public lands and waters located within the CORE Act, including Colorado’s Camp Hale and the surrounding areas once used as training grounds, define our country, and it is what I fought for and am still fighting to defend. Much of the nation’s—and specifically Colorado’s—ski industry stemmed from World War II veterans who were trained there. Taking skills learned on public lands and giving them back to the general public in a continued service that lives on through today. President Biden can honor generations of veterans by designating the Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument,” said Brad Noone, 10th Mountain Division combat veteran (Afghanistan 2006-2007).“We are thrilled with the possibility of a new monument designation for Camp Hale in Eagle County. This monument will honor the service of our veterans from the 10th Mountain Division who trained at Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range, served our nation with distinction in World War II and returned home to help found Colorado’s outdoor recreation economy. This national historic landscape will receive the protections it deserves through monument designation, assuring it will be enjoyed and serve as a place of respect for generations to come,” said Kathy Chandler-Henry, Eagle County Commissioner.“The Wilderness Society has long supported community-driven efforts to protect lands from the San Juan Mountains to Thompson Divide to the Continental Divide and Camp Hale. We strongly encourage President Biden to exercise his executive authority to protect these treasured places by designating the Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument, and doing everything he can to secure protections for the Thompson Divide and in the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forest plan. These actions would be responsive to the consensus we have built with communities and local partners over the years around the CORE Act,” said Jim Ramey, Colorado State Director, The Wilderness Society. “Declaring the Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument will help ensure that all people, from all walks of life and parts of this nation and beyond will know that this area will be protected to continue as a vital part of the American West,” said Mayor Hunter Mortensen, Frisco, Colorado.“Few places epitomize the connection between Veterans and our nation’s public lands quite like Camp Hale, a former training site for the U.S. Army – most notably for the 10th Mountain Division – where Soldiers learned to fight in cold weather conditions. After World War II ended, those very same Veterans returned to these areas and helped launch the ski industry and modern outdoor recreational economy of Colorado. This is a campaign we’ve been working on for years with our fellow Veterans on the ground in Colorado and here in Washington. We want to offer a sincere thanks to Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper, Governor Polis, and Congressman Joe Neguse for their unwavering commitment to championing the creation of the Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument. Without them, this campaign would not be where it is today. President Biden, we urge you to use your authority via the Antiquities Act to permanently protect Camp Hale and create the Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument – a place everyone will be able to enjoy for generations to come, Veterans and non-Veterans alike,” said Janessa Goldbeck, CEO, Vet Voice Foundation.“Colorado's public lands are essential to our unparalleled wildlife. The CORE Act would safeguard special places and also serve as a model for balancing outdoor recreation and wildlife conservation. We join the broad array of countless others across our state who have supported the CORE Act for these many years and the request by Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper, Representative Neguse and Governor Polis that these lands finally become protected. For example, an administrative 20-year mineral withdrawal in the Thompson Divide, following community engagement, would provide interim protections from future oil and gas leasing in this critical wildlife landscape, while these committed leaders move the legislative process forward to gain a permanent withdrawal,” said Suzanne O'Neill, Colorado Wildlife Federation. “The Tenmile Range and Camp Hale are some of the most unique sites among the many cultural, historical, and natural resources that the Continental Divide Trail connects. For time immemorial, this landscape has been stewarded by Indigenous people and the designation of this National Monument can help ensure the ongoing protection of this special place. With these proposed protections, we hope for a strategy of bold, innovative stewardship that meets this moment of the climate crisis while serving the communities that depend on vibrant, connected greenspaces the most. This action on the part of Colorado’s delegation demonstrates that community-led conservation not only works, but that leaders in Congress like Senator Bennet, Senator Hickenlooper, and Representative Neguse, are listening to the urgent calls for bold action to protect our special places,” said Teresa Martinez, executive director, Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC).“Coloradans love our wild places. Senator Bennet, Senator Hickenlooper and Representative Neguse are responding to support from across the state for stronger protections for Colorado’s beautiful landscapes and critical ecosystems. The Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument will be an excellent addition to our state’s already impressive array of unique protected places. Safeguarding these lands will move us closer to our national goal to protect 30 percent of our nation’s lands and waters by 2030, a critical action for fighting climate change, saving wildlife species and creating a greener future for all,” said Ellen Montgomery, public lands campaign director, Environment Colorado.“Colorado’s national monuments are treasured places that help tell the multi-layered story of our country. The story of the Camp Hale landscape changed our state forever and deserves to be preserved, protected, and collaboratively interpreted for future generations here in Colorado and nationwide. This is why we proudly join so many voices at the grassroots, local, and national level in urging the Biden administration to designate a Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument,” said Tracy Coppola, Senior Colorado Program Manager, National Parks Conservation Association. “Mountain Mamas are so grateful to Senators Bennet, Hickenlooper, and Congressman Joe Neguse for their hard work to protect Colorado's Camp Hale and Continental Divide Trail. Moms support their efforts and urge the Biden administration to take action and designate these places as national monuments. All Americans, especially Coloradans, appreciate the importance of valuing and preserving our lands. By protecting these areas that hold important history, we are ensuring our children and their children will share in the pride we feel for our state's history and contributions. They will also have places to recreate and enjoy the Colorado way of life as we do today,” said Jen Clanahan, Colorado Director, Mountain Mamas.“This is an excellent opportunity for President Biden to use his authority to protect public lands at the invitation of state lawmakers and community stakeholders who have worked tirelessly to put together a responsible conservation plan for Colorado. The CORE Act has strong public support among Coloradans, where residents see the value in conserving public lands for future generations. Almost 90 percent of Colorado voters said they support protections proposed in the CORE Act in recent polling conducted by the Center for Western Priorities. Despite strong public support, the CORE Act has been held up in the Senate by lawmakers who are dead set against passing any conservation legislation. It’s time for President Biden to step in to deliver for the people of Colorado,” said Jennifer Rokala, Executive Director, Center for Western Priorities.“I’m thrilled that Senator Bennet is calling on President Biden to take prompt action to protect the Thompson Divide! Our community has been working for well over a decade to protect ranching, recreation, and wildlife in the Divide from oil and gas development; an administrative withdrawal will expand existing protections and provide certainty until the CORE Act permanently protects these public lands. We’re also excited to work with our communities to support a National Monument designation for the Camp Hale – Continental Divide landscape. We’re grateful to see Colorado’s leaders responding to the overwhelming support for permanently protecting the CORE Act landscapes. We remain committed to passing the full CORE Act to designate the spectacular proposed Wilderness and other public lands in this critical legislation,” said Will Roush, Executive Director, Wilderness Workshop.“LCV joins advocates and officials in Colorado in calling to protect Camp Hale, the Tenmile Range, and the Thompson Divide,” LCV President Gene Karpinski said. “Thank you to Senator Bennet for his leadership in pushing to protect these magnificent places. We look forward to working with him, Senator Hickenlooper, Congressman Neguse, Governor Polis and the Biden-Harris administration to preserve these historical and ecological resources and support the ever-growing outdoor recreation economy.” “In the CORE Act, Colorado lawmakers have taken great care to protect the world-class hiking, climbing, and mountain biking along the Continental Divide, the San Juan Mountains, and the Thompson Divide. We join Senator Bennet, Senator Hickenlooper, Representative Neguse, and Governor Polis in asking the Biden administration to advance this a collaborative and locally-led approach to crafting the legislation, and the proposed protections in the CORE Act have been proposal that has been carefully vetted by recreation groups to protect and enhance hiking, climbing, skiing, and mountain biking, while also providing broader protection for the landscape. As outdoor recreationists passionate about conservation, we strongly support the thoughtful protections embodied in the CORE Act,” said Louis Geltman, policy director, Outdoor Alliance.“The CORE Act protects Colorado’s public lands, including some exceptional mountain peaks and traverses. Access Fund, and the entire climbing community, deeply appreciate protecting the legacy of Camp Hale, where many of the climbing, skiing, and mountaineering techniques used today were developed by the 10th Mountain Division. Colorado climbers support the CORE Act and join Senator Bennet, Hickenlooper, Representative Neguse, and Governor Polis in asking the Biden administration to protect the places within the CORE Act,” said Erik Murdock, Vice President of Policy and Government Affairs, Access Fund."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=450B1C1C-D082-4764-864E-EA123098446E,"Denver – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper welcomed $100,000,000 for the Colorado Department of Transportation’s (CDOT) I-70 improvement project at Floyd Hill. Bennet and Hickenlooper wrote to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in support of CDOT’s grant proposal in May. In February, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Colorado U.S. Congressman Joe Neguse, and Colorado Governor Polis hosted Buttigieg at Floyd Hill. “When we passed the infrastructure law, we made the biggest investment in our roads and bridges since the Eisenhower presidency. And as a result, Colorado is receiving $100 million for the vital I-70 corridor, which millions of homes and businesses depend on,” said Bennet. “After Secretary Buttigieg visited Floyd Hill, Senator Hickenlooper and I urged him to deliver the funding for this critical project. I look forward to seeing how it will improve safety and decrease congestion for all who travel from the Front Range to the West Slope.” “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is again delivering for Colorado. The Floyd Hill project will upgrade an essential tract of I-70, boosting our mountain economies and easing congestion so Coloradans can access the great outdoors,” said Hickenlooper. This grant will improve safety, mobility, and operational efficiency on I-70 from Floyd Hill to Veterans Memorial Tunnel. This project is a priority for CDOT and communities throughout the state. It is also the largest transportation project in Colorado since work began on the expansion of I-70 through Denver.Today’s $100 million grant award came from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Bennet and Hickenlooper passed in August 2021 and President Joe Biden signed into law in November 2021. CDOT applied for the grant through the INFRA Grants Program at the U.S. Department of Transportation. "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=72047169-F2D9-4E6F-908F-59ED44ECC65C,"Denver – Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet announced that his agriculture policy and regional staff will host additional Farm Bill listening sessions in Southwest Colorado, the San Luis Valley, and the Denver area in the coming weeks. Today’s announcement comes after Bennet and his staff held 17 listening sessions on the Front Range, the Eastern Plains, the West Slope, and in Northwestern Colorado in the last six months. With plans to organize at least a dozen more discussions, Bennet is on track to hold more Farm Bill listening sessions than he did in the lead-up to the 2018 and 2014 Farm Bills and gather more input than ever before to ensure Colorado’s priorities are reflected in the upcoming Farm Bill. “Across Colorado, we’ve heard from farmers and ranchers about the toll severe drought, increased prices, and our broken immigration system has taken on their operations. This year, my team and I will hold more listening sessions than ever before to ensure next year’s Farm Bill reflects the priorities of Colorado,” said Bennet. In an effort to make sure Colorado’s needs are part of the national discussion about next year’s Farm Bill, Bennet and his staff are hosting listening sessions across the state throughout 2022. This year, Bennet kicked off his listening sessions with roundtables in Pueblo and Fort Collins in April and May. In April, he also hosted a forestry and fire listening session with Meryl Harrell, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, and U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore in Boulder. Since then, his staff have held listening sessions across the Eastern Plains, the West Slope, and in Northwestern Colorado. In August, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Bennet to hear from producers and nutrition leaders in Palisade. During the listening sessions thus far, Bennet and his staff have heard from farmers, producers, and community and business leaders about the threat that drought poses to their livelihoods and operations. Colorado producers have told them about the effects that increased costs have had on their balance sheets – including the cost of inputs like seed, fertilizer, and diesel – and the need for stronger USDA safety net programs. Nutrition leaders have stressed the importance of federal nutrition programs to support Colorado families during and after the pandemic. Listening session attendees also have emphasized the need for legislation to reform our immigration system for producers and farmworkers, which Bennet continues  to negotiate in the Senate with Idaho U.S. Senator Mike Crapo. Bennet has served on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee since first coming to the U.S. Senate in 2009. During that time, he has worked to pass two bipartisan Farm Bills -- in 2014 and 2018 -- and secured a number of priorities for Colorado, such as new tools to improve drought resilience and soil health, and expanded funding for collaborative forest restoration and wildlife habitat improvements. Since passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, Bennet has remained committed to ensuring key Colorado priorities in the bill are fully and effectively implemented.As the Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee’s Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry and Natural Resources and Chair of the Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, Bennet has pushed to make major investments in our forests and agricultural economy. He secured $4 billion to address drought in the West and in the Colorado River Basin in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law last month. The IRA will also invest more than $20 billion in working lands conservation measures and $5 billion to restore the health of our forests to prevent wildfires, modeled after his Outdoor Restoration Partnership Act. At Bennet’s urging, the bipartisan infrastructure law also made a major investment in our forests – for a combined historic $10 billion investment in our forests."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=6A410272-3FCD-4550-95EB-933A093E32D1,"Denver – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper applauded an announcement from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that it will provide access to abortion and abortion services to veterans and eligible dependents in cases of rape and incest, or when the life of the woman is at risk. In July, Bennet, Hickenlooper, and a group of their colleagues urged the agency to allow the Veterans Health Administration to provide abortions. “The VA’s decision to offer abortion services to veterans and their dependents is significant. I’ll keep pushing the agency to provide these services to all veterans, regardless of circumstance,” said Bennet.“Abortion is essential health care and we’ll continue urging the VA to expand care to all who need it. This is an important step to expand access to veterans and their beneficiaries,” said Hickenlooper.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Bennet and Hickenlooper remain committed to protecting access to reproductive rights. In August, Bennet and Hickenlooper introduced legislation to eliminate copayments for contraception covered by the VA. Bennet, Hickenlooper, and their Democratic colleagues attempted to pass a bill to protect doctors providing legal abortion care to out-of-state patients, but Senate Republicans blocked its passage. The lawmakers also introduced and attempted to pass legislation to protect the right of individuals to cross state lines for reproductive health care, but Senate Republicans blocked its passage as well. Bennet and Hickenlooper spoke on the Senate floor in support of this effort. "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=BE4C233E-AA25-46EF-A6C7-CCA4FAC8C6E8,"Denver – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper celebrated President Joe Biden’s intent to nominate Judge Gordon Gallagher to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Bennet and Hickenlooper recommended Gallagher to the White House for the position in April. If confirmed by the Senate, Gallagher would serve on the court once Judge William Martínez takes senior status on February 10, 2023.“For decades, Judge Gallagher has sought to achieve justice and equality under the law for Coloradans, especially those along the West Slope and in Tribal communities,” said Bennet. “With his robust experience on the federal bench and unwavering commitment to the law, he will be a terrific addition to the District Court, and I look forward to supporting his nomination during the confirmation process.”“Judge Gallagher has devoted his career to Western Slope and Tribal communities and will apply this important perspective to his work,” said Hickenlooper. “He is an experienced jurist who will be a fair and compassionate addition to the U.S. District Court. We look forward to the Senate confirming his nomination.”Judge Gallagher has served as a magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado since 2012. He was unanimously re-appointed to the position in 2016 and 2020. Earlier in his career, Judge Gallagher served as a Deputy District Attorney for the 21st Judicial District (Mesa County) from 1997-2000. In 2000, he began a criminal defense practice focusing on state court litigation in western Colorado. Judge Gallagher served as a member of the Grand Valley Task Force’s criminal justice working group where he worked to address systemic bias in the community. Judge Gallagher also works to provide rehabilitative resources for the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes. In addition, he has worked for over a decade to provide legal representation to indigent defendants as part of the Alternate Defense Counsel (ADC) and served as Chair of the Pro Se Working Group to “investigate and consider how [the District] court can best facilitate pro se access to the court and how pro se cases can be handled in the most efficient and economical fashion.”Judge Gallagher now serves as Co-Chair of the Pro Se Prisoner Task Force which was constituted to find ways to support and manage pro se litigation by state and federal prisoners. He graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1991 and obtained his J.D. at the University of Denver College of Law in 1996. "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=0C1BD39A-44B8-4235-A3C8-01CF70F41268,"Denver — Yesterday, at the annual National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA) conference in Denver, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet highlighted the progress Congress has made to expand access to high-speed, affordable broadband and close the digital divide. Last year, Bennet introduced the bipartisan Broadband Reform and Investment to Drive Growth in the Economy (BRIDGE) Act with U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Angus King (I-Maine), which was incorporated into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make the single largest investment in broadband in history.“I am convinced that high-speed broadband is as important to America’s competitiveness today as rural electrification was in the 1930s, or the interstate highway system was in the 1950s,” said Bennet in his remarks. “It would be inconceivable to imagine our country today if our parents and grandparents hadn’t made those investments for our benefit. And if we rise to the moment, our kids and grandkids are going to look back 30 years from now, or 60 years from now, and say the same thing about our work to ensure that every American, no matter where they live, has access to affordable, high-speed broadband.”At the conference, Bennet accepted the Jane E. Lawton Commemorative Award from NATOA for his efforts to ensure that broadband is accessible and affordable for every American.“NATOA and our members are grateful for Senator Bennet's national leadership on addressing broadband inequality. His efforts to ensure that broadband is accessible and affordable for every American will make a significant impact on the day-to-day lives of millions of Americans. The broadband provisions of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which were derived from his BRIDGE Act, will allow states and local governments to ensure every resident is able to enjoy the benefits of broadband services. We are also grateful for the Senator's strong advocacy to improve the broadband services, which contributed to the USDA increasing the minimum speeds and standards for its ReConnect program, and his consistent efforts to improve the FCC’s E-Rate program,” said NATOA President Michael Russo. Bennet has helped lead the effort to bridge America’s digital divide in Congress. In addition to writing the BRIDGE Act, in March 2021, Bennet, alongside Senators King, Portman, and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) urged the Biden Administration to establish a consistent, 21st-century definition of broadband to reflect modern demands of families, farms, and businesses. Last month, Bennet and the senators welcomed the FCC’s proposal to redefine broadband connections  in line with what the senators called for as 100 megabits (Mbps) per second or faster for download speeds.  During the pandemic, Bennet also consistently called for more funding and flexibility for the FCC’s E-Rate program to connect low-income students online and helped secure more than $7 billion to close the digital divide for students nationwide in the American Rescue Plan.Bennet’s full remarks are available below.Thank you. I’m so pleased to win this award. I feel grateful for the recognition because really it belongs to Colorado, which is where we wrote the BRIDGE Act because of the exceptional leadership of communities across our state who are figuring out how to move the country into the future. So I am particularly grateful to win this award on my home turf and congratulations to the home team for also winning their award. Thank you to Rick and Nancy and thank you to NATOA for having us here today. I want to start by thanking you for your leadership during a really difficult two years for our state, and for the country. It’s been a really difficult time and this conference is proof that maybe we are finally getting back to normal.So in that spirit, let me say welcome to Colorado and those of you from Colorado we are delighted that you are here.There were some upsides to COVID for me because there was a certain period of time when my now seventeen year old daughter couldn’t really leave the house. She’s our third daughter and I would go in in the afternoon because I was working in the other end of the house, she was working in her room, and I’d go open the door and she’d say, “What are you doing in here? Get out of here! I’m social distancing. I'm doing what the governor is telling me to do.” She’s very happy to be back at school. And I’m very happy to be here with all of you.And when you think about it, it should never have taken a pandemic to put broadband at the top of Washington’s agenda.Because I’ve been hearing about broadband since I was a school superintendent, certainly, and off and on for the 13 years that I have been in the Senate.No matter where I’ve gone in the state— whether it’s on the Front Range, the Eastern Plains of Colorado, or the West Slope— broadband has come up again and again and again.And if I were to summarize what people have told me over the past 13 years, it’s very easy to do: Broadband was too slow or too expensive for their family, farm, or small business— even though it was becoming more central to their lives every single month, every single day.And that was before the pandemic.Once the pandemic hit, we all saw what happened:Families struggling to work remotely and going to school on the same, outdated network.Businesses struggling to transition to telework.And most offensive to me was the idea that kids in poor communities in Colorado, many of them rural communities in our state, were having to go to Wal-Mart parking lots to do their homework because they had no broadband at home.  And because my job, before I was in this job, was to superintend a school, it seemed obvious to me— it’s always seemed obvious to me— that when you got one set of kids with access to the internet because of resources at home and you have another set of kids that don’t have access to the internet because they don't have resources at home, in the 21st century that is identical to accepting a school system in America where some kids have access to textbooks and other kids have no access to textbooks. There have been times in this country’s history when we’ve tolerated that set of inequality for our children. Those are not the moments of which I am most proud, and we need to make sure that we address it.So we came through COVID, and during COVID I was thinking how unconscionable it was that we had put kids in this position. And of course it wasn’t accidental. I mean, this is the result of Washington’s underinvestment year after year after year. And if there’s any silver lining at all to what we’ve just been through, it’s that it created a bipartisan consensus that we could no longer accept the status quo. It fed a renewed sense of urgency, finally, to bridge America’s digital divide.And so a few months into the pandemic, I introduced the BRIDGE Act -- a bill I wrote, as I said, on the ground in Colorado working with people here, notwithstanding the lack of constructive federal policy in this area, who are figuring out how to deliver high-speed broadband to their constituents at an affordable price. And I should say that a big help on that bill was NATOA’s past president Ken Fellman, the past Mayor of Arvada, Colorado, who has been a leader on telecommunications since before he was Mayor of Arvada, and he was enormously helpful, as well as local governments across the state from Longmont to the Delta-Montrose’s Electric Association on the Western Slope of Colorado.And just for a reminder, the BRIDGE Act did essentially three things. First, it put, for the first time, states and local communities in the driver’s seat— not Washington, DC— on the theory that you better understand the needs on the ground and have the greatest incentive to spend the funds effectively.Another way of thinking about that is having the greatest incentive not to waste money or spend the money ineffectively, or not know what you’re doing, which we’ve seen with the $50 billion of telecom money that Washington sent to the largest telecom companies in the country who then visibly didn’t deliver the broadband to rural America or the underserved communities. So the first was getting the actors right. Second, the bill preempted state laws that restrict municipal broadband, including S.B. 152 right here in Colorado. We couldn’t get that part of it done in the [infrastructure law], but I’m hopeful that we’re going to do it going forward and welcome your partnership. We included that provision by the way because we understood what everyone here knows intuitively– communities need choice. They need competition. And when the private market won’t provide the quality broadband people need, local governments should have the freedom to offer it directly.And this isn’t speculation when it comes to my state, and I’m sure to yours. Here in Colorado, over 100 communities have voted to opt out of S.B. 152, and communities like Longmont now offer some of the fastest broadband in the country. Which brings me to the third point of the BRIDGE Act. We significantly raised the minimum standards for new broadband projects. We quadrupled the minimum download speed from 25 megabits per second to 100.We also said that states have to prioritize even faster, gigabit networks that can meet our needs in the 21st century, and so we wouldn’t have to rebuild those networks in five or ten years.This all may sound totally obvious to the people in this room, or it may sound like common sense to all of you, but it’s exactly the opposite of what Washington’s policies have been for the last 40 years. We’ve frittered away billions of dollars, as I said, to subsidize networks that were outdated almost as soon as they were completed. And then what we did was hand out more subsidies to do it all over again. It wasted a lot of money and left a lot of communities in Colorado and the West and our country behind.So that’s what I heard over and over and over again, especially in rural areas. And it’s why the BRIDGE Act insisted on the highest broadband standards no matter where you live.We put the bill out over two years ago, and last summer we reintroduced it with Senator Rob Portman, my friend who’s a Republican from Ohio, Senator Angus King, who’s an independent from Maine. I’m campaigning now, and I love to tell the story of how this wasn't just a bipartisan bill, it was a tripartisan bill in the US Senate. And when the bipartisan infrastructure proposal finally came together, the three of us worked very hard to add the BRIDGE Act to the final bill.And now, the $42.5 billion in broadband funding going to states through the BEAD program comes almost entirely from the bill that I wrote with many of you in Colorado.And unfortunately, we didn’t succeed, as I said, in getting the municipal broadband language in the bill, but we insisted that local governments have a seat at the table and were eligible for the funding. This was a tough fight for reasons that I am happy to describe if anyone is interested, but now the truly hard work now falls on everybody here to do the work and seize this historic opportunity for Colorado and communities all across this country.Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime investment. We are not going to see this again. And I am convinced that high-speed broadband is as important to America’s competitiveness today as rural electrification was in the 1930s, or the interstate highway was in the 1950s.It would be inconceivable to imagine our country today if our parents and grandparents hadn’t made those investments for our benefit.And if we rise to the moment, our kids and grandkids are going to look back 30 years from now, or 60 years from now, and say the same thing about our work to ensure that every American, no matter where they live, has access to affordable, high-speed broadband.So thank you again for having me. Thank you NATOA for embracing Colorado with your presence. We’ll take you back anytime."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=47DFF55D-C9BF-4FC4-A6E6-97CC9C1A0116,"Denver–– Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper welcomed $9.7 million to reimburse the state’s cleanup of the damage to Interstate 70 (I-70) through Glenwood Canyon caused by extreme mudslides last year. The funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Emergency Relief (ER) Program funds to help states repair roads and bridges damaged by severe storms, floods, wildfires and other events.“Over the last year, we’ve continued to work together to secure necessary resources to repair Glenwood Canyon, restore the Colorado River, and support the communities that rely on them. There’s more to do to protect this important corridor, and we won’t stop until the work is done,” said Bennet. “Last summer’s disaster shows why we need more climate resilient infrastructure,” said Hickenlooper. “Glenwood Canyon supports economies across the Western Slope and the Front Range.” After Colorado Governor Jared Polis formally authorized the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to request emergency resources from the FHWA Emergency Relief program, Bennet and Hickenlooper led the Colorado Congressional Delegation in urging the Biden Administration to quickly approve the request. Four days later, the Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration awarded the CDOT $11.6 million to begin repairs to I-70. FHWA emergency funds can be used to rebuild roads after natural disasters and improve resiliency against future disasters. In February, Bennet and Hickenlooper invited Secretary Buttigieg to visit Glenwood Canyon to see the recovery efforts first hand."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=01320F29-30CB-4628-AF48-0736A4E028AD,"Denver – Today, the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel editorial board endorsed Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet’s effort to make Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range a national monument. Last week, Bennet, Colorado U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, and Colorado U.S. Representative Joe Neguse urged President Joe Biden to use his Presidential authorities, including the Antiquities Act, to designate Colorado's Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range as the Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument and protect other landscapes included in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act, including the Thompson Divide and the Grand Mesa Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests Bennet has worked on the CORE Act with Coloradans for over a decade to protect over 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado, boost the state’s economy, establish new wilderness areas, and safeguard existing outdoor recreation opportunities for future generations. As Bennet, Hickenlooper, Neguse, and Polis continue to fight to pass the CORE Act through Congress, they are urging the administration to take swift action and protect these landscapes for future generations.The full editorial is available HERE and below.Grand Junction Daily Sentinel: Editorial: Make Camp Hale a monumentCamp Hale outside Leadville was used during World War II as a training area for the 10th Mountain Division, with members of that division fighting in key battles in the war and afterwards helping establish the ski industry in the state. It is past time to protect Camp Hale by designating it a National Monument.Most of the men who were training at Camp Hale and fought bravely to defend the U.S. and Europe in World War II have passed away. If this historic place isn’t made a National Monument soon there won’t be any left to see it protected.Last week, U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse were joined by Gov. Jared Polis in writing to President Joe Biden to ask him in part to use his authority under the Antiquities Act to designate the Camp Hale area and acreage on the Tenmile Range as the Camp Hale — Continental Divide National Monument, according to reporting by The Daily Sentinel’s Dennis Webb.Outside the valley floor where the soldiers were housed, the Army used the mountainous terrain to train soldiers for winter warfare, and generations since have recreated in the same landscape. Protecting this area has been something in the works through the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act, which has passed in the House of Representatives multiple times but has yet to clear the Senate.The bill would withdraw about 200,000 acres in the Thompson Divide area from future oil and gas leasing, provide wilderness or other conservation designations for other lands from Colorado’s central mountains to southwest Colorado, formally designate the boundaries of the long-existing Curecanti National Recreation Area west of Gunnison, and establish Camp Hale outside Leadville as the nation’s first National Historic Landscape.“This legislation has been built from the ground up with years of dedicated stakeholder engagement and enjoys bipartisan support,” the letter to Biden says. “Regrettably, progress in Congress has stalled despite strong support in Colorado. The time has come to take the next step in protecting the key landscapes within the CORE Act and we need your help.”We have written in support of the CORE Act before and we still think it should be passed. That said, the Senate has not been able to come together to get this legislation onto the president’s desk. Since Biden can protect this historic area without the need of new legislation, we believe the time has come to do so.Notwithstanding, there are other aspects of the CORE Act that should continue to be pursued. It may take passing the various aspects of this legislation in a more piecemeal fashion, but it should not be abandoned.While that hard work continues, we can show the men who trained at Camp Hale our thanks and respect by protecting this place that is so important to Colorado’s history and the history of our armed services.Make Camp Hale and the surrounding landscape a National Monument this year."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=FEB0F7E5-2EFE-42A8-B338-41E51D6803A9,"Denver — Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper welcomed news that Colorado will receive an initial $25 million in grant funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to create jobs cleaning up orphaned oil and gas wells across the state. The funds were announced by the Department of the Interior and are a part of a new $4.7 billion federal program created by the infrastructure bill. In total, Colorado will receive at least $79 million in grants and formula funding from the program.“This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, consistent with provisions in my Oil and Gas Bonding Reform and Orphaned Well Remediation Act, will help Colorado reduce harmful pollution from dangerous orphaned oil and gas wells,"" said Bennet. ""I welcome this much-needed support to reduce methane emissions, create good-paying jobs, protect our watersheds, and restore wildlife habitat in our state.”“Methane leaks are more dangerous than carbon dioxide to communities and the environment,” said Hickenlooper. “Now we will stop leaks and create good-paying union jobs in the process.”Plugging orphan wells will help reduce methane emissions. Last year, Bennet introduced legislation to clean up abandoned, or orphaned, oil and gas wells while strengthening bonding requirements and expanding opportunities for local input in lease sales on public lands— consistent with Department of Interior funding to support programs to plug, remediate, and reclaim orphaned wells on Federal, State, and Tribal lands.Colorado has led this effort since then-Governor Hickenlooper established the first-ever regulations for methane emissions. Colorado’s regulations became the national model established under President Obama and the Global Methane Pledge more than 100 countries have signed onto.Colorado will use the funds to begin plugging and remediating 710 abandoned wells identified by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s initial grant funds.Millions of Americans live within a mile of one of the tens of thousands of documented orphaned oil and gas wells across the country. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill’s historic investments to clean up these hazardous sites will create good-paying, union jobs, catalyze economic growth and revitalization, and reduce dangerous methane leaks. In addition to the funding announced today, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill created a $150 million Tribal orphaned well grant program and a separate $250 million program for remediation of orphan wells on federal land, which will be implemented by the Bureau of Land Management."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=137260E6-14DC-40D4-8F91-65A1F62C1921,"Denver — Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, and Colorado U.S. Representative Joe Neguse urged President Joe Biden to use his Presidential authorities, including the Antiquities Act, to protect the landscapes included in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act. This letter comes after U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Bennet, Hickenlooper, Polis, and Neguse this month to meet with Colorado stakeholders, who called for urgent administrative actions to protect Camp Hale and other landscapes in the bill, including the Continental Divide, the Thompson Divide, and the San Juan Mountains. “We appreciate Secretary Vilsack’s recent visit to Colorado to see Camp Hale. Based on the overwhelming support expressed at the meeting from local elected leaders, conservation stakeholders, sportsmen, ranchers, business leaders, veterans and the 10th Mountain Division Foundation it is clear that Coloradans across the state support the conservation and preservation of these landscapes for future generations,” wrote Bennet, Hickenlooper, Polis, and Neguse in the letter. “We strongly urge you to use your Presidential authorities to swiftly protect Colorado’s public lands within the CORE Act.”Specifically, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Polis and Neguse are urging Biden to use the Antiquities Act to designate Colorado's Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range as the Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument.  They also request the protection of Colorado’s Thompson Divide through a Federal Lands Policy and Management Act mineral withdrawal, which would ban new oil and gas leasing, as well as mining, on a landscape where community members, including farmers and ranchers, have come together to request protection. In addition, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Polis and Neguse call on Biden to bring new protections to the areas of the CORE Act proposed for wilderness designation, mineral withdrawal and special management areas on the Grand Mesa Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests by using the upcoming U.S. Forest Service plan revisions or other administrative tools. More specific details on these protections can be found in this letter of support from seven Colorado county commissioners integral to the CORE Act. The letter continued: “By taking these steps, you will be making sure that even more of Colorado’s open spaces will be preserved for future generations. We will continue our fight to pass the CORE Act to deliver permanent conservation for the areas featured in the legislation but ask for your help in the interim to offer administrative protections modeled after the CORE Act.”The text of the letter is available HERE. In January 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper and Colorado U.S. Congressman Joe Neguse reintroduced the CORE Act. The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives five times. In May 2022, Bennet and Hickenlooper welcomed the Senate’s first-ever committee vote on the CORE Act.The CORE Act combines four previously introduced Colorado public land bills, which have been in development over the past decade: the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness, and Camp Hale Legacy Act, the San Juan Mountains Wilderness Act, the Thompson Divide Withdrawal and Protection Act, and the Curecanti National Recreation Area Boundary Establishment Act.Of the land protected by the bill, 73,000 acres are designated as new wilderness, and nearly 80,000 acres are designated as new recreation and conservation management areas that preserve existing outdoor uses, such as hiking and mountain biking. The bill also includes a first-of-its-kind designation for Camp Hale as a National Historic Landscape, to honor World War II veterans and Colorado’s military legacy, and prohibits new oil and gas development in areas important to ranchers and sportsmen in the Thompson Divide.The CORE Act is supported by: Governor Jared Polis, the counties of San Miguel, Gunnison, Eagle, San Juan, Summit, Pitkin, and Ouray as well as the following towns and cities f of Ouray, Crested Butte, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Telluride, Basalt, Breckenridge, Ophir, Paonia, Ridgway, Minturn, Mountain Village, Vail, Snowmass, Mt Crested Butte  Frisco, and Dillon.In addition, the following organizations also support the bill: The Wilderness Society, Conservation Colorado, NPCA, Conservation Alliance, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Mountain Biking Association, TRCP, National Wildlife Foundation, Trout Unlimited, Outdoor Industry Association, Wilderness Workshop, Trust for Public Land, American Whitewater, Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, Roaring Fork Audubon, Roaring Fork Sierra Club, Solar Energy International, Carbondale Historical Society, Crystal Valley Environmental Protection Association, Arapahoe Basin, San Juan Citizens Alliance, Sheep Mountain Alliance, and Great Old Broads for Wilderness."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=BA226541-09F9-47AC-BB7C-F8DAC717722F,"Denver — On Tuesday, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, chair of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee’s Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources, spoke at the annual Colorado Water Congress. He highlighted the progress Congress has made to address extreme drought in the West through the Inflation Reduction Act and called for more action to tackle the Western water crisis.During his remarks, Bennet discussed the $4 billion he secured in the Inflation Reduction Act to address drought in the West by funding water conservation, habitat restoration, and mitigation as the American West faces extreme drought, fueled by climate change. Bennet also highlighted the law’s $370 billion investment to fight climate change, including nearly $30 billion for drought, forestry, conservation, and environmentally friendly farming, almost all of which is under Bennet’s Senate subcommittee on Agriculture.In June, Bennet chaired a subcommittee hearing to sound the alarm on the Western water crisis. He continues to work with his colleagues to build on the progress of the Inflation Reduction Act to address extreme drought, combat climate change, and protect Western water. Bennet’s full remarks are available below.I wanted to come here this year, as I come here every year, but I wanted to come here this year to say thank you to you for the extraordinary strides that we’ve been able to make because of your leadership. I think there's a strong case to make that the leaders in this room have done more for the West than anybody in the country thanks to our work together over the last thirteen years. As Christine said, I’m the first to admit that when I joined the Senate in 2009, I didn't know a lot about water issues and I didn't know a lot about ag issues either. I also didn't know that people describe the Agriculture Committee as the easiest committee to get on and the hardest committee to get off in the United States Senate. But I am very very grateful that I asked them to put me on there when I first went back because I know how much that it matters to Colorado and I know how poorly Washington understands what we’re facing. And so I’ve been proud to be there since the day I arrived and I’m still on the Agriculture Committee today so that I've had the opportunity to learn from you and work with you to put Colorado’s priorities at the top of the agenda, issues like drought and conservation and forest and watershed health, and elevate farmers and ranchers as part of the solution. And if you step back and look at what we’ve been able to do together over the past thirteen years, there’s a lot to feel good about. Together we wrote two farm bills that strengthened locally-led conservation programs at USDA and made them work better for Colorado’s farmers and ranches including the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, which was literally written in Colorado. Now we’re working on a third farm bill and last week I invited Secretary Vilsack out to join me in Palisade to see firsthand how these programs could work even better for our state by listening to producers that are here. We won $575 million in EWP funding to protect our watersheds after the catastrophic fires over the last several years, along with nearly $60 million for the Arkansas Valley Conduit, which -- that was the first bill I wrote in the United States Senate…I was just talking to a former commissioner back there saying “I don't know if I’ll still be alive by that time it’s finished” and he said “You will be, sign me up for the ribbon cutting.”Just this morning some of us were at a groundbreaking for a project to reconnect the upper Colorado at Windy Gap and we worked with people in this room to help push that forward to secure $14 million in federal funding, nearly half the cost of that project. And together, we've written bills to protect our waterways from invasive species, conserve the Dolores River Canyon, strengthen forest management across public and private lands, improve access to clean drinking water on tribal lands, and…finally end fire borrowing — a shortsighted approach that undermined prevention and put our communities at risk.But more than any one project or piece of legislation, all of this reflects our work to elevate Western water on the national agenda -- to make the federal government understand that in the West, water isn’t a secondary issue. It is the issue. And Washington’s role is to support leaders on the ground, not to micromanage or impose top-down mandates. That's the case I’ve made over and over in Washington over the last years and it hasn't always been easy. I cannot tell you the number of times that I've had to explain to Chuck Schumer that in Colorado, water is more important to our economy than the Brooklyn Bridge or the Lincoln Tunnel are to New York. I will say that last year, the smoke finally arrived in New York and in Washington during those fires from California and that also has made a difference because we have been able to capture people’s attention. We held the Senate’s very first hearing on Western drought in my subcommittee on the Ag committee so my colleagues can hear directly from Andy Mueller, who is here probably, and other experts about the dire conditions that we face. And because we made the case and because we laid the groundwork, when opportunities arose in the last two years to make historic investments in the country, Western water had a seat at the table. When the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law came together, Christine helped us write a letter urging the administration to make water a priority. The result was $8 billion for water infrastructure and $5.5 billion for forests. When the Inflation Reduction Act came together over the last month, we were ready for that as well. We partnered with other Western senators to make sure that we had funding for Western drought. I went on national television and I said because I couldn't get the leader on the phone, but I didn't give him time. I called him and then I didn't wait for the callback, but I went on national television and I said…I'm not going to vote for a bill that’s not good for the upper basin of the Colorado. I’m not going to vote for a bill that’s not good for Colorado. And in the end working with some of you we were able to get the language that we needed. And as we drafted that language, we spent hours on the phone with Colorado water leaders to make sure it worked for our state and the upper basin. And I want to be crystal clear that that will be true of any agreement we make going forward for the Colorado River. In the end, we got $4 billion for Western drought in the final bill. The initial version had $0 and Senator Manchin only wanted $1 [billion] and Senator Sinema who’s from Arizona wanted $5 [billion] but it was for the lower basin. And they were not liking each other at the moment very much, so Joe is saying how about $1 [billion] or $0 and I was saying Joe if it's $1 [billion] we’re never going to get this done. And in the end we settled on $4 [billion], and Senator Kelly from Arizona and I got to go spend the evening on Joe Manchin’s houseboat on the Potomac River for the first time.But it couldn't come soon enough obviously because the conditions are as dire as we've ever seen. And we all know that we’ve got a very difficult negotiation in front of us. We are going to need the federal government to backstop whatever states decide with the Bureau of Reclamation. And whatever they decide it should be obvious that the Upper Basin can't solve these challenges on our own. We have always lived within the compact. And when there is less water, we take less. Last year we actually cut our water use by a million-acre feet even as the lower basin increased their use by 600,000 acre feet. The people in this room have stepped up and you've made sacrifices to do more with less. And although we've got more difficult choices ahead, and I know that we do, we know temporary mandates are not going to cut it, and any long-term solution requires permanent reductions in use by the lower basin and all parties have to live with what the Colorado River can provide. As everybody here knows, the number one reason why the Colorado River is providing less water every year is climate change. A few years ago, you might remember, we were outside I think that day, I was here several years ago to ring the alarm on how climate change threatened the future of Western water and since then matters have only gotten more challenging. The people in our state on the front range and the West Slope are deeply worried about what’s happening to the quality of their lives. Just ask the outfitters, the anglers, the businesses here in Steamboat who rely on the Yampa [River]. Between the volunteer closures and the threat of mandatory closures, Steamboat’s economy faces a stark new reality. The same is true for Colorado’s $46 billion outdoor recreation sector and our $47 billion agriculture sector. And we see our state literally being incinerated by wildfire. We see less water in our rivers, more smoke in our skies. We worry about the future that we’re handing to our kids and to our grandkids, whether that farm or that ranch is going to be able to stay in the family. And we’ve been right to be worried. Because, unlike Colorado, Washington has done very little to meet this moment until now. Now the federal government has finally stepped up with $370 billion to fight climate change in the Inflation Reduction Act. With a single bill, Washington has gone from doing virtually nothing on climate to setting an example to the world for a responsible energy policy that will cut emissions, that will strengthen our energy independence and our economic independence, will help free us from tyrants like Vladamir Putin. And out of that $370 billion, nearly $30 billion touches the work that we’ve been doing together for the last thirteen years — drought, forestry, conservation, environmentally friendly farming, and almost all of that is under my Senate subcommittee, which means that Colorado now has an incredible opportunity to put our stamp on these programs. Speaking for myself, one of the best moments that I’ve had in this job is when I called my oldest daughter Caroline, and told her that we had finally done something meaningful on climate. That we’ve finally done something to make it a little bit better for her generation right when they started to give up hope. Because we can't give up hope. We have to keep going and we have to build on the historic progress that we’ve made by making sure this funding gets to the right projects and lifts up the hard work of our state and local leaders by fighting to defend Colorado’s seat at the table and the American West by continuing to push for more investment because we know this is only a down payment on what’s required. So I am so grateful for everything that we’ve accomplished together, but our work isn't done. We face profound challenges ahead, but I think we should view this as the opportunity of a lifetime. The opportunity to make decisions over the next five years that will strengthen the West for another hundred years -- to lay a durable new foundation for our Western environment, for our economy, and for our way of life. And to fulfill our responsibility to the next generation, and leave them Colorado in a better shape than we found it. I think that it is in the future, I think that is in the cards, and that there is a lot of reason for hope.Thank you for having me today."

They've devastated their credit scores, made it harder to purchase homes, start a business, or pay for childcare – and this crisis is only growing. “That’s why in June, I urged President Biden to target relief to those who need it most, provide additional relief to Pell grant recipients, and enact long-term reforms to this broken system. ""In my view, the administration should have further targeted the relief, and proposed a way to pay for this plan. While immediate relief to families is important, one-time debt cancellation does not solve the underlying problem. So I'm pleased to see reforms to income-driven repayment plans and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.“Moving forward, we need to reform the system that got us here in the first place with solutions to bring down the absurd cost of college. We cannot continue to trap another generation of Americans in this cruel cycle. And we need to continue our work to build career pathways to economic security for every American, including those who choose not to pursue a two or four-year degree.""BACKGROUND:In June, Bennet spoke on the Senate floor to urge long-term solutions to America’s student loan system and new measures to drive economic opportunity for all, especially for Americans who do not attend or graduate from college. Bennet proposed:Yesterday, Bennet joined a group of his colleagues to call on the Biden Administration to extend the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, which is when the Department’s proposed rules to improve and expand federal student debt relief for  programs like PSLF will take effect.  In March, Bennet called on President Joe Biden to extend the pause on student loan repayment until December 31, 2022 as the families and the economy continue to recover from the pandemic. Bennet also asked President Biden to work with leaders of both parties to develop long-term solutions to the U.S. student loan debt crisis. Following Bennet’s request, the president extended the moratorium until August 2022. "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=8F4B4599-E56F-430D-B4C6-7E4CA74F853B,"Denver – The Durango Herald published an editorial highlighting Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet’s legislation to protect the Dolores River Canyon. Bennet introduced the Dolores River National Conservation Area Act with Colorado U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper last month to designate a portion of the Canyon within Dolores, Montezuma, and San Miguel Counties as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Bennet worked with leaders in Southwest Colorado for years to develop this bill. It represents over a decade of collaboration and compromise by a diverse coalition to find the best way forward for the Dolores River Canyon.The full editorial is available HERE and below.Durango Herald: Our View: Lower Dolores River group rare, specialIt’s been a long time coming, these extraordinary bipartisan Senate and House bills that propose additional protections for the Lower Dolores River corridor. Equally impressive are stakeholders who spent 14 years, pulling together this legislation.At their first meeting during a blizzard in December 2008, a quick glance around the room could have produced skeptics. People from wildly diverse backgrounds sized up each other. Glared and made assumptions. County commissioners, ranchers, reps from water districts, Ute Mountain Ute members, recreationists, landowners, conservationists – some with boating habits – got through the initial awkwardness. At the time, though, you could almost smell the fear. Who would try to take water from whom?Instead, stakeholders heard each other’s concerns and learned they mostly wanted the same thing. A river that supports recreation and agriculture.This was a starting point, along with an unconditional love of the area. Good science would be their guide. They would become the Lower Dolores Working Group.Dolores County Commissioner Julie Kibel said: “By the time we got to the hard questions, we had built that bond. And that mutual respect.”The group came to embody the ability – rare and elusive – to put aside differences for a mutual goal. “My approach has always been to listen to people,” said Amber Clark, executive director of Dolores River Boating Advocates.The journey was winding. Players dropped out, then back in, then out again. The group had side turns and outside loops. A pressing priority – not addressed by legislation – was the right amount of water released to support native fish spawning. Fish couldn’t wait for legislation to be dialed in. The timing was critical, and led to monitoring and recommendations.And they kept returning to that river love. Who wouldn’t swoon inside the canyon’s desert-patina streaked red walls, protecting mighty old-growth ponderosas? The river shape-shifts. It’s an enchanting place with desert bighorn sheep, bear and river otters, and a vitality that stays with people. The Dolores touches each community it runs through.Group members built their best legislative tool for the job. Community values, such as cultural and natural resources, native fish, boating and agricultural interests, had to be included. From the early days, Sen. Michael Bennet and his staff were committed. After much give and take, the group found language to protect the Lower Dolores River corridor and keep it under a kind of local control with an advisory committee on the management plan. The end result is the expertly crafted, homegrown Dolores River National Conservation Area and Special Management Act. Legislation protects more than 68,000 acres of public land along a coveted 75-mile stretch of the river canyon below McPhee Dam in Montezuma, Dolores and San Miguel counties. The area includes the spectacular Ponderosa Gorge.The bills ensure traditional uses – grazing, uranium mining and other mineral extraction. Motorized-vehicle use will continue. The bills prohibit new mining and oil and gas permits, but protect existing rights and leases. It also bans new large dams, new roads and commercial logging.John Whitney, a regional director with Bennet’s office, said, “I can’t think of a place where people worked harder to get a bill done.”Whitney remembered the group eating lunch alongside the river, making breakthroughs. “No way better to do that than to spend a day in the canyon,” he said.The group evolved into a community. Jeff Widen of The Wilderness Society said “it was a true partnership.” Kibel added, “We count each other as friends.”We in the Southwest are better off for group members’ diligence in protecting the sublime, delicate Lower Dolores River corridor.Fourteen years of discussions and compromise, missed dinners and homework with kids to get here."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=57116791-4848-49E4-9E30-93676A5C8889,"Denver — Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited Camp Hale this week with Colorado U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, and Colorado U.S. Representative Joe Neguse. They met with supporters of the Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act, who called for urgent administrative actions to protect Camp Hale and other places in the CORE Act, such as the Continental Divide, the Thompson Divide, and the San Juan Mountains. Vilsack noted the widespread support and committed to exploring new protections for these landscapes. Bennet has worked on the CORE Act with Coloradans for over a decade to grow Colorado’s outdoor recreation economy and protect over 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado, establishing new wilderness, recreation, and conservation areas, including the Camp Hale National Historic Landscape, and safeguarding existing outdoor recreation opportunities. Here’s what they’re saying about Bennet and Vilsack’s visit to Camp Hale: CBS Colorado: Colorado's elected leaders secure Agriculture Secretary's help to designate Camp Hale a Historic National LandscapeGov. Jared Polis, Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Congressman Joe Neguse sat in a rainy tent near Leadville Tuesday afternoon alongside Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, listening to people excited for their push to complete a mission long in the making. The idea is to get Camp Hale to be designated by the federal government as a Historic National Landscape. …The pitch to Secretary Vilsack seemed to have gone over well…[Vilsack] went on to say he would be in favor of pushing President Biden to push the designation through.Vail Daily: CORE Act supporters make appeal to Biden’s agriculture secretary to take executive actionOn Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack committed to recommending to Biden that Camp Hale, the historic World War II-era training site for the U.S. Army that’s included in the CORE Act, be recognized as a national monument following a meeting Tuesday with federal and state legislators and community representatives.Vilsack traveled to Camp Hale, located between Leadville and Red Cliff, to tour the site on an invitation from Sen. Michael Bennet, one of the CORE Act’s sponsors, and was joined by Rep. Joe Neguse, Sen. John Hickenlooper ??and Gov. Jared Polis. Following the tour, the representatives met with a diverse group of local stakeholders to hear why recognizing and protecting Camp Hale as a national monument is important to the Colorado community and the country as a whole.…“Here’s what I’m going to tell Mr. President,” Vilsack said. “I heard an extraordinary example of collaboration and partnership at the meeting that took place in Colorado. … ??I heard this is a special place. One that’s reflective of literally 8,000 years of heritage. One that reflects the values of the West, which are incredibly important, and I think represents that independent streak that we have in this country. Of those who fought for our freedom.”…Bennet, who organized the tour of Camp Hale, expressed gratitude for this movement in the right direction, and committed to continue pushing for the passage of the CORE Act in its entirety.??”There’s so much to be grateful for here, and I think we’re going to push very very hard to make sure that we get a designation that can hold up,” Bennet said. “We’re going to make sure that we don’t give up on the CORE act, as everybody around this table said, because that’s the ultimate aim, is to pass that well-supported bill to support this environment. That is so important to people here in Colorado but, frankly, important to the entire world.”Colorado Newsline: Executive action eyed as way to advance CORE Act goals in Colorado, officials say during Vilsack visitColorado leaders say they are committed to protecting Camp Hale in Eagle County and thousands of other acres of federal land in the state, whether that be through pending legislation stalled in the Senate or through executive action at the federal level.…It would be protected with a historic landscape designation through the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy — or CORE — Act, which has repeatedly passed in the U.S. House of Representatives under Neguse’s leadership but has failed to make it through a deadlocked Senate. The CORE Act would also protect land in southwest Colorado, land near the Blue Mesa Reservoir and land in the Thompson Divide area.“Our preference, obviously, is to pass the CORE Act. We’re going to continue to fight for that. The places that are appropriate for other designation, like a national monument designation or mineral withdrawal — we’ll look at that,” Bennet told reporters after the gathering.…Bennet, a sponsor of the CORE Act, organized the Tuesday meeting and invited local conservationists, ranchers, environmentalists and elected officials. Leaders all said they understand the need for land protection, specifically for Camp Hale.Denver Post: Stalled in Congress, Colorado Democrats ask Biden to take action to preserve public landsOn Tuesday, Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Rep. Joe Neguse and Gov. Jared Polis hosted Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack near historic Camp Hale to make the case for whatever action the president could take to achieve the goals of the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act.Surrounded by nearly two dozen advocates and more onlookers, Vilsack said he’d bring back a favorable report of “extraordinary collaboration and partnership” driving the initiative. But it would be premature to say exactly what those actions might be.The Colorado Democrats credited Bennet with convening the roundtable and bringing Vilsack literally to the table near Leadville. The CORE Act is essentially four separate pieces of legislation that, combined, would add various protections to more than 400,000 acres of public lands throughout the state, according to advocates.Colorado Sun: With the CORE Act stalled, its supporters want Biden to protect Colorado’s public lands right now through executive actionU.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat who is among the sponsors of the CORE Act, organized the gathering Tuesday.“I think our preference, obviously, is to pass the CORE Act,” Bennet, who is facing election-year pressure to get the CORE Act done, told reporters. “We’re going to continue to fight for that.”But in the meantime, Bennet said, national monument designations and mineral withdrawals through executive action will be sought in an effort to speed up the protections. …Asked why Biden hasn’t taken action already, U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper exclaimed “he’s been busy.” Vilsack echoed that sentiment, but also acknowledged that conversations with the president about protecting lands targeted by the CORE Act should have happened “yesterday.” “I think it really is a model of what we should be doing in this country,” Vilsack said, nodding to how the bill was formed through conversations with groups and elected leaders across Colorado. “I’m gonna go back and make sure that the president and the White House are fully briefed on this and make sure that our team is moving as expeditiously as we possibly can to do whatever we can.”"

Bennet invited Vilsack to Camp Hale and convened the meeting of CORE Act stakeholders. “I’m deeply grateful Secretary Vilsack joined us in Colorado today to meet with CORE Act supporters at Camp Hale,” said Bennet. “As we continue to push to get the CORE Act over the finish line, I join Coloradans in urging President Biden to take prompt action to protect Camp Hale, along with the other public lands in our bill.”Today, CORE Act supporters called for urgent administrative actions to protect Camp Hale and other places in the CORE Act, like the Thompson Divide, the Continental Divide, and San Juan Mountains, a priority Bennet has been fighting for since 2009. Secretary Vilsack listened intently, and committed to discussing urgent protections for these landscapes with President Biden. "

The intensely personal choice about whether or not to have an abortion should be made by a woman and her doctor – not politicians. If individual liberty means anything, it has to include the freedom of every woman, no matter where she lives, to make her own reproductive and health choices.“Today’s setback is disappointing, but not surprising. In the days ahead, we must continue the fight to codify the right to choose.”"
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=EAB23861-37A4-4C30-AAA2-E777EADEBB46,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper released the following statement regarding the Department of Defense Inspector General’s report on the decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama: “We are reviewing the findings of the report, and will have more to share in the coming days. Our position remains that the previous administration used a basing process for U.S. Space Command that was untested, lacked transparency, and neglected critical national security and cost considerations. Chief among those concerns is Peterson Space Force Base’s singular ability to reach Full Operational Capability as quickly as possible. Space Command should remain permanently based at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado.”BACKGROUND:In 2019, Bennet and former U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) led the Colorado delegation in writing to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and to Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matthew Donovan and Commander of U.S. Space Command General Jay Raymond to emphasize what Colorado offers to be the permanent home of U.S. Space Command. Bennet and Gardner also published an op-ed in the Colorado Springs Gazette advocating for the basing decision. Following the White House’s official announcement of the creation of U.S. Space Command in August 2019, the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation reiterated their call to re-establish the headquarters in Colorado. In the original basing decision process, of the six possible locations that the Air Force named, four were in Colorado: Peterson Air Force Base (AFB), Schriever AFB, Buckley AFB, and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. In the fall of 2019, the Air Force named Peterson AFB the temporary home to U.S. Space Command.In December 2019, Bennet met with Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett and spoke with the Commander of U.S. Space Command General John W. Raymond to discuss the importance of a focus on national security space and to reiterate his support for basing Space Command in Colorado.In May 2020, the Air Force announced a new basing decision process that evaluated self-nominating communities, like Aurora and Colorado Springs, on their ties to the military space mission, existing infrastructure capacity, community support, and cost to the Air Force. The Air Force also announced Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs would remain the provisional location of the command until 2026. Later in May, Bennet and Gardner wrote a letter to Colorado Governor Jared Polis calling for him to support military spouse licensure reciprocity in the state, which Polis then signed into law in July 2020. Spouse licensure reciprocity was a component of the Air Force’s evaluation of each nominating state’s support for military families. Following passage of Colorado House Bill 20-1326, the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation, Polis, and Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera wrote to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Barrett to highlight the new Colorado law and further demonstrate that Colorado is the best state to serve as the permanent home of the U.S. Space Command.In June 2020, Bennet welcomed Polis’ endorsement of the self-nomination of both the Aurora and Colorado Springs communities to compete to be the permanent home for U.S. Space Command. At the end of August 2020, the Aurora and Colorado Springs communities submitted their questionnaire responses to the Department of the Air Force completing the next step in the basing process.In August 2020, Bennet visited Peterson AFB and Schriever AFB for an update on the U.S. Space Command mission and stand up. He also met with General Dickinson, who assumed command in August, and learned about advancements at the National Space Defense Center. In November 2020, the Air Force announced Colorado Springs as a finalist for the U.S. Space Command headquarters.In December 2020, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper joined more than 600 state, federal, local, county and municipal officials, businesspeople, philanthropists, civic leaders, military officials, entrepreneurs and Coloradans from across the state in a letter urging Trump to keep the Command in the Centennial State.In January 2021, following the relocation announcement, Bennet and Hickenlooper released a statement denouncing the decision and expressing concern that the Trump White House influenced the decision for political reasons. In January 2021, Bennet and Hickenlooper also led a letter from the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation that urged President Joe Biden to suspend the Trump Administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama until the administration conducts a thorough review.In May 2021, Bennet and U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged Biden to fully consider how the move may affect Intelligence Community dependencies and missions as well as the country’s ability to maintain superiority in space.In June 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper, and U.S. Representatives Jason Crow and Doug Lamborn, and a bipartisan majority of the Colorado Congressional Delegation invited Vice President Kamala Harris to visit Colorado and its thriving space industry. In August 2021, Bennet expressed concerns over comments former President Trump made on a radio show suggesting his direct involvement in the relocation decision. In August 2021, Bennet spoke at the Space Symposium’s Space Technology Hall of Fame Dinner, highlighting Colorado’s leadership in national security space and space innovation and pushing for a thorough review of the decision to relocate U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama.In September 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow, Lamborn and a group of bipartisan members of the Colorado Congressional Delegation sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall urging him to suspend the Trump Administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama until the administration conducts a thorough review.In January 2022, Bennet and Crow hosted Chairman Adam Schiff in Colorado for a briefing with Space Command, National Space Defense Center, and National Reconnaissance Office  leadership.Bennet and Warner met with leadership from the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community IC at Schriever Space Force Base and Buckley Space Force Base. The senators’ meetings highlighted the defense and intelligence elements in Colorado key to U.S. space missions, including U.S. Space Command, and underscored the central role Colorado maintains in both space and national security innovation. In March, Bennet and Hickenlooper announced support from thirteen leading aerospace companies and accelerators to keep U.S. Space Command in Colorado due in large part to the state’s commanding aerospace industry, which supports U.S. defense and space missions.Recently, Bennet and Hickenlooper led a letter from the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation calling on President Joe Biden to ensure the U.S. Space Command basing decision takes into account national security and cost implications, and considers the findings of two pending reviews."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=764B9723-4EB6-4499-8992-D6BDAE56A9C5,"Washington, D.C. – Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet introduced the School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act to help lawmakers gain a complete and accurate picture of gun violence in and around school campuses. This legislation will also provide actionable data to build effective strategies to prevent these tragedies. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. “Colorado is no stranger to the tragedy of mass shootings at our schools,” said Bennet. “Our kids are living in the shadow of gun violence every day, and they are counting on us to take action. This bill would provide the data necessary to help us understand the full scale of this crisis and inform the action we desperately need to end gun violence in and around our schools. I’ll also continue to work with my colleagues to pass legislation to require universal background checks, limit the size of magazines, and address our country’s mental health crisis.”This legislation would create a definition for “school shooting,” which does not exist in federal law. Currently, policy makers rely on media reports of “school shootings,” which can vary. With a standard definition, lawmakers would have a consistent way to measure incidents, trends, and the impact of policies and strategies implemented in response to school shootings.In addition, this bill would direct the Department of Education to consult with the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to produce comprehensive annual reports on school safety indicators, such as shooting and fatality statistics, shooter and victim demographics, shooter motivations, and the types of firearms and ammunition acquired and used. It would also track prevention efforts, such as building designs, and communication and response plans. The bill text is available HERE. A one-page summary of the bill is available HERE."

In their letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, the senators also ask for $1 billion to continue to increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Operations to help ensure farmers, ranchers, and foresters can be part of the climate solution.“Recognizing the importance of land-based solutions in combating climate change, it is necessary to continue federal investments in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs,” wrote Bennet, Stabenow, Coons, and their colleagues in their letter to Subcommittee Chairwoman Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Ranking Member John Hoeven (R-N.D.). “We need strong investments in USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) staff and resources to support farmers, ranchers and foresters to help mitigate and adapt to climate change.”In the recent FY22 omnibus spending bill, the Senate passed $904 million for NRCS Conservation Operations. The NRCS staff help implement several Farm Bill conservation programs that are critical to helping farmers, foresters, and ranchers conserve land and water, protect water quality, and improve soil health. As climate change continues to affect communities across the country, strong investments in these programs are necessary to help Colorado’s agriculture community combat its effects. The senators continued: “As producers face growing productivity and environmental challenges such as droughts, wildfires, and floods, these programs help build resiliency and support the economic viability of family farms. These programs also help producers implement climate-smart conservation practices and enhance productivity. Maintaining full mandatory funding, as authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, will keep working farms and ranches productive and benefit the environment.”In addition to Bennet, Stabenow, and Coons, this letter is signed by U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).The text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Chair Baldwin and Ranking Member Hoeven:Thank you for your work to fully fund Farm Bill conservation programs and increase Conservation Operations in the fiscal year (FY) 2022 omnibus appropriations bill. As your subcommittee considers its FY 2023 appropriations bill, we write to request that you support full mandatory funding for Farm Bill conservation programs and continue to increase Conservation Operations by providing it $1 billion. Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Sixth Assessment Report, which provides an updated global assessment of climate change mitigation progress and pledges, and examines the sources of global emissions. The IPCC report makes clear that land-based mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors represent some of the most important options currently available for large-scale emissions reductions and also removal and storage of carbon dioxide at scale.  Recognizing the importance of land-based solutions in combating climate change, it is necessary to continue federal investments in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs. We need strong investments in USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) staff and resources to support farmers, ranchers and foresters to help mitigate and adapt to climate change. NRCS staff help implement a number of Farm Bill conservation programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), and Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). These programs are critical to helping farmers, foresters, and ranchers conserve land and water, protect water quality, and improve soil health. As producers face growing productivity and environmental challenges such as droughts, wildfires, and floods, these programs help build resiliency and support the economic viability of family farms. These programs also help producers implement climate-smart conservation practices and enhance productivity. Maintaining full mandatory funding, as authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, will keep working farms and ranches productive and benefit the environment. NRCS field staff are invaluable resources for farmers and ranchers across the country, providing direct technical assistance and planning support for those interested in enrolling in the aforementioned programs. USDA’s ability to deliver conservation programs depends heavily on this on-the-ground technical assistance, or conservation technical assistance (CTA). CTA provides landowners with unique, location-specific solutions so farmers and ranchers can implement conservation practices on their lands, while providing accountability to ensure maximum return on the public investment. It is critical that NRCS offices are well-staffed to best serve our country’s producers and foresters so that we may better mitigate and adapt to climate change. Less than adequate funding for technical assistance and staffing would severely limit farmers and ranchers’ abilities to build soil health, protect water quality, create and maintain habitat for threatened, endangered, or economically important fish and wildlife, and prepare for and manage drought and flooding.Again, we urge you to fully fund Farm Bill conservation programs and increase funding for Conservation Operations to $1 billion so our farmers, ranchers, and foresters can be part of the climate solution. Sincerely, "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=E028892D-1A25-418B-974C-0BEE0EC8D64E,"Denver – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper requested continued funding for the Arkansas Valley Conduit (AVC) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget. In their letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Bennet and Hickenlooper ask for funding in line with the over $10 million proposed in President Joe Biden’s budget. “The Arkansas Valley Conduit is a planned 130-mile water-delivery system from the Pueblo Dam to communities throughout the Arkansas River Valley in Southeast Colorado,” wrote Bennet and Hickenlooper in their letter to Subcommittee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Ranking Member John Kennedy (R-La.). “The Conduit is the final phase of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, which Congress authorized in 1962.”They continued: “Stakeholders have worked to finish the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project since Congress first authorized it. Annual funding, like the $10.059 million included in our request for FY23, is an opportunity to shorten the construction timeline for the Conduit and allows federal drinking water standards to be met more quickly providing Coloradans with a secure and safe supply of water.”This letter comes after Bennet and Hickenlooper helped secure $10.05 million in continued funding for the AVC in the recent FY22 omnibus funding bill. Once this project is complete, it will help bring clean drinking water to over 50,000 Coloradans in over 40 rural communities. Bennet and Hickenlooper will continue working in Washington to ensure communities have the resources needed to complete this vital project for the region.Since arriving in the Senate, Bennet has continuously advocated to ensure the Arkansas Valley has access to clean water. In 2009, Congress passed legislation by Bennet and former U.S. Senator Mark Udall (D-Colo.) to authorize the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit. Bennet worked to secure $5 million in funding to begin construction on the Conduit as part of the Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report. In 2013, Bennet and his colleagues sent a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to quickly approve the Conduit’s Environmental Impact Study (EIS) in order to expedite the project’s completion. In 2014, following Bennet and Udall’s efforts to urge the BOR to quickly approve the Conduit’s EIS, the Record of Decision was signed in February. After the President’s budget included an insufficient level of funding for the project, Bennet led a bipartisan letter urging the administration and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to allow the Conduit’s construction to move ahead as planned. Bennet successfully urged the Department of Interior to designate $2 million in reprogrammed funding from FY14 for the Conduit. Bennet secured language in the FY15 Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act that sent a clear signal to the BOR that the Conduit should be a priority project. In 2016, Bennet secured $2 million from the BOR’s reprogrammed funding for FY16. Bennet secured $3 million for the Conduit as part of the FY17 Energy & Water Appropriations bill. In April 2019, Bennet and former U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) wrote to then-Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Ranking Member Feinstein, urging them to prioritize funding for the Conduit. Bennet, Gardner, former U.S. Congressman Scott Tipton (R-Colo.), and Congressman Ken Buck (R-Colo.) wrote to the Department of the Interior urging the Department to support the project. In December 2019, Bennet secured approximately $10 million for the Conduit in the FY20 spending bills. In 2020, Bennet welcomed $28 million from the BOR to begin construction on the AVC to help bring clean drinking water to Colorado communities.The text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Chairwoman Feinstein and Ranking Member Kennedy: We write to request funding for the Bureau of Reclamation in fiscal year 2023 (FY23) to continue the on-schedule planning and construction of Colorado’s Arkansas Valley Conduit project (the Conduit). Accordingly, we request continued investment in this project, in line with the $10.059 million provided in the President’s FY23 Budget. The Arkansas Valley Conduit is a planned 130-mile water-delivery system from the Pueblo Dam to communities throughout the Arkansas River Valley in Southeast Colorado. The Conduit is the final phase of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, which Congress authorized in 1962. Upon completion, it will help bring clean drinking water to more than 50,000 people in over 40 communities in this rural, underserved region of our state.Stakeholders have worked to finish the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project since Congress first authorized it. Annual funding, like the $10.059 million included in our request for FY23, is an opportunity to shorten the construction timeline for the Conduit and allows federal drinking water standards to be met more quickly providing Coloradans with a secure and safe supply of water.We join the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District, the State of Colorado, and the numerous local water providers in support of the Administration’s FY23 Budget Request for the Arkansas Valley Conduit. These funds would allow stakeholders to partner with the Bureau of Reclamation to perform and maintain on-time delivery of pre-construction activity including updating environmental documents, design activity, contract negotiation, land acquisition, and right of way work. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely,"

CSP was designed to provide critical resources to expand access to high-quality charter schools, but these proposed regulations could restrict access to new high-quality public charter schools. As such, we are concerned that the NPP does not prioritize the needs of students and limits high quality choices to certain families.”The majority of federal funding for charter schools comes from the 28-year-old, bipartisan federal Charter Schools Program (CSP). Despite a 7% increase in charter school enrollment throughout the 2020-2021 academic year, the Department of Education recently proposed a rule that would impose burdensome new requirements on charter schools, making it difficult — if not impossible — for many schools to receive funding.In addition to Bennet, Scott, and Feinstein, this letter was signed by U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.).The full text of the letter is available HERE."

This is the first Senate vote on the bill in its decade-long history.“The CORE Act was written for Coloradans, by Coloradans who’ve worked really hard to make sure it reflects local interests and local values,” said Bennet. “After over a decade of work, we're now one step closer to passing this legislation to protect more than 400,000 acres of public land and support our state's economy. Coloradans have waited a long time for this moment, and I look forward to getting the CORE Act over the finish line.”“This vote is a new high water mark and I hope the final hurdle before it passes the Senate and becomes law,” said Hickenlooper at the committee markup. “Communities in these areas came together to write this bill from the ground up – literally! This is a model for collaboration.”The party-line vote allows the Senate to proceed with consideration of the bill for a final vote, which would then send it to President Joe Biden to become law.“As a rancher who relies on the Thompson Divide for our summer grazing, I am hoping for the passage of the CORE Act. It will bring needed protection to this area which is so important to myself and fellow ranchers and also for the entire community, who utilizes these amazing lands for hunting and year-round recreation,” said Bill Fales, Cold Mountain Ranch, Thompson Divide. “The pandemic makes protection even more vital as our USFS lands are seeing unprecedented levels of use by the public. Senator Bennet and Congressmen Neguse have been fantastic in advancing this bill. Hopefully, with Senator Hickenlooper’s support we can finally give this area the protection it so richly deserves.”“Gunnison County has worked for years on the Curecanti and Thompson Divide elements of the CORE Act. We have fought long and hard for the CORE Act because our constituents believe in these sensible public lands protections that are vital to our economy, our values and the enduring opportunity these lands will provide for future generations,” said Jonathan Houck, Gunnison County Commissioner. “For many years, we have worked with diverse stakeholders to develop sensible landscape scale protective measures that match our communities’ values and our desire to see these productive and pristine landscapes thoughtfully protected. We are thankful to Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper for their leadership and persistence on the CORE Act.”“The Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act is common sense legislation and we're proud to support it,” said Janessa Goldbeck, USMC veteran and CEO of Vet Voice Foundation. “We're specifically excited to work to see Camp Hale -- a vital training area for the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division during World War II -- designated as the first National Historic Landscape. Veterans have long-played a role in protecting our nation's public lands. It's even more exciting to work on projects that will preserve places so closely tied to our military history. We're ready to do our part to see the CORE Act become law.”More statements of support are available HERE.In January 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper and Colorado U.S. Congressman Joe Neguse reintroduced the CORE Act. The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives four times.The CORE Act combines four previously introduced Colorado public land bills, which have been in development over the past decade: the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness, and Camp Hale Legacy Act, the San Juan Mountains Wilderness Act, the Thompson Divide Withdrawal and Protection Act, and the Curecanti National Recreation Area Boundary Establishment Act.Of the land protected by the bill, 73,000 acres are designated as new wilderness, and nearly 80,000 acres are designated as new recreation and conservation management areas that preserve existing outdoor uses, such as hiking and mountain biking. The bill also includes a first-of-its-kind designation for Camp Hale as a National Historic Landscape, to honor World War II veterans and Colorado’s military legacy, and prohibits new oil and gas development in areas important to ranchers and sportsmen in the Thompson Divide.The CORE Act is supported by: Governor Jared Polis, the counties of San Miguel, Gunnison, Eagle, San Juan, Summit, Pitkin, and Ouray as well as the cities of Ouray, Crested Butte, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Telluride, Basalt, Breckenridge, Ophir, Ridgway, Mountain Village, Vail, Snowmass, Town of Frisco, and the Town of Dillon.In addition the following organizations also support the bill: Conservation Colorado, NPCA, Conservation Alliance, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Mountain Biking Association, TRCP, National Wildlife Foundation, Trout Unlimited, Outdoor Industry Association, Wilderness Workshop, Trust for Public Land, American Whitewater, Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, The Wilderness Society, Roaring Fork Audubon, Roaring Fork Sierra Club, Solar Energy International, Carbondale Historical Society, Crystal Valley Environmental Protection Association, and Great Old Broads for Wilderness."

This bill is a true reflection of how people across Colorado and the West come together to develop sustainable solutions to the biggest challenges facing our communities. I will continue to work with Coloradans to make sure our local economies can thrive today and into the future.”Bennet began work on the National Energy Community Transition Act after meeting with Northwest Colorado leadership in February 2020 to discuss the challenges they are facing as a result of the announced closures of the coal-fired power plants in Craig and Hayden, which they expect to result in a significant loss of revenue as part of their tax base. He continued to gather input from community leaders while developing the bill, including at a 2021 roundtable discussion in Craig. They underscored the importance of getting ahead of this “fiscal cliff” and the need to provide the resources to plug projected local government budget gaps for core services such as hospitals and schools, and to diversify their economies. Right now, limited resources are available to communities that are expecting a loss of tax revenue due to anticipated closures in the near future. The National Energy Community Transition Act seeks to rectify this oversight by providing immediate support to these communities to smooth the transition before closures occur.The National Energy Community Transition Act would: ""Tri-County leaders have had an ongoing conversation with Senator Bennet about how we can achieve an economic future that honors traditional industry and land uses that have built the communities and landscapes we all enjoy today, while embracing an economic future that supports our core services and offers new opportunities into the future. We believe the endowment concept has the opportunity to do just that. We continue to advocate for legislative proposals that benefit our region. As impacted local governments, we appreciate Senator Bennet modifying draft legislation after considering local government input,” said Commissioner Melody Villard, Moffat County.“Senator Bennet’s efforts to work hand-in-hand with local leaders—on both sides of the aisle—to create a new permanent endowment fund will help northwest Colorado through the transition away from coal plant-based economies. We believe his proposal is grounded in rural Colorado and would provide the necessary and sustained support to refocus, retool, and revitalize Craig and our region. I can’t thank the Senator enough for his efforts to help keep Colorado’s great northwest thriving,” said Mayor Ryan Hess, City of Craig.“Senator Bennet’s National Energy Community Transition Act puts a focus on communities like those in NW Colorado and is a clear indication he is thinking broadly about our region and is showing particular attention to our challenges. I believe we must think regionally about sustainable and long-term community development and the endowment concept will allow for long term planning and success.  Thank you, Senator Bennet, for your leadership and support,” said Commissioner Tim Redmond, Routt County.“Thanks to Senator Bennet for his leadership in our region and across Colorado.   In Hayden, we have been leading along with our partners in this transition as we tackle the issues of climate change, coal transition, and moving forward in an equitable way to ensure everyone benefits. Hayden is on the move, we have a beautiful new school, community center and a growing community; our future is starting to look bright. However, our challenges remain the same – we need an equitable transition. Our new school was built leveraging both state grant funding along with a voter-approved $22.3 million bond that is 55% dependent on the Hayden Station, a coal-fired power plant. Our fire district, library district, hospital district, and cemetery district rely on this asset for property taxes that range anywhere from 55-65% of their total budget. We are deeply concerned about this transition, but we recognize this is a unique opportunity to move forward for our community and lead by example in Northwest Colorado. This bill provides that unique opportunity to secure sustainable funding and transition our hard working community into the future,” said Mayor Zach Wuestewald, Town of Hayden.“This bill addresses one of many critical needs that energy communities are facing today—how they will continue to provide essential services during a time of transition. We applaud Senator Bennet’s work to listen to coal communities’ members and leaders, and advance solutions that are truly needed. The BlueGreen Alliance supports this legislation as part of a multi-faceted effort to support communities, workers, and families as they weather the impacts of a rapidly changing energy economy,"" said Jason Walsh, BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director.In the Senate, Bennet continues working to prioritize the needs of rural and transitioning communities in Colorado. In October 2021, Bennet and his colleagues introduced the American Energy Worker Opportunity Act to provide critical resources and training opportunities to assist and empower workers whose jobs are affected by the energy industry’s move toward cleaner sources. In January 2021, Bennet sent a letter to the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Susan Rice and the Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, outlining ways the federal government can better partner with rural communities and in particular, those transitioning away from fossil fuel-based economies. In 2020, Bennet introduced the RESILIENT Act to empower rural communities to upgrade their infrastructure by expanding technical assistance, strengthening local capacity, and simplifying access to various federal funding streams. In 2017, Bennet introduced the Coal Community Empowerment Act to spur investment, workforce training, economic growth, and job creation in rural communities in Colorado and across the United States. The bill text is available HERE.

Attorney General Merrick Garland expressed support for this effort earlier in the week.“We must hold Russian oligarchs accountable for enabling Putin's egregious, lawless war,” said Bennet. “My bipartisan bill with Senator Portman would direct funds from seized Russian assets to support Ukrainian refugees, reconstruction, and recovery. I look forward to working with President Biden, Attorney General Garland, and my Senate colleagues to get this done for the Ukrainian people, who have inspired the world with their resilience and resolute defense of democracy.”The RELIEF for Ukraine Act requires the Department of Justice to allocate funds from the disposal of seized Russian into a new Ukraine Relief Fund, which will be administered by the Department of State in consultation with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Fund would be used to support the safety, health, and wellbeing of Ukrainian refugees, along with the general reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine in areas not controlled by the Russian Federation.The bill text is available HERE.

This is an important step to grow our skilled workforce and lower costs for students who want to advance their education.”“America needs a 21st century education system that embraces options beyond the traditional four-year college degree track,” said Rubio. “Our current accreditation system stifles innovation and leaves too many people with piles of student loan debt. This bill would help make higher education more affordable for students who choose high quality, nontraditional higher education pathways such as trade schools and community colleges.” ""When it comes to higher education, we must think more boldly and more expansively. Non-traditional programs and pathways that demonstrably connect learners facing barriers to employment with an in-demand credential and a good-paying job need access to major public funding streams to allow them to scale. Colorado's ActivateWork applauds Senator Bennet and Senator Rubio for a bipartisan bill that will bring overdue outcomes-driven reform to our postsecondary system,” said Helen Young Hayes, Founder and CEO of Colorado's ActivateWork.""The Higher Education Innovation Act prioritizes postsecondary federal resources based on what should matter most: whether a given institution, program or pathway measurably improves the lives of its learners. I thank Senators Bennet and Rubio for their leadership, and I hope Congress will pass this important bipartisan legislation,” said Roger Low, CEO & Founder, Colorado Equitable Economic Mobility Initiative.""As a coalition of business leaders invested in education, Colorado Succeeds supports policies that expand and diversify learner access to high-quality industry credentials and promote equity and inclusion. That's why we support the Higher Education Innovation Act of 2022. By establishing an outcomes-based process for quality postsecondary institutions to receive authorization to participate in federal financial aid programs, students will have more opportunities to succeed in school and in their future careers. We're very thankful to Sen. Bennet for sponsoring this legislation alongside Sen. Marco Rubio and urge Congress to support this bipartisan effort,” said Scott Laband, President, Colorado Succeeds.Currently, students who attend high-quality unaccredited postsecondary institutions are unable to receive federal student aid to help finance their education. As a result, many bright students can’t access the financial assistance they need to enroll in trade schools, community colleges, and other postsecondary institutions with a proven record of positive outcomes.

Modernizing the system will help improve water quality, protect our public lands, safeguard our watersheds, and support our communities.”Regulation of hardrock mineral extraction in the United States has remained virtually unchanged for 150 years, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed the General Mining Act of 1872 into law. This antiquated system has allowed mining companies to extract more than $300 billion worth of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals from U.S. public lands without paying a cent in federal royalties to the American people. These same companies have left the public with billions of dollars in cleanup costs for abandoned hardrock mines, which have polluted 40% of the headwaters of western watersheds. Many Indigenous communities’ sacred sites and lands are continuously at-risk of being permanently destroyed by mining. With a growing demand for the critical minerals necessary for a clean energy economy, the need to reform the existing mining law is particularly salient. Modernizing our leasing system would address major environmental justice concerns, protect our public lands, and ensure a fair return for American taxpayers.The Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act would amend the 1872 General Mining Law to eliminate patenting of federal lands, impose a federal minerals royalty, establish a Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund for the cleanup of abandoned mines, and require a review of certain lands within three years to determine if they should be available for future mining. Specifically, the bill would:In addition to Bennet and Heinrich, this legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). U.S. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. The legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Representatives Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.), Don Beyer (D-Va.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), and Rashida Talib (D-Mich.). Seventy environmental, conservation, and Tribal rights’ organizations sent a letter supporting the mining reform legislation. The letter is available HERE. Trout Unlimited, National Wildlife Federation, and Backcountry Hunters and Anglers also support the bill.""For far too long, antiquated and racist hardrock mining law has governed mining operations in the United States. In the past 150 years, frontline communities endured discrimination, injustice, and prejudice to receive basic needs like clean drinking water, all for mining operations to produce high yields,"" said Mark Magana Founding CEO of GreenLatinos. ""It's time we address this issue and use our public lands in a way that acknowledges the histories and traditions of those historically and deliberately overlooked communities. By giving land managers the ability to balance mining with other uses of public lands, The Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act of 2022 is a bill that would defend local communities and wild places from irresponsible mining.""“The 150-year-old law that governs American mining is severely outdated, offering no protections for communities or public lands that are facing the threat of industrial mining. As we navigate towards a clean energy future, updating our mining laws is a necessary first step to protect people, wildlife and our shared lands and waters against toxic mining pollution. The Wilderness Society is proud to stand behind efforts to update this antiquated law. We thank Senator Bennet for being an original cosponsor of this legislation and one of Congress’ champions on mining reform,” said Jim Ramey, Colorado State Director, The Wilderness Society. “Mining law reform needs to be fair and meaningful. This legislation is an important step in balancing mineral production and the conservation of our waters, sensitive public lands, and fish and wildlife habitat,” said Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited. “Coupled with Good Samaritan legislation that would make it easier for third parties to clean up polluting abandoned hardrock mines, we will leave the next generation cleaner and healthier lands and waters. We thank Senator Bennet for his leadership on these pressing issues.""  “For decades, mining companies have capitalized on our public lands without paying royalties and left behind toxic pollution, thanks in large part to outdated mining laws from 150 years ago,” said Athan Manuel, Director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program. “As we make the transition to clean energy, we cannot continue these extractive, unsustainable processes that put profits over people. It's time to pass the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act to bring our mining laws out of the 19th century, put an end to subsidizing mining operations, and protect our communities and treasured places.”“Hunters and anglers have long-advocated for legislation to modernize the General Mining Act of 1872,” said John Gale, Conservation Director of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “The world has changed a lot in the last 150 years and hardrock mining's image of the one-man operation with a mule and a pick ax is a far cry from the multinational corporations systematically extracting minerals from our lands and waters today. We also acknowledge that establishing parity with other extractive industries that pay royalties and have greater regulatory safeguards in place for protecting natural resources is central to the conversation and important as taxpayers look to congressional leaders for establishing new revenue streams to support better management of our public lands and waters. It well past time for us to do more for our water resources and improve habitat for fish and wildlife while generating new jobs and establishing higher standards for the stewardship of our natural resources.”“This is important legislation that would protect public lands and end government handouts to mining companies,” said Hans Cole, head of Environmental Activism at Patagonia. “Pollution from mining endangers air, water and wildlife habitats, and this bill would prioritize the health of people and the planet.”The bill text is available HERE.

Boulder County and other municipalities avoid using WEA due to concerns about reliability and delivery of alerts during emergency scenarios, but private systems used instead often have problems of their own.Tomorrow, the FCC will consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Improving Public Reporting on Wireless Emergency Alert Reliability. If adopted, the FCC would seek comments to help ensure wireless emergency alerts (WEAs) are promptly delivered to cellular devices during emergencies and natural disasters like the Marshall Fire. “While over 1,600 entities nationwide are authorized to send WEAs, less than half have ever done so. According to reports, concerns about the geographic accuracy, delivery, or reliability of WEAs have hampered confidence in the WEA system and impacted its adoption,” wrote Bennet and Hickenlooper in a letter to the FCC.“The Marshall Fire is the most destructive wildfire in Colorado’s history and underscores the need for a whole-of-government effort to increase our resilience against natural disasters and improve our emergency response capabilities, including WEAs.”The full text of the letter is available HERE and below.Dear Chairwoman Rosenworcel,We write to you to highlight the importance of the Federal Communications Commission’s (Commission) consideration of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Improving Public Reporting on Wireless Emergency Alert Reliability. If adopted, the Commission will take a necessary step toward ensuring wireless emergency alerts (WEAs) are promptly delivered to cellular devices during emergencies and natural disasters. Authorized federal, state, and local governments and emergency management agencies have the ability to send verified and geographically targeted alerts to WEA-capable mobile devices to warn of imminent emergencies, threats, or natural disasters such as wildfires. While over 1,600 entities nationwide are authorized to send WEAs, less than half have ever done so. According to reports, concerns about the geographic accuracy, delivery, or reliability of WEAs have hampered confidence in the WEA system and impacted its adoption by emergency management authorities. Now more than ever, it is critical the Commission consider taking meaningful steps within its authorities to establish performance requirements  and improve the reliability of WEA delivery. Americans must have confidence they’ll receive timely, life-saving emergency alerts to protect themselves and their loved ones during times of crisis.Early warnings to evacuate and seek shelter ahead of fast-spreading wildfires are necessary to save lives and property. During last December’s Marshall Fire, more than 1,000 homes and businesses were destroyed. Coloradans are still removing debris, seeking to recoup lost property, and recovering from the disaster. The WEA system was not used during the Marshall Fire due to existing concerns about its reliability and delivery, and many Boulder residents did not receive any timely emergency alert to evacuate from the blaze through the private alerting system that was used instead by local authorities. We must ensure there is confidence in tools such as WEA to perform flawlessly and assist our first responders in carrying out their life-saving responsibilities. The Marshall Fire is the most destructive wildfire in Colorado’s history and underscores the need for a whole-of-government effort to increase our resilience against natural disasters and improve our emergency response capabilities, including WEAs. We thank you for your consideration of this matter and we look forward to supporting the Commission in its effort to improve the performance, reliability, and accuracy of wireless emergency alerts during times of crisis, consistent with all applicable rules and regulations. Sincerely,"

The announcement means Marshall Fire survivors will be able to borrow an amount that better reflects today’s building costs.The announcement follows a letter Bennet, Hickenlooper, and Neguse sent to SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman in March urging the SBA to update the formula used in loan calculations because they no longer reflected actual building costs in Colorado. They also called on SBA to increase the overall maximum of a loan to better reflect housing prices in 2022. The maximum was last updated in 1994.Marshall Fire survivors can learn more about the SBA Disaster Loan Program, including how to apply, HERE.“I'm pleased to see SBA expand access to disaster loans for survivors of the Marshall Fire,” said Bennet. “This disaster tore through our communities, leaving millions of dollars in damage and destruction. As Coloradans continue to rebuild, we will keep working with the administration to ensure survivors can access the federal support needed to help cover the cost of reconstruction.”“SBA Disaster Loans are a lifeline for survivors,” said Hickenlooper. “Updating how SBA calculates building costs is a great first step, but we also need to update borrowing limits to reflect today’s all-time high home prices.” “Today’s announcement is an important step for the thousands of families impacted by the Marshall Fire,” said Neguse. “The initial estimates of the damage caused did not accurately reflect the actual costs of rebuilding nor did they take into account the length of time such efforts will take. We will keep pushing for proper support of all Coloradans impacted by this unprecedented disaster until all of our communities can fully recover.”Specifically, the announcement will double the geographic multiplier used for the Disaster Loan Assistance Home and Personal Property Loans Program to compensate for higher building costs in Colorado.Low-interest SBA disaster loans support those looking to replace or repair their primary residence and personal effects. The maximum amount a homeowner can borrow to rebuild is $200,000 and has not changed since 1994, despite inflation and rising home values. The maximum loan amount to replace household and personal effects is $40,000 and has not been raised since 1994."

The projects I saw — from increasing  child care options in Hayden to improving access to clean water in Minturn to rebuilding the courthouse in Craig – will help spur economic growth in these communities.”In Minturn, the town will use $1 million in federal funding  to help construct a new water tank for the community, which will help lower water costs, increase water quality, and secure the area’s water supply. In addition, it will help combat wildfires and support the development of affordable housing. In Hayden, the town will use over $2.8 million to expand a child care facility and create cultural arts and technology spaces at the old high school, now called The Hayden Center. Bennet ended his day in Craig to see how Moffat County will use over $4.6 million to renovate an old K-Mart building into a new courthouse and county building after years of safety and security concerns about the aging Moffat County courthouse.“We are in the process of upgrading our entire water system in Minturn. The federal grant funding that Senator Bennet secured allows us to begin the first phase of this process, which is the construction of a new 600,000 gallon water tank. Having this new water system will help keep the cost of water down for current residents and allow us to direct funds to other projects, such as building more affordable housing like the Eagle County School District workforce housing project at Maloit Park for teachers and staff,” said Mayor Earle Bidez.  “As the Mayor of Hayden, I would like to personally thank Senator Bennet for his dedication to Northwest Colorado, specifically for fighting to get Hayden this CDS request, which will complete the Hayden Center three years ahead of schedule. This CDS allocation allows us to leverage multiple other grants for the project, expand childcare, start a new arts and culture scene, have indoor recreational opportunities, and open up tourism to Hayden. Without this funding we would still be piecing this project together. The Town of Hayden thanks Senator Bennet for representing all of Colorado and fighting for this investment in Hayden, which will improve the quality of life in Hayden,” said Mayor Zach Wuestewald.  “We are sincerely thankful for Senator Bennet’s tremendous effort to secure $4.65 million dollars in federal grant funding to help Moffat County renovate an old Kmart building in Craig into a new courthouse and county building. The new facility combines the departments from 6 buildings into one, providing services to the public that are functional, efficient, safe, and secure. The future economic growth of Moffat County depends on being able to provide adequate public services,” said Melody Villard, Moffat County Commissioner.READ MORE HERE: Vail Daily: Bennet gets first-hand look at Minturn’s water issuesBennet, along with Sen.

Michael Bennet paid a visit to the Hayden Center to see the space, which $2.9 million in congressionally directed spending will help finish in the next year and a half, while Sen. John Hickenlooper toured the Yampa Valley Housing Authority’s Brown Ranch property, on which there are hopes to build 2,300 housing units by 2040.…Bennet said seeing the federal funding at work was rewarding, but he emphasized that it started with a local project and local government.“There are a lot of times when people think about government and — often for good reason — are really frustrated with what a bad job it does with certain things,” Bennet said. “This is a good illustration of all different levels of government and a community coming together to build something that is going to last for generations.”Projects in rural areas like Hayden and Craig — which also received spending from congress this year — help show people that government is there to work for them, Bennet said.Steamboat Radio: KRAI NEWS FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 21U.S. Senator Michael Bennet was in Northwest Colorado Wednesday. He first got a tour of the Hayden Center to see how the town is using over $2.8 million dollars to expand a child care facility and create cultural arts and technology spaces at the old high school.Town leaders were on the tour, along with Routt County Commissioner Tim Redmond and Hayden Town Manager Matthew Mendisco. Commissioner Redmond says transforming The Hayden Center has been a unifying experience in the community as the community is stronger when working together. …After their visit to Hayden, the Bennet team headed to Craig to tour the new Moffat County Courthouse and county offices, which are going in the old Kmart building.

This comes after SkyWest Airlines announced its intention to stop operating 29 EAS routes, including to the San Luis Valley Regional Airport and Pueblo Memorial Airport, last month.“The San Luis Valley Regional Airport in Alamosa, Colorado serves a region in South-Central Colorado larger than the state of Rhode Island,” wrote Bennet in the letter. “Surrounded by three mountain passes, the closest major airport is at least two hours away in Colorado Springs. SkyWest Airlines’ cancellation of these contracts surprised the airport and the broader community as enplanement numbers are increasing and service negotiations were recently finalized in October of 2020.”Bennet continued: “The Pueblo Memorial Airport serves the South and Southeastern regions of Colorado and benefits greatly from EAS. Reliable and accessible air service, to and from Pueblo Memorial Airport, is necessary for Pueblo and the surrounding communities.”DOT’s EAS program subsidizes airline service for small, rural airports to ensure the surrounding communities have access to commercial flights. Following SkyWest’s announcement, DOT issued a holding order to require the airline to keep operating for two months while the agency identifies replacement carriers for routes. Given the uncertainty of SkyWest Airlines’ service status to the San Luis Valley Regional Airport and Pueblo Memorial Airport, Bennet is urging DOT to expedite review of their EAS applications for routes to these airports to avoid service gaps and other potential issues. In 2016, Bennet fought to secure a waiver to exempt the San Luis Valley Regional Airport from EAS requirements, allowing the airport to continue regional air service.“SLV Regional Airport creates economic opportunities in every corner of the San Luis Valley.  Unfortunately, SkyWest has announced plans to discontinue service to Alamosa and 28 other communities. Considering this recent announcement and with concerns about a disruption in service, Alamosa County Commissioners strongly recommend Denver Air Connections to US DOT because they are offering to meet or exceed the SkyWest model of providing airplanes that seat a minimum of 30, offering 12 non-stop round-trip flights per week and offering interline agreements so passengers don’t experience baggage limitations and  issues,” said Michael Yohn, Chair, Alamosa County Commissioners.“The Pueblo Memorial Airport is a convenient and necessary service to our citizens here in Pueblo and provides accessibility to our Southern Colorado region. It is critical that services here in Pueblo are prioritized so we can offer flights that meet the needs of our community. Many people use Pueblo as their connection to Denver and beyond which allows for less out of pocket expenses for gas and parking associated with air travel, which is why EAS airports need reliable airline partnerships,” said Nick Gradisar, Mayor, City of Pueblo.The text of the letter is available HERE and below. Dear Secretary Buttigieg,I write to request that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) expedite the contract review of air service carriers that have applied or may apply to replace SkyWest Airlines following their announcement to discontinue Essential Air Service (EAS) to the San Luis Valley Regional Airport and Pueblo Memorial Airport. As EAS airports, these facilities rely on DOT to ensure that service to this region of Colorado continues uninterrupted. The San Luis Valley Regional Airport in Alamosa, Colorado serves a region in South-Central Colorado larger than the state of Rhode Island. Surrounded by three mountain passes, the closest major airport is at least two hours away in Colorado Springs. SkyWest Airlines’ cancellation of these contracts surprised the airport and the broader community as enplanement numbers are increasing and service negotiations were recently finalized in October of 2020.  The Pueblo Memorial Airport serves the South and Southeastern regions of Colorado and benefits greatly from EAS. Reliable and accessible air service, to and from Pueblo Memorial Airport, is necessary for Pueblo and the surrounding communities. As you know, DOT’s EAS program subsidizes airline service for small, rural airports to ensure the surrounding communities have access to commercial flights. The EAS program also reimburses airlines for empty seats on flights to major hub airports. I understand an applicant submitted a bid for service to the San Luis Valley Regional Airport prior to SkyWest Airlines’ announcement in March. Furthermore, the Alamosa Board of County Commissioners had vetted the carrier and recommended them (see letter attached). I respectfully request that you give this applicant expedited review subject to applicable laws and regulations, to ensure service continues uninterrupted in this region of Colorado. I also encourage DOT to consider the recommendations from Pueblo’s airport community in the EAS selection process to determine best fit for this region.Thank you for your attention to this important issue. Sincerely,"
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=0CACDACA-CA4B-4782-9B83-FB6E59420C07,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D) and John Hickenlooper (D) and Colorado U.S. Representatives Doug Lamborn (R) and Jason Crow (D) released the following statement after being briefed on the draft Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama: “We have said before that the U.S. Space Command basing decision was the result of a flawed and untested process that lacked transparency and neglected key national security and cost considerations. After reviewing the draft GAO report, we are even more concerned about the questionable decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama.“Putin’s war on Ukraine and China’s space expansion underscore the need for U.S. Space Command to reach full operational capability as soon as possible. We cannot afford any operational disruptions or delays to the mission currently being conducted at Peterson Space Force Base, which is why U.S. Space Command must remain in Colorado.“We will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to urge the Biden Administration to keep U.S. Space Command at Peterson. Colorado Springs is the best and only home for U.S. Space Command. We look forward to the report’s public release in the near future.”BACKGROUND:In 2019, Bennet and former U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) led the Colorado delegation in writing to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and to Acting Secretary of the Air Force Matthew Donovan and Commander of U.S. Space Command General Jay Raymond to emphasize what Colorado offers to be the permanent home of U.S. Space Command. Bennet and Gardner also published an op-ed in the Colorado Springs Gazette advocating for the basing decision. Following the White House’s official announcement of the creation of U.S. Space Command in August 2019, the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation reiterated their call to re-establish the headquarters in Colorado. In the original basing decision process, of the six possible locations that the Air Force named, four were in Colorado: Peterson Air Force Base (AFB), Schriever AFB, Buckley AFB, and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. In the fall of 2019, the Air Force named Peterson AFB the temporary home to U.S. Space Command.In December 2019, Bennet met with Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett and spoke with the Commander of U.S. Space Command General John W. Raymond to discuss the importance of a focus on national security space and to reiterate his support for basing Space Command in Colorado.In May 2020, the Air Force announced a new basing decision process that evaluated self-nominating communities, like Aurora and Colorado Springs, on their ties to the military space mission, existing infrastructure capacity, community support, and cost to the Air Force. The Air Force also announced Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs would remain the provisional location of the command until 2026. Later in May, Bennet and Gardner wrote a letter to Colorado Governor Jared Polis calling for him to support military spouse licensure reciprocity in the state, which Polis then signed into law in July 2020. Spouse licensure reciprocity was a component of the Air Force’s evaluation of each nominating state’s support for military families. Following passage of Colorado House Bill 20-1326, the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation, Polis, and Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera wrote to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Barrett to highlight the new Colorado law and further demonstrate that Colorado is the best state to serve as the permanent home of the U.S. Space Command.In June 2020, Bennet welcomed Polis’ endorsement of the self-nomination of both the Aurora and Colorado Springs communities to compete to be the permanent home for U.S. Space Command. At the end of August 2020, the Aurora and Colorado Springs communities submitted their questionnaire responses to the Department of the Air Force completing the next step in the basing process.In August 2020, Bennet visited Peterson AFB and Schriever AFB for an update on the U.S. Space Command mission and stand up. He also met with General Dickinson, who assumed command in August, and learned about advancements at the National Space Defense Center. In November 2020, the Air Force announced Colorado Springs as a finalist for the U.S. Space Command headquarters.In December 2020, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper joined more than 600 state, federal, local, county and municipal officials, businesspeople, philanthropists, civic leaders, military officials, entrepreneurs and Coloradans from across the state in a letter urging Trump to keep the Command in the Centennial State.In January 2021, following the relocation announcement, Bennet and Hickenlooper released a statement denouncing the decision and expressing concern that the Trump White House influenced the decision for political reasons. In January 2021, Bennet and Hickenlooper also led a letter from the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation that urged President Joe Biden to suspend the Trump Administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama until the administration conducts a thorough review.In May 2021, Bennet and U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged Biden to fully consider how the move may affect Intelligence Community dependencies and missions as well as the country’s ability to maintain superiority in space.In June 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper, and U.S. Representatives Jason Crow and Doug Lamborn, and a bipartisan majority of the Colorado Congressional Delegation invited Vice President Kamala Harris to visit Colorado and its thriving space industry. In August 2021, Bennet expressed concerns over comments former President Trump made on a radio show suggesting his direct involvement in the relocation decision. In August 2021, Bennet spoke at the Space Symposium’s Space Technology Hall of Fame Dinner, highlighting Colorado’s leadership in national security space and space innovation and pushing for a thorough review of the decision to relocate U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama.In September 2021, Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow, Lamborn and a group of bipartisan members of the Colorado Congressional Delegation sent a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall urging him to suspend the Trump Administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama until the administration conducts a thorough review.In January, 2022, Bennet and Crow hosted Chairman Adam Schiff in Colorado for a briefing with Space Command, National Space Defense Center, and National Reconnaissance Office  leadership.Bennet and Warner met with leadership from the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community IC at Schriever Space Force Base and Buckley Space Force Base. The senators’ meetings highlighted the defense and intelligence elements in Colorado key to U.S. space missions, including U.S. Space Command, and underscored the central role Colorado maintains in both space and national security innovation. Last month, Bennet and Hickenlooper announced support from thirteen leading aerospace companies and accelerators to keep U.S. Space Command in Colorado due in large part to the state’s commanding aerospace industry, which supports U.S. defense and space missions.Recently, Bennet and Hickenlooper led a letter from the entire Colorado Congressional Delegation calling on President Joe Biden to ensure the U.S. Space Command basing decision takes into account national security and cost implications, and considers the findings of two pending reviews."

https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=3C8B4A72-2CAF-4E55-A62E-9E30E01DE7CF,"Denver - Today, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper Colorado U.S. Representative Joe Neguse introduced the Replacing Essential Passports and Licenses After Certain Emergencies (REPLACE) Act, a bill to automatically waive replacement fees for critical documents lost in major disasters.Under current law, federal agencies may waive the fees for the replacement of passports, visas, proof of citizenship, and other documents. However, the waiver process is not automatic and the current process can cause confusion for survivors who may not know to wait for a fee waiver to be issued or who need documentation replaced immediately. Additionally, waivers are not guaranteed and are not always issued.""As families recover from major disasters like the Marshall Fire, the last thing they should have to worry about is paying to replace passports and other essential immigration documents lost in the damage,"" said Bennet. ""Our bill will ensure document replacement is free, taking one burden off of people's shoulders as they move forward after disaster strikes.""“Disaster survivors don’t have time to worry about passport or green card replacement fees,” said Hickenlooper. “We waive most of these fees already, so let’s make it standard for every major disaster.” “Over the past several months my staff has assisted survivors of the Marshall Fire in recovering critical documents. From passports to birth certificates, the fees for replacing all that was lost can quickly become overwhelming,” said Neguse. “The REPLACE Act will ease the burden of recovery by issuing fee waivers for people impacted, allowing passports to be replaced at no additional cost. We must continue to be present for our healing communities, and this bill is a small way we can show our support.”The REPLACE Act would amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to require certain critical document fees be automatically waived for individuals and households that are affected by major disasters and eligible to receive funding under the Individuals and Households Program (IHP) assistance. Specifically, fees would be automatically waived for the following:PassportsPassport and/or Visa formsPermanent Resident Card replacement formsDeclaration of Intention formsNaturalization/Citizenship Document formsEmployment Authorization forms Biometric service feesThe bill text is available HERE."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=B1C7A60E-84A0-4D02-8D6D-1301633749AF,"Denver — U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) introduced the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act of 2022, which exempts state and local corrections officers from paying a federal tax penalty for early withdrawals from qualified retirement accounts. Currently, federal corrections officers are exempt from such penalties. Due to the physically taxing nature of this profession, many officers retire prior to age 59 ½, which is the age at which individuals can withdraw from qualified retirement accounts without facing a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. In 2015, Bennet and Toomey introduced the Federal Public Safety Retirement Fairness Act, which made all federal law enforcement officers eligible for an exemption to the early withdrawal penalty, and which passed into law as part of a broader package. With the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act of 2022, eligibility for this exemption would expand to include state and local corrections officers. “State and local corrections officers in Colorado and across the country work long, hard hours — and their demanding jobs as essential public service workers often mean they face early retirement,” said Bennet. “When they’re ready to retire, our bipartisan legislation would provide them with the same security as federal law enforcement officers by ensuring they won’t face penalties when they access their savings.”“Law enforcement officers and public safety employees endure unique physical demands and stress throughout their careers, leading to earlier-than-normal retirements. This small change to the federal tax code will ensure that all of America’s law enforcement and public safety employees have access to this exemption and can utilize their hard-earned retirement savings penalty-free,” said Toomey. “The National Prison Council would like to thank Senator Bennet and Senator Toomey for their continued support of the nation's Correctional Officers and the Corrections Profession by introducing the State and Local Corrections Officer Retirement Fairness Act of 2022,” said Shane Fausey, National President, Council of Prison Locals 33.“This bill is a great way to honor corrections employees and the uniquely difficult work they do. Having the ability to retire a little earlier and without a penalty to their retirement will certainly benefit corrections employees and honor the work they do to make our communities safe,” said Hilary Glasgow, the Executive Director of the state employees union, Colorado WINS. “We're proud to see our elected leaders lifting up public employees and the essential work they do to keep our state running.”A one-page summary of the bill is available HERE."

The funding comes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) which makes the largest-ever investment in public transit. ""Modernizing public transit is absolutely essential to connect Colorado communities,” said Bennet. ""This funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help our state invest in public transit to ensure more Coloradans can rely on safe, accessible transportation to get to work or school.""“No matter where you live, Coloradans rely on public transit. This huge investment will help people get to work or school, see family and friends, and explore Colorado while reducing emissions in our fight against climate change,” said Hickenlooper. The Department of Transportation today announced that $20 billion will be going to communities nationwide for public transit this year. “Every day, transit connects millions of Americans to jobs, schools, groceries, hospitals, resources, and countless other opportunities – all while helping to reduce pollution, congestion, and traffic,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “Now, thanks to the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making the largest investment in public transit in our nation’s history.”The funding includes specific allocations for Colorado the following transit agencies. The remainder will go to small transit agencies. $6,450,842 for Transfort in Fort Collins$11,411,805 for Mountain Metropolitan Transit in Colorado Springs$113,739,727 for metro Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD)The funding will enable Colorado transit authorities to modernize and expand services for residents in their communities by buying new buses and railcars, addressing repair backlogs, transitioning to new technologies to address the climate crisis, and improving transit service for communities that have historically had more limited access to transit. These upgrades will create jobs and support the expansion of U.S. manufacturing due to Buy America requirements that apply to steel, iron, and other materials used in public transportation projects that receive federal assistance."

As Tax Day approaches on April 18, Bennet also highlighted that eligible families can claim the second half of their expanded CTC — as well as their full expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) — by filing their 2021 tax return.“[The expanded Child Tax Credit] is a pro-work policy,” said Bennet in his speech. “It's a pro-family policy. It’s a pro-democracy policy. And we now know it worked and it worked well…we've got to fight to make it permanent. And that's what I'll do.”“Last year…we adopted the expanded Child Tax Credit,” said Bennet. “We discovered that we didn't have to accept a world where the poorest people in our country were our children. We benefited 61 million kids in the United States — 90% of the children in Colorado…We cut childhood poverty nearly in half. We cut hunger by a quarter for families with kids during a pandemic.”“120 economists [today] sent an open letter saying that, ‘the expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the easiest, most effective and direct tools currently at our disposal to help families deal with the impact of inflation on family budgets,’” said Bennet. “Economic inequality has only gotten staggeringly worse in this country…And I can tell you, Mr. President, that our kids pay the highest price from this.”“...What I really want is an economy that when it grows, it grows for everybody,” said Bennet. “Because that's the American Dream. That's the story we've told ourselves about who we are as a people. And that's the way to strengthen our democracy…In the meantime, what I would like us to do…is lift half the kids of this country out of poverty so they have a chance to pursue the American Dream themselves.”In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (APRA) expanded the CTC based on Bennet’s American Family Act, along with the EITC, based on Bennet’s Working Families Tax Relief Act with U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and the CDCTC. Millions of families received monthly installments of the CTC last year, including 27 million children previously excluded from the full credit because their families’ incomes were too low.  Today, more than 120 economists urged Congress to extend the CTC to help families in the face of rising costs. As Coloradans continue to face cost increases, Bennet is fighting to make this expansion permanent. Bennet’s full speech is available HERE."

These meetings underscored the central role Colorado maintains in both space and national security innovation.“I’m grateful Chairman Schiff joined Representative Crow and me today to see first-hand Colorado’s extensive space and national security assets,” said Bennet. “Our visits today reinforce that Colorado is the nexus of national security space operations for the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense.

This critical legislation will impose steep costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine. As the Kremlin continues to engage in an unjustified military build-up along Ukraine’s border, this proposal to deter a military escalation sends a clear message that the United States is prepared to impose devastating consequences for Putin and the Russian economy if he goes down the path of re-invading Ukraine. The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022 would impose crippling sanctions on the Russian banking sector and senior military and government officials if President Putin escalates hostile action in or against Ukraine. The bill would also prohibit transactions on Russia’s primary and secondary sovereign debt and authorize sanctions on Russia’s extractive industries as well as on providers of specialized financial messaging services (e.g., SWIFT). To help meet urgent defense needs, the legislation calls upon the Departments of Defense and State to expedite transfer of defense articles to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities and authorizes $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance to Ukraine in the event of a re-invasion by Russia. Lastly, the bill also expands U.S. efforts to counter Kremlin disinformation and strengthen ties with key regional partners facing Kremlin aggression. “Putin’s attempt to undermine Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty is unacceptable,” said Bennet. “Our bill outlines comprehensive and severe consequences, including crippling sanctions, for any further aggression. We must continue to strengthen ties with our regional allies and partners to ensure freedom and stability in Ukraine and across Europe, as well as support the Ukrainian people’s desire for democracy.”“The U.S. will stand with the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian aggression,” said Hickenlooper. “This bill sends a clear signal to President Putin that invasion is unacceptable and will be met with severe consequences.”“This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,” said Menendez. “As the Biden administration seeks a diplomatic path forward this week in Europe to avoid another bloody escalation in Ukraine, I find little reason to believe that Putin is negotiating in good faith nor do I believe he has any newfound respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is precisely why we are coming together to send a clear message—Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe. Ultimately the most effective sanction on Russia is a strong and unified Ukraine, and I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues so that we can provide the people of Ukraine the type of support they need to confront the bully in Moscow.”  In addition to Bennet, Hickenlooper, and Menendez, this legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K.

https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=B0CA9AB6-69E1-4755-BE71-7FA030CEDC74,"Washington, D.C.  – Yesterday, Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper met with a group of Colorado leaders to discuss a strategy to address Colorado’s ongoing housing affordability crisis. In August, Bennet convened a group of Coloradans to craft a comprehensive strategy that could serve as a roadmap for progress on housing affordability in the state. On Monday, after months of work, Bennet’s Housing Affordability Strategy Group, chaired by Kelly Brough, Jenn Lopez, and Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers, presented its policy framework to the senators. “We cannot solve our housing challenges unless we work together –– they’re too big and too complex for anyone to take on alone,” said Bennet. “I’m grateful to Kelly, Jenn, and Mayor Suthers for convening this group of Coloradans to take a comprehensive look at our housing affordability challenges and put forward specific ideas to address them. To succeed we’re going to have to be a model of collaboration between the public, private, and non-profit sectors and across every level of government. I look forward to continuing our work together to put these recommendations into action and deliver for the people of Colorado.”“We must find ways to house more people more affordably in Colorado and across the country. These recommendations show how we solve that need,” said Hickenlooper.“I joined in the process because I thought that we could identify some meaningful steps to address the housing crisis that we could all support together,” said Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers. “There are a number of ideas that we put together where I feel we’ve hit the mark, especially with bringing more private partners to the table to increase supply and changing our programs to increase flexibility so they are more responsive to conditions on the ground. We now have a framework in which we can continue to work on together and find common ground, which is somewhat rare these days in politics. I’m looking forward to supporting the work that lies ahead.”  “I’d like to thank Senator Bennet for bringing us all together and Senator Hickenlooper for being part of this important discussion. I’m proud of the work we’ve done to lift up voices from urban, suburban, and rural communities, and Coloradans from across the political spectrum. If we want to address the housing crisis, we need all levels of government, for-profit, and non-profit partners to come together to address these challenges across the state,” said Kelly Brough, Chief Strategy Officer, Metro State University.“I really think we have something here that is game-changing for our state and for our communities. Together, we face the challenges of increasing the supply quickly, modernizing our response to our housing crisis that gives local communities the flexibility they need to respond, tackling issues like discrimination and sustainability, proactively addressing the issue of housing stability, and bringing more innovation into the system. I think if anyone can do it, it’s the state of Colorado, and I’m excited to see where we go from here,” said Jenn Lopez, CEO, Project Moxie.The framework includes specific action items under four big-picture recommendations:The symptoms of the housing crisis exist across Colorado:"

The announcement comes after Bennet requested the fee waiver last week. “Many victims of the Marshall Fire, rightly so, are still in shock and grappling with how they will move forward from this disaster after losing their homes. The tremendous news that USCIS will waive the fees to replace essential documents like visas and green cards will take one burden off their shoulders,” said Bennet. “I’ll continue to do everything I can to ensure the federal government is an effective partner as we rebuild.”USCIS is working to finalize the Marshall Fire fee waiver. As the process is finalized, Coloradans can request a fee waiver for special situations HERE in the interim. Fire victims who have lost passports, military discharge papers, Medicare or social security cards in the fire can also contact Bennet’s office for help obtaining replacements. Representatives from the USCIS Field Office, as well as the offices of Bennet, U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper, and U.S. Representative Joe Neguse, are onsite at the Boulder County Disaster Assistance Center to offer assistance. The Assistance Center is open from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. seven days a week at 1755 South Public Road in Lafayette. A full list of resources available to victims of the Marshall Fire — including mental and behavioral health care resources, free telehealth care resources, insurance information, information on applying for FEMA assistance, U.S. Small Business Administration assistance, and disaster unemployment assistance — is available HERE."

What do we owe the 158 million Americans -- a record -- who showed up during a plague, this COVID pandemic, to cast their votes for Donald Trump and for Joe Biden -- what are they owed? And what do we owe our kids and our grandkids? I think the answer is very clear, which is a stronger democracy, [and] an economy that works for everybody, not just the people at the very top,” said Bennet during his speech.“This is our choice. We either save this democracy, which I believe we will, or we let it go.  And it's going to be on us. And if we let it go, generations of Americans are going to indict us for that. And if we save it, I think they'll celebrate the work that we did here just as we celebrate the work of the people that came before us that made our country more democratic, more fair, and more free,” Bennet concluded.Bennet also penned an op-ed in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel today to reflect on the attack and the future of this democracy.Bennet’s full speech is available HERE and a transcript is available below.I feel grateful to have the chance here to join my colleagues to mark the anniversary of January 6. And I thank the Chair of the Rules Committee, Senator Klobuchar, for her leadership in all of this. We had an insurrection here a year ago that could have very easily turned into a conflagration if it had not been for the incredible bravery of the Capitol Police and the other law enforcement that was summoned to the Capitol, too late, but nevertheless, here. The National Guard, as my colleague from Virginia was talking about, they kept this place from being burned down. They kept people from getting killed. They lost their lives on that day and in subsequent days because of the trauma that they were exposed to. They suffered racial epithets that nobody in America should have to suffer shouted in the halls of this Capitol. T-shirts with the most racist, Holocaust denying slogans on them. And there are people here, as my colleague from Wisconsin said, who are claiming that they were acting like tourists. That's a really big lie too.This was an incredibly dangerous situation. And we were saved. Not just us, but the staff all over this Capitol and everybody else. I just heard somebody downstairs in the basement walking by and they were pointing out one of those pictures that's down there of newsboys standing in front of the Capitol when they were kids. And the guy said, ""Those were my great uncles."" Because this place, for the people that work here -- I'm not talking about the Senate, but the people that work here that are the staff, whose grandparents worked here, whose great uncles are on the pictures downstairs. To them, this is a family. And it was attacked. It was assaulted on behalf of people that came summoned here by the president who claimed that the election had been stolen from him, who was perpetrating a big lie about what had happened in the election. There shouldn't have even been a surprise about the results in the election. There was little reason for suspense. And it's tragic that a year later, we still have to come here and say, ""Joe Biden won the election.""And he did by any fair study of what happened that day on election day. He won Arizona by 10,000 votes. He won Georgia by 11,000 votes. He won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes. He won Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes, in Michigan by 150,000 votes. In every one of those swing states, he won by more votes than Donald Trump won in his election against Hillary Clinton. So this wasn't some razor thin margin. This margin was bigger in those states, except Arizona, than the margin that Donald Trump had won when he won the election against Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden won this election by 7 million votes. Donald Trump actually lost the popular vote when he won the election by 3 million votes. But his election wasn't seriously contended by anybody. And it shouldn't have been, because he'd won the Electoral College. Just as Joe Biden had won the Electoral College. And he still claims the election was stolen even though there is no evidence that that's true. His own Attorney General said it's a lie. His lawyers -- Donald Trump's lawyers -- have been thrown out of more than 60 courtrooms by state and federal judges, some of them appointed by President Trump himself, saying that there was no evidence that there was fraud. A year later, there's been another incredibly expensive audit or review of the election, this time the election in Georgia. And you know what, there were four people down there who were dead who voted. Four people. They didn't actually vote, they were dead, but people cast ballots on behalf of them. Four people out of 5 million and one of those cast a vote for Donald Trump. But President Trump continues to say that there were dead people voting all over the United States of America. The Associated Press did a review of all those swing states that I was mentioning earlier, and they found that if you just looked at the disputed ballots -- so these aren't even fraudulent ballots, because they haven't been identified as fraudulent, they're just disputed ballots -- that in all these cases, the disputed ballots came to about .15% of the margin in any one of these races. In other words, in not a single one of these swing states where there's a “dispute” that President Trump has brought, would it make a material difference, even if it were true, what you're alleging. Which it's not. And he's still doubled down on the big lie. And the result of that is, as my colleagues have said here today, there are more than 400 bills nationwide, in the name of that big lie, making it harder for the American people to vote, making it harder for them to register, making it harder for people to vote early, or to vote by mail. Because of a myth. Because of a lie, slashing the number of polling places, and dropboxes. In Texas, they are down to one dropbox per county. In Colorado, I can practically cross my street and vote at a dropbox. This is an effort to subvert elections to cling to power. That is what is happening here. And it's based on a massive falsehood -- the big lie. I think one needs to ask oneself, even people that support President Trump, what future does the stop the steal movement imagine for our country? What future do they imagine for this democracy where every election is going to be contested? Where political violence replaces the ballot box. Where elections are decided by strongmen, not votes, turning us into Russia or China. Is that really what we want our legacy to be here in the country? Do we want to be the first generation of Americans to decide that it's just too hard to do our duty to the people that founded this country, the people that fought from the time this country was founded until today, who died for the sake of democracy, that it's just too hard? That somehow our differences are unique, or so important that we're going to give up on our shared commitment to the democracy in favor of those disagreements? And I think we need to ask ourselves at a moment like this, what we owe the generations of Americans that have fought to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free. What do we owe the 158 million Americans -- a record -- who showed up during a plague, this COVID pandemic, to cast their votes for Donald Trump and for Joe Biden -- what are they owed? And what do we owe our kids and our grandkids? I think the answer is very clear, which is a stronger democracy, an economy that works for everybody, not just the people at the very top. And where do we begin? You know, Colorado, I think, is a great example, Mr. President, where we have made it a lot easier for people to vote. We have one of the highest voter turnouts in the country. I always have to say, especially when the senator from Minnesota is around, that we are number two in terms of voter turnout, Minnesota is number one, but we're coming for you. And that's the spirit we should all have. We should be trying to get more people to vote, not fewer people to vote. We should have vote by mail, we should have early balloting. We have all of that in Colorado, one of the highest turnout rates in the country, and no fraud. No fraud. So I'm going to just finish by saying that we should distrust politicians who can't seem to win people's votes with their argument, just as we should distrust politicians who attack the free press to avoid accountability even though that free press is enshrined in our Constitution. And we should recommit to each other and the democracy. Let me tell you something, Mr. President. Last week we had another tragedy in Colorado, another disaster. Boulder, Colorado started out this year with a mass shooting in a grocery store, some of you may remember that. And basically on New Year's Eve, we had a massive fire that ripped through neighborhoods in the front range of Colorado in Boulder County. 1000 people, 1000 houses were burned, more than 30,000 people [forced from] their homes. And I sat there thinking to myself as I was with my daughters watching those fires on the television set, how much we actually need each other, you know. And there's a lot of evidence out there in those two days –the law enforcement that got those 30,000 people out and had almost literally no fatalities because of what they did and what they sacrificed. The Coloradans that stepped up that night and said ""You can come to my house, we'll put you up in my house"" so that out of those 30,000 people, there were fewer than 300 people in a shelter that night. The reporters, the journalists, that were out there long into the night, reporting on that fire so that people might have some sense of whether their house had been lost or their house had been saved. The local county officials who have worked tirelessly after flood and after fire, and after natural disasters to come together to make sure that we build back stronger, which we always do in Colorado. And even, let me say, the federal government's contribution, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, because if there is one reason that we should be one nation under God, it's for a natural disaster like the one that's just occurred in Colorado. This is our choice. We either save this democracy, which I believe we will, or we let it go. And it's going to be on us. And if we let it go, generations of Americans are going to indict us for that. And if we save it, I think they'll celebrate the work that we did here just as we celebrate the work of the people that came before us that made our country more democratic, more fair, and more free. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=A5B78ED1-D9D9-4E4B-9FF2-935798CED3ED,"Washington, D.C. – In case you missed it, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet penned an op-ed today in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel one year after the attack on the U.S. Capitol and the attempt to block the certification of the 2020 election. In the op-ed, Bennet urges the country to reject the ongoing, unfounded claims of election fraud and seize this moment to strengthen American democracy for the next generation.The full op-ed is available HERE and below. One year ago today, Americans violently stormed our Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election.After being evacuated, the Senate and the House returned that night to fulfill our Constitutional duty. On Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden’s inauguration marked the 45th peaceful transition of power since John Adams succeeded George Washington.There was little reason for suspense that day. President Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes; Georgia by more than 11,000; Wisconsin by more than 20,000; Pennsylvania by more than 80,000; and Michigan by more than 150,000. His margin in all these states except Arizona was greater than President Trump’s in 2016. And unlike the former president, who lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 3 million votes, Biden won by more than 7 million.Nevertheless, President Trump claims the 2020 election was stolen. He has never produced any actual evidence of fraud (his own Attorney General said there was none). Judges across the country, including some Trump appointees, have thrown his lawyers out of more than 60 courtrooms for failing to provide evidence. Last week, another expensive “audit” determined that dead people voted in Georgia: out of nearly 5 million Georgians who voted, four were dead, including one likely for Trump. Since the election, the Associated Press reviewed every potential case of voter fraud across the six states President Trump challenged and determined that disputed ballots represented just 0.15 percent of Joe Biden’s combined margin of victory in these states. Despite this reality, President Trump has seized on the Jan. 6 anniversary to double-down on his claim the election was stolen.If President Trump can “stop the steal” with no evidence of theft, what election would ever be secure? As Americans, we cannot disregard our Constitution just because we don’t like an election’s outcome. Elections are how we transfer power peacefully — from school boards to the presidency. Our Founders knew that throughout history, the alternative to peaceful elections is political violence — as we saw at the Capitol one year ago. Surrendering the peaceful transfer of power would end the exercise in self-government our Founders designed over 230 years ago and deal a crippling blow to freedom and the rule of law.We should ask what future the “stop the steal” movement imagines for our country. I understand many Americans’ frustration with government, but are we really prepared to trade our constitutional rights for the tyranny in Russia, China or Turkey? Will we be the first Americans to give up self-government because we think the work is too hard, our leaders are too corrupt or our grievances with each other are more profound than our common commitment to democracy?A year after Jan. 6, we should ask what we owe generations of Americans that have fought to make this country live up to our founding creed? What do we owe to each other, the record 158 million people who voted in 2020 for President Trump and President Biden? What do we owe our children and our grandchildren?The answer is clear. We owe them a stronger democracy that works better for all Americans, and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the very top. Our democratic example has always shined brightest when we stood for both freedom and opportunity; one idea cannot meaningfully exist without the other.At a moment when we seem so divided, how do we begin? By remembering the Founders did not expect us to agree with each other. Far from it. They understood that in America no king or tyrant could tell us what to think. Our freedom to think gives us the freedom to disagree. They trusted that from our disagreements, we would create more imaginative and durable solutions than any tyrant could discover on his own. I think our Founders were on to something, because the worst decisions I make are the ones made alone in my basement or workshop not contending with someone else’s viewpoint, perspective or experience.We are not the first generation of Americans to disagree, but we are the first to suffer the effects of disagreements as they are stoked by giant social media echo chambers whose business model addicts us (and our kids) by making us angry at each other. We are the first generation to witness the near collapse of trusted print and local journalism because of the same business models. More important, we are becoming the first generation since WWII to have shorter lifespans, worry that our kids are going to be economically worse off than we are, and contemplate the possible eclipse of America’s global leadership by an authoritarian China.We can escape this future, but only if we recommit to our democracy and show the world that, out of our disagreements, America can still make decisions for the benefit of the next generation. Start by distrusting any politics that asks you to treat a neighbor with a different perspective as your enemy, or an enemy of America. Reject politicians escaping accountability by attacking the free press, enshrined in our Bill of Rights. And, concerning rights, celebrate Colorado’s extraordinary (and fraud-free) voting and work to ensure all Americans have similar access to the polls.If last week’s Boulder County fires demonstrated anything, we need each other: the first responders who warned over 30,000 people out of harm’s way; the Coloradans who housed their neighbors so fewer than 300 people spent the night in shelters; the journalists whose reporting throughout the night gave families some sense whether their home had been lost or spared; local officials who have helped Colorado rebuild better after floods and fires, now turning their attention to yet another disaster; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — because if ever there were a reason to be “one nation under God,” it’s to deal with natural disasters.We must seize this moment to restore our democratic covenant with one another. If we fail to fulfill our responsibilities as citizens, we will unleash a disaster of our own making and earn condemnation from generations of Americans. If we succeed, as Lincoln said, we will have “nobly save[d]...the last best hope of earth.” Do we really have any choice?"

This funding, which was allocated in the American Rescue Plan Act and Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations, will help Colorado make mental health support more accessible and expand the lifeline’s services.“Everywhere I go in Colorado, I hear how our country’s mental and behavioral health crisis is only getting worse,” said Bennet. “Shortening the suicide prevention lifeline to expand its services and reach is a strong step toward making mental health support more accessible to Coloradans and addressing the crisis. I’m glad our state will receive this critical funding to help make this a swift and easy transition.”In July 2021, Bennet introduced the Suicide and Crisis Outreach Prevention Enhancement Act with U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), which would expand and enhance the capacity of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and mental health crisis centers. The bill aims to increase awareness of the Lifeline through outreach campaigns, collect and report on demographic data on individuals accessing the lifeline, as well as increase the capacity of the lifeline and crisis centers to provide mental health crisis intervention services. In December 2019, Bennet co-sponsored the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, which designates 9-8-8 as the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline and ensures states have the flexibility to strengthen local crisis call centers. In October 2020, the bill was signed into law. The 9-8-8 hotline will be implemented in July 2022. In total, states will receive $282 million to help make this transition and expand lifeline services. The funding includes:"
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=26738F24-2B8B-4598-85BB-6F35526CA329,"Denver – In an op-ed in the Colorado Sun, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet reiterated his support for reforming U.S. Senate rules to end the filibuster, restore the Senate, and protect democracy. Bennet proposes several reforms to make the U.S. Senate work again for the American people by allowing legislation to move forward with a majority vote while ensuring opportunities for meaningful input from the minority party. In Bennet’s view, these reforms are critical to ensure American democracy can compete in the 21st century.The full op-ed is available HERE and below. Confined to bed and forced to watch television coverage of the Senate for a week, an American citizen wouldn’t see anything resembling the old School House Rock cartoon about “How a Bill Becomes a Law.” Committees don’t draft careful legislation after weeks of deliberation. Senators don’t debate the pros and cons of that legislation on the floor. Instead, we cram everything we can into overstuffed budget bills passed at the stroke of midnight to keep the government’s lights on.Today more than half of young Americans believe our democracy is “failing” or “in trouble.” One think tank recently labeled America a “backsliding democracy.” The Senate does not bear all of the blame, but it deserves a lot.The Founders wanted the Senate to make its decisions after careful consideration and debate. Now the Senate never debates and almost never decides.That’s because current Senate rules, commonly misdescribed as the filibuster, require a supermajority of 60 votes to advance legislation to a final vote. These rules, which exist nowhere in the Constitution, empower 41 senators, who often represent as little as 24 percent of Americans, to block debate and decisions about broadly supported legislation--from voting rights to gun safety. Until this century, senators rarely used the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation and almost always to block civil rights and enforce segregation. Now, members invoke it daily, forcing both parties to jam their priorities through “reconciliation,” a mutant parliamentary workaround that allows certain budget-related bills to pass with a simple majority.The result is a crisis of American democracy: the majority cannot govern, which means the nation cannot act. Our sclerosis discredits our system of self-government at the very moment authoritarian governments like Russia and China argue that democracy cannot meet the challenges of the 21st century.For our democracy to compete, we have to restore the Senate. And there’s no way to do that without reforming rules that a minority of craven lawmakers are abusing to grind the body to a standstill.Let’s be more specific about what needs to happen:I know that Republicans and their allies in the conservative media will argue that the filibuster is a vital part of American politics and that any change would be nothing more than a partisan power grab.But let’s be clear: this isn’t the first time that the Senate has impeded American progress, and it wouldn’t be the first time that Senate rules have changed in response.Before the Civil War, the Senate sheltered the minority interests of slave holders. After the war, it enabled monopolists, robber barons, and isolationists to profit from the misery of the conflict and its aftermath.Each time, crises forced the Senate to fundamentally change how it went about its business. And each change led to meaningful progress, including clearing the way for the passage of the 14th and 15th amendments to emancipate and enfranchise former slaves, sweeping anti-trust reforms, and long-delayed legislation to protect civil rights.The bottom line is that Senate rules are not suspended in amber; they can and have changed with the times. No one knew this better than the late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. More than once, Byrd reformed the Senate to better serve the nation. In 1975, he even led the effort to reduce the votes required to end debate and proceed to a final vote from 67 to 60, where it stands today.As we consider reforms, we should reject the choice between making the Senate more like the House, where the majority runs roughshod over the minority, or accepting the procedural straightjacket of our own design. If we change the rules, we should also be prepared to live under them whether we are in the majority or not.Our goal is not to secure an immediate partisan advantage. It is to make the Senate work again and refire the engine of American democracy -- for our nation, and for the world."

In Colorado, she could live independently while still accessing the care she needed in her own home. This legislation named in her honor would strengthen the federally protected right of individuals with disabilities to be meaningfully integrated into their own community and to receive long-term services and supports (LTSS).“Every person deserves the opportunity to live independently while still having access to the care that they need,” said Bennet. “Latonya Reeves was forced to leave Tennessee and come to Colorado to find that opportunity. Then she dedicated her life to helping others do the same. Our legislation will help ensure people like Latonya and the individuals that she has helped can live independently in their communities while still accessing the care they need -- no matter where they live.”“I am honored for the bill to be named after me, and just want other people to get out of nursing homes. Thank you, Senator Bennet, for your support,” said Latonya Reeves who left Tennessee and came to Colorado to avoid being institutionalized and has since dedicated her life to ensuring other Disabled individuals are given the opportunity to live in freedom.  ""We are thrilled that Senator Bennet has introduced the LaTonya Reeves Freedom Act,"" said Dawn Russell, an ADAPT activist who has spent more than 30 years fighting for freedom.  ""Because of Senator Bennet's leadership, we can see the day when people who need long term services and supports can live in the community and will no longer be forced into unwanted institutionalization.  His work honors every ADAPT activist, beginning with Wade Blank and the Gang of 19, who put their bodies on the line for decades in our fight for civil rights.""“THRIVE Center fully supports the Latonya Reeves Freedom Act. This piece of legislation will allow people with Intellectual Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) to live quality lives in the community of their choice. Finally, access to Long Term Support and Services that are person-centered, self-directed, culturally responsive, and comprehensive. Currently, many people with I/DD and their families/caregivers have to constantly fight for services that they are eligible for. The crazy bureaucracy, the nonsensical rules that families had no part in creating, the exhaustion and uncompensated effort families must endure to keep their loved ones from being in an institution is far from equitable or inclusive. But, there is hope with the Latonya Reeves Freedom Act where our voices were heard, heeded, and acted upon. Nothing about us without us,” said Yvette Burkhalter, Executive Director of THRIVE Center, a Colorado Community Parent Resource Center and Family-to-Family Health Information Center. “Jewish Family Service of Colorado (JFS) enthusiastically supports the adoption and passage of The Latonya Reeves Freedom Act. As a provider of Disability Services, we strongly believe that individuals with disabilities should have the autonomy and freedom to live in their desired location and be integrated in the communities they live. This legislation is a matter of civil rights for those with disabilities. JFS encourages the passage of The Latonya Reeves Freedom Act during the 117th Congress,” said Linda Foster, President and CEO of Jewish Family Service of Colorado.“Greeley, Colorado-based organization, Connections for Independent Living, fully supports the passing of the Latonya Reeves Freedom Act. Our nonprofit organization has served Northeastern Colorado’s disability community since 1986. We encourage individuals who live with disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community of their choice. Considering some individuals we serve require Long-Term Services & Support (LTSS) in their lives, the Freedom Act is vital to their future independence. At Connections for Independent Living, our team has directed a long-standing nursing home transition program for nearly 25 years. Its success relies on LTSS arranged in part by Home & Community Based Services. The Latonya Reeves Freedom Act will be of critical importance to our participants who are transitioning from skilled nursing facilities into private residences,” said Brad Taylor, Director of Transitions and Director of Advocacy at Connections for Independent Living. In the United States, over a quarter of individuals, or 67 million people, are living with a disability. In 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C. (Olmstead) that individuals with disabilities have a qualified right under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to receive supports and services while living in the community of their choosing. This landmark decision has assured people that they will not be forced into institutions, including psychiatric hospitals and nursing homes. The legislation will enable individuals with disabilities to live independent lives in their community and would: The bill would guarantee minimum requirements for coverage of LTSS, regulated by the Attorney General. Public entities and LTSS insurance providers would be required to conduct evaluations of their current practices and policies, identify current gaps in their systems, and implement a transition plan that addresses barriers to community living. The Department of Health and Human Services will be responsible for providing technical assistance, reviewing, and approving these transition plans. In addition to Bennet, this legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Jon Tester (D-Mont.).The bill text is available HERE.

Including this initial allocation for FY22, Colorado will receive roughly $430 million for airports and roughly $3.5 billion for highway and bridge projects over the next five years from the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “I’m pleased to see this much-needed funding from the bipartisan infrastructure bill coming to Colorado’s airports, highways, and bridges over the next five years,” said Bennet. “This funding will help create jobs, bolster our state’s economy, and better serve our growing Colorado communities. ”“Getting our Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill done was huge, but the job’s not finished until we get the funding where it’s needed most,” said Hickenlooper. “This first investment for roads, bridges, and airports will strengthen our infrastructure and create jobs in communities across the state.”“We are grateful for the support of Senator Bennet and Colorado’s congressional delegation,” said Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington. “This grant will provide much-needed funding for DEN’s infrastructure projects and will go a long way in helping us prepare for the exponential growth we are experiencing.”""These much-needed funds will support a record construction season that we are planning for Colorado next year,"" said CDOT Executive Director Shoshana Lew. ""Thanks to the expanded resources made available by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we are poised to build on our unprecedented state-level modernization bill passed by the Colorado state legislature and signed by Governor Polis this Spring to move even more quickly in delivering our 10-year project plan.""More information about the airport funding in the IIJA is available HERE. A fact sheet on how the IIJA will deliver for transportation projects in Colorado is available HERE. A breakdown of how much each Colorado airport will receive for FY22 and again in Fiscal Year 2023 is available below. LOCIDAirport NameCityTotalDENDenver InternationalDenver$                      59,164,109COSCity of Colorado Springs MunicipalColorado Springs$                        4,409,674ASEAspen-Pitkin County/Sardy FieldAspen$                        2,582,155GJTGrand Junction RegionalGrand Junction$                        2,242,202DRODurango-La Plata CountyDurango$                        1,921,731EGEEagle County RegionalEagle$                        1,899,256MTJMontrose RegionalMontrose$                        1,705,211HDNYampa ValleyHayden$                        1,399,975GUCGunnison-Crested Butte RegionalGunnison$                        1,023,462PUBPueblo MemorialPueblo$                        1,007,930ALSSan Luis Valley Regional/Bergman FieldAlamosa$                        1,006,513APACentennialDenver$                           763,000BJCRocky Mountain MetropolitanDenver$                           763,000FLYMeadow LakeColorado Springs$                           295,000CFOColorado Air and Space PortDenver$                           295,000FNLNorthern Colorado RegionalFort Collins/Loveland$                           295,000GXYGreeley-Weld CountyGreeley$                           295,000LMOVance BrandLongmont$                           295,000RILRifle Garfield CountyRifle$                           295,000SBSSteamboat Springs/Bob Adams FieldSteamboat Springs$                           295,000BDUBoulder MunicipalBoulder$                           159,000AEJCentral Colorado RegionalBuena Vista$                           159,000ITRKit Carson CountyBurlington$                           159,0001V6Fremont CountyCanon City$                           159,000CEZCortez MunicipalCortez$                           159,000CAGCraig-MoffatCraig$                           159,000AJZBlake FieldDelta$                           159,000EIKErie MunicipalErie$                           159,000FMMFort Morgan MunicipalFort Morgan$                           159,000LHXLa Junta MunicipalLa Junta$                           159,000LAALamar MunicipalLamar$                           159,000LICLimon MunicipalLimon$                           159,000MVIMonte Vista MunicipalMonte Vista$                           159,000PSOStevens FieldPagosa Springs$                           159,000ANKSalida Airport Harriett Alexander FieldSalida$                           159,000STKSterling MunicipalSterling$                           159,000TEXTelluride RegionalTelluride$                           159,0004V1Spanish Peaks AirfieldWalsenburg$                           159,0002V5Wray MunicipalWray$                           159,000AKOColorado Plains RegionalAkron$                           110,000GNBGranby-Grand CountyGranby$                           110,000HEQHolyokeHolyoke$                           110,00020VMc Elroy AirfieldKremmling$                           110,000LXVLake CountyLeadville$                           110,000EEOMeeker Coulter FieldMeeker$                           110,000AIBHopkins FieldNucla$                           110,0004V0RangelyRangely$                           110,000TADPerry StokesTrinidad$                           110,0002V6Yuma MunicipalYuma$                           110,000"

https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=69411AE7-6F5D-4CF5-AE84-E9D9CC3AAB45,"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) reintroduced the Helping Unleash Benefits and Services (HUBS) for Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation to support local “network hubs” which streamline access to essential resources for veterans, servicemembers, and their families. “Colorado has a wide range of resources available for servicemembers, veterans, and their families. However, these essential services and resources are often spread across agencies and organizations, forcing veterans to navigate a confusing bureaucracy to access the benefits they earned,” said Bennet. “Already, communities in Colorado are recognizing the benefit of centralizing resources into a network hub that can best help individuals find support. The HUBS for Veterans Act would elevate this idea and increase access to resources for more veterans, meeting them where they are.”“Navigating a number of streams of information to gain access to the resources they need can be a daunting and time-consuming task for many servicemembers transitioning from the military to civilian world,” said Crapo. “Many community-based organizations in Idaho have already stepped up to provide crucial long-term, holistic support and assistance.  Prioritizing network hubs to help provide these servicemembers more wraparound services from one entry point would reduce the burden on veterans to navigate each path individually.”“Here at the Mt. Carmel Veterans Service Center in Colorado Springs, we continue to see tremendous results in the ability of military members in transition to quickly attain job stability and self-sufficiency for themselves and their families. This is especially important now as our nation and those who served deal with the effects of COVID.  Transition success happens when a variety of community programs and services are integrated at one location minimizing stress and maximizing access to critical support services. This model continues to be an effective way for a community to support servicemembers after duty to our nation is complete. Public private partnerships are the cornerstone of this success.” – Bob McLaughlin, Chief Operating Officer for Mt. Carmel Veterans Service Center, a one-stop center for transitioning military, veterans, and their families.The HUBS for Veterans Act would authorize a five-year pilot program to provide matching grant funds to non-profit organizations that offer access to multiple, wraparound services from one source, or “network hubs.” The bill directs the Department of Labor (DOL), in consultation with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to prioritize network hubs that provide job recruitment training, educational support services, financial services, entrepreneurship training, behavioral health services, and assistance in accessing benefits administered by the VA.The bill would also ensure that servicemembers receive information through the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) about network hubs located in the community in which they will reside once they become a civilian. TAP is an interagency collaboration between the Department of Defense, DOL, and VA that provides information to servicemembers and their families to help them transition from military service to civilian life.Bennet and Crapo first introduced the HUBS for Veterans Act in 2018.The bill text is available HERE.  "
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=3EB62B30-09A5-42D6-AD7B-448ED04C2ED6,"Washington, D.C. – Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet issued the following statement after President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law:“Today in America, many cannot afford a middle-class life. People are working harder than ever, but struggling to put food on the table, afford health care, or keep a roof over their heads. In the wealthiest country in human history, tens of millions of Americans, millions of them children, live in poverty. This tremendous inequality existed before the pandemic, but this crisis has made matters much worse. “President Biden’s signature on the American Rescue Plan represents a historic step toward bridging our way out of this crisis and building an economy that provides opportunity for everyone, not just those at the top. The expansion of the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, something I have long championed, will significantly boost incomes for working families and cut child poverty almost in half. This legislation is the most significant investment in American workers and families in generations, but it is only the beginning of our work to build an economy that delivers greater opportunity and security to all Americans.”"

The bipartisan legislation supports the use of evidence-based innovation grants and the pay for outcomes model to benefit students.“An effective higher education system is critical to the long-term success of our students and our economy. Too often, high-need students, such as first-generation students and students from low income backgrounds, are underserved and under supported by our colleges and universities. The FINISH Act will promote innovation, flexibility, and evaluation in higher education to help improve educational attainment and outcomes for all students,” said Bennet.“Even before the pandemic, our higher education system was already falling short in serving our vulnerable students. In fact, every year, 1.2 million low-income or first-generation students enroll in college, but only a quarter of them will leave with a job related to their studies or enter graduate school. As our economy continues to struggle, we must be cognizant of student debt. It’s more important than ever to incentivize innovation through evidence-based solutions and set students up for success,” said Young. “The FINISH Act works to ensure our students have the tools to finish a credential or degree pathway – not just start – by using incentives to adopt innovative solutions.”“Every student learns differently, and to constrain them to a single cookie-cutter path of education is detrimental for their studies and our nation’s future. We need to innovate and diversify higher education as it becomes increasingly evident that the workforce of the future is dependent on a wide array of skills, knowledge, and experience,” said Scott. “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing the FINISH Act that will authorize innovation grants, encourage open-educational resources, and enforce greater accountability of tax-payer dollars in higher education.”The FINISH Act would authorize innovation grants, encourage open-educational resources, and establish better evaluation authority. The bill also works to support efficient and innovative uses of taxpayer funds through Pay-for-Outcomes initiatives.The legislation would:Bennet first introduced this legislation in 2018. The FINISH Act received widespread support from 118 local, state, and national organizations in a recent letter including Results for America, Knowledge Alliance, and Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP). In the letter, the organizations commended the senators for introducing the FINISH Act, “which would leverage the power of evidence and innovation to improve outcomes in higher education.” The full letter is available HERE.The bill text is available HERE."
https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=2C769043-69ED-426B-B30A-57981A4BA333,"Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Angus King (I-Maine), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wrote to the Biden Administration urging it to update federal standards for high-speed broadband to reflect modern uses and align those standards across the government. In a letter to the Biden Administration’s top officials for federal broadband policy -- including Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Acting Chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Jessica Rosenworcel, and Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese -- the senators called on federal agencies to update broadband program speed requirements to reflect existing and anticipated uses, from two-way video conferencing to smart grids to artificial intelligence. The senators also urged the officials to work together to align the definition of what constitutes high-speed broadband across federal agencies to replace the patchwork of standards that exist today.In the letter, the senators called on the administration to invest limited federal broadband dollars in faster and more reliable networks capable of supporting modern and future uses. Specifically, they urged the administration to set a goal of supporting networks wherever practicable and cost effective that provide, at a minimum, symmetrical speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) such that all members of a typical family can be online simultaneously without issue.“In the years ahead, emerging technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, health IoT, smart grid, 5G, virtual and augmented reality, and tactile telemedicine, will all require broadband networks capable of delivering much faster speeds, lower latency, and higher reliability than those now codified by various federal agencies,” wrote Bennet and the senators. “We must learn from our experience during the pandemic and raise federal standards for new broadband service to require low latency, high reliability, and speeds that meet our expected 21st century needs. We should also insist that new networks supported with federal funds meet this higher standard, with limited exceptions for truly hard-to-reach locations.”  Bennet and his colleagues continued: “For years, we have seen billions in taxpayer dollars subsidize network deployments that are outdated as soon as they are complete, lacking in capacity and failing to replace inadequate broadband infrastructure. We need a new approach. We urge you to work together to establish one consistent, modern baseline definition of high-speed broadband service and underlying infrastructure specifications across the federal government and a coordinated approach to deploy funding efficiently where it is most needed.” Shirley Bloomfield, CEO, NTCA – The Rural Broadband Association: “NTCA members are local providers delivering high-quality broadband that enable their rural communities to enjoy the critical advantages of broadband-enabled economic opportunities, education, health care and other vital services.  The demands placed upon broadband networks by the pandemic demonstrates that ‘just good enough’ speeds and latency are not good enough and will fall even further short of consumers’ needs in the near future.  Our nation’s federal broadband programs should aim higher and do better to drive investment that will provide the level of symmetrical speed and performance customers will need in the near future and for decades to come.  On behalf of NTCA’s members, I thank Senators Bennet, King, Portman, and Manchin for their letter highlighting the importance of aligning federal broadband program speed definitions and updating speed requirements to reflect modern broadband demands.” Bennet has helped lead the effort to bridge America’s digital divide. During the pandemic, he has consistently called for more funding and flexibility for the FCC’s E-Rate program to connect low-income students online. He called on the country’s top internet companies to keep families connected and waive data caps for the duration of the pandemic. Last June, Bennet and Senator King introduced the BRIDGE Act to deploy affordable, high-speed broadband to unserved communities nationwide. Bennet also co-sponsored the Emergency Broadband Connections Act, which passed as part of the 2020 end-of-year relief bill and will now provide $3.2 billion to help economically distressed Americans afford broadband connections.The text of the letter is available HERE and below. Dear Secretary Vilsack, Secretary Raimondo, Commissioner Rosenworcel, and Director Deese:We welcome the Biden Administration’s commitment to deploying affordable, high-speed broadband across the country to help bridge America’s digital divide and remedy persistent digital inequities. As you pursue this important goal, we strongly urge you to update federal broadband program speed requirements to reflect current and anticipated 21st century uses and align the definition of what constitutes high-speed broadband service across federal agencies.Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality, including low latency, high reliability, and low network jitter, for modern and emerging uses, like two-way videoconferencing, telehealth, remote learning, health IoT, and smart grid applications. Our goal for new deployment should be symmetrical speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps), allowing for limited variation when dictated by geography, topography, or unreasonable cost. While we recognize that in truly hard-to-reach areas, we need to be flexible in order to reach unserved Americans, we should strive to ensure that all members of a typical family can use these applications simultaneously. There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas (e.g., according to speedtest.net’s January 2021 analysis, average service is currently 180 Mbps download / 65 Mbps upload with 24 milli-sec latency).Broadband is increasingly critical to every aspect of our society and economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans have relied on high-speed broadband more than ever. It has allowed millions of Americans to continue working to support themselves and their families. Broadband has helped millions of students maintain their education and provided patients access to vital care through telemedicine services. It has also given family and friends a way to connect in this difficult time while supporting social distancing. All of these vital economic, social, and healthcare-related functions are only possible with access to adequate broadband, the demands for which only continue to increase. Over the next five years, if current trends hold, data needs are expected to increase annually by at least 25% per year, according to the International Data Corporation. The goal of universal service requires that all Americans have affordable broadband with the technical capacity to meet those needs equitably.The pandemic has reinforced the importance of high-speed broadband and underscored the cost of the persistent digital divide in our country. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), roughly 14.5 million Americans still lack access to broadband, and other studies estimate this number could be as high as 162 million. Unfortunately, the FCC data continually overestimates broadband connectivity due to outdated mapping and poor data collection methods. We now have multiple definitions across federal agencies for what constitutes an area as served with broadband, resulting in a patchwork without one consistent standard for broadband.  For example, the FCC defines high-speed broadband as download speeds of up to 25 megabits per second and upload speeds of up to 3 megabits per second (25/3 Mbps). Alternatively, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines it as just 10/1 Mbps. While it is important to update standards for federally funded projects, we also recognize that there are many Americans who lack access to even minimal service. If we do not prioritize unserved Americans before upgrading to higher speeds, then we will only increase the digital divide further.Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to “high-speed” in the year 2021. For any of these functions, upload speeds far greater than 3 Mbps are particularly critical. These challenges will not end with the pandemic. In the years ahead, emerging technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, health IoT, smart grid, 5G, virtual and augmented reality, and tactile telemedicine, will all require broadband networks capable of delivering much faster speeds, lower latency, and higher reliability than those now codified by various federal agencies.We must learn from our experience during the pandemic and raise federal standards for new broadband service to require low latency, high reliability, and speeds that meet our expected 21st century needs. We should also insist that new networks supported with federal funds meet this higher standard, with limited exceptions for truly hard-to-reach locations. For years, we have seen billions in taxpayer dollars subsidize network deployments that are outdated as soon as they are complete, lacking in capacity and failing to replace inadequate broadband infrastructure.We need a new approach. We urge you to work together to establish one consistent, modern baseline definition of high-speed broadband service and underlying infrastructure specifications across the federal government and a coordinated approach to deploy funding efficiently where it is most needed. This would also reduce redundancy and make it easier for state, local, and private partners applying for support, while complementing provisions in the end of year relief COVID-19 relief bill directing the National Telecommunications Information Agency to work with federal agencies to streamline existing broadband programs.The United States has long taken pride in our position at the vanguard of technological innovation and global competitiveness. If we want to maintain that leadership in the 21st century and ensure every American has access to economic opportunity regardless of where they live, we need to make sure that federal standards and strategies for essential technology services like broadband reflect our true needs today and future demands for connectivity.Sincerely,"
