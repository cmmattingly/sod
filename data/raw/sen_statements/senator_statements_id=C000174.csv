Rysheema Dixon was a dedicated councilwoman and community leader who spent her life in the service of others. I know her commitment to the greater good — including her extraordinary work at Pathways to Apprenticeship — will ensure that her legacy continues to live on. All of Delaware mourns her loss, and my deepest condolences are with her loved ones.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/carper-statement-on-pending-senate-consideration-of-the-kigali-amendment,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today issued the following statement on the announcement that the Senate will vote next week to proceed to consider the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, a global treaty to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).“I’m beyond pleased that the Senate is on the precipice of considering the Kigali Amendment. In ratifying this agreement, the United States will join 137 other nations to phase down the use of these powerful greenhouse gases. Importantly, Kigali ratification will finally allow U.S. heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration manufacturers to access international markets, resulting in massive economic benefits and job creation. As the original author of the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing Act with Senator Kennedy, I look forward to voting for ratification of the Kigali Amendment and urge all of my colleagues to join me.”ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF RATIFICATIONIt is estimated that implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act paired with the ratification of the Kigali Amendment will generate $38.8 billion in investment in the U.S. economy by 2027 while creating 150,000 direct and indirect American jobs and increasing U.S. heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration exports by at least 25 percent in that same period."
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-hearing-on-fhwa-nomination,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On September 14, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will hold a hearing to consider the nomination of Shailen P. Bhatt to be Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“Let me start by offering a few words on our especially well-qualified nominee. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Shailen since 2011 when he assumed the role of Secretary of the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT). “As Secretary of DelDOT, Shailen helped the department integrate performance management measures to improve accountability. He also embraced innovative practices to improve service and outcomes and helped to reduce the agency’s debt.“As a Delawarean, I am deeply grateful for Shailen’s four years of service, during which he delivered critical transportation projects up and down the First State. As chairman of this committee, I am delighted that he is again willing to serve our country—this time in the role of Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration.“Shailen is no stranger to this committee. He’s been called to testify twice previously for hearings: once in which the committee was considering innovative transportation mobility and a second time to testify about cybersecurity threats to our physical infrastructure. Throughout his interactions with our committee, he’s demonstrated a commitment to being responsive.“Shailen also brings a wealth of experience to this role. In addition to serving as a state-level transportation executive in Delaware and Colorado, he has served in the federal government as the Associate Administrator for Policy and Government Affairs at the Federal Highway Administration. In addition, he has experience at the local level and with transportation non-profit advocacy organizations, as well as in the private sector, in his role as Senior Vice President at AECOM, a multinational infrastructure consulting firm.“There is no doubt that this is why his nomination has been welcomed by numerous transportation stakeholder associations. They include the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which awarded Shailen their President’s Special Award of Merit in 2020 for his outstanding and exemplary contributions to the transportation field.“Outside of his qualifications and accolades, it’s important to note that Shailen’s nomination comes at a pivotal time for the Federal Highway Administration.“Last year, our committee led the way in drafting the surface transportation legislation that became the foundation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. As you will recall, this historic law provides more than $350 billion of investment in our nation’s highway programs. This includes a significant increase in funding for competitive grants to be administered by Federal Highway Administration.“As we know, last month, Congress also passed the Inflation Reduction Act, providing more than five billion dollars in funding for grants to improve equity and access and to reduce emissions from cement, steel, and other roadway construction materials. The Inflation Reduction Act also includes additional funding to facilitate timely environmental reviews of transportation projects, ensuring that the American people feel the benefits of these investments without delay.“From day one, this administration set a goal of partnering with Congress to rebuild and enhance critical infrastructure while improving climate and equity outcomes. Less than two years later, I’m proud to say we’ve accomplished that goal legislatively.“Now, the work of implementing these historic investments could not be more urgent. We know that far too many Americans continue to lack access to safe walkways and reliable public transportation. Traffic crashes and fatalities, which were already far too high, have risen sharply since the start of the pandemic more than two years ago.“And, as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, drastic changes are needed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. We must do so while also protecting the American people and our critical infrastructure from the effects of extreme heat, flooding, and other climate disasters.“Addressing these goals of safety, equity, and climate mitigation have been priorities in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I am confident that Shailen will be able to pick this ball up and run with it, as he has done time and time again.“I hope that the Senate will move expeditiously to confirm him for this important role. It has been left vacant for far too long. From our years of working together, I know Shailen to be hard-working, intelligent, fair, and open-minded. If confirmed, I’m confident that he will be committed to working with all fifty states and territories and every Senator to address the transportation priorities in their communities.”"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/chairman-carper,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On September 7, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to examine S.2736, the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports Act of 2021; S. 1475, the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act of 2021; S. 2661, the Smoke-Ready Communities Act of 2021; and S. 2421, the Smoke Planning and Research Act of 2021.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“Today’s hearing is our committee’s first since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act—the most significant investment to combat climate change in our nation’s history. I’d like to take a moment to discuss the significance of this law.“This historic law is going to deliver nearly $370 billion in climate and clean energy funding that will put our nation on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. This is a critical down payment on reaching President Biden’s goals of cutting emissions in half by the end of the decade and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. These investments will also significantly reduce emissions that impact our nation’s air quality, helping all Americans breathe a little easier.“But that’s not all. These historic climate investments are expected to lower energy costs for families and clean up pollution in disadvantaged communities as well.“In the Environment and Public Works Committee’s title alone, we invest more than $41 billion in climate and environmental justice. This includes new programs that tackle potent methane emissions in the oil and gas sector, leverage investments in projects that combat climate change, focus on environmental justice communities, and strengthen the Clean Air Act—one of our nation’s bedrock environmental laws that we will discuss here today.“In fact, we added seven new sections to the Clean Air Act as part of the Inflation Reduction Act—the most since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. These changes will enhance EPA’s ability to help us meet our climate and clean air goals while paying workers a fair wage to do it.“Passing this law could not have come at a more critical time. Just this week, heavy rainfall flooded streets and highways surrounding Providence, Rhode Island and temperatures in Sacramento, California broke all-time records amid a historic heatwave in the state. It’s quite clear that the climate crisis is here, and this extreme weather is impacting the air we breathe.“Currently, there are nearly 70 wildfires burning across our country. Along with the destruction that wildfires bring, the smoke they release contains particulate matter and other air pollutants that poses a threat to human health. Smoke doesn’t just threaten nearby communities but also downwind communities, as well. We know that smoke from wildfires in the West has reached as far as my state of Delaware at the end of what’s known as America’s tailpipe.“As these wildfires become more frequent and severe, so do the emissions they release. The health risks from exposure to this pollution are even greater for disadvantaged communities, including rural communities, which are often more vulnerable to wildfires and the resulting air pollution.“That’s why we made mitigating the climate and health risks from wildfires eligible for funding under our Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants program in the Inflation Reduction Act. This new program provides $3 billion in grants and technical assistance for mitigating environmental issues in disadvantaged communities.“That brings me to Senator Merkley’s two pieces of legislation we are considering today. The Smoke-Ready Communities Act would create a grant program to support communities in preparing for and responding to the potential health risks from harmful air emissions from wildfires.“The Smoke Planning and Research Act would support community planning and research activities on the effects of smoke emissions from wildfires on human health. I look forward to hearing more about these bills shortly from Senator Merkley and our witnesses.“Before we do, however, let me turn to another piece of legislation we are examining today: the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports (RPM) Act. This legislation seeks to clarify that racecars do not need to meet Clean Air Act emission requirements. I commend Senator Kelly for his leadership on this legislation, as well as our good friend, Senator Burr, the original sponsor of the bill.“We can all agree that racecar drivers shouldn’t face liability for the emissions of their cars that are used solely for organized competition. Fortunately, as EPA has informed us, the agency has never sought to assert that individual drivers are liable under the Clean Air Act.“But, as a $10 million civil penalty announced last week makes clear, bad actors are attempting to exploit the racing community to sell devices that tamper with pollution controls for on-road use. While I do have concerns that this legislation is a solution without a problem, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and seeing if we can reach an agreement on language to clarify this point without inadvertently creating new uncertainties or opportunities for litigation in the law.“Finally, the fourth bill we are considering today is Senator Thune’s legislation, the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act. This legislation would restrict EPA’s ability to issue permits under the Clean Air Act for emissions from certain agricultural activities, specifically related to biologic processes from livestock farming.“As we discuss this legislation today, it’s worth noting that EPA already refrains from issuing such permits. Why is that? One reason is the inclusion of language similar to Senator Thune’s bill in annual appropriations legislation for several years now. That means the decision on whether this restriction is necessary is up to Congress each year—not the EPA. Doing so provides Congress with important flexibility.”"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/carper-hosts-granholm-and-walsh-to-highlight-clean-hydrogen-in-delaware,"NEWARK, Del. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today convened a roundtable discussion at the Air Liquide Innovation Campus with U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), and Delaware clean energy leaders to discuss clean hydrogen technology.Hydrogen energy has the power to decarbonize electricity, transportation, and manufacturing industries. The clean hydrogen investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act – including those authored by Senator Carper – will have a major role in supporting President Biden’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis.“Clean hydrogen has the power to create jobs, strengthen our economy, and help save our planet. It’s an extraordinary opportunity for the nation – and we are leading the way in Delaware with the innovative hydrogen technology companies in our state,” Senator Carper said. “Clean hydrogen has a critical role to play in reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and developing a clean energy future, and I’m proud that provisions I authored in the Inflation Reduction Act will help make that a reality. There’s much vital work to be done to implement this landmark legislation and bolster our nation’s efforts to invest in clean hydrogen technology: Secretary Granholm and Secretary Walsh will continue to be essential leaders in that effort. I’m delighted to welcome them to Delaware to discuss this important issue for our state, our nation, and our planet.”“I’m glad to welcome Secretary Granholm and Secretary Walsh to Delaware to see the opportunities for union labor to power the energy transition. Delaware is proving that clean hydrogen production can be economically viable and create good-paying union jobs, not just for the next six months or six years, but for the next six decades and longer,” Senator Coons said. “Delaware’s unions, established energy producers, and clean technologies will play an essential role in our country’s green energy future.”“I’m thrilled to welcome Secretary Granholm and Secretary Walsh to the First State. It’s going to take all of us working together to secure a clean energy future,” said Representative Blunt Rochester. “That’s what today’s conversation is was all about – how the Biden-Harris administration, Congress, and businesses can come together to find innovative and sustainable ways to create clean energy sources and create good-paying jobs at the same time. As a member of both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Energy Subcommittee, I had the chance to be at the ground-level at so many of the clean energy provisions that were included in the historic Inflation Reduction Act – including some of the strongest clean energy tax credits that will protect labor and incentivize the domestic manufacturing of clean energy here in the United States. It was a pleasure to welcome Secretaries Granholm and Walsh to Delaware as we look to lead the way to a better and cleaner future – making us the First State in more ways than one.”“The Biden Administration recognizes the enormous potential of clean hydrogen as a job creator, a community revitalizer, and as an essential tool in our fight against climate change. We’re so grateful for Air Liquide and the entire Delaware delegation for their leadership in fostering innovation to advance our clean energy future,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. “Under President Biden, the economy has gained a historic number of jobs and companies are investing in America again,” said U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. “With the investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, thousands of good-paying manufacturing and clean energy jobs will expand in Delaware and across the country. As we implement these vital pieces of legislation and fight the climate crisis, the Department of Labor will continue to ensure on-the-job protections, worker empowerment, and equal access to new opportunities in growing industries.” “We are honored to help celebrate the monumental achievement of the Inflation Reduction Act. It is a clear signal that the U.S. is serious about clean energy technologies and the jobs they represent for American workers. Hydrogen will play an essential role in our nation’s clean energy transition, and with the right public policy in place, we are better positioned to deliver its benefits to our environment, economy, and workforce,” said Marcelo Fioranelli, CEO of Airgas and Air Liquide Group Vice President.A number of Delaware clean energy leaders attended the roundtable today: Marcelo Fioranelli, CEO of Airgas, Air Liquide Group Vice President, and member of the Executive Committee; Adam Peters, CEO of Air Liquide North America; Katie Ellet, President of Air Liquide Hydrogen Energy & Mobility, North America; David Martin, University of Delaware College of Engineering; Dora Cheatham, Executive Director of the Delaware Sustainable Chemistry Alliance; Erica Nemser, CEO of Compact Membrane Systems; Mark Newman, CEO of Chemours; Tyrone Jones, Senior Manager, Policy and Public Affairs, Bloom Energy; Wen K.

This groundbreaking law will do so much to better the lives of Delawareans and families across our nation. It will lower health care and energy costs, take historic steps to address climate change, create a fairer economy, and lower our nation’s deficit. The law will do all these things while creating millions of jobs and without increasing taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 annually. “The Inflation Reduction Act also represents a significant step forward for our nation, especially at a time when many Americans are struggling with rising costs and the effects of a changing climate. I proudly helped author many of the provisions in this historic law to address these challenges in a way that turns adversity into opportunity. That includes provisions to lower prescription drug costs and help rebuild the IRS to provide everyday Americans with better taxpayer services, as well as programs to reduce excess methane emissions, promote clean energy deployment, and help disadvantaged communities grappling with legacy pollution.  “Today, we celebrate a unique moment in American history and a renewed sense of hope for our future. Tomorrow, our work begins to implement this historic law in a way that benefits communities across our nation and leads to a brighter path ahead for all.”"

After continued delays for the past year and previous attempts to ask USPS how they plan to address these issues, the Congressional members are now seeking responses to their questions no later than August 16, 2022.“Last year, the USPS provided a briefing to staff outlining its plans to address staffing shortages to alleviate broader disruptions in service in the Delaware/Pennsylvania 2 Postal District. A year later, the USPS still faces critical workforce shortages, which continue to affect mail delivery service for households in Delaware and Pennsylvania,” the members wrote.They continued: “In recent months, our offices have received a sharp increase in constituent calls regarding disruptions to regular mail delivery, in some cases from households who have not received mail service for multiple days or even weeks at a time. Our staffs continue to engage the district management leadership about these growing complaints and continued delays but have yet to receive a proactive plan to address these deficiencies in the near-term.”The full text of the letter can be found below, or by clicking HERE.Dear Mr. Vaccarella:The COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense pressure on many industries and government services, including the United States Postal Service (USPS). Timely mail delivery service has suffered at a time when Americans are relying on the USPS more than ever. As you know, earlier this year, Congress passed the historic Postal Service Reform Act, which will help put the USPS on a sustainable financial foundation moving forward. That said, there remains much work to be done to ensure that the USPS can continue efficiently serving the American people, and we remain committed to working with our colleagues in Washington to look for additional avenues to assist the USPS in accomplishing its mission.Last year, the USPS provided a briefing to staff outlining its plans to address staffing shortages to alleviate broader disruptions in service in the Delaware/Pennsylvania 2 Postal District. A year later, the USPS still faces critical workforce shortages, which continue to affect mail delivery service for households in Delaware and Pennsylvania. In recent months, our offices have received a sharp increase in constituent calls regarding disruptions to regular mail delivery, in some cases from households who have not received mail service for multiple days or even weeks at a time. Our staffs continue to engage the district management leadership about these growing complaints and continued delays but have yet to receive a proactive plan to address these deficiencies in the near-term.The response from the USPS district leadership has largely been an acknowledgement of a depleted workforce. The regional leadership team presented the USPS’s plan to recruit and hire additional mail carriers to resolve the shortage of workers, while acknowledging that there is a very high rate of rejection for new applicants. This delay in onboarding new staff, coupled with unanticipated call-outs for sick leave and anticipated vacation leave, has left our postal region short-staffed.In response to concerns from households that have gone multiple days without mail delivery, the USPS regional leadership team has maintained that these households simply must not have any mail to be delivered, asserting that it is the USPS’s policy that routes that do not receive service on one day will be prioritized for service the following day. However, in separate conversations with our staffs, letter carriers have stated that it is not uncommon for mail to go undelivered for multiple days due to workforce shortages and the demanding schedules and routes that letter carriers are currently working.We understand that addressing the workforce shortage will require a long-term plan to both recruit new employees and retain current workers. However, we continue to hear daily from Delawareans and Pennsylvanians about service delays and interruptions, and the USPS’s long-term plans to address the workforce shortage do not address the immediate concerns these constituents are raising about delayed or absent mail delivery.We respectfully request that you respond to these questions no later than August 16, 2022:Given the complaints we receive from constituents about service disruptions, we are requesting a monthly meeting involving our staffs, the regional USPS Service District Manager, and appropriate USPS staff to review hiring and recruitment efforts, performance data, other pertinent items related to service delays, and the ways in which the USPS is working to make improvements. We look forward to working with you as we make strides to improve delivery service for Delawareans and Pennsylvanians.Thank you for your continued leadership as we work to move the USPS forward. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response.### "
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/carper-statement-on-senate-passage-of-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), today issued the below statement following the Senate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022:“Passing the Inflation Reduction Act represents a monumental step forward for our nation and our planet. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have helped craft and pass this landmark legislation to improve the lives of the American people and lead us to a brighter future.  “Amid unrelenting heat waves, floods, droughts, and other extreme weather, the Inflation Reduction Act represents the most significant climate legislation in history to pass the Senate. This legislation will unleash the potential of the American clean energy industry, drive down greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy costs for families, and create millions of good-paying jobs across our country.“As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I am especially proud of the groundbreaking climate and equity investments we make in this bill. That includes my program to reduce excess emissions from methane—a greenhouse gas that’s over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere—along with a first-ever block grant to help lift up communities that struggle with legacy pollution.“Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a proposal that I helped craft to rebuild the IRS so that the agency once again provides everyday Americans with better taxpayer services while also ensuring that the wealthiest Americans and highly profitable corporations pay their fair share.“I’m also glad that we include provisions that I helped author to lower the cost of prescription drugs, as well as measures to keep health insurance affordable, for families up and down the First State and across the nation. If enacted, the Inflation Reduction Act will save Delaware families an average of $1,000 annually on health insurance purchased through Affordable Care Act marketplaces—that’s savings going directly back into Delawareans’ pockets. It will also cap at $2,000 per year the cost that our seniors enrolled in the Medicare Part D drug program pay for prescription drugs.“This historic legislation, which is fully paid for and does not increase taxes on those making less than $400,000 annually, will make a lasting difference in the lives of millions—proof that we can do good and do well at the same time. I hope to see our colleagues in the House of Representatives quickly pass this legislation so that President Biden can sign it into law—the best is yet to come.”### "

Participants of the forum included Nemours Children’s leadership and families, U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Delaware Lieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long, Delaware Secretary of Health and Social Services Molly Magarik, community leaders, business leaders, and local and state officials.“Today’s Pediatric Mental Health Roundtables are an example of how we can come together on the critical issue of child and youth mental health, learn from one another, and develop real-world solutions,” said R. Lawrence Moss, MD, FACS, FAAP, President & CEO ofNemours Children’s Health. “We need to meet the youth mental health crisis with action and Nemours Children’s is working to increase access for Delaware’s children. We look forward to working with our state and federal leaders on policies and legislation that will help Nemoursand other providers create the healthiest generations of children.”“I had a great discussion at Nemours Children’s Health to learn how Nemours and Delaware’s Congressional delegation are working to address the mental and behavioral health needs of children across the state,” said HHS Secretary Becerra. “As part of the HHS National Tour to Strengthen Mental Health, I’ve had the chance to travel across the country and hear stories from people from all walks of life, and they all say the same thing: ‘we need help.’ The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized addressing our nation’s mental health crisis by making historic investments to support children’s behavioral health needs. And at the Department of Health and Human Services, we have made a Department-wide commitment to rethink and reimagine how we respond to and treat mental health in this country, and while we’ve made great strides, the work continues.”“I am so proud that Secretary Becerra was able to come to Delaware and see first-hand how we are implementing good public policy to meet the needs of children and families, especially when it comes to youth mental health,” said U.S. Senator Tom Carper. “I’ve been laser-focused on strengthening families since my days as Governor, and one way we are working on that today is to make much-needed investments in school-based mental health care services and telehealth. It’s important that we take down the barriers to services for these children and meet them right where they are.” “Looking out for Delawareans’ mental health in their earliest years can help our children do better in school, avoid bad outcomes, and lead richer and more fulfilling lives for decades to come,” said U.S. Senator Chris Coons. “I’m glad we could show Secretary Becerra the great work Nemours Children’s Health is doing to expand access to mental health care for kids in Wilmington, and I appreciated hearing what more we can do in Congress to improve and increase mental health care opportunities throughout the First State.” “Children in Delaware and across the country are experiencing unprecedented mental health challenges and have been since before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. “That’s why today’s roundtable on youth mental health is so critical – because it brought together federal and state officials, community partners, young people, and healthcare professionals to engage in meaningful dialogue about how we can best combat this crisis through all avenues available. As a member of the Health Subcommittee in the House, I’ve introduced four bipartisan bills to support our children by expanding capacity in pediatric behavioral and mental health services, funding community-based activities, supporting training and workforce innovations, and expanding telehealth access. I’m honored to have Secretary Becerra in Delaware for this timely conversation – one that will undoubtedly initiate innovative solutions and policies to support children in Delaware and across the nation experiencing mental health challenges.”   The forum consisted of a roundtable split into four panels to discuss four topics: mental and behavioral health challenges youth face, pediatric healthcare workforce shortages and infrastructure needs, school wellness, and innovative policy solutions. Additionally, Secretary Becerra highlighted the work of the Biden-Harris Administration on combating the mental health crisis – highlighting the mental and behavioral needs of children and teachers as they prepare to return to school in the fall. U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) all highlighted their work in Congress to address the crisis, including several key pieces of legislation that have been introduced or signed into law to improve access to telehealth services and school-based mental health care. Additional information on how HHS, the Delaware Congressional Delegation, and the State of Delaware, including Lt. Governor Bethany Hall-Long, State Representative Val Longhurst, and State Senator Sarah McBride, are working to combat the youth mental health crisis can be found here.  ###"

It is time to prioritize connectivity and the subsequent adoption of digital governance to shape regional norms and provide an alternative to restrictive policies promoted by our adversaries like China. As the U.S. is positioned to lead in the digital space, our resolution encourages American leadership on digital trade rules in order to secure 21st century opportunities for Hoosiers, small businesses, manufacturers, and domestic service industries.”In 2020, U.S. exports of digital services surpassed $520 billion, accounting for more than half of all U.S. services exports and generating a digital services trade surplus of $214 billion. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand and reliance on digital technologies and services, data flows, and e-commerce has only increased.The resolution calls for the U.S. to “negotiate strong, inclusive, forward-looking, and enforceable rules on digital trade and the digital economy with like-minded countries as part of a broader trade and economic strategy to address digital barriers and ensure that the United States values of democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech, human and worker rights, privacy, and a free and open internet are at the very core of the digital world and advanced technology.”In addition to Senators Carper and Young, the resolution was cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas). A companion, bipartisan resolution led by Representatives Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), and Ami Bera (D-Calif.) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. A copy of the resolution can be found here. ###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/carper-leads-senate-passage-of-water-resources-development-act-delivering-wins-for-delaware,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today led the Senate to pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2022  (WRDA 2022), bipartisan legislation that authorizes critical investments in the projects and programs of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in both Delaware and across the country. The legislation includes key provisions of the Shoreline Health Oversight, Restoration, Resilience, and Enhancement Act (SHORRE) Act introduced by Carper earlier this year.“Here in the First State, water is essential to our very way of life. Whether it’s investing in our beaches and coastal communities, or the waterways that deliver goods to the Port of Wilmington, this year’s Water Resources Development Act will benefit Delawareans up and down the state,” Senator Carper said. “This legislation will advance critical Army Corps projects that will improve people’s quality of life, create good-paying jobs, and strengthen our economy. I’m proud that the Senate came together to pass this bill with such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to seeing it advance to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.”Before the vote, Carper spoke on the Senate floor, urging his colleagues to support the legislation.

https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/carper-statement-on-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), today issued the following statement on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022:“As the senior Senator from the lowest-lying state in the country, I can think of no greater challenge of our time than the climate crisis. That’s why I believe the Inflation Reduction Act is an answer to our prayers for a better future for our planet.“In what would amount to the most ambitious climate bill ever enacted, this legislation would put our nation on track to nearly 40 percent emissions reduction by the end of the decade, unleash the potential of the American clean energy industry, and create good-paying jobs across the country. As EPW Chairman, I am especially proud that the bill includes significant climate and clean air investments that I worked on, specifically my program to capture potent excess methane emissions.“And, just as its name suggests, at its core, this legislation is about lowering costs and creating a fairer economy for American families. That means finally lowering drug prices that weigh on our nation’s seniors with fixed incomes, keeping health insurance affordable for millions of Americans, and making sure that corporations and the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.“To that end, I’m pleased that this legislation includes provisions I proudly helped author, including those that lower prescription drug costs and rebuild the IRS to prevent the wealthy from avoiding paying the taxes they owe while also providing everyday Americans with better taxpayer services. Together, we can lower costs and curb inflation for the American people, boost our economy, and save our planet in the process.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-hearing-on-carbon-capture,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday July 27, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to examine projects and policies supporting carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“We are here today to discuss the potential for carbon capture and storage to help us address climate change, create American jobs, and support economic growth. My sincere thanks to our ranking member, Senator Capito, for requesting this hearing.“As all of us know, this committee has a history of coming together to advance solutions to some of our biggest environmental and infrastructure challenges. I can think of no greater challenge that we face today — as a nation and as a planet — than the climate crisis.“This crisis is here now and we are increasingly feeling its impacts, especially in the form of extreme weather events like heat waves. Last weekend, roughly 85 million Americans from the southern Plains to the Northeast were under excessive heat warnings and heat advisories. Just yesterday, St. Louis broke its previous single-day record for rainfall from 1915. And today, much of the Pacific Northwest continues to experience record-breaking high temperatures, putting lives at risk.“It is worth noting that extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in our country. The 20 most costly extreme weather events last year alone resulted in the deaths of almost 700 people in our country, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“Extreme heat is also exacerbating drought conditions across much of the western United States, too, threatening critical sectors of our economy like never before. This includes the agricultural sector, which is important to all of our states including my state of Delaware.“According to the America Farm Bureau Federation, severe drought in the West forced 40 percent of farmers to sell off part of their cattle herds last year. This year, farmers in California have been forced to cut back production on produce such as cherries and almonds amidst the worst drought in 1,200 years.“The science is clear: climate change is here and these costly extreme weather events are continuing to worsen. If we fail to act now and support a clean energy transition, we do so at our own peril. That is why it is incumbent upon all of us to comprehensively address this issue, using all the tools in our toolbox.“Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) are critical tools in reducing the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Don’t just take my word for it. Analysis by the International Energy Agency, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other respected organizations say as much.“Last Congress — thanks to the leadership of our former chair, Senator Barrasso, along with Senators Capito, Whitehouse, myself, and others on this committee — we enacted the Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies (USE IT) Act. We worked together on passing this bipartisan legislation to lower the regulatory barriers preventing the widespread development and deployment of carbon capture.“Today, the Biden Administration’s ongoing implementation of the USE IT Act, coupled with new funding for carbon management projects and federal programs through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, continues to support CCUS research and deployment throughout the country. Just today, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) announced that it is seeking nominations to head two new task forces required by the USE IT Act. These task forces will provide input to inform the responsible deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage on federal lands, the Outer Continental Shelf, as well as non-federal lands.“When we talk about the responsible deployment of CCUS projects, it is important to emphasize the key role that equity must have. I have been pleased to see that CEQ’s guidance for carbon capture projects has reiterated the need to develop robust tribal consultation and stakeholder engagement plans, while also encouraging agencies to prioritize environmental justice in the development of best practices for CCUS efforts.“Doing so protects overburdened communities from the potential negative impacts of these projects and, ultimately, helps ensure that those most vulnerable to climate change benefit from our clean energy investments.“Investing in carbon capture is necessary if we are going to meet our climate goals and create economic opportunity in the process. Still, carbon capture alone is not enough to avoid a future plagued by deadly heat waves, devastating storms, and other extreme, climate-related weather events.“We must also facilitate the widespread deployment of wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen, and other forms of clean energy. Together, these technologies hold the key to saving our planet and creating good-paying jobs across our nation. I hope more of our colleagues engage in policy debates on how best to do so before it is too late.”"

After much consideration, I’m delighted to see him nominate such a thoughtful, accomplished person to be the Administrator of the FHWA.“Shailen Bhatt’s resume is nearly perfect for leading a transportation agency with such a critical infrastructure mission. In addition to serving as a presidential appointee at the U.S. Department of Transportation, he has also experience at the state level, leading the Colorado and Delaware Departments of Transportation. I have a long history of working with Shailen, and he is an outstanding choice. I’m confident that he won’t need any on-the-job training and look forward to doing my part to expeditiously advance his nomination and confirm him for this important role.”"

Sens. Carper and Coons spearheaded the project in the FY2022 Appropriations bill so that Challenge Program can provide increased job opportunities for underserved student workers. “For over two decades, the Challenge Program has provided at-risk youth in Delaware with invaluable skills to pursue educational and career opportunities, while bolstering the local workforce” said Carper. “I was proud to work with Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester to secure an $500,000 investment for this vital program that will empower our community, strengthen our workforce, and bring a new life to a part of Wilmington that has long been abandoned.” “I’m proud to support the work of Andrew McKnight and his team to provide opportunities to at-risk youth in Wilmington while also bolstering our state’s workforce with hands-on job training and skill development,” said Senator Coons. “I’ve seen firsthand the tremendous good that the Challenge Program does, and I’m excited to see how this additional funding will help support their efforts.”  “As the former Secretary of Labor in Delaware, I know the critical importance of getting our young people involved and invested in workforce training opportunities,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “I can think of few better programs in our state of Delaware than the Challenge Program. I’ve had the chance to visit with Andrew and his remarkable staff as they craft, not only beautiful furniture – but incredibly bright futures for young Delawareans. I was proud to champion last year’s appropriations bill with my colleagues Senators Carper & Coons to secure this critical funding which will help continue to expand opportunity for Delaware’s young people.”“We’re all proud of this,” said Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki. “The way we get judged is how we treat the folks in the neighborhood. Show them the kind of extraordinary possibilities that are available to them.”“I’d like to thank Senators Carper and Coons for coming down today as we celebrate these investments in this new facility,” said Andrew McKnight. “Workforce development requires real investment, and I’m proud to say our Department of Labor, members of Congress, and private sector understand this. This is of, by, and for our trainees, and I’m proud to recognize them today.”“The trainees that participate in the program, many of whom face multiple barriers, have made the affirmative decision to choose success. Trainees spend their time learning new skills and building buildings in some of our communities that suffer from the highest rates of violence. That is why I believe the Challenge program is more than the Construction Skills Program,” said DE Secretary of Labor Karryl Hubbard. “A sincere thank you to Senator Coons and Senator Carper and our other partners here today, and Andrew McKnight and your team for your commitment to developing our workforce and improving many lives.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-for-hearing-on-air-quality-monitoring-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday, July 13, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to examine S. 1345, the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act; S. 2476, the Environmental Justice Air Quality Monitoring Act of 2021; and S. ____, the Public Health Air Quality Act.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“We are here today to examine three bills that are intended to improve our nation’s antiquated air quality monitoring system and better protect Americans from air pollution.“Since enacting the Clean Air Act more than 50 years ago, our nation has made great progress in cleaning up the air we breathe without harming economic growth. Soot and smog pollution in the United States decreased by nearly 80 percent since 1970. Over that same period, our gross domestic product grew by more than 250 percent.“The benefits of clean air far outweigh the costs, and it’s not hard to understand why — clean air is good for human health, it’s good for our planet, and it’s good for our economy.“As my colleagues know, I often like to say that in everything I do, I know I can do better. The same is true with respect to reducing air pollution. Despite our successes, we still have far too many Americans who are negatively impacted by air pollution, especially those from low-income and historically disadvantaged communities. According to the EPA, nonwhite children are much more likely to die from air pollution than white children in the United States today.“Why are environmental justice communities at risk? One answer is proximity. More often than not, those in our nation’s environmental justice communities live near, or downwind of, facilities that emit harmful air pollution. These ‘fenceline communities,’ as they are known, bear the immediate impacts of exposure to harmful pollutants and the burden of the cumulative health effects that can arise from repeated, long-term exposure to air pollution.“But you don’t have to live near a source of air pollution to suffer its consequences. When emitted into the air, persistent air toxics like mercury, can fall into our waterways and bioaccumulate in fish over decades — long after a source may clean up or close down.“Many Americans today do not even know that they are being exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. There are real gaps in what the federal government knows, as well. “Today, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will testify on its troubling 2020 study on the state of our nation’s air monitoring systems. The report found that our air monitoring systems are woefully out of date and under-resourced. According to GAO’s findings, these out-of-date systems have left state air quality managers buying replacement parts on eBay. Why? The air monitoring technology that states are using is no longer being manufactured. We continue to rely on yesterday’s systems to address today’s problems.“GAO also found what we have long known: while the health threats posed by air toxics are well-documented, the data we have on where, when, and how they are released into our air are not well-documented.“This is unacceptable. We can and must do more to support federal, state, and local officials who are tasked with maintaining and improving our air monitoring systems.“That brings us to the legislation we are considering here today. For more than a decade now, I have worked alongside Senator Collins on the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act.“Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin that is especially dangerous to pregnant women and developing children. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 children born in our country each year are exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair neurological development.“In the last decade, we know that there have been more mercury consumption fish advisories in U.S. lakes and rivers than all other pollutants combined. However, we still have data gaps on where mercury persists in our environment.“Our legislation fills in the gaps by establishing a first-ever national mercury monitoring network to track long-term trends in mercury concentrations in communities and ecosystems across the country. Under our legislation, the public would have free access to the network’s findings — empowering communities with the information that they need to better protect themselves from mercury pollution. I am grateful that my partner on this effort, Senator Collins, is joining us today to speak more on our legislation, which she leads.“We will also examine Senator Duckworth’s and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt-Rochester’s legislation, the Public Health Air Quality Act, of which I am also a cosponsor. This legislation would upgrade and expand our nation’s outdated air monitoring network, which includes providing immediate monitoring for air toxics in fenceline communities experiencing high cancer rates and other health impacts.“Finally, we will review the Environmental Justice Air Quality Monitoring Act, sponsored by Senator Markey. This legislation would help ensure communities have access to relevant, local air quality information. Our current air monitoring systems do not always provide accurate, localized data, which makes it harder for communities to assess their exposure to certain toxics.“All three bills are intended to help Americans understand who is being exposed to air pollutants and who is not. These investments in our air quality monitoring systems are investments in healthier communities and a stronger economy — a win-win.“We look forward to hearing more from our colleagues and our witnesses on the benefits of these important pieces of legislation.”"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/carper-decries-judicial-injustice-for-d-c-residents,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del), senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), today called out the historic injustice facing residents of the District of Columbia in a hearing to consider three D.C. Superior Court nominees. “The average time it takes, Mr. Chairman and colleagues, to fill a vacancy on the D.C. Superior Court . . . is over three years. Over three years. If we’d done that in the state of Delaware we should have all been thrown out of office. It’s just appalling. Justice delayed is justice denied.… “The nearly 700,000 Americans who live in D.C. pay taxes; they serve our country—many times in uniform; they start businesses; they care for their neighbors, their friends and colleagues just like the rest of us. And yet, they are not treated like every other American from our 50 states.”Senator Carper’s full opening statement may be viewed HERE.Background:States and local governments typically make decisions over their own judicial systems. Yet, when it comes to the District, the federal government must confirm Washington, D.C.’s judges. Vacant seats on D.C. local courts are often open for years as a direct result of the Senate’s failure to act swiftly to confirm well-qualified judges. Senator Carper’s legislation to grant statehood to Washington, D.C., S. 51—the Washington, D.C. Admission Act—would fix this historic injustice. The legislation now boasts 45 cosponsors, a record number, and Carper has introduced statehood legislation every Congress since 2013. ### "
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/carper-statement-on-biden-harris-administration-s-proposed-transportation-emissions-reduction-framework,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today released the following statement on the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) proposed rule for states and metropolitan areas to track and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“Meeting our climate obligations requires focusing on the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. economy — the transportation sector. Congress created a national goal of making our roads, highways, and bridges environmentally sustainable a decade ago. At that time, we directed the U.S. Department of Transportation to establish a system for states to measure their performance towards that goal — an authority the department has rightly used to propose the establishment of greenhouse gas performance measures.“This proposal will fulfill the original congressional intent of performance management and improve the functioning of our highway programs. Importantly, it will help protect Americans from deadly extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters. I am glad to see the Biden-Harris Administration take this regulatory step.“In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we provided resources to ensure that states would develop their own plans for reducing transportation emissions. These programs will work together to help us achieve a more sustainable future on our highways.”"

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).In October, the Court will begin its new term with this challenge from conservative property owners seeking to strip essential protections from the Clean Water Act. The lawmakers contend in the amicus brief that the Court must uphold its current interpretation of the waters protected by the Clean Water Act, one of our nation’s most critical environmental laws.“Huge progress has been made in protecting this nation’s waters but polluting and filling still threaten to destroy wetlands and other waters that provide valuable services to fisheries, wildlife, recreation, health, and drinking water.  The resolution of this matter could have a profound impact on whether this progress is sustained. This brief highlights the express choices Congress made in the Act regarding what waters are protected, the roles Congress assigned, and the Act’s explicit criteria,” the lawmakers wrote.The lawmakers “…urge this Court to respect the policies in the statute Congress enacted and jurisdictional boundaries that have governed, regardless of party affiliation in the White House or control of Congress, for almost fifty years.”   Full text of the lawmakers’ amicus brief can be found here.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-hearing-on-coastal-restoration-and-habitat-conservation-legislation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday June 15, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to examine S. 2194, the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act of 2021; S. ____, the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2022; S. 3069, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act; and S. 3767, the Delaware River Basin Conservation Reauthorization Act.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“Today, our committee will examine four pieces of legislation. Collectively, they would enhance the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore and conserve coastal habitats — for the benefit of wildlife and people alike.“The critical work implicated in each of these bills could not be more timely. According to the United Nations, we are amid an unprecedented global biodiversity decline, and extreme weather events are already causing accelerated loss of coastal habitats, imperiling vulnerable species.“But that’s not all. These coastal areas that many species call home also protect coastal communities — homes, businesses, and infrastructure alike. So, by investing in coastal habitats, we are investing in local economies as well.“One of the bills we are examining today — the Coastal Habitat Conservation Act — would codify the Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal Program. This voluntary program provides technical and financial assistance to states, tribes, landowners, and other partners to support habitat conservation in coastal watersheds. Since 2010, this program has enabled 66 projects in Delaware alone. And, for every federal dollar invested, partners have contributed seven dollars — an impressive leveraging ratio.“I want to thank both Senators Cardin and Graham for their leadership on this legislation, and Senator Cardin in particular, for encouraging us to hold today’s hearing.“We will also consider legislation today pertaining to two regional Fish and Wildlife Service programs. The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act would reauthorize the Service’s Great Lakes program. This program has provided funding for research and restoration projects in the Great Lakes since 1998. The Delaware River Basin Conservation Reauthorization Act would reauthorize the Service’s Delaware River Basin program. This program has successfully brought federal, state, and local governments together with regional partners to identify, prioritize, and implement restoration activities within the Basin.”I would like to note that the Fish and Wildlife Service has done an exceptional job of getting this program off the ground since Congress authorized it in 2016. Recent grants from the Service are already being put to work in Delaware, enhancing pollinator habitats, improving fish passage, and restoring our wetlands.“Last, but not least, today we will consider draft legislation that amends the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and codifies maps to add units to the Coastal Barrier Resources System. This program protects sensitive habitats and in doing so, saves taxpayer dollars by restricting the use of federal funding in those areas. The bipartisan Coastal Barrier Resources Act became law in 1982, in no small part due to the hard work of former Congressman Tom Evans from Delaware. I am glad to carry on his important work.“As I mentioned earlier, the benefits of coastal restoration are well documented. After Hurricane Sandy, the Fish and Wildlife Service received funding for large-scale restoration activities to mitigate habitat damage and improve resiliency. The Service spent some of this much-needed funding to restore Fowler Beach in Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge. As a result of that project’s completion more than six years ago, record numbers of piping plovers are nesting on the beach.“And the community resiliency benefits are just as impressive. The homes and infrastructure surrounding Fowler Beach — which had flooded in nearly every major rain event in the years before the completion of this project — no longer flood. Now, that is a real win-win.“In addition to advancing the legislation before our committee today, I believe we should also undertake these types of large-scale restoration activities ahead of the next storm, instead of in response to it. Doing so would make our coastal communities even more resilient and better able to withstand extreme weather events in the face of a changing climate.“Just as our committee has agreed that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to our goals for conserving species, the same is true of building resiliency in our nation’s coastal communities.“The Fish and Wildlife Service has demonstrated that we can, and should, tackle these important goals together. This is evident from their successful work in the First State and many other states as well.“What we have experienced in Delaware is the rule, not the exception. When we restore and conserve habitat, we also protect communities and support local economies. I hope our colleagues and our esteemed panel of witnesses will highlight their similar experiences, and we look forward to hearing from all of you.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-hearing-on-nrc-nominations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday June 8, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to consider the nominations of Annie Caputo and Brad Crowell to be Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“We are here today to consider two important nominations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission — Annie Caputo and Bradley Crowell. Let me start by welcoming each of them, as well as Senator Cortez Masto, before our Committee. We look forward to hearing their testimony.“Before we do though, let me say a few words about each nominee, as well as about the important role a well-functioning NRC has in ensuring we continue to safely and reliably power our nation into the future.“As a nation and a planet, we are at a critical point when it comes to reducing our addiction to fossil fuels. Just last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that Earth’s atmosphere surpassed another historic, alarming milestone. The carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is now more than 50 percent higher than in pre-industrial times — a level not seen in millions of years. Yes, that’s millions with an ‘m.’ We should find these figures alarming, especially as scientists continue to warn of the future that awaits us if we fail to act.“The good news? The technology required to transition our economy towards a clean energy future already exists. That includes nuclear power, which currently provides over half of all carbon-free energy in the United States.“In addition to being our largest source of reliable, clean energy, nuclear energy also generates economic opportunities across our country. As I said during our oversight hearing in December with Chairman Hanson, Commissioner Baran, and Commissioner Wright, nuclear energy is key to reaching our climate goals economywide. The NRC is critical to ensuring that our nuclear energy is both safe and reliable.“For the NRC to effectively maintain the safety of our nation’s nuclear facilities and also prepare for the future, we must ensure that the agency has the resources that it needs. That includes having the right leadership in place. Currently, two of the five seats on the Commission are vacant.“Fortunately, in Annie Caputo and Brad Crowell, President Biden has nominated two well-qualified individuals to serve on the NRC. From my conversations with each nominee, I believe they both possess the knowledge and experience to successfully and faithfully serve the American people in these roles.“Ms. Caputo and Mr. Crowell have strong professional backgrounds. Both of them have worked for members of this Committee who are passionately engaged on nuclear issues. Importantly, both of them have also demonstrated an ability to work collaboratively with members of both parties and with a wide range of stakeholders to achieve progress and get results.“Ms. Caputo recently served as an NRC Commissioner for a three-year term that expired in June of last year. Since that time, Ms. Caputo served as a professional staff member on the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, and she has consulted with the Idaho National Laboratory regarding international collaboration on advanced nuclear reactors.“Prior to her term at the NRC, Ms. Caputo served as a professional staff member and senior policy advisor for this Committee under the leadership of former-Chairmen Inhofe and Barrasso. With the wide array of issues before the Commission, I believe that the NRC will benefit from Ms. Caputo’s broad knowledge and expertise.“Mr. Crowell, meanwhile, has over twenty years of experience at the state and federal levels of government working on clean energy and nuclear power. He served as the Director of Nevada’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources under both Republican and Democratic governors. His experience also includes time at the Department of Energy handling congressional affairs during the Obama Administration and serving as a policy advisor for Senator Whitehouse on our Committee.“Mr. Crowell understands the importance of engagement among the federal government and states, tribal and local governments, and the public — a key part of effectively communicating the benefits of nuclear energy to those who might otherwise be skeptical.“As I mentioned, a full slate of commissioners will help the NRC carry out its responsibilities more effectively and efficiently. That is why I hope to work with our Ranking Member, Senator Capito, to move both nominees through the confirmation process together and do so expeditiously.”"
https://bit.ly/3ajQ1DS,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons, along with U.S. Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (all D-Del.), today issued the following joint statement on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) finalized Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2020, 2021, and 2022 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. “We know many Delaware families and businesses are feeling the effects of several global crises, especially in higher prices at the pump. Given this historic uncertainty, we are encouraged by EPA’s decision to adhere to its previously proposed renewable fuel volume target for 2020. Still, we are disappointed the agency failed to adjust its 2022 volume obligations despite good reasons to do so. As we warned earlier this year, the 2022 levels do not reflect what is likely to occur in the fuels marketplace this year.“Volatile prices for complying with the renewable fuels standard have already harmed our nation’s independent refineries this year. Those prices continue to trend toward record-breaking highs, squeezing our fuel producers as they look to comply with the program and creating uncertainty for the skilled union workers that are the backbone of our community and our regional economy. While we are disappointed with the final renewable fuels volume numbers released today, we are committed to working with organized labor, with our refinery, with the biofuel and farming communities, with our colleagues in Congress, and the Biden administration to find solutions to the challenges facing the RFS program. We remain committed to finding a path that not only achieves a quick transition toward more sustainable fuels, but also provides certainty and predictability for our refineries, our biofuel producers, and our Delaware workers and farmers.”"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/carper-applauds-epa-s-proposed-rule-to-safeguard-state-territory-and-tribal-water-resources,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today lauded the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to update the regulatory requirements for water quality certification under Clean Water Act Section 401. This proposed rule would grant stronger control to states, territories, and Tribes to preserve and protect their water resources.“The Clean Water Act quite clearly gives states, territories, and Tribes the ability to protect their water quality when projects are permitted or licensed,” said Senator Carper. “I commend Administrator Regan and the technical experts at EPA for taking a prudent step to help these governments act to address local water quality.” ###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/carper-dnrec-eda-announce-3-2-million-grant-for-state-parks,"LEWES, Del. — Today, U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, joined Delaware Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) Secretary Shawn M. Garvin and the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Regional Director Linda Cruz Carnall to announce $3.2 million from the EDA to DNREC’s Division of State Parks.This project will support campground improvements at Cape Henlopen, Delaware Seashore, Killens Pond, Lums Pond, and Trap Pond State Parks, bringing new visitors to Delaware, its businesses, and local attractions. This project is funded under EDA’s $240 million competitive American Rescue Plan Travel, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation program, and will be matched with $803,100 in local funds.“Delaware is proud to have the nation’s best state parks. With this investment, they will just keep getting better,” said Governor John Carney. “This American Rescue Plan grant will help DNREC provide needed and sought-after enhancements to Delaware’s five state park campgrounds. I want to thank the U.S. Economic Development Administration for this investment, the Biden Administration and our Federal Delegation for their continued support of our nationally recognized state parks.”“Delaware’s state park system is a vital contributor to our state’s $3 billion tourism economy,” said Senator Carper. “The First State may be small, but the appeal of our parks is far from it: Delaware’s parks attract almost six million guests a year! I’m delighted to welcome this investment from the Economic Development Administration that will create jobs, boost our economy, and help ensure that park visitors can come enjoy Delaware and make lifelong memories here.”“Delawareans should be proud of our incredible state park system, a source of tourism and jobs for communities across the First State,” said Senator Coons. “Thanks to President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, and my colleagues Senator Carper and Representative Blunt Rochester, this grant will help ensure that future generations are able to enjoy the natural wonder of Delaware for years to come and that local economies and businesses across the state will thrive.”“Delaware’s State Parks are a vital component of both Delaware’s vibrant tourism sector and local economy,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “With these federal dollars, the First State will be able to make investments to its beautiful State Parks so that Delawareans and travelers from across the country can continue to enjoy them today and for years to come. I’m glad to have worked alongside Senator Carper and Senator Coons to secure this critical funding for Delaware, and I look forward to seeing these enhancements come to fruition.”After breaking attendance records in 2021, Delaware State Parks is on pace to set another visitor attendance mark by the end of 2022. Visitation to Delaware State Parks has been increasing for years, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2011, camping nights reserved within Delaware’s state parks have increased by 124 percent. In 2011, the parks saw 67,000 nights booked and, 10 years later, that number grew to more than 150,000 nights in 2021.There are currently 826 campsites and 47 cabins/cottages or yurts at Delaware State Parks’ campgrounds. In 2021, campers at these state parks came from 49 states. Post-camping surveys show visitors to our state parks want to see upgrades to bathrooms and showers, RV hookups, improved campground stores and retail offerings, connectivity, larger campsites, and additional camping opportunities.In 2021, the division released its Strategic Plan as a framework and goal through 2026. While creating this plan, the division conducted a thorough evaluation of its five campgrounds to incorporate best practices and industry standards in planning for future expansion and improved campground amenities.The $3.2 million EDA grant will fund planning through the construction design, and help the Division of Parks and Recreation to fulfill several campground plans and needs at its five state park campgrounds, including:Sixty-five percent of the Division of Parks and Recreation’s annual revenue is user-generated. A recent economic impact study showed that for every dollar spent by out-of-state visitors in Delaware State Parks, 92 cents is returned to the Delaware economy. For every General Fund operating dollar invested in Delaware State Parks, $40.02 in economic activity is added to the state. If not for Delaware’s state parks, each household in Delaware would need to contribute $150 extra in state and local taxes. ###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/carper-welcomes-launch-of-dot-reconnecting-communities-pilot-program,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today applauded the launch of the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Reconnecting Communities pilot program. The $1 billion program, written by Carper in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help restore economic opportunities and reconnect communities that have been cut off and divided by transportation infrastructure. “Our nation’s highways, roads, and bridges should connect communities, facilitate the transport goods and essential services, and unlock economic opportunities. But we know that throughout our history, our transportation infrastructure has often been built in ways that do the exact opposite, cutting off neighborhoods from prosperity and dividing communities. I wrote the Reconnecting Communities pilot program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address this unjust legacy of our past infrastructure investments. Now, I’m pleased to see the Department of Transportation is getting this program off the ground. It’s a real, tangible way that we can start to right the wrongs of our past and ensure a brighter future for all Americans.”"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/carper-statement-on-supreme-court-s-west-virginia-v-epa-ruling,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement on the Supreme Court’s decision in the case of West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which called into question EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector and other industrial sectors under the Clean Air Act.“As someone who voted for the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, I strongly disagree with the Court’s decision today. Continuing the troubling precedents in recent days, once again ideology trumps reality as this extreme court chips away at EPA’s ability to address climate change. While EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other sources under the Clean Air Act remains the law, the Court’s decision is way out of step with reality. This ruling hampers our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a rapid and cost-effective way, which is bad for our economy and planet.“While utilities have exceeded the emissions reductions goals called for under the Clean Power Plan, we must do more. The Court seeks to restrict EPA from using flexible and low-cost approaches to address greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Still, I remain resolute in my commitment to passing legislation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions across our economy. Our future depends on it.”BackgroundOn January 25, 2022, Senator Carper led 192 congressional Democrats—29 in the Senate and 163 in the House—in submitting an amicus brief for this case. The brief supported EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to protect the public from harmful pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and address the climate crisis. "

Justice Montgomery-Reeves has served on two of Delaware’s highly-regarded courts—the Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court—making her well-qualified for this appointment,” said Senators Carper and Coons. “She has the heart of a public servant, and has earned a reputation as a consensus builder on the bench. We applaud President Biden’s following through on his commitment to nominate a diverse group of Judges to serve on our federal courts, including Justice Montgomery-Reeves, and we look forward to a swift hearing and confirmation process.”Justice Tamika Montgomery-Reeves is the first African-American woman to serve on the Delaware Supreme Court, where she has served as an Associate Justice since January of 2020. Prior to that, Justice Montgomery-Reeves served as Vice Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery from November 2015 to November 2019. Before her public service, she was a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Wilmington, Delaware.Justice Montgomery-Reeves graduated from the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College at the University of Mississippi in 2003. She received her law degree in 2006 from the University of Georgia School of Law. Justice Montgomery-Reeves served as a law clerk for Chancellor William B.

And at a time when too many Delaware families are struggling to find affordable housing, Habitat’s work couldn’t be more important,” said Carper. “I’m proud to announce more than a million dollars in funding today to help build more affordable homes for families in Delaware who need them. My thanks to Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester for joining with me to help secure this funding, and to Kevin Smith with Habitat for his dedicated service to the First State.”“Delaware and our country are facing a crisis when it comes to affordable housing,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “Especially here in Delaware, the number of affordable units is simply too low. We’re fortunate to have organizations like Habitat for Humanity making a real difference when it comes to building units. That’s why I was proud to work with Senators Carper & Coons to help secure federal funding to assist Habitat’s mission of ensuring that every Delawarean has an affordable place to call home. We still have much more work to do – but this project is an important step in the right direction.”  “Given the enormous challenges of providing affordable housing, it cannot be understated what a tremendous contribution our elected officials from Delaware have made through the appropriations process,” said Executive Director Smith. “On behalf of our board of directors, staff and the future 17 new homeowners who will become first time homeowners, we say thank you to Senators Carper and Coons, and Representative Blunt Rochester for your continued leadership in Congress.”Senators Carper and Coons, along with Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester worked together to secure this funding through the omnibus appropriations bill passed earlier this year in March. Delaware’s congressional delegation has secured nearly $100 million for First State communities and projects up and down the state.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/carper-condemns-scotus-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.) today released the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning 50 years of precedent and the Constitutional right to an abortion as established under Roe v. Wade:“Today, the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, and upended the lives of millions of American women. It is a cruel and wrong decision—very likely the worst Supreme Court decision of my lifetime. “For nearly 50 years, women have had the constitutional right to privacy to make their own personal decisions about their health and future without a politician or an unelected judge in their bedroom or doctor’s office—no longer. The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision takes away this bedrock constitutional right for women, and turns back the clock to a bygone era when unsafe and deadly abortions were commonplace. This radical decision also jeopardizes other constitutional rights that hinge upon Roe v. Wade—including access to contraception and marriage equality.“The vast majority of the American public, myself included, continues to support safe and legal access to abortion, and thankfully many states, including Delaware, have laws that will continue to entrust women to make their own health decisions. However, many states have already enacted—or will enact—radical abortion bans that will force victims of rape and incest to carry their pregnancies to term. Many of these state laws do not allow for exceptions to save a woman’s life during a complicated pregnancy. This is why Roe v. Wade has been so foundational for so long—because a woman in Delaware and a woman in Oklahoma deserve equal protection under the law. And this is why millions of women—including many whom are pregnant—are terrified right now, and understandably so.“This is a dark day for our country and our Constitution. In the face of what will surely go down in constitutional infamy for the harm it does to the Americans it ought to serve, I’m committed to doing everything I can to protect women from the pain that this decision will cause.”  ### "

The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will strengthen background checks, implement red flag laws, and make our schools safer. This legislation reflects ideas that the American public overwhelmingly supports, and most importantly, this legislation will save lives. “I’m also pleased that this package includes bipartisan legislation that I’ve worked on for months with my Republican colleagues, Senators Cornyn and Cassidy, to increase access to telehealth and school-based mental health care. Ensuring that schools can provide critical health services for students has been a priority of mine since I served as governor of Delaware, and I’m delighted to have played a part in expanding and enhancing these services nationwide.“While this bill doesn’t include everything we need to end the epidemic of gun violence, it’s a good start. However, at the very same time that the Senate made progress today, the Supreme Court handed down a decision that will make it harder for states to implement commonsense gun reforms and restrictions. This decision is a historic failure, and makes it clear that our work is far from over. As we continue to work together to address the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our nation, I’m proud of the bipartisan work my colleagues and I achieved today, and hope this legislation makes its way to President Biden’s desk in short order.”###"

Commonsense reforms to our nation’s gun laws are supported by an overwhelming majority of the American public — including gun owners — and this deal is an important first step after decades of inaction on this front. By strengthening the criminal background check system and making it harder for dangerous individuals to possess dangerous weapons, this bipartisan legislation will save lives.“In addition, I’m grateful that this package includes bipartisan legislation that I’ve worked on for months with two of my Senate colleagues across the aisle — John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) — in order to make much needed investments in telehealth and school-based mental health care services. Ensuring that schools can provide critical services for students, like access to mental health care at school-based wellness centers, has been a priority of mine since I served as governor of Delaware and chairman of the National Governors Association. Now, as a member of the U.S. Senate, I’m delighted to join with two of my Republican colleagues in expanding and enhancing these services nationwide.“While this bill doesn’t include everything we need to end the epidemic of gun violence, it’s a good start. Simply put, we cannot let this moment pass us by. And going forward, we must continue to work together in the days to come to ensure that this bill makes it to President Biden’s desk expeditiously, and then keep working together to further reduce gun violence and make our schools and communities safer still.”###"

Today’s discussion draft comes as a part of the Finance Committee’s ongoing work to improve mental health care across the nation, which has included a public call for comments and four hearings to help develop these initiatives.“After two years of a life-altering pandemic and worsening youth mental health crisis, it’s more important than ever to come together and ease the burden for kids across the country,” said Carper. “Our draft will make it easier for schools to provide vital mental health services to students on campus and more manageable for states to face head on an impending mental health crisis. Our nation’s children need someone to stand up for them and I’m proud that, alongside this bipartisan group, we’re doing just that.” “There has been a massive rise in youth mental health issues in the wake of the pandemic,” said Dr. Cassidy. “This bill ensures children and teens have access to quality care to have their needs addressed.”“Young people across the country are facing unprecedented challenges, and it’s taking a devastating toll on their mental health,” said Wyden. “By strengthening access to mental health care through Medicaid — which covers half of all children in this country — the Finance Committee can make a real difference in helping kids get the care they need, whether that’s at home, in the doctor’s office, or at school. I’m proud that the committee was able to come together on a bipartisan basis to craft these policies, and I look forward to continuing that work in the coming weeks and months.”“Although the pandemic is subsiding and our return to normalcy may be imminent, we cannot ignore the lasting effects of the past two years on the social and emotional well-being of children, whose needs require carefully tailored solutions,” said Crapo. “We should do all that we can, within the committee’s jurisdiction, to increase access to high-quality mental health services, and reduce the causes of delayed and forgone treatment.”The discussion draft includes policies that would: Earlier this year, the Finance Committee announced five areas of focus for addressing shortfalls in mental health care: workforce, care integration, mental health parity, telehealth, and youth.The full text of the discussion draft can be found here.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-finance-trade-subcommittee-hearing-on-supply-chain-resiliency,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— On Wednesday, June 15, 2022, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness held a hearing to discuss supply chain resiliency.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“Good afternoon. It’s my pleasure to call today’s hearing before the Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness to order.“Thank you to our witnesses for joining us to testify today, and a special thank you to our Ranking Member, Senator Cornyn, and his team for working with our staff and with me to plan this hearing which is focused on supply chain challenges, an issue that continues to frustrate folks across our country and around the globe. “Today’s hearing will offer a chance to examine why supply chain bottlenecks have developed since the onset of the pandemic, and to look at what kind of policies might improve the long-term resiliency and security of our supply chains to prevent these types of shortages in the future.“Many folks have probably heard about supply chain problems and know that supply chains have something to do with keeping our economy moving. But I’m sure many folks are left wondering: what do we mean exactly when we say ‘supply chains?’“Here’s what we’re talking about: supply chains include every step of the process to manufacture a product and move it from point A to point B — sometimes halfway across town or halfway across the globe — to get goods from a person’s wish list to their doorstep.“One of the reasons why I’m eager to address these issues at today’s hearing is because Americans are eager to address these issues. In 2022, the effects of supply chain challenges aren’t some distant policy issue to folks at home. Americans are seeing it play out in empty shelves at their local grocery store that once held baby formula, in gifts delayed and delivered weeks after a birthday has passed, or in new cars and technology that they’ve saved up for years to buy but can’t find on the market.“With Father’s Day coming up this weekend, I’m reminded about how just last month, I went to my local Rite Aid pharmacy to pick up a Mother’s Day card for my wife Martha. At a store where we’ve shopped for years—with a huge selection of anniversary cards, birthday cards, holiday cards, you name it—I walked up and found an entire Mother’s Day card section empty. I found an employee and asked what was going on, and she said that this year, Mother’s Day cards never even made it to the store. “This is just one example of the supply challenges happening all across our country. And Americans—and this Committee—want to know how we can get back on track. So, today, we will explore how we got to this point, and what we can do to ensure that we’re better prepared in the future. I’ve long believed that one of the jobs of policymakers is to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation so we may enjoy economic growth—and one key to maintaining that nurturing environment is improving the dependability of our supply chains.“And while we know that the tremendous supply chain backlogs that we are seeing today come largely from the economic shock of the pandemic, many systemic vulnerabilities existed long before COVID. Fundamental weaknesses in our global logistics systems are the result of a decades-long focus on supply chain efficiencies, ‘just in time’ manufacturing, and a reliance on foreign adversaries for a wide array of goods. The result is a system so brittle and fragile that it cracked under the pressure of the worst pandemic we’ve endured in over 100 years. “But in adversity lies opportunity, and these challenges present a great opportunity for us to re-think how we move goods across the globe and create a system that better serves the American people. That starts with investing in our own critical infrastructure. And I’m proud — as I’m sure every member of this committee is — that we have already taken steps through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to—among other things—improve the efficiency of our ports and make our roads and bridges safer.“However, it’s clear that infrastructure investments are only one piece of the puzzle. Another piece is expanding domestic investment in the technologies we rely upon — from semiconductors to renewable energy products — so that we don’t find ourselves over-relying on a foreign adversary or jeopardizing our national security for the sake of a supply chain.“Through these investments, we can create jobs and support American manufacturing—a win-win. A good place to start is the ‘China competition’ legislation currently being reconciled between the two chambers of Congress. And I commend our friend and Ranking Member, Senator Cornyn, for his leadership in supporting chips funding through that process.“And while domestic investment is a key part of shoring up our supply chains for years to come, we also have to focus on a fundamental principle central to the supply chain discussion: working together with our global partners. And as leaders of this Subcommittee, Senator Cornyn and I have repeatedly called for greater U.S. economic engagement and leadership across the globe, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. “By reaching out to our allies across the globe and bringing more nations into a shared economic framework, we can improve the security and resiliency of our supply chains—leading to a wider range of products and lower costs for American consumers. That’s part of the reason why I was happy to see President Biden announce the start of an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework — to bring more good-faith trading partners into a stronger, fairer global economy, and create even more diverse, resilient supply chains.“Ultimately, building secure and flexible supply chains will require both economic cooperation with our allies across the globe and more strategic investments in critical industries and workers here at home. So, today we look forward to hearing from our witnesses with respect to their insight on solutions to these challenges — so that the next generation of American families won’t have to worry about empty shelves and higher prices. We’ll be ready for what’s to come.” ###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/carper-statement-on-revelations-from-first-public-january-6th-hearing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.) released the following statement after the first public hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol:“The Big Lie — Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated and false claim that the 2020 election was stolen — inspired the January 6th attack that lead to nine Americans dead, 140 police officers injured, and ultimately to the failed attempts to hang the Republican Vice President of the United States and overturn the 2020 election. Last night, the bipartisan House Select Committee began to shed new light on the attack on the Capitol and the conspiracy to overturn a free and fair election in the United States. I am grateful to my Republican and Democratic colleagues for working together for more than a year to provide a clear picture of that dark day to the American people. “In the weeks to come, these hearings will also prove that the January 6th attack was not merely a dark day or some random event. This was a dark chapter in our nation’s history that began long before the Proud Boys and their supporters breached the Capitol. Donald Trump, for the first time in our nation’s history, refused to peacefully transfer power. Trump’s Big Lie was a call to action on January 6th for white supremacists and other extremists. The plotting, planning, and execution of an attempted coup took place, and soon we will learn the role of the former president and his closest advisors.“Unfortunately, instead of denouncing the worst attack on our Constitution since the Civil War, too many political leaders and candidates are pledging allegiance to the Big Lie, attempting to ingratiate themselves to a disgraced former president instead of telling the truth. It is disturbing that the same deranged rhetoric that led to January 6th continues online, in right-wing media, and on the campaign trail. Last night’s hearing should serve as a stark reminder that as long as the Big Lie remains in our politics, the threats to our Constitution and our next election will also remain.“Over 800 Americans have been charged with crimes related to the January 6th attack, ranging from the leaders of a white supremacist hate group earlier this week to a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan just yesterday. We must continue to seek accountability for any individual who violated our laws and our Constitution. In the weeks to come, the bipartisan House Select Committee will continue to seek the truth and present more evidence to the American public. I encourage the Committee to continue seeking the truth, no matter where it leads.” ###"

We must continue to fight and recommit our values until true equality is shared by all.”“Pride is love, Pride is equality, and Pride is diversity. I’m proud to join my colleagues to celebrate Pride Month and affirm that the Senate stands with the LGBTQ+ community,” said Coons. “After a year of attacks on the LGBTQ+ kids and families in states across the country, it’s more important than ever that the Senate move forward here in Congress by enacting the Equality Act and enshrining true equality for our LGBTQ+ friends and neighbors into law.”In 2021, Senate Democrats re-introduced the Equality Act, legislation to ensure civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Equality Act would unequivocally ban discrimination in a host of areas, including employment, housing, public accommodations, jury service, access to credit, federal funding assistance, and education. The senators’ resolution highlights the contributions LGBTQ individuals have made to American society, notes several major milestones in the fight for equal treatment of LGBTQ Americans, and resolves to continue efforts to achieve full equality for LGBTQ individuals. The resolution also recognizes how the U.S. Supreme Court’s pending decision to overturn Roe v. Wade could potentially undermine and erode other constitutional rights also grounded in privacy, including the right for same-sex couples to marry or engage in consensual relationships without the risk of criminal prosecution. This year’s pride resolution has been endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).Full text of the resolution is available here. ##"

A roundabout will also be installed at the intersection of South Bedford Street/Arrow Safety Road/Park Avenue.The realignment of Park Avenue will not only address existing safety and traffic issues but allow for the additional 500-foot expansion of the Delaware Coastal Airport main runway, provide access to the Sussex County Industrial Park, and serve as a Georgetown bypass for trucks and traffic moving through the central part of the county. “This is a day over 20 years in the making,” said U.S. Senator Tom Carper. “The investments, most of which are from federal funding, to realign Truck Route 9 and Park Avenue will not only enhance safety for cars and trucks but will also facilitate economic development projects like extending the runway at Delaware Coastal Airport.”“We are making needed infrastructure investments in Sussex County, and projects such as this, the nearly completed Georgetown East Gateway project and Route 24 improvements are all intended to improve safety as Sussex County continues to grow,” said Secretary of Transportation Nicole Majeski.State Rep. Ruth Briggs King (R-Georgetown/Long Neck) stated, “This project is one that will serve our community very well. In addition to the safety improvements that will be made to the intersection of Route 113 and Arrow Safety Road, the Truck Route 9 bypass relocation will also be a welcome change for commuters and for those nearby residential communities that had been previously impacted by truck traffic traveling through their neighborhoods. Thank you to DelDOT for continuing to make this project a top priority for improving vehicle safety throughout the area.”The $25.5 million phase 1 project is expected to be completed in early 2024 with phase construction beginning later that year.###"

The funding for the renovations will pave the way for potentially using the home for a historical museum in the future. The park and house are owned and maintained by Kent County Levy Court, and the house is currently in need of renovations to allow for general public access.Carper, Coons, and Blunt Rochester secured this funding through the omnibus appropriations bill passed in March. Delaware’s congressional delegation has secured nearly $100 million for Delaware communities and projects up and down the state.Brecknock Park sits on 86-acres and is an historic farm and millpond site adjacent to the Isaac Branch stream corridor. It was given to Kent County by the estate of Elizabeth Howell Goggin. The land that now includes Brecknock Park was first granted to Alexander Humphrey in 1680. Subsequent owners John Clayton Jr. and Joshua Gregg and Thomas Hanson operated a grain mill on the property where the foundation still remains to this day. The Manor House was built during four major construction periods beginning in the 18th century through the late 19th century. This house is constructed of brick and frame and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.“I am proud we could secure the funding to help restore the Goggin House and  preserve Delaware’s role in the history of our region,” said Senator Carper. “Brecknock County Park is one step closer to becoming a tourism driver to the area, inviting visitors from all over to stop and learn about Kent County’s important role in the Underground Railroad and life in America dating back to the 1700s.”“The echoes of a rich past and architectural heritage reverberate all throughout the First State, but few areas have defined Delaware’s history as much as the Goggin House, with its connection to the Underground Railroad and heritage as the home of our first governor,” said Senator Coons. “The Kent County Levy Court has put decades of work into restoring and upgrading the Goggin House, and I’m hopeful and excited to see the progress that will continue to be made with this additional federal funding.”“The historic Goggin House is a principal fixture in Kent County that deserves to be shared with all who come to Delaware,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “I’m proud to work alongside my counterparts in Congress – Senator Carper and Senator Coons – to deliver this federal funding that will help Kent County Levy Court make the long-overdue renovations to the Goggin House to preserve its historical and cultural significance for generations to come.”“This funding for renovation efforts of the Goggin Manor house at Brecknock County Park will allow Kent County to establish additional programming for our community, and access to a long treasured historic home,” said Jeremy Sheppard, Kent County Levy Court, Director of Community Services. “Future interpretation of this house and surrounds will allow citizens to engage with Kent County’s past.”“On behalf of Kent County Levy Court, and the residents of the County, I’d like to thank the congressional delegation for the funding that will allow us to further renovate the Goggin House,” said Jody Sweeney, Commissioner, District 5, Kent County Levy Court. “In the 13 years that I have been on Kent County Levy Court, it has been my desire to have a Historical Museum in the heart of an area where we know there was Underground Rail Road activity; and the funding you’ve provided brings us one step closer to making that historical museum a reality.”###"

Delaware’s congressional delegation has secured nearly $100 million for Delaware communities and projects up and down the state.“I’ve long said that the role of government is to create a nurturing environment for job growth, and that’s exactly what we are doing here with $5 million in federal funding to help power future development in Dover,” said Senator Carper. “Powering this industrial area has the potential to create hundreds of jobs and provide backup electricity to our state’s capital city. That is a win-win for Dover and our region.”“Investing in projects that supply enough energy to power our existing infrastructure—that can sustain powering future developments as well—must remain a top priority for Delaware to continue on a pathway of economic success,” said Senator Coons. “Securing $5 million for Garrison Oak Business and Technology Park will bring both jobs and economic development to the City of Dover, and I’m glad to have secured this funding alongside Senator Carper and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester.”“Having served as Delaware’s Secretary of Labor, job creation has – and always will be – a driving force behind my work,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “This $5 million in federal funding – secured by the federal delegation – won’t only be used to power Garrison Oak Business and Technology Park, it will also drive economic development in Dover – a win-win for Dover and our entire state. I look forward to the implementation of this new substation and the investments it will bring to Kent County.”“We are very appreciative of the 5 million dollar grant that was made possible by our federal delegation,” said Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen. “Without the support from Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons and from Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester this would not have been made available to us. These funds will allow improved electrical sustainability and reliability while aiding us in continuing the development of the Garrison Oak Business and Technology Park. By building more circuits on the east side of Dover, it allows increased resiliency to the electric grid and makes available additional opportunities for growth.”###"

The Army Corps of Engineers maintain Delaware’s critical infrastructure, shore up our coasts, and fortify our waterways. These funds are in addition to the nearly $70 million already secured for Delaware under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law earlier this year.“So much of Delaware’s vital infrastructure is protected or maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers,” said Senator Carper. “The Corps is a critical partner to our state by supporting the many projects that drive our economy. These activities include maintaining access to our Port and navigable waterways which support our flow of commerce, protecting our communities from the growing threats of climate change with critical flood risk reduction measures, and maintaining our five-star beaches to support our expanding tourism industry.”“The work of the Army Corps of Engineers is critical to the strength of Delaware’s economy and quality of life, and securing funds for the Corps’ Delaware projects is one of my top priorities as an appropriator,” said Senator Coons. “In addition to the investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, this funding will support commerce and recreation across our state, while making our communities more resilient to climate change. Thanks to these investments, Delaware will continue to be a great place to call home.” “To keep our economy strong, we must make bold investments in our infrastructure,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “ The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already doing just that. That’s why I’m excited that the Army Corps of Engineers plan will include over $101 million in additional funding for Delaware-based Army Corps projects – from beach nourishment to climate change mitigation – so that the Corp can continue its critical work to invest in and maintain the First State’s infrastructure.”Delaware projects funded under the 2022 Appropriations and Work Plan: ·         $4,000,000 for the beach nourishment project at Fenwick Island to protect the community and support the local tourism economy. ·         $1,200,000 for the Indian River Inlet Sand Bypass Plant operations, which nourishes the beach on the north side of the inlet that protects a stretch of Delaware Route 1 highway.·         An additional $30,000 for Indian River Inlet operations and maintenance work. ·         $7,650,000 for the beach nourishment project that protects the city of Rehoboth Beach and the town of Dewey Beach while also maintaining the beach for tourism. ·         $2,000 for periodic inspections of federally authorized levee systems in Delaware which are natural or artificial walls that block water from flooding local communities.·         $150,000 for additional operations and maintenance activities along the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal. ·         $225,000 for the Corps to perform condition surveys and assessments of federally authorized navigation channels including the small harbors in Sussex County.·         $78.4 million for dredging of the Intracoastal Waterway – Delaware River to the Chesapeake Bay – and upgrades of Reedy Point and St. George’s bridges.·         $9.2 million for operations and maintenance work on the Wilmington Harbor, including a new management plan to support the Port’s expansion to the Edgemoor terminal.·         $250,000 for Little River maintenance dredging. ·         $400,000 for Mispillion River maintenance dredging.###"

https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-collins-applaud-committee-passage-of-bill-to-expand-benefits-for-federal-firefighters,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, today celebrated the committee passage of their bill, the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act of 2021, at a business meeting held by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC). The legislation would help to ensure federal firefighters receive the financial support they deserve for illnesses and diseases associated with the performance of their duties as a firefighter. “Federal firefighters put themselves in harm’s way to save lives and protect our nation’s public lands. In this dangerous line of work, these heroic men and women are at higher risk of developing certain diseases—like respiratory illnesses and a variety of cancers. We owe it to them to ensure they get the benefits and support they deserve for putting their own personal safety at risk,” said Carper. “I’m proud the Committee passed our bill today, and urge the full Senate to follow suit so we can get this bipartisan bill to President Biden’s desk swiftly.” “Every day across the country, firefighters put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe,” said Collins. “Federal firefighters protect some of our nation’s most critical assets and infrastructure, and these brave men and women should have the same occupational safeguards and benefits as most of their colleagues at the local level. I am pleased that Congress has taken another step toward passing our bipartisan bill, which would allow federal firefighters to receive the benefits they deserve when they fall ill as a result of their service to our nation.”“Federal fire fighters are always on the frontlines protecting our nation’s vital military installations, federal facilities, laboratories, and neighboring communities. For too long, the federal government has denied fire fighters workers compensation benefits when they fall victim to occupational cancers, heart, and lung disease despite scientific links between firefighting and these deadly diseases,” said Edward A. Kelly, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. “Today, we are very close to eliminating the bureaucratic burdens on sick federal fire fighters who need their workers’ compensation benefits. I applaud Senator Carper for his unwavering leadership on this issue and for securing a favorable vote from the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs on the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act. This bill will soon grant federal fire fighters workers compensation benefits that are on par with the protections 49 states provide for their local and state fire fighters.”The Federal Firefighters Fairness Act would amend the Federal Employee Compensation Act to create a presumption that a disability or death of a federal firefighter caused by certain diseases is the result of the performance of their duties. The conditions include bladder cancer, brain cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemias, lung cancer, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, skin cancer (melanoma), testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, and a sudden cardiac event or stroke. In April 2021, Senators Carper and Collins introduced the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act along with Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Angus King (I-Maine), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). In May 2022, the House of Representatives voted in a bipartisan fashion to approve and advance the House companion bill first introduced by Representative Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.).In addition to the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), the legislation is also supported by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE)##"

Though my own boys are now grown adults, I am thinking of when I used to tuck them into bed and help them with their homework. I am thinking of when they were the age of the 18 elementary school children gunned down at their school today. Instead of planning their summer vacations, these families are now planning their children’s funerals. Martha and I are overwhelmed with sadness, and pray for the families who have had their most precious gift taken from them by a gunman. “As I am mourning this tragedy, I refuse to accept inaction. I refuse to accept that the mass slaughter of children in their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade classrooms is normal. I refuse to believe that Congress can’t reform our gun laws in a way that the American public broadly supports. “Tonight, President Biden outlined what we can do—as citizens and as legislators— to stand up to gun lobby and say, ‘Enough.’ We are long overdue to make commonsense reforms to our nation’s gun laws.

We affirm our support for Sweden and Finland’s applications for membership. In addition, we pledge to work closely with you and with our Senate colleagues to ensure that their applications are swiftly considered and approved by the Senate,” they wrote. “The transatlantic alliance has never been more crucial to global security and stability.

The framework will help the United States write the rules of the road for trade and create a stronger, more resilient economy here in the U.S. and abroad.“One of the best ways we can counter China’s anti-competitive trade practices is by working productively with our Indo-Pacific allies to write global trade rules. And while I’ll never understand why the previous Administration decided to walk away from an agreement that would have allowed us to do that, I applaud President Biden’s action today to put the U.S. back in the driver’s seat,” said Carper. “The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework will boost American competitiveness and help shore up supply chains to lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration on further developing the Framework to ensure it supports American workers and businesses and upholds our values.”    “While not perfect, this framework is a good first step toward a comprehensive free trade agreement in the region and reinforces the U.S. commitment to those nations and allies that abide by the rules-based, international trading system,” said Cornyn. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to push for critical priorities including market access for American businesses, farmers, and ranchers and prioritizing crucial areas such as digital trade.”  Background:Both Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Cornyn have long called for the United States to re-engage with our Asia-Pacific allies following the previous Administration’s misguided decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Last year, Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Cornyn sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai calling for the U.S. to reassert trade leadership in the Asia-Pacific region by engaging again with allies to develop comprehensive, multilateral free-trade partnerships.Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Cornyn also penned an op-ed last year in the Washington Post arguing that the U.S. must re-engage our Asia-Pacific allies to forge multilateral trade partnerships to counter China’s geopolitical rise in the region and benefit American manufacturers, farmers and small businesses.##"

In a letter to President Biden, the senators noted Taiwan’s importance to the United States as an important trading partner and underscored that failing to include Taiwan in IPEF runs counter to U.S. economic interests in the region.“IPEF can be a meaningful first step for the United States to assure its allies and partners that we are economically engaged in the region, which accounts for sixty percent of the world economy and two-thirds of all economic growth over the last five years. For IPEF to be a useful vehicle to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, however, we must make sure that all of America’s regional allies and partners are included,” the senators wrote. “This is just one necessary aspect to ensuring the framework is competitive in a region already saturated with economic treaties and agendas.”  “The more economic engagement U.S. and allies and partners have with Taiwan, the stronger our collective resilience against coercion,” the senators added. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows the value of tangible economic support by the United States and like-minded allies and partners, and the same is true for Taiwan. Including Taiwan in the IPEF would be an invaluable signal of our rock-solid commitment to Taiwan and its prosperity and freedom.”Background:Chairman Carper has long called for the United States to re-engage with our Asia-Pacific allies following the previous Administration’s misguided decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Last year, Chairman Carper sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai calling for the U.S. to reassert trade leadership in the Asia-Pacific region by engaging again with allies to develop comprehensive, multilateral free-trade partnerships. Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Cornyn (R-Texas) also penned an op-ed last year in the Washington Post arguing that the U.S. must re-engage our Asia-Pacific allies to forge multilateral trade partnerships that would counter China’s geopolitical rise in the region and benefit American manufacturers, farmers and small businesses.You can read the full letter HERE. ###"

We cannot stop working on this issue until babies are fed,” wrote the Senators. “The federal government needs to do more to get formula back on shelves as soon as possible and secure the supply chain of infant formula to prevent this type of crisis from happening again. These actions require a government-wide response, as the issue spans food supply chain security, regulatory oversight, public health surveillance, market competition, government contracting, and more. We urge you to immediately assign a coordinator within the White House to work with manufacturers directly and oversee the development and implementation of a national strategy for increasing the resiliency of the infant formula supply chain and protecting against future contamination and shortages.”The letter was also signed by Senators Hassan (N.H), Smith (Minn.), Blumenthal (Conn.), Reed (R.I.), Hirono (Hawaii), Shaheen (N.H.), Rosen (Nev.), Kelly (Ariz.), Sinema (Ariz.), King (Maine), Warnock (Ga.), Wyden (Ore.), Merkley (Ore.), Baldwin (Wis.), Padilla (Calif.), Heinrich (N.

In a letter with Senate colleagues led by Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Carper urged suppliers to increase production and distribution following a nationwide shortage of infant formula that has made it harder for parents and caregivers to obtain infant formula at local stores. This is a critical issue especially for Delaware, which reportedly has the second highest out-of-stock rate of formula in the nation.“This shortage has placed an unacceptable burden on parents and caregivers and has put the health of babies and infants at risk,” the Senators wrote. “For many families, infant formula is critical for ensuring their children receive the nutrition they need to grow healthy and well-nourished. This shortage has been especially challenging for some of the most vulnerable infants, with particularly acute shortages of specialty formulas to address health needs such as allergies, gastrointestinal issues, or metabolic disorders. There is no easy substitute for infant formula, and this shortage has left families across the nation scrambling to figure out how they will care for their children. We urge the Infant Nutrition Council of America and your member companies to do all you can to increase infant formula production and distribution, and prevent future supply chain disruptions.” To view the full letter, click here.Delaware Public Health provided guidance to families struggling to find formula, and urges Delawareans to visit dethrives.com for up-to-date information on Delaware’s response to the infant formula supply chain issue, or call 211 for community resources. ##"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-celebrates-bipartisan-postal-legislation-promoting-wildlife-conservation-becoming-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today celebrated the news that his Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act was signed into law. The bicameral, bipartisan legislation— which Carper introduced alongside Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and U.S. Representatives John Katko (R-N.Y.) and Jim Costa (D-Calif.)— requires the U.S. Postal Service to sell the approximately 41 million remaining Saving Vanishing Species Stamps left in stock. When the program began in 2011, the U.S. Postal Service printed 100 million stamps to help promote wildlife conservation.“With President Biden signing the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Stamp Reauthorization Act into law, Americans can continue to protect the at-risk species we love by purchasing postal stamps,”said Carper. “Supporting this program right now is critical as our world’s most threatened wildlife face threats like habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. My thanks go out to Senator Portman and all supporters of this legislation for their hard work in getting this bipartisan effort across the finish line.” “We owe it to our future generations to preserve our planet’s rich wildlife and natural resources so they can continue to be enjoyed,” said Portman. “This successful stamp program has raised millions of dollars to fund conservation without any taxpayer money. I’m proud this bicameral, bipartisan legislation has been signed into law so that we can ensure that every last stamp is sold.”“The Save Vanishing Species Semipostal stamp – or Tiger Stamp – gives every American the opportunity to easily and effectively contribute to programs that protect imperiled species including tigers, rhinos, great apes, turtles, tortoises, and elephants. To date, these stamps have raised over $6.5 million for critical conservation programs around the globe,” said Danielle Kessler, U.S. Country Director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “Thanks to the leadership of Senators Portman and Carper and Representatives Costa and Katko, these popular stamps will now remain available to postal customers, and continue to provide support for endangered animals around the world. A win for these beloved species and for postal customers.”“On the eve of Endangered Species Day, Congress and President Biden have given us a reason to celebrate now that the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semi-Postal Stamp Reauthorization Act has been signed into law. The bipartisan bill ensures that the ‘Tiger Stamp’ will remain on U.S. Post Office shelves until the last stamp is sold,” said Ginette Hemley, senior vice president, wildlife conservation, World Wildlife Fund. “It seems fitting that, with 2022 the ‘Year of the Tiger,’ this beautiful stamp has been given new life and will continue to help fund U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service efforts to restore populations of these big cats and other magnificent species in their wild habitats. We commend the champions in Congress and the Administration who have made this program a lasting success and a legacy of U.S. leadership on global wildlife conservation.” “The Save Vanishing Species stamp makes the act of conserving wildlife as easy as mailing a letter,” said John Calvelli, Wildlife Conservation Society Executive Vice President of Public Affairs. “This continues to be a win-win as we can increase the financial support for conserving some of our most iconic, endangered species and engage everyday Americans in the cause. Thanks to Reps. Jim Costa and John Katko, Sens. Rob Portman and Tom Carper, and all the members of Congress that worked to keep this important conservation tool on sale.”“The Tiger Stamp has generated $5.7 million to conserve some of the world’s most iconic wild animals, and now Americans can continue to increase that sum each time they visit the post office,” said Sara Amundson, president of Humane Society Legislative Fund. “We are thrilled this legislation is now law. We thank Congress for passing it and President Biden for signing it, with special gratitude to Senators Portman and Carper and Representatives Costa and Katko for shepherding it through.”“Once again, Senators Portman and Carper and Representatives Katko and Costa have shown their willingness to work together to protect wildlife and wild places,” said the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. “In this case, quite literally, showing our nation’s continued commitment to stamping out extinction. Now everyone can play a role in conserving African and Asian elephants, great apes, rhinos, tigers, marine turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises simply by purchasing some stamps. Everyone should celebrate this achievement by purchasing Save Vanishing Species Stamps.”BackgroundOn September 20, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued the Saving Vanishing Species Stamp, depicting an endangered Amur tiger cub, priced above the normal price of a first-class stamp. The difference in price from this first-class stamp is transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support the five Multinational Species Conservation Funds to protect tigers, rhinoceroses, Asian and African elephants, marine turtles, and great apes. These programs target poaching, illegal wildlife trade, habitat protection, and projects to incorporate species conservation into community development.Through purchases of 59 million tiger stamps to-date, out of a total of 100 million stamps, Americans have raised more than $6.5 million for conservation projects. This funding has helped support 135 on-the-ground conservation projects in 37 countries. These projects have leveraged more than $25 million in matching funds provided by partners. ###"

This legislation is now ready for consideration by the full Senate.“I’m proud to have introduced the Water Resources Development Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation that will help give the Delaware the ability to recover from future storms like this. This bill will be critical to help protect our communities and keep our beaches beautiful and accessible to all,” said Carper.“We appreciated Senator Carper’s visit today to view the storm damage to our beach,” said South Bethany Mayor Tim Saxton. “Senator Carper has consistently worked to assure funding for beach replenishment here in Delaware.  We support his efforts with the Water Resources Development Act to enable recovery from damage due to future storms.” ###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-statement-on-the-sale-of-the-trump-hotel-lease,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the General Services Administration (GSA), released the following statement on the final sale of the Trump Hotel’s lease for the Old Post Office Building.“This sale closes a shameful five year chapter at the General Service Administrations. The only relief I find by this news is the removal of the Trump name on this building, signaling an end of the federal government entanglements with the previous President’s moral, ethical, and legal shortcomings.“However, this sale does not put an end to questions about GSA’s failures over the last few years to uphold the public’s trust in overseeing the lease of the Trump Hotel property to the Trump Organization.“Shortly after the November 2016 election, I asked GSA to look into obvious conflicts of interest then President-elect Trump held as the incoming the head of government with a major financial interest in his namesake hotel located on government property. GSA refused my multiple requests for information and failed the American people by its unwillingness to provide transparency into the government’s business relationship with the Trump organization.“Failures like this at our highest level of government erode the American people’s confidence in our democracy. Even now, the emerging details regarding this sale do not assuage my concerns about whether former President Trump unduly enriched himself through his political power, both while he held office and even after he left the Presidency. The American people deserve better.“"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-and-capito-introduce-legislation-to-support-national-wildlife-refuge-system,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), the Committee’s Ranking Member, introduced legislation to support our National Wildlife Refuge System. The Keep America’s Refuges Operational Act will reauthorize appropriations for the National Wildlife Refuge System volunteer, educational, and community partnership program, an initiative that helps ensure public access to national refuges for exploring, hunting, fishing and studying wildlife.“National Wildlife Refuges are natural treasures for all Americans to enjoy. We especially saw the importance of our national public lands, including refuges, during the pandemic, when these critical wildlife habitats also served the public as safe outdoor spaces for recreation—thanks, in large part, to the hard work of dedicated volunteers. I’m delighted to introduce the Keep America’s Refuges Operational Act to support these volunteers and our refuges, and just in time to mark World Migratory Bird Day this Saturday. People come from around the world to see migratory birds at Delaware’s two national wildlife refuges, and volunteers are critical in helping these visitors have the experience of a lifetime,” said Senator Carper.  “The Keep America’s Refuges Operational Act of 2022 reauthorizes volunteer, community, and educational programs that will support America’s wildlife refuges. Some of our greatest assets are our lands and waters, and this legislation ensures that citizens can continue to volunteer and play a role in the National Wildlife Refuge System and preserve it for future generations,” said Senator Capito.   America’s 568 National Wildlife Refuges are located in all 50 states and the five territories. They make up 850 million acres of pristine public lands and waters dedicated to the conservation of fish and wildlife. Wildlife refuge volunteers are individuals who want to give back to their communities, parents who want to be good stewards of the land and set examples for their children, retired people willing to share their wealth of knowledge, concerned citizens of all ages who want to learn more about conservation, and passionate people who enjoy the outdoors and want to spread the word about America’s greatest natural treasures. Their contribution is significant: in Fiscal Year 2021, more than 11,000 volunteers donated 68,879 hours of their time to benefit the National Wildlife Refuge System. The value of their time contribution is equal to $18.5 million and equivalent to 318 full-time refuge staff.  The bill is supported by: The American Bird Conservancy; American Fisheries Society; American Hiking Society; American Sportfishing Association; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Coalition of Refuge Friends and Advocates; Defenders of Wildlife; Ducks Unlimited; Izaak Walton League of America; National Audubon Society; National Wildlife Federation; National Wildlife Refuge Association; The Nature Conservancy; The Wilderness Society; Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; and Trout Unlimited.

https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-coons-blunt-rochester-announce-1-2-million-to-improve-seaford-infrastructure,"SEAFORD, Del. – Today, U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.) joined representatives from the City of Seaford and the Chesapeake Conservancy to announce $1.2 million in funding to improve wastewater infrastructure and nurture economic development along the Nanticoke River in the city.This project will relocate and upgrade a 60-year-old main line sewer line that serves Seaford — including a hospital and four schools— as well as the neighboring communities of Bridgeville and Greenwood.This critical community investment is funded through a congressionally directed spending request, part of nearly $100 million for community projects up and down the state secured by Delaware’s congressional delegation. These investments were included in the 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Bill signed into law by President Biden on March 15, 2022.“When we began the process of accepting requests for congressional directed spending, we made an effort to choose projects that would benefit the greater good for Delaware,” said Senator Carper. “Seaford’s project gives us a great bang for our buck. Not only will it help restore an important infrastructure component to Seaford and its neighboring communities, but it also helps build on the economic development work going on here at Oyster House Park.”“Upgrading and improving Seaford’s wastewater infrastructure will improve public health and quality of life along the Nanticoke, while boosting the city’s economy. I am especially proud to have helped deliver the funding for this project because it will allow the Chesapeake Conservancy, Seaford, and Sussex County to continue their work of reconnecting Seaford’s residents with the water and the future construction of the Oyster House and park,” said Senator Coons.“Upgrades to our outdated wastewater infrastructure, like the main sewer line in Seaford, are critically important to the health and well-being of our state,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “This vital project that will improve the quality of life for Delawareans in Seaford and surrounding communities all while growing our economic development in Sussex County.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/chairman-carper-s-opening-statement-hearing-on-council-on-environmental-quality,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday, May 11, 2022, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing on the work of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) under Chair Brenda Mallory’s leadership.Below is the opening statement of Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as prepared for delivery:“Let me begin by welcoming our witness, Brenda Mallory, Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, back before our committee today. We appreciate you being here to discuss the CEQ’s work since your confirmation last year.“Let me also thank you for celebrating Earth Day in Delaware with us last month. Your visit to Delaware State University and Delaware Technical Community College made a real impact on everyone we met, especially the students, which ran the gambit from kindergarten to doctoral programs. You are welcome in Delaware at any time.“Since the moment he took office, President Biden has made leading our country out of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, as well as addressing climate change and advancing environmental justice top priorities of his administration. The role that CEQ plays in achieving these goals cannot be understated.“CEQ ensures that federal agencies work in harmony to protect our environment and improve public health, which is critical to creating a nurturing environment for job creation and preservation. With more than 8 million Americans back to work since President Biden took office, it’s clear that CEQ’s urgent work is not stymying economic growth.“Earlier this year, the Fourth National Climate Assessment made clear that nations throughout the world must dramatically and urgently reduce emissions if we are to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change.“These impacts are already being felt in communities in the United States and across our planet, showing us just how vulnerable we are to climate change and extreme weather.“Just last week, we saw four days of rain on the East Coast produce flooding in places where it rarely occurs.“Prior to that — in the last year alone — we witnessed record heat waves in Oregon, where only a third of households have air conditioning. Wildfires burned millions of acres in California, Montana, Arizona, and other Western States.“The same hurricane that knocked out access to power and water for a million people in Louisiana and Mississippi then went on to produce flash floods in New Jersey and New York. People there actually drowned in their basements, unable to escape the torrent of floodwater.“According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, damages from last year’s disasters totaled roughly $145 billion — that’s 2021 alone. So it’s becoming increasingly clear that the Biden Administration’s focus on climate action is both timely and critical.“Addressing the long-standing environmental inequities in our nation is equally important and also linked to climate change.“We know that while climate change threatens to disrupt all communities — and affects all aspects of our economy — it poses unique threats to communities that are already vulnerable.“In other words, Americans living in lower-income and marginalized communities have less ability to prepare for and recover from extreme weather. The least among us have the most to lose from inaction on climate.“That is why our federal agencies need to address these twin goals of climate action and environmental justice together. Fortunately, we have an important tool to improve federal analysis and decision-making — the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA.“NEPA established the Council on Environmental Quality in 1969. This was done, in part, to provide agencies with high-quality information on the environmental effects of their proposed actions.“Over the years, we have made a number of adjustments to NEPA, ensuring that the law functions as intended while, also, not being overly burdensome to industry.“Earlier this year, CEQ finalized revisions to the rules that implement NEPA. This restored critical protections under NEPA and also provided agencies and other stakeholders with greater certainty as they begin to implement the programs created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These revisions will ensure that agencies consider the cumulative impacts of a project, such as the implications for climate change, and the question of whether the impact is on a community that is already vulnerable.“CEQ also has been coordinating efforts across the federal government to improve the federal permitting process for clean energy technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration. Today, I look forward to hearing more about those efforts from our witness.“I would also be remiss if I didn’t set the record straight with respect to the Biden Administration’s policy actions and gas prices in our country. The last time I checked, the United States is the top oil and gas producer in the world, producing more than we consume. And, with more than 9,000 unused, approved permits to drill onshore, the oil and gas industry — not the federal permitting process — bears more than a little responsibility for the current level of domestic production.“In addition to its permitting efforts, CEQ has been hard at work delivering on the Biden Administration’s promise to prioritize environmental justice and equitably distribute the benefits of climate action. As part of that effort, CEQ has released a draft version of its Climate and Environmental Justice Screening Tool, helping agencies better identify underserved or overburdened communities. They have also recently hired a new Director of Environmental Justice to oversee this important work.“CEQ has also established sustainability goals for federal buildings and other federal procurements and launched a $1 billion effort — known as the America the Beautiful Challenge — to support conservation and restoration projects across the nation.“All of this demonstrates the administration’s commitment to leading by example when it comes to doing what is good and what is right for our planet.“So, we are looking forward to hearing from Chair Mallory on the critical efforts she’s leading and whether CEQ has the resources it needs to effectively carry out this work.” "

If confirmed, he will be the only judge of color currently serving on the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and the second Black judge to ever serve on the Delaware District Court in its history.“Greg Williams is well-suited to serve in this important role for Delaware and our nation,” said Carper. “More than his professional qualifications, though, Greg is the personification of the Golden Rule. He is also the personification of judicial temperament. Greg Williams, has not just the credentials and the temperament, but the strong work ethic that is necessary for this court to continue to function as one of the most important District Courts in our country.” “Greg Williams has been a leader in the Delaware legal community for years now, with over two decades working on the kind of commercially significant legislation that the Delaware District Court is known for. His exceptional qualifications, strong character, and wealth of lived experience will make him an asset to the Court, and I support his nomination unreservedly,” said Coons.Senators Carper and Coons recommended Williams to President Biden to be nominated for the judicial vacancy created when Judge Leonard Stark was confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit earlier this year. The American Bar Association’s Standing Committee evaluated Williams as “well qualified” to serve on the District Court in a unanimous opinion.Williams is a partner in the Wilmington office of Fox Rothschild LLP. He joined the firm in 1995 as an associate and was elevated to partner in 2003. He has served as a special master in complex civil cases for the District of Delaware since 2020. From 1986 to 1992, Williams served in the U.S. Army Reserve. He received his J.D. from Villanova University School of Law in 1995 and both his B.A. and B.S. from Millersville University of Pennsylvania in 1990.To view Senators Carper and Coons’s full opening remarks at today’s hearing, click here.### "
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-statement-on-senate-failure-to-pass-women-s-health-protection-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.) today released the following statement after the Senate failed to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, legislation that would have codified the opinion in Roe v. Wade: “Last week, we learned the deeply disappointing news that the Supreme Court is on the precipice of overturning Roe v. Wade. Like many Americans, I am dismayed over what this would mean for our nation and our Constitution. Essentially, it amounts to a full-fledged attack on women’s health and the biggest setback for women’s rights in my lifetime. Overturning Roe v. Wade would allow states to ban all abortions—even for victims of rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother—and enable state legislators to create criminal penalties for women and their doctors who make this most personal decision. These are not hypotheticals; these are the actual laws being passed by state legislatures.“That’s why today, I once again voted for legislation to protect a woman’s right to make decisions about her own health, a principle first established in Roe v. Wade and upheld by the Supreme Court as settled law for the past half-century. This critical legislation would ensure that Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land—and would ensure that women and their doctors, not politicians and judges, can continue to make these private health care decisions. “While I’m deeply disappointed in the outcome of today’s vote, the fight is far from over: I’m committed to continuing to work to find a way to protect this fundamental right for women to be able to make their own health care choices. Failure is not an option.”###"

https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/delaware-congressional-delegation-stands-firmly-with-delaware-state-university-community,"WILMINGTON,  Del. – Today,  U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons, and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (all D-Del.) issued the following statement after video emerged of the Delaware State University Women’s Lacrosse Team’s bus being stopped and searched by law enforcement in Georgia. “The story reported in The Hornet and images captured on video by the Delaware State University women’s lacrosse team during a Georgia traffic stop are deeply disturbing. No one should be made to feel unsafe or humiliated by law enforcement or any entity who has sworn to protect and serve them. That’s especially true for students who have sought out HBCUs like Delaware State University with a long history of empowering communities of color that have far too often faced discrimination and other barriers to opportunity. We strongly support Dr. Allen’s decision to ‘go wherever the evidence leads’ him and his administration as they explore all possible options in response. Our offices stand ready to assist the Delaware State community however we can as it deals with the impact of this episode, and hope there will be a swift, just resolution.” ###"

Funding will be administered to Jewish Family Services, the Salvation Army, and Westside Family Healthcare. This funding is part of nearly $100 million for community projects up and down the state secured by Delaware’s congressional delegation. These investments were included in the 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Bill signed into law by President Biden on March 15, 2022. “I am so proud our congressional delegation could work to deliver nearly $100 million in funding that will help Delawareans up and down the state,” said Senator Carper. “Today’s announcement of investments will go to reputable organizations that are working on the front lines to meet health care needs in the state to the people who need it the most. I am so grateful for their continued work.”“Organizations like Jewish Family Services, the Salvation Army, and Westside Health have been instrumental in helping support Delawareans through difficult and unprecedented times,” Senator Coons said. “I’m grateful to have helped deliver millions of dollars in critical funding to groups doing the work on the ground to meet the needs of our communities in Wilmington and across the state.” “Today’s announcement of federal funding to some of our state’s best nonprofits will help create a better quality of life for Delawareans throughout the First State,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “I’m proud of the work of the Congressional Delegation to secure this critical funding, signed into law by President Biden, and am proud of the work of organizations like Jewish Family Services, the Salvation Army, and Westside who work tirelessly to make our state a better place. “We are grateful to the Congressional Delegation for securing federal funding in these critical service areas,” said Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Secretary Molly Magarik. “At DHSS, we value the partnership of Jewish Family Services, the Salvation Army and Westside Family Healthcare, as well as the services and care they bring to the community. These additional funds will provide important support to Delawareans suffering from substance use disorder and survivors of human trafficking, and help to expand health care services to our neighbors in need.“The past two years have required agility, creativity, and flexibility, and I am very proud of the work Jewish Family Services has done to meet the challenges of providing services throughout the pandemic. JFS is grateful for this opportunity to address Delaware’s shortage of licensed mental health professionals through our Mental Health Fellowship Program, which will accelerate the number of experienced—ultimately licensed—therapists to serve Delawareans and the growing demand for services,” said JFS Delaware Interim CEO, Regina Kerr Alonzo. “The funding for this Fellowship Program is an investment in Delaware’s long-term health and well-being. JFS is grateful for this opportunity to play such a vital role in ensuring a healthier future for Delaware.”“Trafficking victims housed at the Emergency Housing Residence Shelter come from difficult situations and are struggling to exit lives of crime that were not of their choosing. Unfortunately, criminal elements often follow these victims, which is why we are making physical changes to the facility that will better protect these survivors as well as everyone who seeks or delivers services through our organization. We are extremely grateful for the award of this funding, which will help us continue to further build upon the significant community impact of the Restoration Now program”, said Major Timothy Sheehan, Delaware State Coordinator for the Salvation Army.“Westside Family Healthcare is grateful to Delaware’s Congressional Delegation for securing critical funding that will complete our multi-year capital campaign to renovate our largest, oldest health center located on the West side of Wilmington,” said Chris Fraser, Chief Operating Officer at Westside Family Healthcare. “The redesigned family medical and prenatal care suite will transform our patient and care team experience, and meet the growing need for primary care in the community.” The three programs we will be announcing funding for are:·         $3.5 for Mental Health Fellowship and Training for License-Eligible Social Workers, Program Support to Jewish Family Services  ·         $485,000 for the Restoration Now Security Project to Combat Human Trafficking to the Salvation Army ·         $2M for the Building Better Business Districts to Westside Family HealthcareBackground: $3.5 for Mental Health Fellowship and Training for License-Eligible Social Workers, Program Support to Jewish Family Services  The purpose of this project is for Jewish Family Services to create ten paid fellowship positions for mental health counselors with Master’s degrees to prepare them for their licensing exam. This project will support the creation of five paid fellowship positions for Master’s degree prepared and license-eligible counselors, while providing the intensive clinical supervision necessary to prepare them for their licensing exam. Two of the fellows will be bilingual, and at least two will be people of color. Together, these five fellows will address unmet mental health needs in Delaware by providing upwards of 7,000 individual mental health sessions to nearly 1,000 Delawareans in need of support. Delaware has seen the number of mental health professionals decline in the past five years. At the same time, the demand for mental health services has increased, particularly for the growing Hispanic population in Kent and Sussex Counties. This project will address the growing mental health crisis, rising demand for counseling, and lack of licensed mental health practitioners in Delaware.$485,000 for the Restoration Now Security Project to Combat Human Trafficking to the Salvation Army The funding will support the Salvation Army’s plans to reconfigure its existing Wilmington facility to improve the safety of clients living in Restoration Now, the only anti-human trafficking shelter recognized by all government agencies in Delaware. This project will create a safe and secure space for survivors of human trafficking on the facility’s fourth floor by installing key card access controls and kitchenettes, enabling survivors of human trafficking to remain separate from residents under other shelter programs within the facility, like emergency homelessness housing. This project has the support of local elected officials and the Delaware Department of Justice.$2M for Wilmington Health Center Facility Renovations to Westside Family Healthcare The purpose of this project is to complete phase 3 of a multi-year capital improvement campaign, which will include renovations and a re-design of the center to expand resident capacity and facilitate patient-centered care.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/epw-committee-unanimously-advances-water-resources-development-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today led a committee markup to advance the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA 2022) by a 20-0 vote. Carper authored the legislation along with EPW Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), as well as Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).WRDA 2022 would authorize much-needed investments in the projects and programs of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) across the country. For the first time since 2007, the bill authorizes new environmental infrastructure projects and modifies existing ones. It also directs the Corps to expedite the completion of several ongoing studies and projects that are critical to addressing coastal and inland flood risk mitigation, navigation, and ecosystem restoration.“Our committee has shown, yet again, that we can come together across the aisle to help meet the pressing water infrastructure needs of the American people,” Senator Carper said. “This year’s reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act would authorize the modification of existing and construction of new, critical Army Corps projects in Delaware and throughout the country — projects that will significantly improve quality of life, create good-paying jobs, and protect communities against the threats of climate change. I am proud of our committee’s bipartisan work in advancing this legislation and look forward to its consideration by the full Senate.”Draft Bill Text  |  Section by Section  |  Bill Summary"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/carper-and-kennedy-applaud-kigali-amendment-advancement,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, today applauded the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for voting to advance the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to the full Senate for ratification.Last month, Senator Carper pressed for the committee to take this action in a letter with Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Ranking Member James Risch (R-Idaho). Carper and Kennedy also penned a joint op-ed last week calling for Kigali ratification.“The Kigali Amendment is a win-win-win: it’s good for American industries’ global economic competitiveness, it’s good for consumers’ pocketbooks, and it’s good for our planet. Today, we are one step closer to realizing these benefits for our nation and the world. Now, it’s time for the full Senate to continue the momentum of the Foreign Relations Committee’s vote on Kigali by quickly ratifying this treaty and delivering this victory to the American people,” said Senator Carper.Senator Carper authored the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act along with Senator Kennedy, which phases down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) along the timeline required under Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Co-sponsored and passed with strong, bipartisan support and backed by a broad coalition of industry and environmental groups, the AIM Act supports American companies at the forefront of developing energy-efficient alternatives to HFCs that will be made in the United States and save consumers money."

Yet right now, the program is not known by many taxpayers who would greatly benefit from the services it provides,” said Carper. “The IRS should adopt the recommendations in this report by GAO, so that Delawareans and Americans alike can file their taxes easily and without unnecessary fees – which will also result in stronger tax compliance across the country. In light of the challenges that taxpayers faced during the recent filing season, I look forward to continue overseeing this critical issue.”  Background:In June 2020, Senators Carper and Portman (R-Ohio), the former Ranking Member and Chairman of PSI respectively, unveiled a bipartisan report that revealed the majority of Americans eligible for the Free File program do not know it exists or are not taking advantage of it. In response, Senator Carper asked GAO in August of 2020 to conduct a review of the IRS Free File program to provide recommendations to make it more useable, affordable, and accessible for the American people.The Free File program provides free online tax preparation and filing services to U.S. taxpayers. And while 70 percent of Americans are eligible for the program, only 3 percent use the Free File services. Currently, a group of tax preparation companies have an agreement with the IRS to provide these services, but this agreement is set to expire in 2023. GAO has provided the IRS with three recommendations to improve this program, including adding relevant federal guidelines into the next agreement with the Free File companies, and provide additional options for Free File prior to the expiration the current agreement.The full report findings from GAO can be found here.  ### "

According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70 percent of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation. This investigation, may expand harmful, job-killing tariffs on solar imports, raising costs on consumers. It has already caused widespread cancellations and delays in the U.S. solar industry.“Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the Senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.” “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the Senators’ letter continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”In addition to Senators Carper, Coons, Rosen, Heinrich, and Sinema this letter was also signed by Tom Tillis (R-N.C.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Sheldon Whitehouse (D- R.I.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Angus King (I-Maine), Mazie K.

The legislation was developed in partnership with Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chairman of the EPW Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ranking Member of the EPW Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. “Our nation’s water infrastructure is vital to our economy and way of life,” said Chairman Carper. “That is why Senator Capito and I sought input from all 100 Senators and a broad group of stakeholders as we began work on this year’s water resources legislation. After months of hard work and collaboration, we are moving forward with a truly ambitious, bipartisan WRDA bill. This legislation builds on our historic infrastructure investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the past WRDA bills, authorizing projects in all 50 states. Importantly, our bill modernizes the way we approach water resources projects nationwide by ensuring climate and equity are priorities, not afterthoughts in the Corps’ work.”“USACE continues to do amazing work, supporting new water resources infrastructure and improving existing projects. WRDA 2022 will help the Corps protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans and facilitate commerce throughout this country and internationally,” Ranking Member Capito said. “In addition to addressing national needs, this bill advances critical flood control projects for West Virginia and supports programs for water and wastewater services across the state. The EPW Committee continues to deliver quality legislation that will make a difference in communities across the country.”“At the heart of the Water Resources Development Act are tools and resources that support the Army Corps of Engineers and its ability to carry out vital infrastructure projects in our communities,” said Senator Ben Cardin, Chair of the EPW Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. “For Maryland and the nation, this bipartisan bill provides new opportunities to address the maintenance needs of our small harbors, authorizes critical funding for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure assistance throughout the state, and puts Army Corps expertise to work in addressing the impacts of climate change on our coasts and river systems. The jobs, commerce, and livelihoods that rely on these efforts make WRDA incredibly important to strengthening local economies across the country. I am proud to advance this bill with my colleagues.”“Every two years, the Water Resources Development Act provides an opportunity for Congress to provide the Army Corps of Engineers direction to set up our nation’s water resources for long-term success. Provisions in the bill embrace states’ water rights, improve recreational access, support flood mitigation initiatives, and establish policies to better utilize Corps projects while creating jobs and improving our economy. There are a lot of wins for North Dakota in this year’s WRDA bill and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation,” said Senator Cramer, Ranking Member of the EPW Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee.Draft Bill Text  |  Section by Section  |  Bill Summary ###"

We must act with greater urgency to drive down greenhouse gas emissions globally. In Congress, that means passing robust legislation to unleash the power of American clean energy and move our nation closer to meeting our shared climate goals. Future generations will look back at this critical moment in history to assess our response to these clear warnings. If we fail to act, we will leave the costly burden of addressing this crisis to our children and their children — or even worse — leave them with an irreversibly damaged planet.”"

In the Senate, this is our ‘do or die’ moment to pass legislation that speeds up our transition to a clean energy future and strengthens our national security,” said Senator Carper. “Now is our time to get it done. Every week that passes without action, Americans face real costs in dollars, livelihoods lost, and missed opportunities. The future of our national security and planet is at stake.”“As long as we rely on fossil fuels, our economy and our families’ pocketbooks will be held hostage to the whims of dictators like Putin,” said Secretary Mabus. “America will be truly energy independent only when we use home grown alternative, sustainable energy which isn’t subject to price spikes due to uncertainty and chaos. It’s an issue of national security.”A livestream of the event is available here."

States can use the funds in this program to expand transportation options for American families that can help them save money on gas.“I am so proud of the work we did to make the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law a reality—and I’m especially proud that we made sure our bill’s historic investment in our highways, roads, and bridges also included an unprecedented commitment to address climate in our transportation sector. The centerpiece of that climate focus is the Carbon Reduction Program that has been announced today,” said Senator Carper. “This program will enable the development of projects that will reduce emissions, create jobs, and help families save money at the pump. With Earth Day just around the corner, our announcement today takes a big step forward in making the investments we need to fight climate change and create a better planet for future generations. This is a win-win: good for our planet and good for our economy.”“As the sector generating the most carbon emissions in the U.S. economy, transportation must play a leading role in solving the climate crisis,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “The Carbon Reduction Program will help reduce pollution from transportation and move us closer to the President’s ambitious goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030.”The Carbon Reduction Program will fund a wide range of projects designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from on-road highway sources — from installing infrastructure to support the electrification of freight vehicles or personal cars, to constructing Bus Rapid Transit corridors, to facilitating micro-mobility and biking.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/carper-booker-duckworth-applaud-administration-equity-action-plans,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D- NJ), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), founders and co-chairs of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, today applauded the Biden-Harris Administration’s release of Equity Action Plans by more than 90 federal agencies that lay out strategies to advance equity and address the systemic barriers harming underserved communities. The Equity Action Plans include vital commitments to environmental justice.“I am thrilled to see the Biden-Harris Administration use its executive power to continually find ways to promote equity and racial justice within the federal government. With the recent onslaught of state laws that target marginalized groups and communities, it is more important now than ever that we leverage the power of the federal government to protect and benefit those who have historically been left behind or faced discrimination. From addressing legacy pollution in environmental justice communities to ensuring access to housing, or providing benefits for our veterans, there is always more we can be doing to right our past wrongs and give all Americans a chance for opportunity, dignity, and prosperity,” said Senator Carper. “I applaud the administration’s plan and look forward to using my position as Chairman to help implement the goals and objectives found within this historic agenda.”“I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for implementing racial justice and equity initiatives across more than 90 federal agencies to help underserved communities that are too often overlooked by the federal government,” said Senator Booker. “I look forward to continuing my work with the administration and the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus on more actions to achieve environmental justice, including remediating Superfund sites, replacing lead water pipes, and developing frameworks to evaluate and address the impact of pollution on underserved communities. This administration has taken critical steps to build a fairer and more prosperous America for all, and today’s release of agency-specific Equity Action Plans is another important step forward.”“For too long, our most toxic, polluting industries have been located next door to Black, Brown, Indigenous and low-income communities at the expense of their health while too many in power have looked the other way,” said Senator Duckworth. “Racial justice and equity should be prioritized in every aspect of our nation—including in environmental justice and climate action. I’m proud to see that the Biden administration is heeding the call of our Environmental Justice Caucus and countless EJ advocates by making an explicit commitment of helping protect the environments of long-underserved communities.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/carper-statement-on-scotus-clean-water-act-determination,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), issued the following statement on the Supreme Court decision to reinstate a Trump-Administration regulation that constrains states’ authorities under the Clean Water Act Section 401 to review, modify, or deny permits for federal infrastructure projects that could affect their water quality.“As a former governor, I am shocked that the Supreme Court would rely on its ‘shadow docket’ — typically reserved for emergencies — to reinstate a Trump-era regulation that flies in the face of the absolutely clear role Congress reserved to states under the Clean Water Act. Without explanation, without hearing on the merits, the Supreme Court has revived a rule that hamstrings states’ ability to protect their waters, defend their citizens, and preserve their public and economic health,” said Senator Carper. “This is wrong on the substance and wrong on the process. There is too much at stake to simply cave to the interests of a very few energy companies who find themselves compromised by this hugely important, and very clear, law.”BackgroundIn June of 2019, the Trump Administration issued guidance for the regulation that undermines states’ rights to review applications for CWA Section 401 water quality certifications. In response, Senator Carper was joined by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) — his fellow co-founders of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus — in sending a letter to EPA demanding information related to the agency’s efforts to modify the process for state review of applications.In October 2019, the three senators sent another letter to the agency and urged EPA to reverse course on its proposal. The senators wrote that the proposed changes undercut state authorities, violate congressional intent, face bipartisan opposition from state regulators and are unnecessary due to states’ longtime responsible and expeditious handling of Section 401 responsibilities.###"

That’s why I was eager to join forces with Senators Capito and Boozman in crafting these commonsense bills to strengthen our recycling and composting efforts,” Chairman Carper said. “I’m also delighted that our committee has come together to advance these bills today. Our legislation would reduce pollution and waste while also creating economic opportunity in communities across the country — a win-win. Now, we look forward to working with our colleagues on bringing these bills to the full Senate soon.”“The U.S. recycling system provides millions of Americans the opportunity to both protect the environment and contribute to the economy. However, a lack of infrastructure — especially in rural America — often hinders communities’ access to recycling. The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act addresses this issue by establishing a pilot grant program to improve recycling accessibility in underserved areas. Coupled with the Recycling and Composting Accountability Act, legislation to improve data collection on recycling and composting rates across the country, this is a significant step forward in improving our country’s recycling opportunities and needed raw materials for our domestic supply chains,” Ranking Member Capito said. “These bills are the latest examples of quality, bipartisan work products coming out of the EPW Committee. It’s a testament to the genuine partnership Chairman Carper and I have, and I look forward to continuing our important work.”“These legislative initiatives will help preserve our resources and improve our nation’s recycling and composting capabilities. I’m pleased EPW Committee members unanimously advanced these efforts so we can leverage the economic and environmental benefits of recycling. This is a step in the right direction and I’ll be working with Chairman Carper and Ranking Member Capito to encourage support on the Senate floor,” Boozman said.RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT:The Recycling and Composting Accountability Act would improve data collection on our nation’s recycling systems and explore the potential of a national composting strategy. The legislation would require EPA to collect and distribute data on recycling and composting rates across the country to provide an accurate reflection of performance both nationwide and on the state level. This information is critical to evaluating future recycling policies.Bill text is available here.RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCESSIBILITY ACT:The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act would establish a pilot recycling program at the EPA. This program would award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities for improving recycling accessibility in a community or communities within the same geographic area. The goal of the program is to fund eligible projects that would significantly improve access to recycling systems in underserved communities through the use of a hub-and-spoke model for recycling infrastructure development.Bill text is available here and a one-pager is available here.###"

They are an opportunity for presidents to describe their priorities and lay out a vision for the American people.“Last week, the Biden Administration released its first full federal budget proposal, and it’s clear that this administration’s priorities are aligned with the needs of the American people and the immense challenges we all face.“This week, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a new comprehensive scientific report with dire warnings regarding the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The President’s budget calls for historic investments to address the climate crisis while ensuring that the benefits from doing so reach our most disadvantaged communities. The proposal also builds on this committee’s work last year to rebuild our nation’s aging infrastructure — a groundbreaking investment in greenhouse gas emission reduction, climate resilience, and job creation.“In short, the combination of this budget and our infrastructure efforts shows we can do good and do well at the same time.“It’s no secret that Congress has not always provided the EPA with the resources it needs to successfully execute its mission. In recent years — at least until the past year — flat budgets provided by Congress have undermined the agency’s ability to do its job. Still, we have been able to avoid the catastrophic harm that the previous administration’s budget proposals would have inflicted.“Instead of slashing the agency’s budget more than 30 percent as President Trump’s first budget proposed to do, President Biden’s first full budget proposal would increase EPA’s budget by roughly 24 percent in fiscal year 2023. This increase in funding is vital to rebuilding the agency’s capacity after four years of neglect and failed leadership.“In addition to helping EPA rebuild its workforce, which have fallen by about 1,000 since fiscal year 2016, I am also pleased that the President’s budget includes funding to help our nation rebuild as well. Specifically, I was happy to see the request to fully fund our committee’s bipartisan legislation, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021.“While our bill became the foundation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the final legislation only funded the State Revolving Loan Fund provisions.“With this budget, President Biden has prioritized the drinking water and wastewater grant programs that are essential to addressing a variety of water infrastructure needs, especially those of small, disadvantaged, Tribal, and Alaska Native communities.“In fact, the budget calls for addressing a host of critical environmental justice community needs by investing $1.5 billion in clean air, water, environmental cleanup, and other grant programs.“These investments would make good on President Biden’s Justice40 initiative and ensure that all communities, including those who have been overlooked historically, receive their fair share of federal assistance from EPA.“As co-founder of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus with Senators Duckworth and Booker, I am particularly grateful that this budget focuses on the needs of our most vulnerable — communities of color, as well as low-income and Tribal communities — something I know you, Administrator Regan, have prioritized at EPA.“The budget also makes a significant investment in combatting climate change.“Particularly at a time when Americans are feeling the impact of climate change and the downside of our over-reliance on fossil fuels, I am encouraged to see the administration treat the ever-growing threat of the climate crisis with the urgency it deserves.“After years of cuts, the President’s budget proposes $705 million for EPA’s clean air and climate programs — a 60 percent increase from fiscal year 2022. These climate and clean air investments, including funding for the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act and Diesel Emission Reduction Act, would not only drive down emissions and energy costs but would also help grow our economy by supporting American-made products and technologies.“Additionally, this budget would further empower EPA’s efforts to regulate methane and other greenhouse gas emissions as mandated under the Clean Air Act by providing the agency with the financial support it needs to do so.“When it comes to leaving behind a livable planet for future generations, I strongly believe that recycling is an important tool for improving sustainability and creating economic opportunity. To that end, I was pleased to see that the President’s budget will continue to prioritize investments in recycling infrastructure and other waste management initiatives at EPA. It is my hope that these addition funds will help implement EPA’s new national recycling strategy, which the agency crafted reflecting recommendations made by our committee members.“The President’s budget also acknowledges the need to address the pervasive threat that harmful toxics pose to our lives.“With that in mind, I appreciate the long-overdue request for the funds needed to implement the Toxic Substances Control Act — better known around here as TSCA. Many of us recall the extraordinary bipartisan effort led by Senators Inhofe, Vitter, Udall, and other members of this committee to reform TSCA. The President asks for a nearly $125 million increase to implement TSCA the way we intended when we passed the Lautenberg-Vitter Act six years ago — an investment we should all endorse.“And finally, I tip my hat to you, Administrator Regan, and the hardworking experts at EPA for biting the bullet and articulating a specific, robust, and comprehensive roadmap to deal with the host of problems PFAS chemicals create. This is an issue that our ranking member, Senator Capito, and I care about deeply. And as with TSCA, implementing the PFAS roadmap will require a significant investment to keep these forever chemicals out of our air, our water, our land, our lives. “I assure you that we will work with you to ensure that the relevant program offices have the resources they need to address this threat with the urgency and speed our health and our children’s wellbeing demand.   “Let me close by saying that I believe the President’s budget represents a brighter vision of the future of our nation — one that delivers on the promise of clean air and water in every zip code, and ensures that every American has an opportunity to live up to their potential.“Administrator Regan, I think we are heading in that direction under your leadership at EPA and we look forward to hearing your testimony today.”###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/epw-holds-hearing-on-tennessee-valley-authority-nominees,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety held a hearing to consider the nominations of Beth Geer, Robert Klein, and L. Michelle Moore to be Members of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Ben Wagner to be Inspector General of the Tennessee Valley Authority.“TVA should be at the forefront of ensuring fair prices for ratepayers, incentivizing energy efficiency, and transitioning swiftly toward cleaner energy generation. While TVA has already made some progress toward a clean energy transition, other private utilities have far surpassed TVA’s clean energy and energy efficiency commitments. TVA can and must do more, and it all starts with leadership,” said Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the EPW Committee.“In meeting with Ms. Geer, Mr. Klein, and Ms. Moore, I believe they would rise to this challenge and bring excellent leadership to the TVA Board of Directors if confirmed. I also believe that Mr. Wagner would be objective and independent as TVA’s Inspector General if confirmed,” he continued. “I hope that we can quickly confirm each of these nominees. In doing so, we will ensure the TVA Board of Directors does not lose its quorum and provide quality leadership for the Board during a critical time.”###"

That’s why I am delighted to see the Biden-Harris Administration taking action to reduce harmful pollution in our schools and improve the health of our students and teachers. Today’s announcement will help our nation’s schools access the historic funding that Congress has provided for air quality monitoring, clean school buildings, and clean transportation provided in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We fought for these investments to deliver better educational experiences for students across our country — especially those in historically underserved communities that have long carried the burden of high pollution.”The Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure ensures schools have access to key provisions of law authored and championed by Senator Carper, including:###"

When the program began in 2011, the USPS printed 100 million stamps to help promote wildlife conservation.“If we want to save our world’s most threatened wildlife from extinction, we have to work collaboratively and creatively to combat threats like poaching and habitat loss. With our bill, Americans will continue to be able to directly help protect the at-risk species we love by purchasing postal stamps to help promote wildlife conservation,” said Carper. “I’m pleased that the House has passed our commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will move quickly to do the same and get this to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.”“We owe it to our future generations to preserve our planet’s rich wildlife and natural resources so they can continue to be enjoyed,” said Portman. “This successful stamp program has raised millions of dollars to fund conservation without any taxpayer money. I applaud the House passage of our bipartisan legislation, and I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this commonsense legislation to ensure that every last stamp is sold.”BackgroundOn September 20, 2011, the Postal Service issued the Saving Vanishing Species Stamp, depicting an endangered Amur (or Siberian) tiger cub, priced above the normal price of a first-class stamp. The difference in price from this first-class stamp is transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support the five Multinational Species Conservation Funds to protect tigers, rhinoceroses, Asian and African elephants, marine turtles, and great apes. These programs target poaching, illegal wildlife trade, habitat protection, and projects to incorporate species conservation into community development. Through purchases of 59 million tiger stamps to date, out of a total of 100 million stamps, Americans have raised more than $6.5 million for conservation projects. This funding has helped support 135 on-the-ground conservation projects in 37 countries. These projects have leveraged more than $25 million in matching funds provided by partners.###"

Senator Carper and Chair Mallory started the day at Delaware State University (DSU) Early Childhood Laboratory School, where they spoke to children and joined an Earth Day activity teaching the children to plant fruit and vegetable seeds as a way to learn about the connection between our food and our environment. Following the Early Childhood Laboratory School, Senator Carper and Chair Mallory engaged in a roundtable conversation with DSU faculty and students, led by DSU President Tony Allen, to discuss climate change and environmental justice. Following the roundtable, Senator Carper and Chair Mallory visited Delaware Technical Community College’s Terry Campus to talk with faculty and students about workforce development and job training in the renewable energy sector. “It’s an honor to host Chair Mallory here in the First State. This Earth Day, we’ve had the chance to talk with young Delawareans about the need to safeguard our environment and take care of our planet,” said Senator Carper. “When I led her confirmation process in the Senate, I said President Biden couldn’t have picked a better person for the job— and she has demonstrated that with her outstanding leadership on tackling our climate crisis and advancing environmental justice for our nation.”“It is an honor to spend Earth Day in the First State, and to see the remarkable work that Delaware communities are doing to build a clean energy future, fight climate change, and advance environmental justice,” said CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory. “From helping write and pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to developing and delivering practical and common sense environmental solutions of all kinds, Chairman Carper is an unwavering leader in the fight against climate change, and an invaluable partner to the President and all of us in the Administration. The remarkable students we met with today remind us that a better world is within our grasp and that we must continue the fight to ensure everyone can live, work and go to school in a healthy environment.” Chair Mallory is the first African American to serve as Chair of CEQ. As EPW Chairman, Senator Carper proudly led her Senate confirmation to the position. Chair Mallory advises President Biden on environmental and natural resources policies that improve, preserve, and protect public health and the environment for America’s communities. She is focused particularly on addressing the environmental justice and climate change challenges the nation faces while advancing opportunities for job growth and economic development.###"

I’m looking forward to the day we can celebrate the Riverfront on both sides of the Christina River.”“Today’s announcement will help the City of Wilmington make much-needed investments in its sewer system – ones that Delaware’s congressional delegation has been fighting to make happen for years,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “I commend the hard work of Senator Carper and Senator Coons in securing this funding for South Wilmington and look forward to the positive impact these upgrades will have not only on the city’s residents and businesses but its economic development and public health as well.”Delaware’s congressional delegation has secured nearly $100 million for communities and projects up and down the First State. The sewer project expansion announced today will include a new sewage pumping station and a force main. These upgrades will help mitigate the flooding that has often taken place in parts of South Wilmington, negatively impacting the adjacent Southbridge community. This project is also a vital component to the creation of Riverfront East.###"

Tom Carper (D-Del.) joined representatives from the National Park Service (NPS) to announce a $5.4 million award to rehabilitate the historic Sheriff’s House at First State National Historical Park. The Sheriff’s House is a contributing feature to the New Castle National Historic Landmark Historic District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.“I can’t think of a better way to kick of National Park Week than to announce the restoration of the Sheriff’s House, which will soon serve as a visitor’s center to Delaware’s national park,” said U.S. Senator Tom Carper, who was instrumental in making First State National Historical Park a reality. “Once this restoration is complete, Delaware’s story in the founding of our country and the birthplace of our nation is one that visitors from all over the world will better enjoy when they visit the Sheriff’s House in New Castle.”“Understanding and preserving Delaware landmarks like this keeps us connected to the rich history of the First State,” said Senator Coons. “I’m grateful to the National Park Service staff and volunteers who have been preserving this site and preparing the research needed for an investment like the one Senator Carper has secured. Restoring and opening the New Castle Sheriff’s House is the result of Senator Carper’s commitment to enable people to learn about our history by both seeing and experiencing it, and I’m excited to see its transformation.”“Delaware’s significant role in the founding of our nation continues to be told through historical landmarks up and down the First State. It’s imperative that we preserve these spaces that guide us in understanding our past, our present, and our future,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “That’s why I’m excited about today’s announcement of a $5.4 million award that will help the National Park Service rehabilitate the historic Sheriff’s House at First State National Historic Park. Together, the State of Delaware, the New Castle Historical Society, and the National Park Service will safeguard this historic space in New Castle for years and generations to come.”The restoration of the Sheriff’s House will transform the building to serve as the principal location for visitors to get an orientation to the park’s six sites, and to understand the themes that connect them. Visitors are then encouraged to get a more in-depth, place-based visitor experience at the partner sites throughout the state. In addition, the rehabilitation will provide NPS staff office space on the 2nd floor. The construction project includes exterior accessibility improvements, utility improvements, exterior stone repair and repointing, interior restoration and replacement work, and exhibit fabrication and installation.Because the Sheriff’s House is located between the New Castle Court House Museum and the New Castle Arsenal, popular visitor destinations, construction will be limited to the area immediately adjacent to the Sheriff’s House and mitigation measures will be implemented to limit the impact to visitors and staff.The project is being funded through the NPS line-item construction program, and the NPS is coordinating with the State of Delaware and the New Castle Historical Society on the project. Construction has begun and is expected to last about 14 months.###"

WASHINGTON D.C. — CNN Business Perspectives today published an op-ed by Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Trade, discussing how revoking trade with Russia is a critical way to penalize Putin for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The senators criticize Putin’s war of choice and argue that imposing punishing costs on Russia will inflict a powerful blow to its economy. Last week, Congress passed legislation to remove Russia’s most favored nation trade status and President Biden signed the bill into law shortly after.“Rescinding normal trade relations with Russia will send a powerful message to Putin that he cannot act without consequence,” the senators write. “Now that this bill is law, we, along with our allies, know this move will hit Putin where it will hurt him the most: his wallet. And for the crimes he has committed and continues to commit against the Ukrainian people, we should impose sanctions until his bank account runs empty.”To read the full op-ed, click here.###"

Greg also has broad federal court experience, including with intellectual property and corporate law, and serves on the Attorney Advisory Committee for the District Court of Delaware. We applaud President Biden for making this appointment, and keeping his promise to ensure our nation’s courts reflect the diversity of our country. We have confidence that Greg will ably fill the post vacated by Judge Stark and leave his own indelible mark. The people of Delaware and our nation will be well-served with this nomination, and we look forward to a swift hearing and confirmation process.” Williams will be nominated for the judicial vacancy created when Judge Leonard Stark was confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

This funding from the Federal Transit Administration will enable transit agencies like Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC) to modernize and expand services for residents in communities large and small. “We should all be proud of our work and President Biden’s leadership in getting the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law across the finish line. As part of this law, we included historic investments to modernize our nation’s transit systems,” said Senator Tom Carper. “I’m pleased to see these funds now making their way into the First State. These transit investments will help more Delawareans get where they are going while also lowering pollution and traffic and creating economic opportunity — a true win-win.”“President Biden made historic investments in our transit systems when he signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill into law last year,” said Senator Coons. “Many Delawareans rely on systems like DART and SEPTA to get to work, go to school, and get across town.  The $35 million coming to Delaware—and millions more supporting other regional transit systems—will keep these systems running efficiently, frequently, and on-time.  That is money well-spent.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which I championed through the House last year, is at work making long-overdue investments to our nation’s infrastructure, including modernizing our modes of transportation,” said Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. “For Delaware, that means making our public transportation safer, cleaner, and more accessible all while making sure we reduce our carbon footprint and continue to strengthen our domestic supply chains. And this funding will help us do just that – invest in the transit Delawareans rely on every day to live and work in the First State.” “This additional funding will help us realize our goal of reducing fleet emissions by 50% by the year 2030. We continue to modernize our fleet with zero emission buses and the needed infrastructure to support operations. Additionally, we will use these resources to continue to expand access to public transit by reducing barriers and offer other mobility options such as DART Connect microtransit,” said DTC CEO John Sisson.“Every day, transit connects millions of Americans to jobs, schools, groceries, hospitals, resources, and countless other opportunities – all while helping to reduce pollution, congestion, and traffic,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.“Now, thanks to the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making the largest investment in public transit in our nation’s history.”Full-year funding is available following the enactment of an FY 2022 appropriations bill in March. The amounts that states will receive this year reflects the largest ever federal investment in public transit, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allowing thousands of transit agencies to buy new buses and railcars, address their repair backlogs, modernize their fleets, and transition to new technologies to address the climate crisis. These upgrades will support the expansion of U.S. manufacturing due to Buy America requirements that apply to steel, iron and other materials used in public transportation projects that receive federal assistance.“This funding will open more doors to Americans than ever before,” said FTA Administrator Nuria Fernandez. “Every time a door opens on a bus, a streetcar, a train or a ferry, it’s another chance to connect with our communities. With this announcement, we are also helping fulfill key Biden-Harris Administration priorities by addressing equity, workforce, and climate concerns and moving toward a clean, American-made transportation future.”###"

And we can see clearly the outstanding success of this landmark legislation — in 12 years, the ACA has lowered costs and expanded access to quality care for millions of Americans, and led to the largest drop in our nation’s uninsured rate in four decades.“The ACA isn’t perfect — it wasn’t perfect when we crafted it, and it isn’t today. But I like to say if something isn’t perfect, let’s make it better. And when it comes to our health care system, we should always be striving to make it work better for all Americans.  Today’s executive order is another step in making our health care system better serve families in the First State and across the country.”###"

The policy of school meal flexibilities—first implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—has more than tripled the number of Summer Food Service Program meals for Delaware students from 800,000 meals in Summer 2019 to 3,000,000 meals in Summer 2020,according to the Delaware Department of Education.“Right now, 13 million children in the U.S. have to worry about where they will get their next meal,” said Senator Carper. “I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation to ensure that when school is out during the summer, children in the First State and across the nation can count on a good meal for breakfast and lunch. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get this bill across the finish line.”“We need to dedicate resources to make sure that no child goes hungry this summer or the next school year,” said Senator Coons. “Delaware students have faced many challenges through two years of a pandemic, and the last thing they should have to worry about is their next meal. That’s why I’m working with my colleagues in Congress to maintain these critical lifelines for Delaware families.” The current school meal flexibilities are set to expire on June 30, 2022. The Support Kids Not Red Tape Act would extend these flexibilities through September 2023 and also help schools transition back to normal meal operations by October 1, 2023. The bipartisan bill was led by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). In addition to Senators Carper, Coons, Stabenow, and Murkowski, the bill was cosponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Edward Markey (D-Mass), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Margaret Hassan (D-N.H.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).The text of the bill is available here.###"

Senator Carper delivered a keynote address to mark the commissioning, followed by remarks by President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden.To watch the full commissioning commemoration ceremony, click here.“The men who serve — and will serve — aboard the U.S.S. Delaware will bear our state’s name for decades to come as they defend our nation. Through their sacrifice and service, may we grow even closer to that more perfect union,” Senator Carper said in his keynote address.“This latest ship to carry [the name of] the USS Delaware is part of a long tradition of serving our nation proudly and strengthening our nation’s security—the security of the United States of America, and not just us, but our allies and partners around the world as well,” said President Biden in his remarks.“This vessel will always uphold the First State’s motto of liberty and independence…Today marks the beginning of an incredible journey of the ship’s long and faithful service to our country,” Dr. Biden said in her remarks.“What a special day for Delaware and for our country,” said Governor John Carney. “I’ve been so inspired by every sailor on this ship as we’ve watched their progress — training and learning everything about their new home on the USS Delaware. The people of Delaware are proud to embrace the USS Delaware and her crew. Thank you to Senator Carper for your leadership, and thank you to the officers and crew for your service and sacrifice. We salute you.”“Today is a historic day in Delaware as we witnessed the commemorative commissioning ceremony of the Virginia-Class Fast Attack Nuclear submarine USS Delaware, only the seventh vessel to bear the First State’s name,” said Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Congratulations to the US Navy, the crew of this magnificent ship, and those who worked so diligently to make today happen including Senator Carper and Senator Coons. May the First State’s name bring safety, strength, and skill to all of the USS Delaware’s missions going forward.”The USS Delaware is the first Navy ship to be named for the First State since 1923 and the seventh vessel to bear its name overall.In 2012, a Letter to the Editor published in The News Journal, submitted by Delawarean Steven Llanso, prompted Senators Carper and Coons (both D-Del.) and then-Congressman John Carney to send a letter to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus encouraging him to consider naming a submarine after the state of Delaware. Later that same year, the Delaware congressional delegation welcomed the announcement of the naming of the Naval submarine, the USS Delaware. Biden, Carper, and Carney all participated in the keel-laying ceremony – the formal recognition of the start of a ship’s construction – in April 2016.The USS Delaware was built by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, and General Dynamics Electric Boat. Nearly 4,000 shipbuilders have supported the construction of the USS Delaware, and the ship has 135 officers and crew onboard. The USS Delaware is commanded by Commanding Officer Matthew Horton. The ship’s motto is “First Defenders of Liberty.”The USS Delaware is the 18th boat of the Virginia-class. The Virginia-class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSNs) in service with the Navy. The Navy considers it to be the “next generation” of attack submarine. Virginia-class submarines are capable of submerged speeds in excess of 25 knots and are able to stay submerged for up to three months at a time. Virginia-class submarines are armed with Tomahawk Cruise missiles, MK-48 torpedoes, advanced mobile mines and an unmanned under sea vehicle.###"
https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/carper-merkley-colleagues-call-on-usps-to-explain-new-delivery-fleet-plan-push-for-more-electric-vehicles,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and senior member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, along with Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), today led their colleagues in a letter to United States Post Office (USPS) Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, pressing USPS to explain its financial analysis behind its plan to acquire a new delivery fleet comprised of predominantly gas-powered vehicles.“USPS accounts for roughly one-third of the federal fleet and the actions that USPS takes will have a significant impact on whether the United States does its share to combat climate chaos,” wrote the lawmakers. “While investing in a minimum of 20 percent electric postal vehicles is an improvement, the USPS must do more. Not only does USPS’s current plan to invest in predominantly fossil fuel-powered vehicles endanger public health and the environment, the decision is also being made at a time when companies like Federal Express (FedEx) and United Parcel Service (UPS) are increasingly moving towards electric vehicles for economic reasons. We therefore ask that you further explain to us USPS’s decision.“The USPS has repeatedly stated that its decision to replace the majority of its fleet with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) is based on an analysis of USPS’s existing financial condition and its determination that procuring ICEVs is more cost-effective than procuring EVs,” they continued. “Your statements about the costs of procuring ICEVs over EVs contradict recent reports on the cost-effectiveness of purchasing EVs, including one report that found USPS could save taxpayers $4.3 billion over the fleet’s lifetime by using 97 percent electric.”Senator Carper has been a longtime champion of the Postal Service, and has continually pushed the USPS to electrify its new delivery fleet. Last year, Carper applauded USPS’s announcement to replace its outdated, dirty vehicle fleet. Several months later, Carper called on the Postal Service to invest in more electric vehicles than it had pledged. And just last month, Carper appealed directly to Postmaster General DeJoy in a letter urging the agency to reverse course and adopt a cleaner, more sustainable fleet for its next generation of delivery vehicles.In their letter, the lawmakers request a response from USPS on the following items:In addition to Carper and Merkley, 17 other Democratic Senators signed onto the letter, including Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.). The full text of the letter can be found here.###"
