https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-applauds-movement-of-electoral-count-reform-act-in-senate%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today. U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) spoke before the Senate Rules Committee as it considered the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. During his remarks, Padilla spoke about the importance of upholding the Oath of Office elected officials take when entering their office. He also made the case for protecting election workers and the need to make it easier for all eligible Americans to vote. Padilla voted to move the legislation out of the Rules Committee, which passed by a vote of 14-1.“When we were each sworn in, we swore to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,” said Padilla. “That includes working to ensure that an insurrection and attack on our democracy can never happen again. I’m committed to building the necessary support for this bill in the Senate, reaching out to our colleagues in the House, and getting this bill to the President’s desk.”Senator Padilla wants to preserve and protect the free and fair elections that are the foundation of American democracy. During a Senate Judiciary Committee, Padilla questioned elections officials on threats to democracy and safe and fair elections. Padilla also used his platform on the Senate Rules Committee to call on Congress to step up efforts to protect election workers.More information about the hearing is available here.A transcript of Padilla’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, is below:Madame Chair, last week, I was pleased to join as a cosponsor of the Electoral Count Reform Act. I want to speak briefly about why I’m supporting it here today.Electoral Count Act reform is critical to ensuring that the process of certifying future Presidential elections — and the peaceful transfer of power that is fundamental to our democracy — cannot be disrupted as they were on January 6th. As we take this next step in the legislative process, I want to thank all the members involved in crafting this bipartisan bill, because I’m mindful that this isn’t just another vote at another markup. This vote is about living up to our oath of office. When we were each sworn in, we swore to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. That includes working to ensure that an insurrection and attack on our democracy can never happen again. I’m committed to building the necessary support for this bill in the Senate, reaching out to our colleagues in the House, and getting this bill to the President’s desk.But as important as it is to fix the outdated Electoral Count Act, as California’s former Secretary of State, I know this isn’t the only part of our elections system that needs updating. Across the country, too many Americans still experience unnecessary obstacles to exercising their right to vote. And election workers, who stand on the frontlines of our democracy, are increasingly facing threats and harassment for simply doing their jobs. We must do better.So as urgent and as important it is to pass the Electoral Count Reform Act now, I urge all of us to build on the bipartisan effort at the center of this markup today, and to come together again to fully update our election system. To protect our election workers. To secure the fundamental right to vote. And to make it easier for all eligible Americans — Republican, Democrat, and Independent — to participate in our democracy.So thank you, again, to my colleagues for coming together today to strengthen our democratic process. May this be a first step — but an important step — to protect the voices of millions of Americans. I urge my colleagues to vote for the substitute, and for the bill as amended. Thank you. ###"

The Senate Rules Committee, which Padilla is a member of, is set to consider the Electoral Count Reform Act tomorrow.Padilla spoke to Capehart about how Donald Trump and his supporters exploited the Electoral Count Act of 1887 in the lead up to and during the January 6th insurrection. He then laid out how the Electoral Count Reform Act will better protect against rogue governors or legislatures attempting to ignore the will of the people and how it will clarify what the Vice President’s powers are in processing election results.Key Excerpts:A full transcript of their exchange can be found below:CAPEHARTThe effort to prevent another January 6 is underway in the Senate where the rules committee will meet this Tuesday to mark up the Electoral Count Reform Act, a key procedural step toward passage. The bipartisan bill seeks to Trump proof future election certifications in a number of ways. Here to tell us more is Senator Alex Padilla Democrat from California. Senator Padilla, thank you for coming back to the Sunday show. And thank you for coming on set here in Los Angeles.PADILLAAbsolutely, welcome to my neck of the woods. Good to be back with you.CAPEHARTThank you. So Senator, you are on the Rules Committee. There is this procedural vote that’s going to happen. One: why is it so important that we did that this gets done?PADILLAHugely critical, and let me remind folks that in addition to being a senator from California, served as California Secretary of State before joining the Senate, overseeing elections in the most populous and diverse state in America. So, I can talk to everything from the ballot designed to vote by mail to certification of elections and of course, the Electoral Count Act, which kicks in every four years, which was abused, right, exploited, misinterpreted, as part of January 6, when Trump invited and incited a deadly insurrection in the nation’s Capitol, it was the Electoral Count Act that they were abusing. So what we will be able to begin the process of doing the Senate this week is tightening up that language to say a couple of things like better protecting against rogue governors, legislators that may want to look at election results and say, no, nevermind, we’re going to send a different set of electors as part of who should be the next president United States, making it abundantly clear what the powers of the Vice President are and are not when it comes to accepting those electoral votes in Congress every four years because the chance, the threats against Mike Pence, you know, were about perceived ambiguity in the law, I disagree. But if we can tighten up that language we need to do and we need to do it now. Because even though the November midterms are upon us, we know that that’s really the kickstarter, to the next presidential election cycle. So it set the rules clear. Well, in advance of 2024.CAPEHARTRight, this is all about this is all about getting things in place for 2024. However, there’s the Senate bill, that you guys are going to discuss, but there’s also a House bill is which is a little different. Will the two chambers be able to reconcile the differences and actually get a bill that can pass both chambers and get to the President’s desk for a signature?PADILLAI firmly believe so because there’s both bipartisan and bicameral support for the need to get this done and do it sooner rather than later. So slightly different versions of the bill, try to achieve the same goal right now. Whether the Senate acts in the House bill, the House acts in the Senate bill, it’s a conference committee, different ways to get there. But I think there’s building momentum to making sure we get this done.CAPEHARTBut is there bipartisan support to do this? Because are there Republicans who are on board with the Electoral Count Act.PADILLAThere are already 10, maybe even 11 Republicans that have lent their name publicly to the Senate proposal of the Electoral Count Act. We will start hashing out in Rules Committee this week. But bottom line, like I said, making sure we’re protecting against rogue electors or rogue governors, legislators, trying to undermine the will of the people in their respective states, making it clear what the Vice President’s powers are and are not. And the most important thing is one big piece of doing everything we need to do to avoid another January 6, after future elections, and then we go right back to work, by the way. I should not leave this out of the conversation, to the work that we started on protecting their fundamental rights to vote and access to the ballot. If there was one concern about the Electoral Count Act, is it specific to Electoral Count Act, but does not encompass the need to protect voting rights in America. So that work will continue, but will the Electoral Count Act help prevent future insurrections or January 6 type events? Absolutely.CAPEHARTAnd if I heard you correctly, you said there are 10 Republicans in the Senate who are on board, which is significant because you need 10 to overcome a filibuster so action will move in the Senate. ###"

The Election Worker Protection Act would provide states with the resources to recruit and train election workers and ensure these workers’ safety, while also instituting federal safeguards to shield election workers from intimidation and threats. The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation Senator Padilla helped author and spearhead for introduction.“As California’s former Secretary of State, I know that election workers are the backbone of our democratic elections. But increasingly, they are facing threats rooted in misinformation and the Big Lie, simply for doing the critical work of administering our elections,” said Senator Padilla. “I’m supporting the Election Worker Protection Act because we must provide states with the resources they need to protect our election workers, and ensure that our elections remain free and fair.”“Election workers are facing a barrage of threats from those seeking to undermine our democracy,” said Senator Klobuchar. “We need to respond to these threats head on and make sure that election workers are able to do their jobs. This legislation would ensure that state officials and law enforcement have the tools and resources they need to protect those on the frontlines defending our democracy.”“In a recent survey, one in six election officials reported receiving threats because of their jobs on the frontlines of democracy,” said Senator Durbin. “Donald Trump’s Big Lie not only encouraged these violent threats and the destruction of faith in our elections—it facilitated them. As we face this new, unfortunate reality, this bill is a common sense way to protect the safety of the public servants who administer our elections.”“As a Philadelphia City Commissioner during the 2020 elections, my family and I received death threats simply for fulfilling my duty to certify legitimate election results,” said Schmidt. “I know that election workers across our country are facing similar harassment and intimidation on a daily basis from bad faith actors seeking to delegitimize our elections. That’s why it’s critical that Congress pass this commonsense legislation to protect election officials and safeguard our democratic processes.”A group of 15 Secretaries of State, led by Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, joined a letter supporting the Election Worker Protection Act and calling on Congress to take action to protect election workers.“Additional action is needed at the federal level to ensure that all election workers have the necessary support and protection to do their jobs. The Election Worker Protection Act makes clear that these attacks on election workers will not be tolerated,” wrote the Secretaries. “We know what tools are needed to protect election workers, and we look forward to working with Congress to advance this legislation.”Senator Padilla wants to preserve and protect the free and fair elections that are the foundation of American democracy.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-blackburn-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ensure-artists-are-paid-for-their-music-across-all-platforms%ef%bf%bc/,"The bipartisan legislation will ensure artists receive compensation for use of their music on AM/FM radio stationsWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced the bipartisan American Music Fairness Act to ensure artists and music creators receive fair compensation for the use of their songs on AM/FM radio. This legislation will bring corporate radio broadcasters in line with all other music streaming platforms, which already pay artists for their music. Identical legislation (H.R. 4130) has already been introduced and received a hearing in the House, setting Congress up for action this fall.“For too long, our laws have unfairly denied artists the right to receive fair compensation for their hard work and talent on AM/FM broadcasts,” said Senator Padilla. “California’s artists have played a pivotal role in enriching and diversifying our country’s music scene. That is why passing the American Music Fairness Act is so important. It’s time we treat our musical artists with the dignity and respect they deserve for the music they produce and we enjoy every day.”“From Beale Street to Music Row to the hills of East Tennessee, the Volunteer State’s songwriters have undeniably made their mark. However, while broadcasters demand compensation for the content they create and distribute, they don’t apply this view to the songwriters, artists, and musicians whose music they play on the radio without paying royalties. Tennessee’s creators deserve to be compensated for their work. This legislation will ensure that they receive fair payment and can keep the great hits coming,” said Senator Blackburn.“The American Music Fairness Act is gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, and we look forward to progress in the months ahead. Big Radio has used an antiquated loophole to deny payments to artists for decades, but with the help of Senator Blackburn, Senator Padilla and other allies in Congress, this is the year we will finally end this injustice,” said Congressman Joe Crowley, Chairman of the musicFIRST Coalition. “Senators Blackburn and Padilla have the appreciation and respect of the music industry for leading the fight on behalf of the thousands of American artists and creators who deserve to be paid fairly when their work is played on AM/FM radio.”“The American Music Fairness Act is a vital step towards bringing the U.S. music industry into the 21st Century,” said Michael Huppe, President and CEO of SoundExchange. “It ends the injustice of denying music creators payment for their work, levels the playing field between traditional broadcasts and streaming platforms, and caps the royalties that small and community AM/FM radio stations pay at just $500 a year. This is a common-sense – and long overdue — blueprint for a healthier and fairer music industry.”“Music creators have been fighting this battle for decades, so the introduction of the American Music Fairness Act in the Senate is an important step forward in the fight to ensure artists are paid when their music is played on broadcast radio,” said Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “It’s time for artists to be compensated for their creative work that keeps AM/FM radio thriving. We’re thankful to our many Academy members for their continued advocacy, and to Senators Padilla and Blackburn for hearing our collective voice and pushing this legislation forward. We’re hopeful that we’re nearing the finish line to end this inequity that has disadvantaged music people for far too long.”“The introduction of the AMFA bill in the Senate is an important step forward for music artists’ rights,” said Fran Drescher, President of SAG-AFTRA. “I am grateful to Senator Padilla and Senator Blackburn and implore every Congressional member to support AMFA and close up the loophole that allows businesses to exploit workers without pay. Broadcast companies profit from advertising sales because of the creative content musicians and singers record. It stands to reason that the performers who create the content deserve to be compensated just as songwriters are now. The reason it’s called the American Music Fairness Act is because the current situation is wholly unfair and it’s up to Congress to make it fair NOW!”“By introducing the American Music Fairness Act today, Senators Padilla and Blackburn are standing on the side of musicians and small independent record labels who for too long have seen enormous national radio conglomerates make billions of dollars without paying a cent for the sound recordings that draw in their listeners,” said Dr. Richard James Burgess, President and CEO of the American Association of Independent Music. “That’s just not fair, and the status quo should be an insult to all content creators, including broadcasters themselves. The bill has the most generous exception ever for truly small community broadcasters, so the time is now to enact it into law.”“For far too long, our broken and unfair system has let AM/FM radio stations — many of which are owned by just a few massive media corporations — get away with refusing to pay artists when they play their music. While these big corporate broadcast companies gobble up billions upon billions in advertising dollars, the session and background musicians, whose work make all of it possible, receive no compensation whatsoever for their creations. It’s time to right this wrong, and the American Music Fairness Act aims to do just that,” said Ray Hair, International President of the American Federation of Musicians. “It’s vital that Congress protects the livelihoods of those who create the music we know and love. We commend Senator Blackburn, Senator Padilla and our other allies in Congress for championing this cause.”“The American Music Fairness Act takes a smart, calibrated approach towards solving a decades old problem in the radio industry,” said Mitch Glazier, Chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America. “It will finally ensure that recording artists and copyright owners are paid fairly for their work regardless of the technology used to broadcast it while carefully protecting small and noncommercial stations to preserve truly local radio our communities depend upon.”Currently, the United States is the only democratic country in the world in which artists are not compensated for the use of their music on AM/FM radio. By requiring broadcast radio corporations to pay performance royalties to creators for AM/FM radio plays, the American Music Fairness Act would close an antiquated loophole that has allowed corporate broadcasters to forgo compensating artists for the use of their music for decades.In recognition of the important role of locally owned radio stations in communities across the U.S., the American Music Fairness Act also includes strong protections for small, college, and non-commercial stations.The Blackburn-Padilla bill is identical to companion legislation (H.R. 4130) introduced in 2021 in the House of Representatives, which received a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee in February and is currently working its way through the committee process.This legislation will positively impact artists and the music industry at large by:The American Music Fairness Act is endorsed by: the AFL-CIO, the American Association of Independent Music (A2IM), the American Federation of Musicians, the Recording Academy, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), SAG-AFTRA and SoundExchange.Full text of the bill is available here. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-highlights-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding-for-wildfire-recovery-urges-flexibility-for-additional-emergency-relief-funds%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) questioned witnesses during a hearing of the Environment and Public Works Committee entitled “Putting the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Work: The State and Local Perspectives.” During the hearing to examine state and local implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Padilla questioned Regina Romero, mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and Jim Tymon, Executive Director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.Mayor Romero began by thanking Senator Padilla for his efforts to include wildfires in the list of natural disasters covered in the PROTECT program under BIL, which is available to states to make transportation infrastructure more resilient to future weather events and other natural disasters. She underscored the benefit of strategically investing in climate resilient infrastructure in order to avoid costly repairs and long-term disruptions in the wake of natural disasters.During Padilla’s exchange with Mr. Tymon, they discussed the need for states to have additional time to implement projects using federal Emergency Relief funding given the lengthy process that often takes to recover after a disaster. Earlier this year, Padilla led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to Secretary Pete Buttigieg urging the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to provide flexibility to states like California in using relief funds for transportation repair projects on roads, bridges, trails, and transit systems in the aftermath of natural disasters.Key Excerpts:Senator Padilla has been a leader in all phases of wildfire prevention, mitigation, and suppression efforts. Last year, Padilla co-sponsored the Wildfire-Resilient Communities Act and the Smoke-Ready Communities Act, two bills aimed at battling wildfires, protecting workers, and helping combat the effects of wildfire smoke. Padilla also co-sponsored the Smoke Planning and Research Act and the Wildfire Smoke Emergency Declaration Act, bills that aimed to ensure that California has the federal resources it needs to protect communities impacted by wildfire smoke.For more information about the hearing, click here.A full transcript of the exchange can be found below:PADILLA Colleagues, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created the PROTECT Program to fund projects that improve the resiliency of our surface transportation infrastructure. I was proud to author language that added wildfires to the list of natural disasters relevant to resiliency improvement grants under the PROTECT Program, made vegetation management practices and transportation rights of way eligible for grant funding, and prioritizes resiliency improvement grants for addressing the vulnerabilities of surface transportation assets with a high risk of failure due to the impacts of wildfires, clearly something that’s increasingly common in California as well as in your state, Mayor Romero. So, my question is to you, as the Tucson region faces continued wildfire threats, why are the resources that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides central to improving the resiliency of our service transportation infrastructure from wildfires and other natural disasters and climate vulnerabilities?ROMERO Thank you, Senator Padilla. And thank you for adding wildfires to the list of natural disasters in the PROTECT Program. The City of Tucson benefits from having two incredible national parks on both the east side of our city and the west boundary of our city, and we have beautiful mountain ranges surrounding our city. We have seen wildfires in our mountain ranges and they come dangerously close to homes, to residents in our city. At the same time, we must address wildland-urban interface issues including risks of fires, floods, and mudslides and their potential impacts on both private property and public infrastructure. This is why the City of Tucson supports the inclusion of the PROTECT Program in the BIL. It will help ensure that our infrastructure can stand up to such events to protect life, health, and property. Specifically in Tucson, we have, we’re a center for logistics in our region. We’re 60 miles from the Mexican border, we have rail, we have air, we have an interstate that connects our entire state from Tucson. Commercial activity and supply chain shipments move through Tucson every hour, and therefore infrastructure failures in Tucson due to climate change can negatively impact national economic and security interests. So the costs of these failures can be significant, so we need to make sure that we’re putting that resiliency on our infrastructure, so that we don’t have to pay billions of dollars to repair. We need to be able to protect beforehand.PADILLA Yeah, and I appreciate you highlighting the supply chain impacts not just local geography. But once you’re impacting supply chain and logistics of goods movement in addition to people’s movement, then we’re all feeling it indirectly. My next question is in the area of flexibility in delivering emergency relief projects. Under current regulations, the Federal Highway Administration is allowed to begin clawing back emergency relief funding if projects do not initiate construction by the end of the second fiscal year, following the year in which the disaster occurred. Now while states can apply for extensions provided in one-year increments for delays caused by the need for extensive environmental evaluation, litigation, or complex right-of-way acquisition, the Federal Highway Administration has previously denied such requests for a number of projects to repair disaster damage. To help ensure communities that are impacted by natural disasters have adequate time to utilize federal funds to repair their transportation infrastructure, I led a bipartisan letter earlier this year urging DOT to update emergency relief program regulations to extend the construction start deadline by two years. Question is that, for Mr. Tymon, why is this proposed update important to ensuring state Departments of Transportation have practical requirements and a reasonable period of time to carry out their significant and often complex projects to repair transportation assets after a disaster?TYMONWell, thank you for that question, Senator. We are hearing from several states and we’ve seen this over the last, you know, five to eight years that several states are getting into this situation where the post-disaster recovery is such a complex effort that they need additional time beyond those two years to be able to plan and permit the project in a way that makes them, for the most sense for that specific situation. So, we certainly support your efforts to extend that timeline to four years. We think that that’s the best approach. This two-year approach may have worked well 20, 30 years ago, but given the changing nature of how complex these recovery projects are, given climate change, and some of the other challenges that we’re seeing, I think an extension is absolutely appropriate. I do want to also mention, take a moment to mention, we really do appreciate your support for 3011, the legislation that would give states the flexibility to use ARPA funds for transportation projects and to cover those cost increases associated with inflation. So thank you for that.PADILLAAppreciate that acknowledgement. I understand it came up earlier in the hearing and we’re still trying to get it done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-cosponsors-legislation-to-expand-federal-loan-forgiveness-for-educators%ef%bf%bc/,"Bill helps address educator shortages across the country and increases children’s access to a diverse and well-prepared educator workforceWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla joined Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) along with Representatives Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) and Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) to introduce the Loan Forgiveness for Educators Act of 2022 to expand the federal Teacher Loan Forgiveness program. The bill helps address educator shortages across the country and increases children’s access to a diverse and well-prepared educator workforce. Under the provisions of the bill, the federal government would make monthly federal student loan payments for educators serving in early childhood education programs and high-need public schools and completely forgive any outstanding debt after five years of service.The legislation ensures that, in addition to teachers, school leaders and early childhood educators can access these benefits. It would also allow service under this program to concurrently count toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. These changes would help recruit and retain more educators and ensure more diverse candidates can afford comprehensive educator preparation programs, a key strategy to decrease shortages and help increase educator diversity in early childhood and K-12 education.“Education is the key to bright futures for our nation’s children, yet educators throughout the country remain crippled by student loan debt,” said Senator Padilla. “By expanding access to student loan forgiveness for educators, we can ensure that students have access to the highest-quality education from teachers who represent the diversity of their communities. That’s why I am supporting this much needed legislation to address the shortage in our educator workforce and empower future educators to pursue a career in the classroom.”“Educators are the foundation of our classrooms and child care centers—preparing the next generation of leaders and giving them the tools to be successful in life. But teachers, child care workers, and school leaders are faced with high costs of education and the financial burdens that follow, creating hurdles that have only contributed to workforce shortages impacting New Mexico and countless other states,” said Senator Luján. “That’s why I’m introducing legislation to improve the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program and empower a more prepared and diverse workforce to educate our students at every level. By strengthening and expanding this program, this bill will help increase educator recruitment and retention and ensure more children can access the quality education they deserve.”Senator Padilla has been a consistent advocate for students and student borrowers and has urged the President to provide meaningful student debt cancellation, who recently took action to eliminate up to $20,000 in federal student debt per borrower. Padilla cosponsored a resolution calling on President Biden to use his authority under the Higher Education Act to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for federal student loan borrowers. Padilla also cosponsored the College for All Act to make college tuition-free and debt-free for working families and introduced the Basic Assistance for Students in College (BASIC) Act to ensure college students are able to meet their basic needs while pursuing their education.A list of 50 organizations that endorsed the Loan Forgiveness for Educators Act of 2022 can be found here.A summary of the bill can be found here.Full text of the bill is available here. ###"

As a co-founder of the first-ever Hispanic-Serving Institutions Senate Caucus along with Senator Menendez, I’m committed to ensuring HSIs have the support they need to continue uplifting Latino communities across the country.”California is home to 174 HSIs and 51 emerging HSIs, the most of any state in the nation. Last year, Padilla co-founded the first-ever Senate HSI Caucus with Senator Menendez. Earlier this year, Padilla introduced the Hispanic Educational Resources and Empowerment Act (HERE) Act, legislation that would address the enduring gap in college attendance and completion rates for Latino students by creating a new grant program to support partnerships and collaboration between HSIs and school districts with high enrollments of Hispanic and Latino students. Padilla also successfully co-led a bipartisan Senate resolution to express support for increasing the number of Latino students and young professionals entering careers in STEM.“As the proud alumnus of one of New Jersey’s leading Hispanic-Serving Institutions, my life trajectory would not have been possible without the unparalleled academic and professional opportunities I received as a student at St. Peter’s University,” said Senator Menendez. “It is therefore with immense appreciation for my colleagues that I applaud the passage of this bipartisan resolution, which recognizes the profound impact Hispanic-Serving Institutions have in empowering Hispanic students throughout the nation.”“As a member of the HSI Coalition in the Senate, I applaud the outstanding work of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to provide quality education for Texas’s growing Hispanic population,” said Senator Cornyn. “I thank educators at these institutions for helping their students achieve their full potential, especially given the challenges of these past few school years.”The resolution is supported by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).“HACU joins the 559 Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the observance of HSI Week to celebrate the many accomplishments in Hispanic higher education. We are pleased that the U.S. Senate has adopted the bipartisan resolution in recognition of the important role HSIs play in improving access to education and grateful to the offices of Senators Menendez, Padilla, and Cornyn for, once again, leading this effort in the Senate,” said Antonio R. Flores, President and CEO of HACU.In addition to Senators Padilla, Menendez, and Cornyn the resolution is cosponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Full text of the resolution is available here. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-durbin-request-additional-humanitarian-assistance-funding-for-communities-and-organizations-aiding-migrant-families%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif,), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, led eight of their senate colleagues in a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee leadership urging them to provide additional humanitarian assistance funding for FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) in the upcoming government funding stop-gap bill.As Republican governors continue to engage in political stunts with the lives of asylum seekers arriving at the border, EFSP funds will ensure that NGOs and communities are able to provide adequate support services such as food, shelter, transportation, and access to basic health care. Without additional EFSP funding, NGOs and communities that have been providing critical services for years may be forced to scale back or cease their operations.“As you consider the FY 2023 Continuing Resolution, we urge you to include the White House’s anomaly request for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP). Additionally, we request that you consider providing additional funding for this account based on the increased needs of the grantees providing humanitarian assistance and critical services for asylum seekers,” wrote the lawmakers. “Congress has an opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to protecting migrants and the right to seek refuge by extending funding for EFSP. Furthermore, Congress must ensure that communities have the tools necessary to treat migrants fairly and humanely as they flee violence and instability.”Senator Padilla is a strong advocate and leader on immigration reform. Last month, Senator Padilla visited the San Diego border region and joined local NGOs and advocacy organizations to discuss their critical work to protect and welcome asylum seekers and how the federal government can support their efforts. Padilla’s first bill as a U.S. Senator was the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act, which would create an expedited pathway to citizenship for the over 5 million essential workers, including farm workers, without permanent legal status. He is also an original cosponsor of the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, legislation to overhaul the American immigration system, restore fairness and humanity to the system, strengthen families, boost our economy, and open a pathway to citizenship for millions.In addition to Senators Padilla and Durbin, the letter is also signed by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Chairman Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Murphy, and Ranking Member Capito:As you consider the FY 2023 Continuing Resolution, we urge you to include the White House’s anomaly request for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP). Additionally, we request that you consider providing additional funding for this account based on the increased needs of the grantees providing humanitarian assistance and critical services for asylum seekers.EFSP, through supplemental funding, provides reimbursements to local nonprofit and governmental social service organizations, as well as states and localities, for providing shelter, food, transportation, and support services to asylum seekers arriving at our southern border. These funds are needed to ensure that shelters do not face financial difficulties or are not forced to stop their operations, placing the burden on our local communities.Funds appropriated through FY 22 are quickly being drawn down and in the absence of full-year funding, grantees of the program are currently grappling with how to continue to provide critical services to this vulnerable population. Communities and organizations are on the front-lines of assisting migrants coming to our border and resources are being stretched thin as they take on the role of performing a federal government function. This funding is vitally important as more cities in the United States receive refugees and asylum seekers.Congress has an opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to protecting migrants and the right to seek refuge by extending funding for EFSP. Furthermore, Congress must ensure that communities have the tools necessary to treat migrants fairly and humanely as they flee violence and instability.Thank you for your consideration of this request, and we look forward to working with you to reaffirm this commitment.###"

Martin Estrada to serve as U.S. Attorney for California’s Central District. During his remarks, Padilla expressed his strong support for the confirmation of Estrada to the position. Estrada was confirmed unanimously by the Senate this week.“To effectively serve as the chief federal law enforcement officer for such a large and diverse district, you need someone with a proven track record of experience, a credibility with community leaders, and the character to fight for truth and fairness in our justice system. Martin Estrada is the right person for the job,” said Senator Padilla. “Martin has excelled at every stage of his career, and he is more than qualified to serve as U.S. Attorney for California’s Central District. He will bring a temperament, intelligence, and work ethic worthy of the community he will once again serve, and I thank my colleagues for supporting his confirmation.”Senator Padilla is committed to rebuilding a federal judiciary that better reflects and understands the America it serves. Within weeks of being sworn in to the Senate, Padilla established a Judicial Evaluation Commission, that is approximately 70 percent attorneys of color and a majority women, to evaluate candidates for federal judicial vacancies in California. Over the last year, Senator Padilla has worked closely with the Biden administration to recommend and support the nominations of highly-qualified, outstanding federal judges and U.S. Attorneys. to the federal courts.Padilla’s full remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the confirmation of Martin Estrada to be United States Attorney for the Central District of California.The Central District is the largest federal judicial district in the country.It serves over 19 million Californians—almost twice as many people as the next largest district, and about half the population of California.It spans from San Luis Obispo County—home of Los Padres National Forest—to Riverside County and the Mojave Desert;From the Pacific Ocean to our eastern border with Arizona and Nevada.And it’s home to some of the most culturally and racially diverse communities in the country.To effectively serve as the chief federal law enforcement officer for such a large and diverse district, you need someone with a proven track record of experience; a credibility with community leaders; and the character to fight for truth and fairness in our justice system.Martin Estrada is the right person for the job.The proud son of immigrants from Guatemala, Martin has spent most of his life in and around the Central District communities he will now serve as U.S. Attorney.He was raised near Costa Mesa, and earned his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Irvine.After earning his law degree at Stanford Law School, Martin returned home to the Central District, where he clerked for federal district judge Robert Timlin, and then later for Judge Arthur Alarcón on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.After spending time as an associate at the highly-regarded Los Angeles firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Martin served for seven years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Central District, working to protect communities from major crimes.Since 2014, as Partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, he’s represented clients before both federal and state courts in a diverse array of legal practice areas.He’s also maintained a significant pro bono practice, fighting for equal justice and equal access for Dreamers, Latino and Native American students, and students with disabilities.Martin has excelled at every stage of his career, and he is more than qualified to serve as U.S. Attorney for California’s Central District.He will bring a temperament, intelligence, and work ethic worthy of the community he will now once again serve, and I thank my colleagues for supporting his confirmation.Thank you. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-leads-hearing-examining-how-immigrants-can-bolster-depleting-health-care-workforce%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Safety, convened his fifth hearing of the Subcommittee entitled “Flatlining Care: Why Immigrants Are Crucial to Bolstering Our Health Care Workforce.”The hearing focused on health care workforce shortages, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas, and the growing crisis of access to the most basic level of medical care in the United States. Our country’s health care workforce shortages are dire, with studies confirming physician demand in the U.S. will continue to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected total physician shortage of up to 124,000 by 2034. Immigrants are a significant part of the health care workforce, but their potential impact is limited by our outdated immigration system that does not adequately address current workforce shortages in the health care industry. Without reforms, we will continue to face critically-severe and worsening shortages that only compromise the health and wellbeing of all Americans.During the hearing, Senator Padilla heard from Dr. Ram Sanjeev Alur, MD, Hospitalist Physician at Marion Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Illinois; Sarah Peterson, Principal, SPS Immigration PLLC in Minnesota; and Sheriff Urbino “Benny” Martinez of Brooks County, Texas.Padilla opened the hearing by highlighting the growing shortage of health care workers that is impacting Americans’ access to health care, how our health care system has already depended on immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, and made the case for fixing our outdated immigration system, which has allowed this shortage to go unaddressed.Padilla began his questioning by asking about how limitations on nonimmigrant visas impact doctors and other health care professionals. Dr. Alur discussed how the restrictions impeded the ability of immigrant health care workers to provide services to Americans during the peak of the pandemic. Dr. Alur also spoke to the potential benefits of lifting those restrictions, including enabling health care professions to provide care for more people with a wider breadth of services. During this discussion, Ms. Peterson emphasized how immigrant physicians have already stepped up to fill the gaps in underserved areas and how lifting restrictions would increase access to health care services for that population.During a second round of questioning, Padilla and Dr. Alur spoke about the disparities in health care access for rural communities, which are often too far from hubs where health care services are available. Dr. Alur also expressed how the stability offered by green cards would improve the lives of his family as well as his patients, who would have more access to his services.In a final exchange, Padilla and Ms. Peterson spoke about how dealing with issues of immigration and health care shortages are not mutually exclusive. Ms. Peterson emphasized how inaction will only exacerbate the health care shortage problem and become a growing burden on the American people by way of longer wait times, worse health outcomes, and financial burdens.Padilla closed the committee hearing by raising concerns with Republicans’ continued attempts to detract and conflate the hearing topic with politically motivated border security concerns. He reiterated that the hearing had nothing to do with the border and called on his Republican colleagues to work in good faith on bipartisan solutions that are sitting before the Judiciary Committee to address our health care shortage crisis.WATCH: View Video of Padilla’s Opening Remarks / Download Video of Padilla’s Opening RemarksWATCH: View Video of Padilla’s Questioning Round 1 / Download Video of Padilla’s Questioning Round 1WATCH: View Video of Padilla’s Questioning Round 2 / Download Video of Padilla’s Questioning Round 2WATCH: View Video of Padilla’s Final Question and Closing Remarks / Download Video of Padilla’s Final Question and Closing RemarksSenator Padilla is a strong advocate and leader for immigration reform. As Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Padilla has now led five hearings to highlight the urgency of taking action to fix our outdated and broken immigration system. Padilla is an original cosponsor of the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, legislation to overhaul the American immigration system, restore fairness and humanity to the system, strengthen families, boost our economy, and open a pathway to citizenship for millions. He also introduced the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented essential workers and the bipartisan America’s Children Act to provide a pathway to citizenship for ‘Documented Dreamers,’ children of long-term visa holders who have been waiting for years, and often decades, for a green card.Additional information on the hearing is available here.Full transcript of Padilla’s opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, can be found below:Good morning. Welcome to the fifth hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety this Congress.Today we’re here to talk about both the critical role that immigrants play in our nation’s health care system, and the opportunity and obligation we have to confront our nation’s growing shortage of health care workers.I want to thank all of our witnesses who are here today—not only to speak about their personal experiences, but who have a shared goal of improving care for millions of Americans.For that same reason I want to thank Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Cornyn, and all the committee staff who have worked so hard to bring this hearing together.Today, we have an opportunity to shed light on life-saving solutions to the challenges facing our health care system.And we have a chance to reshape our immigration laws in ways that better reflect the needs of our population and economy.Over the last few years, Americans have seen new obstacles to accessing the standard of health care that should be readily available to everyone.Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was experiencing some concerning trends:Our population was aging, with more patients increasing demand for care and more physicians retiring;Sky high student loan debts were driving prospective health care professionals away from the field;And hundreds of hospitals in rural or low-income communities were at risk of closing their doors for good after struggling to recruit physicians.The onset of COVID-19 created an entirely new strain on our workforce—thrusting America’s health care workers onto the frontlines of a crisis, and accelerating burn out in an already fractured system.Tragically, in the first year of the pandemic, 3,600 health care workers died while serving their communities.As a result, we are now facing a dangerous shortage of health care workers.The Association of American Medical Colleges projects the U.S. is facing a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034.That means a shortage of up to 48,000 primary care physicians, and up to 77,100 non-primary care physicians.And 1 million nurses are expected to retire in the next decade.For over two and a half years of a pandemic, Americans had to put doctor’s appointments and life-saving screenings on hold.But as COVID becomes endemic, and as we gain the tools to better manage outbreaks, there shouldn’t be any more excuses for delaying Americans lifesaving care simply because we couldn’t invest in our health care workforce.Luckily, there is a common-sense solution right before us.There are thousands of highly qualified health care professionals living abroad with dreams of coming to America to study, train in their profession, and ultimately save lives.We know immigrant health care workers can help to fill this gap and provide critical care to so many communities in need.How? Because in large part, they already are.One in every four physicians, and one in every six nurses is an immigrant in the United States.There are around 34,000 DACA recipients and 11,600 TPS holders working in the health care field.And with an aging population in desperate need of care, immigrants make up over half of our physicians practicing geriatric medicine, and almost 38 percent of America’s home health aides.Immigrants write our prescriptions;They care for us at our bedsides;They perform highly skilled procedures;And they’re often the cornerstone for rural and low-income communities—places where sometimes one foreign born physician can be tasked with protecting an entire community.There’s no reason we can’t turn to them now to confront this crisis.However, even as we face unprecedented shortages in our health care system, the laws that limit the immigration of highly trained health care workers have gone largely unreformed since the 1990s.There continue to be backlogs in processing green cards for critical health care workers.There are annual caps to employment-based visa categories that have not been met and per country caps that should be updated to meet the demand of the health care industry.And many of the essential workers we relied on at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic still risk uncertainty with their legal status in America.In our hour of need, the United States is effectively discouraging immigrants from trying to come to America to join our health care work force.That needs to change.The very first bill I introduced in the Senate, co-sponsored by Chairman Durbin and others in this committee, would start to protect many of those workers at risk.By providing an expedited pathway to citizenship for the over five million essential workers without permanent status, the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act would protect health care workers who risked their lives to keep our communities safe during this pandemic.I’m also calling on the Senate to pass America’s Children Act and protect “Documented Dreamers”—the children of long-term visa holders who face deportation at the age of 21 without a green card or other immigration status.Many health care professionals worry about their own children aging out of status or losing status completely if something were to happen to the primary visa holder.But as we’ll hear today, we need bold, system-wide reforms that incentivize and welcome immigrants into our health care workforce.And God forbid we force Americans to wait another month, another week, another day to access critical care because we couldn’t come together to fix our immigration system.I am looking forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today about what they’ve seen firsthand, and about how we can work together to fix this broken system.Next, I’ll turn it over to Ranking Member Cornyn for his opening statement. ###"

But increasingly long, dry, and catastrophic wildfire seasons are putting them at serious risk,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “We must work collaboratively to protect these California icons from the threat of climate change and make sure they are preserved for generations to come.”“California’s iconic giant sequoias are facing new and increasing threats from devastating wildfires,” said Senator Feinstein. “Once considered impervious to wildfires, these resilient trees’ defenses are now tragically being overwhelmed by intensifying fires driven by climate change. An estimated 20 percent of all mature giant sequoias have been destroyed since 2020, and scientists predict that without significant action, another 20 percent could be lost in the next three years. This would be a staggering loss, and it’s imperative that we act now to save one of the world’s most majestic and treasured species.”The Save Our Sequoias Act would:###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-fischer-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-expand-veterans-access-to-commercial-drivers-licenses%ef%bf%bc/,"Bill would ensure veterans can use their GI Bill benefits at accredited commercial driver’s license schoolsWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure veterans can utilize their GI benefits at new branches of commercial driver’s license (CDL) schools whose primary institutions have already received regulatory approval. Currently, if an approved trucking school opens a secondary facility in a new location, existing laws require that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and state regulators must deny the branch’s ability to receive GI benefits for two years.“Our veterans deserve access to resources and opportunities to support themselves and their families after serving. This bill not only supports our veterans by expanding work opportunities, it would also help keep goods moving throughout our nation as we continue to face supply chain challenges. And it will expand veterans’ GI Bill benefits to help veterans pursue educational and career training opportunities, while maintaining strong accrediting standards for institutions,” said Senator Padilla.“Veterans have already given so much for our country – the last thing they need is more frustrating red tape that prevents them from pursuing a career that is essential to our modern economy. These technical changes will reverse unnecessary regulations and allow more veterans to take advantage of their GI benefits,” said Senator Fischer, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee.“The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is proud to lend its support to this proposal for veterans seeking commercial driver education programs. This bill could help reduce nationwide supply chain shortages and veteran underemployment. The VFW thanks Senators Fischer and Padilla for their bipartisan efforts to address this multifaceted challenge,” said MaCherie Dunbar, Associate Director of VFW’s National Legislative Service.“This legislation is a win-win. It supports our nation’s heroes in their pursuit of rewarding careers as they transition out of military service, and it expands our industry’s access to this exceptional pool of talent as we need to hire 1.1 million new drivers over the next decade. We thank Senators Fischer and Padilla for standing with America’s veterans and the men and women who keep our economy rolling,” said Chris Spear, American Trucking Associations President & CEO.The Fischer-Padilla legislation would ensure CDL schools that offer courses at new branches do not have to wait two years if the primary institutions have already been approved by the VA and state approving agency to receive funding. By clarifying this two-year moratorium statute, the bill will allow veterans more access to nearby CDL schools and lead to more careers in the trucking industry. CDL schools must still comply with state and VA rules regarding curriculum standards to ensure no programs are exploiting veterans or offering fraudulent courses.Senator Padilla is committed to supporting all those who have fought for our nation’s freedom. From improving immigration services for military families to addressing veteran homelessness and cleaning up harmful PFAS chemicals on military bases, Padilla works to ensure that servicemembers, veterans, and their families receive the support they deserve. He is committed to guaranteeing that our veterans receive the full benefits and care that they have earned.The legislation is endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Moving Veterans Forward, Werner Trucking, American Trucking Association, Commercial Vehicle Training Association, and Nebraska Trucking Association.Full text of the bill is available here. ###"

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-newsom-vargas-gloria-announce-150-million-to-modernize-port-of-entry-infrastructure-along-california-mexico-border/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.)—a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works—announced that the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) will receive a $150 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to support the construction of the new Otay Mesa East land port of entry and related transportation infrastructure along the California-Mexico border in San Diego County.Padilla recently visited the site of this project with San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, Caltrans, and SANDAG and championed this grant, writing letters to U.S. DOT in April and May 2022.“I have been proud to support efforts to upgrade transportation infrastructure around the San Diego County-California border, and I am excited to announce that $150 million in federal funding has been awarded to the project,” said Senator Padilla. “Modernizing our land ports of entry is critical for improving the efficiency of cross-border travel that is an engine of California’s economy. Investing in our border region is important as we work to rebuild equitably from the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”“The Otay Mesa East Port of Entry is one of California’s highest priority infrastructure projects – a state-of-the-art facility that will reduce wait times, curb greenhouse gas emissions, power economic growth, enhance regional mobility and bolster international trade along the busiest border region in the Western Hemisphere,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “I want to thank Sen. Padilla for his support for this project and the Biden-Harris Administration for recognizing its transformative potential with this crucial investment made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”“I’m pleased that the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry project will receive $150 million from the Department of Transportation,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). “These funds are crucial to move construction along, and I’m proud to support this project as we work to improve border efficiency and boost our regional economy.”“The new Otay Mesa East Port of Entry is going to be a game changer for the San Diego region, for California, and our nation,” said San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. “This $150 million in federal funding toward construction of the third port of entry for our region is an investment in increased binational commerce, shorter border wait times, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. I thank Secretary Buttigieg, President Biden, and Vice President Harris for investing in our region and our people.”Along with the new port of entry and associated highway infrastructure, the project includes inspection equipment for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, zero-emission chargers for staff vehicles, a commercial vehicle enforcement facility to be used by the California Highway Patrol and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and deployment of systems to support efficient traffic management throughout the port of entry. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-supports-legislation-to-boost-workers-right-to-unionize%ef%bf%bc/,"California is home to over 2.4 million union workers, accounting for 15.9 percent of wage and salary workers in the stateWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) in reintroducing the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, legislation that would support the right to unionize by prohibiting states from banning union security agreements through “right-to-work” laws.Twenty-seven states have enacted “right-to-work” laws that prevent unions from collecting dues from non-union members who are covered under a union-negotiated contract. These laws make it more difficult for workers to form unions and fight for higher wages and better working conditions in the states that adopt them, resulting in a 5 percent decrease in unionization rates and a decrease in average wages for all full-time workers of 3.1 percent, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, or about $11,000 a year, according to a report released by Representative Sherman’s office. California is home to over 2.4 million union workers, as of 2021, accounting for 15.9 percent of wage and salary workers in the state.A similar proposal is included in the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which the lawmakers support and which would protect American workers’ right to organize and negotiate for better wages and working conditions.“Every worker deserves access to the protections offered by unions, and no state should be able to restrict that right,” said Senator Padilla. “As momentum builds for workers across the country to unionize, I will keep up the fight to ensure that Congress is protecting workers and improving working conditions for all.”“Republicans and their corporate interest backers have imposed state laws with only one goal: destroy unions and discourage workers from organizing for higher wages, fair benefits, and safer working conditions,” said Senator Warren. “At a time when labor unions are growing in both size, popularity, and delivering real wins for workers, Democrats are making clear that we stand in solidarity with workers everywhere, from Starbucks baristas to Google cafeteria workers and everyone in between.”“So called ‘right-to-work’ laws are designed to make it difficult to organize a union,” said Congressman Sherman. “This impacts not only workers who want a union – but general wage levels throughout the state. In an ill-conceived effort to attract business, one state after another has adopted these anti-union laws in a race to the bottom. That is why today I’m proud to partner with Senator Warren to reintroduce the National Right to Unionize Act – legislation I’ve introduced in every session of Congress since 2008.”Senator Padilla is a longtime advocate of equal access to employment, fair wages, the right to organize, and improving workplace safety standards. As a California state senator, Padilla introduced legislation, which was subsequently signed into law, to compel hospitals to adopt a workplace violence prevention plan as a part of the hospital’s overall injury and illness prevention plan. In the U.S. Senate, he has been a strong proponent of the $15 minimum wage and cosponsored the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 to increase the federal minimum wage. He is also a proud cosponsor of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021. Last month, the Senator held an event with Representative Judy Chu in Los Angeles along with union representatives and workers to advocate for federal workplace heat stress protections.In addition to Padilla, Warren, and Sherman, this legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Duckworth (D-Ill.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Luján (D-N.M.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Booker (D-N.J.), Markey (D-Mass.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Hassan (D-N.H.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Smith (D-Minn.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Cardin (D-Md.), Brown (D-Ohio), Hirono (D-Hawai’i), Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Representatives Lynch (D-Mass.), Norton (D-DC), Garamendi (D-Calif.), Cárdenas (D-Calif.), Swalwell (D-Calif.), Moulton (D-Mass.), Speier (D-Calif.), Raskin (D-Md.), Brownley (D-Calif.), Kildee (D-Mich.), Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Jayapal (D-Wash.).The legislation has received support from the following advocacy and expert organizations: The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Steelworkers, Transport Workers Union of America, International Union of Operating Engineers, Communications Workers of America Union, Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, International Association of Machinists, United Food & Commercial Workers Union, and Aerospace Workers, Economic Policy Institute, Worker Power Coalition, and National Employment Law Project.“Senator Warren’s Nationwide Right To Unionize Act would finally start prioritizing the interests of workers in our nation’s labor laws, which have always been stacked in the favor of employers,” said Marc Perrone, President of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. “The brave, essential workers who make up the UFCW can attest to the fact that the best way to improve a workplace has always been for workers to organize, form a union, and fight for their rights together. Right now, thousands upon thousands of Americans are doing exactly that, and, despite all the unfair hurdles they must overcome, workers are successfully organizing in new industries and new workplaces. Passing this bill and rolling back decades upon decades of anti-worker legislation would be one of the single most important steps we can possibly take to empower the American workers that keep this country running.”“So called “right-to-work” laws have their roots in some of the ugliest parts of our country’s history,” said Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director, National Employment Law Project. “Like so many other workplace laws, “right-to-work” is a policy that was designed to make sure that white people did not have to join unions and join their fates and interests to those of Black workers in the South. Today, these laws operate exactly as intended, and drive down wages and conditions of work in far too many states where large proportions of the working class are people of color. NELP commends Senator Warren for introducing the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act to put an end to this policy and to ensure that all workers, regardless of the state in which they live, can join together with their co-workers and build power to help determine their terms and conditions of work.”“So-called ‘right-to-work’ laws have nothing to do with guaranteeing anyone a job – these state laws are driven by anti-worker and anti-union forces seeking to undermine the bargaining power, wages, and the rights of working people,” said Matthew Biggs, President of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) and IFPTE Secretary-Treasurer Gay Henson. “Our union applauds Senator Warren for reintroducing the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act which restores a core labor standard across the U.S. so that all workers have the right to come together, bargain collectively, and build union power in labor unions that have resources to represent all members.”“We are living through an incredible moment in history where more and more workers are increasingly interested in bringing the power of a union to their workplaces,” said CWA President Chris Shelton. “We have an opportunity to transform the labor movement but only if we do what is required of us in this moment and eliminate the barriers workers face to exercise their power. It is way past time to eliminate the right to work for less laws that corporations have used to systematically chip away at the power of labor unions and the ability of workers to come together and collectively fight to better their lives and the lives of their families. We are encouraged by the leadership of Senator Warren and all the supporters of this legislation and committed to see it through the finish line.”“AFGE supports the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act,” said AFGE. “AFGE strongly supports the right of all workers to unionize in the workplace to ensure safety, health, and equity on the job.  AFGE applauds Senator Warren for introducing this bill which will bring us one step closer to granting union rights to all workers.”“Across the country, working people are demanding the freedom to band together and claim a seat at the table – in fact, the latest Gallup Poll shows a 71% approval rating for unions,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “To unrig the system and make it easier to organize, we need to repeal so-called ‘right-to-work’ laws, which are rooted in white supremacy and allow employers to silence the voices of working people. We applaud Senator Warren for pushing back with the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act, which would get these unjust laws off the books and help level the playing field for private-sector workers.”“A recent Gallup poll showed that 71% of Americans support workers’ right to unionize – and tens of millions of Americans would join a union today if they had the chance,” Chip Shannon, Executive Director, Worker Power Coalition. “Right now, a wave of organizing is sweeping the nation as workers at stores like Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joes and Apple are standing up and demanding their rights to collectively bargain at the workplace. For far too long, so-called Right to Work laws have restricted workers from fully realizing their abilities to come together in union to fight for better pay, benefits and working conditions. The Worker Power Coalition, which represents 24 million workers from more than 40 labor and social justice organizations is committed to updating our labor laws to better protect workers. We enthusiastically support the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act.”Full text of the bill is available here. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-raises-public-health-concerns-regarding-wildfire-smoke-and-lack-of-clean-air-in-california-communities%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — As the western United States faces a record breaking and historic heatwave, and as multiple wildfires actively burn across the state, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today questioned witnesses on the impacts of wildfire smoke in California and across the country and reiterated the need to ensure Americans have access to clean air.During the hearing to examine several pieces of legislation related to air quality and community monitoring, Padilla spoke with Dr. Cassandra Moseley, Vice Provost for Academic Operation and Strategy at the University of Oregon, about the critical need to enact wildfire smoke protection legislation. He also spoke with Mr. John Walke, Director of the Clean Air Project, about California’s environmental leadership as the top agricultural state and the critical role that farmers and ranchers play in feeding the nation and in reducing methane emissions and ensuring clean air for all Americans.Key Excerpts:Senator Padilla has been a leader in all phases of wildfire prevention, mitigation, and suppression efforts. Last year, Padilla co-sponsored the Wildfire-Resilient Communities Act and the Smoke-Ready Communities Act, two bills aimed at battling wildfires, protecting workers, and helping combat the effects of wildfire smoke. Padilla also co-sponsored the Smoke Planning and Research Act and the Wildfire Smoke Emergency Declaration Act, bills that aimed to ensure that California has the federal resources it needs to protect communities impacted by wildfire smoke.A full transcript of the exchange can be found below:PADILLAThank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, first of all want to thank Senator Merkley for his leadership in introducing both the Smoke Planning and Research Act of 2021 and the Smoke Ready Communities Act of 2021. It’s not just the state of Oregon, not just the state of California, but it’s the entire western United States. But California in particular, that is all too familiar with the devastation caused by wildfires, not just the fires themselves, I’m also referring to the smell and effects of wildfire smoke. But again, it’s not just a California issue. It’s not just a western United States issue, because a lot of people remember, I got calls from my colleagues, all the way to Illinois, even colleagues on the Eastern Seaboard last year, complaining about the air quality.Think about that the air quality in the East Coast, that was the result of wildfires burning in the West. So it truly is a national concern. Now, wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of air pollutants, clearly unhealthy to breathe, and it can be especially dangerous for children, for the elderly, for pregnant women, for anyone with heart or respiratory conditions. A recent Stanford University study found that single family homes across the country tend to have three to four times higher particulate pollution during wildfire events than public health guidelines recommend. So my question is for Dr. Moseley, given that time is of the essence with increasingly extreme and more frequent wildfires continuing across the West, how crucial do you think it is to enact these bills as quickly as possible to protect public health and better inform communities of the dangers posed by wildfire smoke?MOSELEYThank you for that question. I, wildfire is growing so rapidly that for those of us who live in the West, you can almost barely imagine it. The fires in your state and mine have been just astonishing. And so the importance of taking action to protect people from wildfire smoke is increasingly urgent not only in our states, but as you say across the country as smoke as we learn more and more about the negative impacts of smoke as well as the rapid increase in the number of people in all walks of life who are affected by that smoke.PADILLAI appreciate the near written testimony, your reference to equity concerns, how there’s a disproportionate impact on lower income individuals lower income communities. Mr. Walke, my home state of California has long been recognized as a national leader in the fight against the climate crisis and for our efforts to protect communities from toxic air and water pollution as well. California is also the largest agricultural state, home to a $50 billion agricultural economy, and the largest dairy industry in the country. California’s farmers and ranchers know better than most at our ability to feed the nation and to support family farmers and farmworkers alike relies on clean air and clean water. That’s why California is working to cut methane emissions by at least 40% by 2030, in partnership with farmers and ranchers as they transition to more sustainable manure management and emission reduction practices. Senate Bill 1475 would preemptively restrict EPA is authority, preventing the agency from considering policies to address the industrial livestock sector. To your knowledge, is there precedent for exempting entire industries from major components of the Clean Air Act?WALKENo, certainly not in this manner. I was shocked to learn that agriculture emits more methane emissions in the United States than the oil and gas sector. And the vast majority of that comes from the digestion processes of animals is not a problem that we should be kind of permanently codifying into an exemption in the law. If, you know, if we kick the can down the road with an appropriation writer, we can always change our mind, but if it becomes a permanent exemption, in the Clean Air Act, my experience is it’s just never gonna go away. We’re never going to solve this problem.PADILLASo so just to underscore the point, how important is the EPA operating permit program to the ability of states like California to protect the public and support investments in smart, sustainable agricultural practices?WALKEWell, the key to the operating permit program, and it’s sometimes misunderstood, is really to just have some monitoring and reporting so that there’s public awareness and some accountability and that so the states and the federal government can get a handle on how much the emissions are from this industry. Right now, we don’t know, there’s nothing to require it. EPA was required by a court ordered in 2005 to develop emissions estimation methodologies for concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs. They are 17 years overdue. Now, they’re supposed to come out with something this fall. I’m waiting, you know, with bated breath to see what it will say. But we’re just not taking this problem seriously. And unfortunately, a permanent exemption from the Clean Air Act is just not the right approach, in my opinion.PADILLAThank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ###"

When FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell appeared before Congress in June, she testified that the agency was considering revising the rule that governs the Individual Assistance program. “Despite the Caldor Fire destroying more homes than nine other disasters in 2021 combined, California’s requests for FEMA Individual Assistance have been repeatedly denied,” the senators wrote in a letter to FEMA Administrator Criswell.“It is our understanding that this denial can be traced back to a rule FEMA established in 2019 to consider a state’s total resources when determining whether to provide disaster assistance for individuals.”Full text of the letter follows and is available here:Dear Administrator Criswell, We write to inquire about FEMA’s Individual Assistance approval process and to request any updates you can provide on changing the 2019 rule. When you appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 22, 2022, you testified that FEMA was reevaluating the criteria for FEMA Individual Assistance, and you offered to provide an update on the status of this analysis.As you know, FEMA issued a Major Disaster Declaration for the Caldor Fire, which devastated the town of Grizzly Flats, California. Nearly 222,000 acres were burned in 69 days, and more than 1,000 structures, including 782 homes, were destroyed. However, despite the Caldor Fire destroying more homes than nine other disasters in 2021 combined, California’s requests for FEMA Individual Assistance have been repeatedly denied. It is our understanding that this denial can be traced back to a rule FEMA established in 2019 to consider a state’s total resources when determining whether to provide disaster assistance for individuals. California’s Office of Emergency Services expressed its concerns with this rule during the comment period, including that it would leave survivors without much-needed aid and discriminate against large states, like California, that may need to provide state resources for numerous disasters simultaneously. As you know, California and other Western states continue to face increasingly dangerous and extreme fire seasons. We appreciate your commitment to improving the FEMA Individual Assistance process, and we look forward to hearing the status of your review and working with you to provide more equitable federal disaster assistance for all survivors. Sincerely, ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-encourage-cdc-to-invest-in-west-coast-laboratory%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) today called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to invest in federal laboratory capabilities on the West Coast. The request comes in the wake of a recent push by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to reorganize the agency based on lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We saw early in the COVID-19 pandemic that CDC’s reliance on one reference laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, limited the agency’s capacity and agility,” the senators wrote in a letter to Director Walensky.“We strongly support your efforts to strengthen the agency’s capacity to detect and respond to rare and emerging diseases before new pandemics emerge. Establishing a federal laboratory presence on the West Coast will be a significant improvement to CDC’s current capability.”Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Dr. Walensky:We applaud your efforts to review the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the COVID-19 pandemic and institute reforms to better prepare it for future public health threats. As part of this effort, we recommend building federal laboratory capabilities on the West Coast in order to improve the agency’s readiness to diagnose rare or novel diseases and more swiftly respond to public health threats. We saw early in the COVID-19 pandemic that CDC’s reliance on one reference laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, limited the agency’s capacity and agility. For example, after the first CDC COVID-19 test kits were found to be faulty, all patient samples had to be sent to Atlanta for testing. The substantial delays in getting test results back to states could have been mitigated if the agency had additional capabilities on the West Coast, providing more time for health measures to be put in place to slow COVID-19’s spread.As you know, research published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences estimates that the likelihood of another global pandemic during our children’s lifetime is high and the risk of occurrence is likely to increase three-fold in the next few decades. Climate change is also increasing the risk of emerging infectious diseases that threaten human health and livelihood. We strongly support your efforts to strengthen the agency’s capacity to detect and respond to rare and emerging diseases before new pandemics emerge. Establishing a federal laboratory presence on the West Coast will be a significant improvement to CDC’s current capability. Thank you for your consideration of this priority, and we look forward to continue working with you on this pressing issue.Sincerely,###"

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-chu-join-union-workers-in-los-angeles-to-push-for-federal-heat-stress-protections%ef%bf%bc/,"LOS ANGELES, CA — As temperatures soar to triple digits in areas of Southern California, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Representative Judy Chu (D-Calif.) were in Los Angeles today along with union representatives and workers to advocate for federal workplace heat stress protections.Rising temperatures in California and across the country are increasingly dangerous for workers. Senator Padilla and Representative Chu discussed their bill, the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, to protect the safety and health of workers who are exposed to dangerous heat conditions in the workplace across the nation. The bill is named in honor of Asunción Valdivia, a California farm worker who died in 2004 after picking grapes for ten hours straight in 105-degree temperatures. “While workers face extreme heat amidst record heat waves, there is no federal standard to protect workers from these increasingly hazardous conditions,” said Senator Padilla. “A national heat safety standard is long overdue. That’s why I’m co-leading the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act in the Senate, alongside Representative Judy Chu, to protect the health and safety of our nation’s workers exposed to dangerous heat conditions.“In 2004, United Farm Workers made me aware of Asunción Valdivia’s story, a farmworker who died tragically from heat stress after picking grapes in 105-degree temperatures for ten hours straight,” said Representative Chu. “It was then I knew we had to act — and I am so proud of California for being the first state to adopt a heat standard to protect our workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has already recognized this alarming problem and has made strides forward to provide heat protections. However, I know we must do more, which is why I was proud to stand alongside Senator Padilla and union workers today in support of the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, my bill to ensure our workers not only stay safe and healthy on the job but return home to their families each night. It is time for Congress to stand with our workers and pass this critical legislation!”“The Heat Illness and Fatality Protection Act marks an important step forward for workers by ensuring that they’re protected from, and educated about, the dangers of heat-related illness,” said Ron Herrera, President, Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. “The workers whom we depend on to keep our society functioning, from those in warehousing to our drivers to our farm workers and our sanitation workers, every worker exposed to high heat conditions has the right to be informed of the risks, and have protections and emergency measures in place to keep them safe.”“There’s no time to waste,” said Damon Nagami, a senior attorney with Natural Resources Defense Council. “The world is heating up and people’s lives are on the line. A set of national heat safety safeguards for outdoor and indoor workers is in the works. However, we need this bill to accelerate action because as with so many other environmental health harms, Black, Latinx, low wage, and essential workers are hurt first and worst.”Senator Padilla has been a leading voice in pushing to expedite federal worker protections against heat stress. Last October, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) began implementing Padilla’s plan to protect workers from heat hazards, publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Heat Injury and Illness Prevention in Outdoor and Indoor Work Settings with provisions based on the Senator’s legislation. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued notice it is working on a federal heat stress standard for workers, but the agency takes an average of more than seven years to finalize new standards. The legislation would push for faster action by OSHA to protect our nation’s workers.Workers can file confidential complaints to Cal/OSHA by calling 833-579-0927 and by visiting the Heat Illness Prevention resource page. ###"

Padilla toured San Francisco’s main Monkeypox vaccine site at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital as California surpasses 3,000 Monkeypox cases statewide.“One of the lessons we learned from the COVID pandemic was that a sustained period of limited vaccine availability early in a public health crisis is a recipe for disaster,”said Senator Padilla. “But, unlike COVID, we already have an approved vaccine ready to deploy against Monkeypox. That is why I’ve called on HHS and the CDC to ramp up their efforts to increase vaccine access, and I’ll continue working to ensure that all resources from the federal government are equitably distributed to all corners of California.” “We are proud to stand with Senator Padilla, San Francisco leaders, our local public health peers and community organizers in our ongoing efforts to protect Californians against MPX,” said Dr. Erica Pan, California State Epidemiologist for CDPH. “The state continues to mobilize resources to fight the outbreak, utilizing tools and lessons learned during the pandemic. We remain focused on sharing prevention information and improving access to testing, treatment and vaccine and appreciate the ongoing collaboration with our statewide communities.”“The federal government’s response to this public health emergency has been inadequate and generally disappointing,” said Supervisor Mandelman. “That is why we are so grateful to have an advocate like Senator Padilla in Washington demanding a more robust response. We urge the federal government to expand access to the Mpox vaccine so every Californian who wants a vaccine can get one, and those of us who have gotten our first dose can get a second.”“We know that vaccines can prevent the real suffering that is occurring with people who have been diagnosed with Mpox,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. “We have the need, we have the demand, and we have the infrastructure to deploy the vaccines in a quick and equitable manner, we just need more doses.”“As union members, we have a role to play to collectively advocate for safety, justice, and equity. We fight for these principles for the patients we care for, but also for our communities as a whole,” said Kristin Hardy, a birth and death clerk here at San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco Area Representative for SEIU 1021. “We echo calls for a robust response at all levels of government to keep workers, our patients, and our families safe.”“Equitable vaccine access is key to containing Monkeypox. We can’t make the same mistakes we did with COVID,” said State Senator Scott Wiener. “We need to step up vaccine production and distribution, and make sure that our most vulnerable populations are getting vaccines. Thank you, Senator Padilla for your allyship, and for leading on this issue.”Senator Padilla was one of the first Senators in Congress to call on Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide additional Monkeypox vaccines in California and across the country, expressing concern over limited vaccine supplies and the federal government’s ability to keep pace with the increasing number of people seeking appointments. Most recently, Senators Padilla and Dianne Feinstein sent an additional letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urging him to provide at least 600,000 additional doses of the Monkeypox vaccine to California."

DACA recipients are American in every way except on paper. They are essential workers who have helped us get through the pandemic as doctors, teachers, farmworkers, and grocery store clerks. They contribute to our economy and are part of the fabric of our communities.“While I would have liked to have seen DACA eligibility expanded and for other reforms to be made to the program, it’s clear Congress must take action. Any day now, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the legality of the DACA program, which could once again put DACA beneficiaries at risk. I remain committed to passing legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farmworkers, essential workers, and other immigrant communities.”"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-applauds-president-bidens-historic-student-loan-relief-announcement/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) released the following statement after President Biden announced his plan to provide historic relief to borrowers across the country by forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student debt for Americans who earn less than $125,000 a year and $20,000 for Pell grant recipients, as well as extending the federal moratorium on student loan debt payments through December 31st: “I applaud President Biden’s historic decision to forgive thousands of dollars in student loan debt, target much needed support to low-income students and graduates, and extend the pause on payments.  For too long, students have shouldered overwhelming student loan debt just to get a fighting chance at the American Dream. Facing tens of thousands of dollars in debt, millions of young Americans spend decades under the weight of significant loan payments—or worse, the devastation of default. But today, hardworking Americans won.“First-generation students and communities of color will now be able to better save for their future and build wealth. Young families will have more flexibility to pay for essentials like childcare, rent, transportation, and food. And tens of millions of Americans will be able to put more of their hard-earned paychecks back into the economy—benefiting everyone.”Californians owe nearly $142 billion in student debt, with Black and Latino residents facing the highest rates of default and delinquency. Senator Padilla has been a consistent advocate for students and student borrowers and has urged the President to extend the student loan payment pause and provide meaningful student debt cancellation. Padilla cosponsored a resolution calling on President Biden to use his authority under the Higher Education Act to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for federal student loan borrowers. Padilla also cosponsored the College for All Act to make college tuition-free and debt-free for working families, and he introduced the Basic Assistance for Students in College (BASIC) Act to ensure college students are able to meet their basic needs while pursuing their education."
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/padilla-supports-proposed-rules-on-student-debt-relief-programs-encourages-biden-admin-to-further-strengthen-proposal/,"Senators applaud critical forward progress and outline further steps to strengthen the proposed regulationsWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined 22 of his Senate colleagues in responding to the Department of Education’s proposed rules to expand and improve student debt relief programs. In a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, the Senators applauded the Department’s efforts to provide and expand relief to borrowers whose schools closed or defrauded them, borrowers working in public service, and borrowers who are totally and permanently disabled. The senators encouraged additional steps to improve the Department’s student debt relief programs and ensure borrowers can access the relief they are owed.Californians owe nearly $142 billion in student debt, with Black and Latino residents facing the highest rates of default and delinquency. According to analysis from the Roosevelt Institute, debt cancellation could add more than $173 billion to the nation’s GDP in the first year alone.In their letter, the senators commended the Biden administration’s proposals to deliver and expand relief for these borrowers—steps Senator Padilla and his Democratic colleagues urged the Department to take in a letter last year.“The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed,” wrote the Senators. “This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.”They also detailed additional steps the Department should take to strengthen its proposal. In particular, the senators recommended steps to further strengthen its borrower protection rule, further expand relief for borrowers seeking a closed school discharge and eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, eliminate interest capitalization on all loan types, and further protect students’ right to seek relief in court. The lawmakers also urged the Department to continue working to fix the income-driven repayment system, crack down on bad actors, and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.“As the Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven repayment and gainful employment,” added the Senators. “We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.”Senator Padilla has been a consistent advocate for students and student borrowers and has urged the President to extend the student loan payment pause and provide meaningful student debt cancellation.

The Biden-Harris Administration’s proposed regulations for student loan discharge programs make tremendous progress in providing and expanding relief to borrowers, and we’re pleased to see Senate Democratic priorities, as outlined in the July 1, 2021, letters on program integrity and debt relief, reflected in this proposal.[1] We applaud the proposal’s improvement and streamlining of student loan relief programs and commend the Department’s efforts to support student loan borrowers.For far too long, students who face a variety of barriers have been cheated by predatory for-profit colleges, denied their day in court due to mandatory arbitration agreements, and denied debt relief because of standards that are impossible to meet. Borrowers have seen their balances balloon due to interest capitalization, they have had their lives altered by sudden college closures, and they have faced burdensome and overly-complicated requirements to access debt relief. This Administration has demonstrated its commitment to helping borrowers access the relief they are entitled to and holding institutions accountable for misconduct, including through this draft rule. This proposal represents an enormous step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.For these reasons, we strongly support the Department’s proposed rules for student loan relief programs. Below, we provide detailed input on each of the draft regulations proposed by the Department. We also urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current oversight and enforcement authorities to reign in bad actors and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers. Borrower Defense to RepaymentAfter years of deregulation of the “borrower defense” rule under the previous Administration, which undermined protections for defrauded borrowers and relentlessly denied them relief, we commend the Biden-Harris Administration for reversing course and proposing the strongest borrower defense rule we have ever seen.The previous Administration required borrowers to meet an extremely difficult standard to prove their colleges caused them harm and, as a result, only 7.5 percent of borrower defense claims were estimated to be approved, down from 65 percent under the prior rule.[2] This was so unpopular that Congress—in a bipartisan effort—passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the rule, which was later vetoed by President Donald Trump.[3]We commend your efforts to redress the harms this deregulatory regime caused borrowers—including borrowers from low-income families, first-generation students, students of color, and veterans—who have been targeted and lied to by predatory for-profit institutions. These borrowers deserve to be able to access the loan relief they are entitled to through a fair and streamlined process.Specifically, we strongly support the establishment of a single and streamlined borrower defense standard that better captures the full scope of institutional misconduct relevant for a borrower defense claim. To date, the review process for borrower defense claims has been overly burdensome, with inconsistent regulatory standards depending on loan disbursement date. This has contributed to inequities amongst similarly situated borrowers and lengthy delays in the adjudication of claims, leaving borrowers waiting far too long for relief. The establishment of a single standard with clearer and expanded grounds for borrower defense claims represents a tremendous step forward in protecting consumers and the integrity of the federal financial aid programs. We are also pleased to see that misconduct related to substantial omission of fact and aggressive and deceptive recruitment can serve as a basis for borrower defense under the Department’s draft rule.Additionally, the restoration and strengthening of a group process for borrowers seeking discharge, the establishment of a set timeline for adjudication of both group and individual claims, and the enhanced authorities for the Department to recoup the cost of discharges from predatory institutions are welcome and necessary changes. We support the Department’s approach to establishing a presumption of full discharge in place of the partial relief approach utilized under the last Administration and eliminating the limitations period for borrowers, both of which have created major barriers that have unnecessarily prevented borrowers from accessing the relief to which they are entitled.We remain concerned about the need to protect borrowers from predatory for-profit colleges that are defrauding borrowers at scale and urge you to allow legal assistance organizations, in addition to state attorneys general, to bring forth group claims. Additionally, we encourage you to suspend interest accrual immediately for all borrowers with a pending borrower defense claim. Under the draft regulations, the Department proposes to cease interest accrual for borrowers filing an individual claim only after their claim has been pending for 180 days. Borrowers covered by group claims, meanwhile, would see their interest paused immediately, a distinction that the Department states is based on the premise that not all group members proactively apply for borrower defense. However, no borrower opts into being defrauded or misled by their institution, and no borrower subjected to misconduct should have to see their loan balance balloon while they wait for the Department to take action. We further encourage you to clarify that, if the Secretary reopens a borrower defense application under which a borrower received partial forgiveness, the Secretary may not reduce or rescind previously provided forgiveness. This change would appear to be in alignment with the Department’s intent, given that the preamble states, “a borrower only stands to benefit from the Secretary reopening a borrower defense application that was fully or partially denied.”Lastly, we encourage you to continue to use existing enforcement authorities to hold institutions accountable for engaging in misconduct and wasting taxpayer dollars. We are encouraged by the Department’s ongoing efforts to deliver group discharges of borrower defense claims and look forward to more relief for groups of students who are subject to the same findings of misconduct.Mandatory Pre-dispute Arbitration and Prohibition of Class Action Lawsuits Provisions in Institutions’ Enrollment AgreementsAs part of its deregulatory agenda, the previous Administration removed restrictions banning the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers, thereby allowing institutions to deny students their day in court by requiring them to give up their rights as a condition of enrollment. Instead, students at these institutions are forced to waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits or are required to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, the outcomes of arbitration proceedings are often kept secret—effectively hiding predatory practices from the public and regulators, including the Department. As outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 12 Senate Democrats on program integrity, for-profit colleges have a long track record—unique compared to other sectors of higher education—of imposing these mandatory arbitration agreements and class action lawsuit waivers. [4] For example, a 2016 study examining enrollment contracts from 217 institutions found mandatory arbitration clauses in 98 percent of contracts at for-profit institutions, compared to just seven percent at nonprofits.[5] No public institutions examined in the study required students to settle disputes through arbitration.[6]We applaud the Department’s proposal to reinstate the ban on mandatory arbitration agreements and class action waivers for lawsuits relating to acts or omissions regarding the making of the Federal Direct Loan and the provision of educational services for which such loans are obtained. Since forced arbitration is prevalent in for-profit colleges,[7] the draft proposal to prohibit forced arbitration clauses and class-action waivers will benefit many borrowers attending for-profit colleges. Additionally, the proposal will have a greater impact on Black students who are overrepresented at for-profit schools, by a near 15-percentage point difference, compared to public and private universities.[8] We further commend the collection and public disclosure of arbitral and judicial records related to borrower defense claims. These disclosures will enhance transparency regarding the outcomes of arbitrations, support oversight efforts, and help ensure prospective students and their families have access to information about past instances of institutional fraud and misrepresentation. As you work to finalize the pre-dispute forced arbitration and class action waiver bans, we encourage the Department to make clear that institutions must use the notice language included in the final regulations verbatim and without conditions when providing the required notices to borrowers. We further urge you to clarify the timing of notices sent to borrowers who previously attended institutions that maintained mandatory arbitration and class action waiver requirements. These students should be made aware as quickly as practicable that their rights to pursue claims in court—both as an individual and as part of a class—have been restored.Public Service Loan ForgivenessWe commend the Department’s efforts to expand Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility and codify recent improvements in the consideration of qualifying payments and the application process. As expressed by 23 Senate Democrats in the July 1, 2021, comment letter on debt relief, Senate Democrats support closing holes in PSLF eligibility, removing overly restrictive regulations on qualifying payments, and making it easier for borrowers working in public service to obtain the PSLF forgiveness they are entitled to under the Higher Education Act (HEA).[9]The proposed rule makes critical improvements to the PSLF program by codifying parts of the Biden-Harris Administration’s limited PSLF waiver, which has already resulted in at least $9 billion of forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF.[10] Specifically, we applaud allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including counting payments made prior to consolidation and payments made in multiple installments or outside the 15-day period in current regulations toward PSLF forgiveness. Additionally, the Department’s proposed definition of full-time employment will protect borrowers from being subject to a higher full-time definition set by their employer, ensure eligible borrowers working for multiple employers can obtain relief, and clarify how the Department will calculate the equivalent weekly hours worked for borrowers who are non-tenured instructors.      While we are encouraged by the Department’s necessary proposal to count certain periods of deferment and forbearance toward PSLF, we urge you to count all such periods toward PSLF to reduce unnecessary complexity, address administrative failures by student loan servicers, and fulfill the program’s goal of alleviating the burden of federal student loans for borrowers in public service.[11] Unfortunately, federal investigations have found that student loan servicers have steered borrowers into forbearance, made errors during loan transfers, and failed to advise borrowers about their options to enroll in income-driven repayment plans, under which monthly payments—even if they are $0 payments—count toward PSLF.[12]Borrowers should not lose progress toward forgiveness when a servicer pauses a borrower’s payments to process paperwork, nor should borrowers be penalized for following bad advice from a servicer or experiencing other types of industry misconduct.Under the proposed regulations, the Department contemplates the inclusion of for-profit early childhood education (ECE) employers as qualifying employers for the purposes of PSLF. In response to the Department’s request for comments on this proposal, we support the inclusion of for-profit ECE employers because early childhood educators employed by for-profit ECE employers fundamentally provide a public service to the nation. In addition to providing critical services to educate and care for young children, early childhood educators also play an integral role in supporting working families, businesses and the nation’s economy. According to American Community Survey data, nearly two-thirds of children younger than age six have all parents in the labor force, making access to quality, affordable child care a necessity for working families across the country.[13] Section 455 (m)(3)B)(i) of HEA includes “early childhood education (including licensed or regulated child care, Head Start, and state funded pre-kindergarten)” as part of the statutory definition of a “public service job”, demonstrating Congress’ intent to specifically include the early childhood workforce as eligible for PSLF. The child care sector is a mixed-delivery system that relies at least in part on non-public providers.[14] Additionally, many family child care providers are small businesses with one early childhood educator as both the sole proprietor and sole employee. The vast majority of child care providers are small businesses operating on razor thin profit margins that are usually less than 1 percent.[15]Moreover, when Congress authorized the PSLF program in 2007, the intent was to incentivize employment in public service positions that were presumed to generally have lower wages than other occupations. Today, early childhood educators, who are almost entirely women and 40 percent of whom are women of color—typically earn poverty-level wages despite having highly specialized skills and postsecondary education.[16] Staffing challenges due to inadequate wages for early educators are fueling a nationwide shortage of child care. The inclusion of for-profit early childhood education employers as qualifying employers for PSLF could help recruit and retain highly qualified early educators and strengthen the workforce to ensure that child care remains available to the children and families who need it.The Department should take a multifaceted approach to implement this measure. For example, the Department should collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to identify methods to collect Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for Head Start and Early Head Start programs.[17] Additionally, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act requires states to have in effect licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state.[18] In addition, HHS regulations require each state lead agency to maintain a website with a “localized list of all licensed child care providers” in the state.[19] In turn, HHS operates a national website that links to state databases of child care providers.[20] The Department should consult with HHS on whether and how these state databases may be used to help verify licensed and regulated child care programs. Where practicable, the Department and HHS should automate information-sharing related to qualifying employers and clarify that borrowers working for for-profit ECE employers may pursue the reconsideration process outlined in the proposed rule if they are denied PSLF relief.We also support extending PSLF eligibility to certain self-employed independent contractors who are working on a full-time basis with a qualifying employer, but are not employed directly by the qualifying employer. For example, as noted in the preamble, public defenders and doctors in rural nonprofit hospitals who are independent contractors are not currently eligible for PSLF. Eligibility requirements should be adjusted to account for such types of circumstances particularly in public and nonprofit settings, in which borrowers are providing a public service with a qualifying employer but are not compensated directly by the qualifying employer. Additionally, externally sponsored fellows at not-for-profit organizations and public agencies, such as early career attorneys in public service roles, should be eligible for PSLF. These borrowers are not considered “employees” under the Department’s draft PSLF regulations despite working for a qualifying employer and contributing to the public good. We believe the treatment of contracted fellowships should be distinct from other types of more lucrative, contracted positions in which borrowers may be providing a service to the qualifying employer while being compensated by a non-qualifying employer. In the case of independent contractors, organizations are likely to be willing to sign PSLF forms on their behalf given that they are likely already completing PSLF forms as qualifying employers and often track the number of hours worked for the independent contractors they hire. The Department should clarify the definition of “employee” includes contractors, working for a qualifying employer, who may receive tax forms other than W-2s, including 1099 forms.Relatedly, we support the Department’s ongoing efforts to provide relief to public service workers through the limited PSLF waiver and urge the Department to extend the application deadline for the waiver to align with the implementation of the new changes being made under the Department’s forthcoming rules.Interest CapitalizationAs the Department’s preamble explains, interest capitalization—in which some or all of a borrower’s unpaid interest is added to their principal—can contribute to growing balances, extended time to repayment, and a higher risk of delinquency and default, leading to financial and psychological challenges that hamper successful loan repayment.[21] Furthermore, the Department’s data demonstrate that interest capitalization is particularly harmful for Black borrowers, Pell Grant recipients, borrowers from low-income families, and borrowers who left college without completing a degree or credential.[22]The Department’s proposal to remove interest capitalization where not required by statute represents a vital step in preventing borrowers’ debts from growing over time and reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities in loan repayment outcomes. We applaud the Department’s proposal and encourage you to build on these efforts in the forthcoming regulations for income-driven repayment by eliminating negative amortization on all loan types, as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief.[23] We additionally encourage you to remove capitalization when a borrower in the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan is determined to no longer have a partial financial hardship, as it is currently required (and maintained in the Department’s draft rules) under 34 CFR 685.209(a)(2)(iv). The Department should also examine whether it is still necessary to maintain language capping the amount of interest capitalized under the alternative repayment plan at 34 CFR 685.208(l)(5), as well as the reference to that provision at 34 CFR 685.202(b)(2), as redesignated by the Department’s draft rules, given the proposed striking of 34 CFR 685.202(b)(4).Total and Permanent Disability DischargesAs outlined in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief, current regulations have created unnecessary barriers for borrowers who are entitled to a total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge under the HEA.[24] We strongly support the Department’s proposal to expand the types of acceptable documentation and the list of medical professionals who are authorized to certify a borrower’s eligibility for a TPD discharge. We also commend the Department’s proposed changes to expand the categories of borrowers who may qualify for discharge in alignment with congressional intent. Additionally, we support that the Department’s draft rule would make it possible for qualifying borrowers to access a TPD discharge without an application and encourage the Department to automate the TPD process as much as possible wherever the Department can do so.Under the current TPD regulations, borrowers who receive a discharge are subject to a three-year post-discharge monitoring period during which a borrower’s discharged loan is reinstated if their income rises above a certain level or if they subsequently receive a federal student loan or a TEACH Grant. As the Department’s preamble noted, however, many borrowers have had their loans reinstated due to paperwork issues and not because they had earnings above the threshold for reinstatement. We support that the Department has proposed eliminating the three-year income monitoring period as proposed in the July 1, 2021, letter from 23 Senate Democrats on debt relief.[25] This change will remove unnecessary and harmful barriers that have prevented borrowers from getting the much-needed relief that they are entitled to under the law.However, the Department’s draft rules propose to maintain the reinstatement of loans for borrowers who obtain additional loans or TEACH Grants within three years of receiving TPD discharge. During negotiations, non-federal negotiators recommended reducing the three-year monitoring period to one year, but the Department’s preamble stated that they “[had] not been presented with a reason to change our current position on having a three year limitation on borrowers taking out additional title IV loans.” It appears that the Department intends to use loan reinstatement as a deterrent to discourage future borrowing, but in practice, this policy risks imposing a hefty penalty on borrowers who may not understand the consequences of borrowing new loans.[26] This policy may be particularly harmful for borrowers who discover only after re-enrollment that they will not be able to complete their chosen program or secure work in their desired field.We therefore encourage the Department to revisit this issue, to examine the frequency and impact of loan reinstatement due to subsequent borrowing, and to consider shortening the monitoring period to one year, as suggested by non-federal negotiators. This change would provide more certainty to borrowers who receive a TPD discharge and align with the Department’s overarching efforts to bolster borrowers’ access to debt relief and minimize harmful and punitive consequences associated with borrowing.Closed School DischargesThe closure of an institution of higher education can have severe and life-altering consequences for enrolled students, even as corporate executives and private equity owners escape accountability, as witnessed during the precipitous closure of ITT Technical Institutes and Corinthian Colleges.[27] It is vital that the Department adopt a robust closed school discharge (CSD) rule and maintain a reliable and straightforward CSD process in order to ensure taxpayers and borrowers are not left paying the price when an institution collapses. As part of this effort, 23 Senate Democrats have called on the Department to reinstate the automatic CSD process and process discharges more quickly; eliminate restrictions that prevent students who transfer from receiving a CSD; and extend the look-back window that allows borrowers who left an institution prior to its official closure to access a CSD.[28]We are encouraged by the Department’s proposals to reinstate automatic closed school discharges and extend the look-back window from 120 to 180 days, with the option for a further extension in exceptional circumstances. We also appreciate and support the clarifications regarding what constitutes an exceptional circumstance, how the Department will identify a school’s closure date, and the definition of a program for purposes of the CSD regulations. However, while we appreciate the Department’s proposal to eliminate provisions that deny a CSD to students who transfer, we are concerned that the Department’s alternative—namely, denying a CSD to students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement—will have similarly harmful consequences.Section 437(c)(1) of the HEA requires that the Secretary of Education discharge the loans received by any student who “is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution” and makes no mention of transfers to other institutions.[29] As 23 Senate Democrats pointed out in the July 1, 2021, letter on debt relief, the current regulations denying a CSD to borrowers who transfer to another institution within 3 years of a college’s closure are inconsistent with the statute and should be eliminated [30] Similarly, the HEA does not condition the receipt of a CSD on the rejection of a teach-out plan or agreement. For this reason, and the reasons outlined below, we urge the Department to eliminate these unnecessary restrictions and adopt regulations consistent with the HEA that provide an automatic CSD for any student who is unable to complete their program due to institutional closure, regardless of whether they subsequently transfer or accept or complete a teach-out plan or agreement.Under the Department’s regulations, a teach-out plan is only required to provide for the “equitable treatment of students” and include general details such as a list of currently enrolled students, academic programs offered by the institutions, and other institutions offering similar programs.[31] A student who accepts a teach-out plan does not have any assurance that they will be able to complete their program, much less that program completion will be possible in a timely fashion and with minimal disruption. It is unclear what the Department intends to accomplish by excluding students who “complete” a teach-out plan, but given that those students are not necessarily provided any pathway to transfer previously earned credits or to continue and complete their programs, it seems contrary to the Department’s stated goals to deny them access to an automatic CSD.Teach-out agreements, meanwhile, are subject to more stringent requirements, but still only provide for a “reasonable opportunity” for program completion and do not ensure that students will be able to transfer all (or even a majority) of their credits or access programs that are reasonably affordable (or even comparably priced).[32] As such, it is unreasonable to assume that all students who accept and complete a teach-out plan or agreement will receive their desired credential in a comparable program of study without suffering the consequences of an institutional closure. Even those students who do complete a comparable program through a teach-out plan or agreement may still experience major disruptions and incur significant costs re-taking coursework that does not transfer. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that students pursuing a teach-out plan or agreement will receive a credential that is of comparable value in the workforce as what they might have received had their original institution not closed, particularly given the reputational damage often associated with the closure of an institution. There is also no guarantee that a credential earned through a teach-out agreement will have the same programmatic accreditation as the student’s original program or that it will fulfill any relevant state licensure requirements.Accordingly, we urge the Department to strike the provisions denying a CSD to students who complete a teach-out plan or agreement, and, to the greatest extent practicable, accelerate the timeframe for providing automatic discharges given that the one-year monitoring period would no longer be necessary. If the Department is unwilling to make that change, we urge you to, at a bare minimum, remove the exclusion of students who complete teach-out plans and limit the exclusion of students who complete teach-out agreements to only those students who actually complete a comparable program within a reasonable amount of time (e.g., one year). The Department could also limit the exclusion to students who are able to transfer most or all of their previously earned credits. When a student takes longer to complete their program, or is unable to transfer most or all of their credits, they incur more costs (in both time and money) at their new institution retaking or completing additional credits and experience fewer benefits from the education they received at their previous institution prior to its closure. Lastly, if the Department does opt to restrict access to a CSD based on subsequent enrollment, it should, to the greatest extent practicable, automate data collection (e.g. by using CIP codes and NSLDS enrollment status) rather than requiring new reporting, which may be particularly challenging once institutions have closed and are no longer tracking students who have left.False Certification DischargesWhen an institution falsifies a student’s eligibility for Title IV aid, it should be the institution—not the student—who pays the price. However, as the Department’s preamble explains, the current false certification regulations include two sets of eligibility criteria, creating confusion and establishing different standards and processes for false certification discharges depending on when the loans were first disbursed. Additionally, some borrowers who may be eligible may not have received a discharge because of the difficulty in navigating unnecessarily complex requirements. Therefore, we applaud the Department’s proposal to streamline the false certification discharge process by providing one set of regulatory standards covering all false certification discharge claims. We also support the expansion of acceptable documentation, clarification of applicable dates, and creation of a group false certification discharge process included in the draft rules. These proposals represent a significant step forward for students who have been coerced or defrauded by their schools.The Department’s proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers, protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions, and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex, burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they are owed.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-durbin-lead-colleagues-in-advocating-for-funding-for-dojs-newly-established-office-of-environmental-justice/,"Letter Supports the Administration’s Budget Request for Environmental Justice OfficeWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) led their colleagues in advocating for new funding to support the Department of Justice’s recently established Office of Environmental Justice.Their letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies specifically requests at least $1.4 million to support the newly launched Office of Environmental Justice at DOJ and allocate an additional $6.5 million for DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). The letter states:“We welcome the DOJ’s announcement that they are launching a new Office of Environmental Justice and are eager to provide DOJ with the necessary resources to advance equitable investments, hold polluters accountable, and support historically marginalized communities,” wrote the Senators. “By providing at least $1.4 million for the Office of Environmental Justice, Congress can ensure environmental justice is at the forefront of DOJ’s enforcement work while allowing for improved engagement between DOJ and affected communities.”“We also request no less than $6.5 million in new funding for DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, which protects public health and welfare by enforcing the nation’s environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, safeguarding our natural resources, advancing Tribal sovereignty and resource protection, and more,” the Senators continued. “It is essential that ENRD has the resources it needs to hold polluters accountable for environmental crimes and to better work with communities on the front lines of the climate and environmental justice crises.”Padilla, a member of both the Senate Judiciary and Environment and Public Works Committees, has been a leader in pushing the Department of Justice to hold polluters accountable and better protect underserved communities. Last April, Padilla sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland calling on the Department of Justice to improve enforcement of environmental laws in the Central District of California and asking DOJ to explain their policy regarding the use of non-prosecution agreements that spare corporate polluters of criminal liability. Today, at an Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, Padilla also raised the new Office of Environmental Justice as a necessary resource he has been pushing DOJ to establish, and praised DOJ for issuing an Interim Final Rule to restore the use of Supplemental Environmental Projects – which serve an essential environmental justice function – because they provide tangible benefits and help correct injustices in overburdened communities.In addition to U.S. Senators Padilla and Durbin, the letter is signed by Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.). Full text of the letter can be found here and also below:Dear Chair Shaheen and Ranking Member Moran:As you develop the Fiscal Year 2023 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies subcommittee appropriations bill, we write to request that you meet or exceed the environmental justice funding included in the FY 23 Budget Request submitted by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Specifically, we request that you provide at least $1.4 million to support the newly created Office for Environmental Justice at DOJ and allocate an additional $6.5 million for DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD).Environmental hazards like air, water, and land pollution disproportionately affect communities that have been historically marginalized, such as Tribal communities, low-income populations, and communities of color. Many of these communities have been further neglected by decades of underinvestment in housing, transportation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and health care. We welcome the DOJ’s announcement that they are launching a new Office of Environmental Justice and are eager to provide DOJ with the necessary resources to advance equitable investments, hold polluters accountable, and support historically marginalized communities. By providing at least $1.4 million for the Office of Environmental Justice, Congress can ensure environmental justice is at the forefront of DOJ’s enforcement work while allowing for improved engagement between DOJ and affected communities. We further look forward to advancing legislation to codify the office into law and give DOJ the tools it needs to be effective in its work.In accordance with the President’s Budget Request, we also request no less than $6.5 million in new funding for DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, which protects public health and welfare by enforcing the nation’s environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, safeguarding our natural resources, advancing Tribal sovereignty and resource protection, and more. It is essential that ENRD has the resources it needs to hold polluters accountable for environmental crimes and to better work with communities on the front lines of the climate and environmental justice crises.Supporting DOJ’s community engagement and enforcement of environmental and civil rights laws is critical as we work to mitigate the climate crisis and reduce environmental burdens. We believe this funding will bolster DOJ’s ability to secure environmental justice for our communities and allow all Americans to live pollution free.Thank you for your consideration of our request. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-to-biden-administration-raise-wildland-firefighter-pay/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne (both D-Calif.) joined Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on a bipartisan, bicameral letter calling on the Biden administration to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters to prevent staffing shortages as the fire season begins and wildfires continue to spread throughout the Western United States.“As the 2022 fire season begins, we urge you to take necessary steps to avert critical staffing shortages in the wildland firefighting workforce,” the members wrote. “By using existing authority to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters, we can directly address the recruitment and retention crisis, and ensure that the pending ‘wildland firefighter’ occupational series reflects the professional capabilities of our wildland firefighters.”Federal wildland firefighters are severely underpaid compared to their state counterparts. This low pay, combined with a longer fire season and more intense and dangerous wildfires, means federal land management agencies are faced with significant recruitment and retention problems.Senators Feinstein and Padilla called on the administration last year to increase wildland firefighter pay. President Biden responded by permanently raising the minimum pay rate to $15 per hour. The senators also secured nearly $600 million to increase wildland firefighter pay by up to $20,000 per year in hard-to-fill areas in the bipartisan infrastructure bill.In addition to Senators Padilla, Feinstein, and Sinema, the letter was signed by Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.),Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Representatives Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Penn.), Tom O’Halleran (D-Ariz.), Young Kim (R-Calif.), Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Jason Crow (D-Colo.) Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.), Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.).Full text of the letter is available here and follows:Dear Secretary Vilsack, Secretary Haaland, and Director Ahuja: As the 2022 fire season begins, we urge you to take necessary steps to avert critical staffing shortages in the wildland firefighting workforce. By using existing authority to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters, we can directly address the recruitment and retention crisis, and ensure that the pending “wildland firefighter” occupational series reflects the professional capabilities of our wildland firefighters.Years of low pay and other issues have hollowed out the federal wildland firefighting workforce. Last year, fire officials were unable to fill an unprecedented 1,800 interagency requests for wildland firefighting crews, and more than 1,900 requests for fire engines. In one state, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) had 60 engines idle because of low staffing in the midst of the largest fire in state history. Such shortages exist throughout the West heading into the 2022 fire season, with officials estimating staffing will be below 75% in some regions. This is an urgent threat to natural resources, public safety, and taxpayer dollars, as the Federal Government pays a premium to contract and borrow firefighting resources from state and local authorities when federal resources are unavailable.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must use its authority to stop further attrition in the wildland firefighting workforce. OPM has the authority for special pay rates to address staffing problems caused by significantly higher non-Federal pay rates, the remoteness of the area or location involved, the undesirability of the working conditions or nature of the work involved, and any other circumstances OPM considers appropriate. All these criteria appear applicable in this case.We recognize that OPM, in collaboration with USFS and the Department of Interior (DOI), is in the process of establishing a new “wildland firefighter” occupational series as required under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This job series is an important step towards a sustainable livelihood and career path for federal wildland firefighters, with other steps to include housing support, modified scheduling, and leave policies that reflect the unique nature of wildland firefighting. A new job series that maintains the status quo could lead to a surge in resignations just as fire season begins, and OPM must be clear about how it will use special authorities in the near term to address any shortcoming in the new wildland firefighter occupational series.Given OPM’s function as “the chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the Federal Government,” we wish to underscore some of the factors driving attrition in the wildland firefighting workforce, and their long-term implications. Pay is the most important issue, as it is in many professions and sectors of the economy. However, OPM policies and the challenges of being a wildland firefighter compound financial stress in unique and damaging ways. For example, federal wildland firefighters are paid by the hour, even when they are at an incident and miles from the nearest population center and effectively working. Many state and local firefighters are typically paid on a “portal-to-portal” basis, meaning 24 hours a day, from the time they are assigned to a wildland fire until the time they return, and are reimbursed on that basis by the federal government. Insisting on scheduling and paying federal wildland firefighters in the same manner as other federal employees, rather than other wildland firefighters, is one way in which arbitrary policies are driving recruitment and retention problems.As President Biden said last year, “the only thing that really matters is if there’s enough firefighters.” The land management agencies have lost thousands of wildland firefighters in just the last few years. The federal wildland firefighting workforce is entering a pivotal stretch with the end of OPM’s classification review process and the beginning of fire season. We must stop attrition and commit to rebuilding the ranks of our firefighting service. This starts with increases in pay and benefits. The situation is urgent, and we stand ready to work with you to ensure our federal wildland firefighters are fully supported and compensated.Sincerely, ###"

We look forward to working to ensure that every federal dollar on the table is used to bring this project across the finish line.”Last month, Senator Padilla and Representative Cárdenas joined local officials and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to highlight federal investments for the project. Senators Padilla and Feinstein also recently announced that the FTA will provide over $1.9 billion to California over the next year to invest in transit projects across the state thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which they voted to pass last year.The EPD Pilot Program, authorized by Section 3005(b) of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, is aimed at expediting the delivery of new fixed guideway capital projects, small starts projects, or core capacity improvement projects. These projects must utilize public-private partnerships, be operated and maintained by employees of an existing public transportation provider, and have a federal share not exceeding 25 percent of the project cost.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-support-legislation-to-crack-down-on-wage-theft/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) today released the following statement after they cosponsored the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act.The bill,introduced by Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), aims to stop employers who withhold wages, deny overtime pay, steal tips, misclassify workers and utilize similar tactics that harm their employees. Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (D-Va.) introduced the House version of the bill.“The issue of employers withholding wages, denying overtime and stealing tips is a serious problem that disproportionately affects lower-wage workers, especially those who earn the minimum wage,” said Senators Padilla and Feinstein in a joint statement. “It’s time for Congress to ensure workers are paid the wages they earn and are not taken advantage of by their employers. That’s why we’re proud to cosponsor the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act to help protect American workers from losing billions of dollars in wages.”“No worker should ever be cheated out of the hard-earned pay they have worked for—it’s as simple as that,” said Senator Murray. “That’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues to reintroduce the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act, which strengthens federal protections to make sure all workers are paid for the work they’ve done—and can fully recover wages their employers have stolen from them. It’s time we pass this commonsense bill and ensure workers across the country get paid what they’ve earned.”“Simply put, the biggest economic challenge currently affecting workers across the country is that they are in jobs that do not pay them enough to survive. People are struggling. Every day, countless workers are punching in and working long hours for an honest day’s pay only to have their employers cheat them out of their wages. That is inexcusable, and Congress has the responsibility to act to ensure hard-working people receive their hard-earned wages,” said Congresswoman DeLauro. “The Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act is comprehensive legislation that will strengthen current federal law and empower employees to recover their lost wages. Whether it is compensation for a day’s work or overtime, employees should be paid what they earn. This legislation puts workers first and boosts economic security for families while helping our economy grow.”“It is unacceptable that dishonest employers can steal workers’ wages with little to no consequence. Each year, our most vulnerable workers are cheated out of billions of dollars. We cannot grow the middle class or expect workers to confidently return to the workforce when we don’t even have adequate deterrents to prevent wage theft,” said Chairman Scott. “Workers and employers must be able to trust that our labor laws will hold unscrupulous employers accountable for violating the law and help workers recover the wages stolen from them. This bill would take critical steps to help workers receive the full pay they’ve earned for all hours worked, including overtime pay, and level the playing field for law-abiding employers.”While most employers act honestly and treat workers fairly, some force their employees to work off the clock, refuse to pay workers the minimum wage, deny workers overtime pay or steal workers’ tips.One estimate is that workers lose $50 billion per year that they are legally owed through a variety of minimum wage, overtime, off-the-clock, tip and meal-break violations.These illegal practices, known as “wage theft,” disproportionately harm low-wage workers and amplify poverty. For those with at least 10 years in the workforce, nearly 40 percent describe experiencing wage theft at some point in their careers.As many as 35 percent of tipped workers, and 17 percent of low-wage workers generally, report being paid less than the prevailing local minimum wage in their state. Worse, 46 percent of tipped workers in service industries say they are not compensated at the legally required “time-and-a-half” rate for overtime work.The Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act would strengthen fundamental protections to allow workers to receive the full compensation they have earned and will crack down on corporations that subject workers to these abuses. Taking these steps will help ensure our economy works better for all Americans, not just the wealthiest few.The bill would help combat wage theft and improve wage recovery by:A section-by-section summary of the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act can be found here.A fact sheet on the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act can be found here.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-warren-jayapal-introduce-bill-to-reform-broken-judicial-ethics-system/,"Bicameral legislation would reform the judicial ethics system including by overhauling the judicial recusal process, imposing a code of conduct on the Supreme Court, and banning federal judges from owning individual stockWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and several of their colleagues, introduced the bicameral Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act to overhaul our nation’s judicial ethics laws and restore public faith in our court system.“The legitimacy of our federal judiciary depends on the faith and trust that Americans place in our judges,” said Senator Padilla. “But that trust is eroded if judges, including the Justices of the Supreme Court, are not subject to and abiding by ethical standards that ensure transparency and accountability. It’s time for Congress to act and ensure that such standards are in place and followed.”“I’ve been fighting to reform our judicial ethics system for years. At a time when public trust in the Supreme Court has collapsed to historic lows, it’s critical that we enact legislation to reform this broken system. From banning federal judges from owning individual stocks to overhauling the broken judicial recusal process, my bill would help root out corruption and restore public trust in the federal judiciary – something that Chief Justice Roberts has simply failed to do,” said Senator Warren.“We can no longer stand by while our judges and justices take advantage of our system to build wealth and power at the expense of our country’s most marginalized. A system without basic ethics is a corrupt system,” said Congresswoman Jayapal. “People deserve impartial judges and justices who aren’t beholden to special interests or to their personal agenda. Nobody is above the law. Not even a Supreme Court Justice. My bill with Senator Warren will reinstate the checks and balances needed to ensure a fair and balanced judicial system that fulfills its promise of equal justice under the law.”Ethics scandals have plagued our federal courts for decades. Clerks accuse federal judges of sexual misconduct with little to no recourse. Supreme Court Justices accept lavish international trips and fail to file basic financial disclosure reports. Judges and justices alike sit in cases in which they own individual stock in the parties—and in cases that could directly affect their spouses.The Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act would give Americans confidence that their judges are held to the highest ethical standards and are free from conflicts of interest. Specifically, the bill would:Senator Padilla also joined Senator Warren and Representative Jayapal in a recent bicameral letter to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts demanding answers regarding Justice Thomas’s potential violation of federal ethics laws after reporting on the efforts of his wife, Ms. Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, to overturn the results of the 2020 election.In the U.S. Senate, the legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.). In the U.S. House of Representatives, the legislation is also cosponsored by Representatives Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, André Carson (D-Ind.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Andy Levin (D-Mich.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas.).“We’re facing one of the lowest moments in history for our nation’s highest court. At a time when the federal courts are facing a crisis of confidence from the very people they’re created to serve, the bare minimum required to restore the American people’s trust in our judicial system is to weed out corruption and demand that all judges and justices adhere to a code of conduct,” said Senator Markey. “For federal courts to be respected as arbiters of fairness and justice, they must first hold themselves to fundamental standards outlined in the Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act like avoiding conflicts of interest, refusing lavish gifts, acting with transparency, upholding accountability for the actions of judges and justices, and abiding by an ethics code.”“More than any other branch of government, the courts rely on public trust to operate effectively,” said Senator Smith. “No one before a federal judge should have to think twice about their impartiality or conflicts of interest. This legislation would ensure judges and justices are held to the highest ethical standard and help restore Americans’ faith in the federal judiciary.”The Judicial Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act is endorsed by: Project on Government Oversight (POGO), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), Demand Justice, Public Citizen, End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Campaign Legal Center, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, National Council of Jewish Women, Freedom from Religion Foundation, League of Conservation Voters, Revolving Door Project, 20/20 Vision DC, People for the American Way, American Atheists, Center for Popular Democracy, MoveOn, Alliance for Justice, Transparency International U.S., SEIU, Demand Progress, Common Cause, Government Accountability Project.For full text of the bill, click here.For a one-pager of the bill, click here. ###"

The program launched on April 9th and is the first program of its kind in Oakland where skilled members of the community play a direct role in response to non-emergency calls. The MACRO team members provide community-based interventions and assistance in navigating quality of life referral services throughout the city and county. In less than one month, MACRO has already saved the lives of community members, begun building connections throughout the city of Oakland, and is lessening the burden of 911 calls.“The work being done by the Mobile Assistance Community Responders of Oakland (MACRO) is nothing short of life-saving,” said Senator Padilla. “Through this program, Oakland will become a leader in the movement to prioritize the mental health and safety of vulnerable individuals in our communities. I am proud to have secured funding to support the implementation of MACRO and several other locally developed programs to support mental health and improve public safety in the Bay Area and across the state.”“Oakland thanks Senator Padilla for securing nearly $800,000 to fund our innovative MACRO pilot program, which is becoming a statewide model for compassionate response to calls for service,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. “Our community demanded and created MACRO, and thanks to support from our state and federal partners, Oakland is forging a new path to respond to the specific needs of our most vulnerable residents.”“The MACRO program is truly a collaborative community effort come to fruition,” said MACRO Program Manager Elliott Jones. “The community asked the city to reimagine public safety in the form of a compassionate community response model, and we are working diligently to deliver that with the MACRO program. It’s clear there is a significant need throughout our city and while we’re only focused on two geographic areas during this pilot we are absolutely aware and proud to try to reach those that are most in need of help.”Senator Padilla helped secure $734,000 to support the implementation and training of the MACRO pilot program as part of the bipartisan FY 2022 appropriations package signed by President Biden last month. In addition to supporting MACRO, Padilla secured more than 5.5 million dollars in federal funding for community crisis response service programs to support mental health and improve public safety in the Bay Area and across the state.###"

The letter also calls on the Subcommittee to increase access to zero-emission buses and charging infrastructure for school districts in historically underserved and rural communities.“As you develop the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, we write to request at least $300 million in new funding be provided for zero-emission school buses under the Clean School Bus Program,” wrote the Senators. “We also ask that you include the report language below to enhance the successful deployment of zero-emission buses and robust charging infrastructure for school districts in underserved and rural communities.”Last year, Congress passed a transformational, bipartisan investment in our aging infrastructure, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This law included the largest down payment our country has seen to help electrify our nation’s massive school bus fleet of roughly 480,000 vehicles and provide healthier, cleaner futures for students. However, the $2.5 billion dedicated solely to zero-emission buses, along with an additional $2.5 billion dedicated to zero-emission and alternative fuel buses, only scratches the surface of the needs of providing our nation’s children a clean and healthy ride to and from school.Padilla, Warnock, Cárdenas, and Hayes also previously introduced the Clean Commute for Kids Act, legislation that would invest $25 billion to replace existing diesel buses with electric buses.In the Senate, the letter is also signed by Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Angus King (D-Maine), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).In the House of Representatives, the letter is also signed by Representatives Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), Karen Bass (D-Calif.), Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), André Carson (D-Ind.), Sean Casten (D-Ill.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Emmanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Jerry Connolly (D-Va.), Joe Courtney (D-Conn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa,), Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Bill Foster (D-Ill.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Jesus “Chuy” García (D-Ill.), Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), Ann Kuster (D-N.H.), Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), Al Lawson (D-Fla.), Barabara Lee (D-Calif.), Mike Levin (D-Calif.), Kathy Manning (D-N.C.), Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), Donald McEachin (D-Va.), Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), Jerrold Nadler (D-Calif.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Tom O’Halleran (D-Calif.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), Chris Pappas (D-N.H.), Scott Peters (D-Calif.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), Michael San Nicolas (D-Guam.), John Sarbanes (D-Md.), Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Albio Sires (D-N.J.), Adam Smith (D-Wash.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), Dina Titus (D-Nev.), Lori Trahan (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Nikema Williams (D-Ga.).Full text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Chairs Merkley and Pingree and Ranking Members Murkowski and Joyce:As you develop the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, we write to request at least $300 million in new funding be provided for zero-emission school buses under the Clean School Bus Program. We also ask that you include the report language below to enhance the successful deployment of zero-emission buses and robust charging infrastructure for school districts in underserved and rural communities.The Clean School Bus Program was established as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA; P.L. 117-58). This bipartisan law included a down payment to start electrifying our nation’s massive school bus fleet of roughly 480,000 vehicles and provide healthier, cleaner futures for students. However, the $2.5 billion dedicated solely to zero-emission buses, along with the additional $2.5 billion dedicated to zero-emission and alternative fuel buses, only scratches the surface of what is needed to transition to zero-emission buses and improve the health of the more than 20 million students who ride buses to school each day as well as surrounding communities.To deliver the benefits of electric school buses and meet the growing demand for school bus electrification, the “Clean Commute for Kids Act” (H.R. 2721; S. 1271) calls for a ten-year, $25 billion investment. The additional annual appropriation of at least $300 million for FY 2023 would help bolster the Clean School Bus Program, provide an opportunity for annual engagement beyond the five years of funding provided in the IIJA, support a healthier and more productive learning environment for our nation’s children, and bring the United States closer to meeting its emissions targets.We believe it is also imperative that the Subcommittee support efforts to increase access to zero-emission buses and charging infrastructure for school districts in historically underserved and rural communities. Therefore, we ask that you include report language to encourage the necessary outreach, collaboration, and coordination among school districts and the relevant federal agencies:The Committee provides not less than $300,000,000 to the Clean School Bus Program for zero-emission school bus deployment and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The Committee directs the Agency to conduct outreach to inform, encourage, and support potential award recipients in historically disadvantaged, underserved, and rural communities regarding the availability of resources for the replacement of existing school buses with zero-emission school buses. The Agency shall collaborate with the Department of Energy and Department of Transportation to ensure funding resources for the transition to zero-emission school buses, as well as the necessary charging infrastructure, vehicle-to-grid opportunities, and workforce training programs, are deployed in parallel to optimize program outcomes.Thank you for your consideration of these requests to ensure the Clean School Bus Program is better equipped to improve the health and safety of students, reduce harmful emissions in communities, and meet the needs of our school districts, especially those in historically underserved and rural communities.Sincerely, ###"

The virtual workshop highlighted efforts underway to improve the public safety and health of communities across California.“Major federal funding is coming to California to help us clean up abandoned oil and gas wells across the state,” said Senator Padilla. “When oil and gas wells are left unplugged, they put Californians all across the state in serious danger – polluting our air and drinking water and emitting harmful greenhouse gases. I’ll continue working in Congress to bring additional federal resources to protect communities, reduce toxic emissions, and create good-paying jobs at the same time.”“To reduce pollution and safety hazards from orphan wells, California is pursuing funding provided by the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” said California Secretary of Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot. “We anticipate at least $165 million in federal funding to tackle orphan wells and Governor Newsom has proposed an additional $200 million in state funding to address this health and safety priority.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once in a generation environmental investment in addressing the long-standing issue of unplugged orphan wells and their methane emissions,” said State Oil and Gas Supervisor Uduak-Joe Ntuk. “We thank Senator Padilla for his leadership on moving this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with his office and others to plug and abandon orphan wells across California.”Earlier this year, Senator Padilla announced over $61 million in federal funding for California to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Padilla voted to pass last year. This initial funding has allowed state officials to begin building out well plugging programs, remediating high-priority wells, and collecting additional data regarding the number of orphaned wells.Approximately 5,300 orphan, deserted, and potentially deserted wells are documented in California on state and private lands. Left un-remediated, orphan wells and facilities can contaminate waterways and soil, serve as a source of climate and air pollutants, and present physical hazards to people and wildlife.Video recording of the event can be found HERE.A downloadable version of the presentation can be found HERE. ###"

The senators urged the Transportation Department to revise its criteria for evaluating seismic retrofit projects, including the Golden Gate Bridge.“The Golden Gate Bridge provides a vital transportation link in the state, serving up to 40 million vehicles a year, and is one of the most economically significant bridges in the country,” the senators wrote. “Yet this bridge, and others like it, are disadvantaged when applying for funding under the Bridge Investment Program, because its main threat comes from earthquakes rather than other types of disasters or structural risk.“The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District has designed the retrofit project in strict accordance with applicable design specifications so that it may withstand a ‘maximum credible event,’ including a catastrophic earthquake, which available science unfortunately assesses is overdue. However, despite requiring these important design standards, the Department penalizes these projects and refuses funding because seismic events are rare in any single year despite their destructive nature and likelihood over several years.”Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Buttigieg:We write to express our concern that the Department of Transportation is neglecting to ensure fair distribution of Bridge Investment Program funds for seismic retrofit projects.  Specifically, we urge the Department to revise its criteria for evaluating seismic retrofit projects for projects such as the Golden Gate Bridge.We are very proud of our roles in passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which included $12.5 billion for the Bridge Investment Program, the express purpose of which is to “replace, rehabilitate, preserve, or protect” highway bridges. The Golden Gate Bridge provides a vital transportation link in the state, serving up to 40 million vehicles a year, and is one of the most economically significant bridges in the country.  Yet this bridge, and others like it, are disadvantaged when applying for funding under the Bridge Investment Program, because its main threat comes from earthquakes rather than other types of disasters or structural risk.The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District has designed the retrofit project in strict accordance with applicable design specifications so that it may withstand a “maximum credible event,” including a catastrophic earthquake, which available science unfortunately assesses is overdue. However, despite requiring these important design standards, the Department penalizes these projects and refuses funding because seismic events are rare in any single year despite their destructive nature and likelihood over several years.The Department’s flawed “benefit-cost analysis” methodology for evaluating seismic retrofit projects conflicts with Congressional intent in establishing and funding this program.We urge you to conduct a thorough review of the benefit-cost analysis methodology and incorporate necessary changes as you develop criteria for the Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Bridge Investment Program. The Golden Gate Bridge, along with other critical seismic retrofit projects, deserves a fair chance to compete for funds under this program and fulfill the program’s purpose—to protect necessary bridge infrastructure from avoidable damage.Thank you for your attention to our request. We look forward to working with you to ensure sufficient federal funding for the seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge.Sincerely,###"

I am committed to making health care more affordable and lowering prescription drug costs, including lowering the cost of insulin for millions of Californians.”“The risk to people with diabetes when they cannot afford to take the required amount of insulin to manage their diabetes is immense,” said Dr. Francine R. Kaufman Chief Medical Officer of Senseonics, Inc. “This means insulin must be within reach economically for all who need it to survive and thrive.”“We hear about local Silicon Valley residents making the gut-wrenching choice between buying insulin, paying rent, or putting food on the table,” said Michele Lew, CEO of The Health Trust, a nonprofit in San Jose, CA. “We can – we must – fix this problem.”“People living with diabetes who rely on insulin to live and thrive need Congress to act now to reduce insulin costs. This is especially true for the one in four insulin-dependent people forced to ration insulin doses as a result of the high cost to patients,” said Francisco Prieto, MD, Chair of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) National Advocacy Committee. “It’s time to bring economic relief to millions of Americans forced to stretch beyond their means every month to pay for their insulin. The ADA encourages the U.S. Senate to follow suit and approve legislation that includes the $35 national insulin co-pay cap.”Every year an estimated 272,814 people in California are diagnosed with diabetes. Californians with diagnosed diabetes spend an estimated $39.5 billion each year in insulin costs alone.A downloadable recording of the virtual press conference can be found here. ###"

City Council President Nury Martinez, Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Krekorian, L.A. Metro Vice Chair Ara Najarian, and Executive Secretary of LA-OC Building & Construction Trades Council Chris Hannan.During the event, Padilla highlighted the federal funding that he helped secure for projects throughout the area including a $5 million federal investment for the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project, and the Biden Administration’s proposal to provide $250 million for the project in Fiscal Year 2023 through the Federal Transit Administration’s Expedited Project Delivery (EPD) Pilot Program.“Strong public transit systems are crucial to our local economies and critical to creating opportunities in disadvantaged communities in our state,” said Senator Padilla. “It was an honor to be back in my hometown to highlight this local-federal collaboration to deliver expanded access to public transit for the San Fernando Valley. The services offered by public transportation impact how individuals get to work every day and how consumers access local businesses. I am proud to have secured this funding to expand the LA Metro system because efficient and effective public transit means people can get to work and readily access the resources they need.”“When we invest in public transit, we bring opportunities to our community — opportunities to get to work, school, appointments, see loved ones,” said Congressman Cárdenas. “I know because I grew up on the side of town where buses rarely reached our neighborhoods, let alone trains. Today, we’re one step closer to connecting our friends and neighbors with a train that will finally serve the Northeast San Fernando Valley. Thanks to Senator Padilla, Council President Martinez and Councilmember Krekorian, we’re bringing home $5 million in federal dollars to build 14 new Metro stations up and down Van Nuys Blvd. This federal investment will improve transportation equity in our community, connecting folks to their workplaces, local businesses and one another.”“It brings me so much pride to know that three people from Pacoima — children of immigrants — were able to make this project a reality,” said Council President Nury Martinez. “People in the Valley have been wanting a train for decades, so this will help other working class immigrant families in the community we grew up in. This is what happens when elected representatives come from the districts they represent.”“Not long ago when the leaders of the San Fernando Valley gathered together to determine the most important transportation priorities of the Valley, Metro had 100 transit stations on rail lines around the County, and exactly two of them were in the San Fernando Valley, a place that’s home to 2 million people, 40 percent of the population of the City of Los Angeles,” said Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Krekorian, whose district encompasses the Van Nuys Metro Station. “This is a big step forward for transit in the San Fernando Valley, but it’s so much more than that, because Metro is committed to building affordable housing on its properties adjacent to these lines throughout the County,” said Krekorian, who is also a Director of the Metro Board. “And most importantly, Metro is committed to local hire, thanks to the work that Senator Padilla and Congressman Cardenas have been championing in Congress to ensure that when we build these lines we give job opportunities and opportunities for small business to flourish as well.”“In his brief time in the U.S. Senate, Senator Padilla has established a well-deserved reputation as a strong and effective advocate in bringing federal transportation dollars back to Los Angeles County,” said Metro Board Chair and L.A. County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, representing the First District. “The fact that he serves on the Senate’s powerful Environment and Public Works Committee is a big plus for all transportation stakeholders across the Golden State and especially for us at Metro. Thank you, Senator Padilla, for being such a great champion for the East San Fernando Valley Transit Corridor Project and Metro’s broader efforts in Washington, DC.”“Senator Padilla understands firsthand the challenges of commuting across Los Angeles—and so do the 140,000 members of our local unions,” said Chris Hannan, Executive Secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council. “This new rail line will allow San Fernando Valley residents to access job opportunities connecting to the Metrolink, Orange Line and in coming years along the Sepulveda Corridor into LA’s West Side. And, under our industry-leading Project Labor Agreement, it will open the door to a successful, middle-class career for local residents to join the Building Trades.”This press conference took place as many Californians are returning to in-person work, and relying on public transportation more in the coming months than since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Video of the remarks can be found here.A downloadable version of the remarks can be found here. ###"

I am committed to continuing my work in the Senate to bolster space diplomacy and ensure that space assets can be used responsibly by all spacefaring nations.”The Vandenberg Space Force Base has supported tens of thousands of jobs across the state of California and is responsible for the majority of U.S. launches from the West Coast. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-announce-6-7-million-in-forest-restoration-funding-for-california%ef%bf%bc/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) today announced federal funding for three California forest restoration projects totaling $6.7 million. Forest restoration projects are a critical tool to reduce the risk of severe wildfires.In addition to decreasing the risk of devastating wildfires by removing the fuel that feeds them, these landscape restoration activities establish forest vegetation by planting, seeding, and natural regeneration, reducing or eradicating invasive plants, and enhancing stream habitat.The funds are part of the U.S. Forest Service’s Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program and were made available through a combination of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual appropriations. “I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for continuing to prioritize California when funding projects that will help prevent wildfires,” Senator Padilla said. “This funding will protect communities while improving the health of our forests and California’s resilience against wildfires. The work done now removing excess, dead, and hazardous vegetation will restore key areas of our forests and improve our watersheds. Preparing for fires and responsibly managing our public lands requires a collaborative effort and these projects will be carried out with renewed cooperation between federal, state and tribal government partners.” “Wildfires are a near-constant threat for California, and some of the best tools to combat that risk are large-scale forest restoration programs that remove dead and dying trees and restore native vegetation,” Feinstein said. “I thank the Biden administration for providing these funds and will continue to work with USDA and the Forest Service to increase the scale and frequency of forest restoration projects. These restoration projects are also the focus of my bill, the Wildfire Emergency Act, which has received a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and I expect top advance out of committee in the coming months.”The California projects that are receiving funding:·$757,000 for the Dinkey Collaborative, a 154,000-acre project in the Sierra National Forest that is a critical site for restoration due to unprecedented levels of hazardous fuels caused by Southern Sierran tree mortality.·$3 million for the Western Klamath Mountains Fire and Fire Resiliency Project, a 1.2-million-acre project in Northwest California to protect communities and critical transportation routes. Work will include increasing watershed health and ecosystem resilience and preparation for traditional controlled burns.·$3 million for the North Yuba River watershed in Northern California covering 356,000 acres. This watershed, which provides clean water for homes, communities, businesses and ecosystems, is a critical project site due to its high wildfire hazard potential and susceptibility to insects, disease and drought.###"

Last month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear National Pork Producers Council v. Ross, a lawsuit challenging Proposition 12. “Given the impacts of the law, we urge your Department to support California and other states that restrict sales of a product with the intent of protecting the health and safety of consumers within their state,” the senators wrote. “States should not be stripped of their authority to mitigate the harm that inhumane farm animal confinement poses to animals, people, and the environment.“Further, overturning this popular California law would conflict with longstanding judicial precedent and jeopardize established health, safety, environmental protection, and animal welfare regulations in dozens of states.  In our federal system, states have significant autonomy in the establishment of social and economic policy in a range of areas, from climate change (e.g., use of renewable energy), to labor, to pollution (e.g., mandatory recycled-content laws).  Expanding the Dormant Commerce Clause as NPPC seeks to do in this case would have ramifications far beyond the pork, chicken, and veal industries.”Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack:We write to urge you to support California’s Proposition 12 before the Supreme Court, and to support all states’ authority to protect the well-being of their citizens and animal welfare. As you know, on March 28, 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear National Pork Producers Council v. Ross, the National Pork Producers Council’s (NPPC) challenge to California’s Proposition 12 that sets humane standards for farm animal products sold in California.  This law is intended to prevent animal cruelty, protect the health and safety of California consumers, and decrease the risk of foodborne illness by phasing out extreme methods of farm animal confinement. California’s Proposition 12 only regulates in-state sales of certain pork products at issue in this case (as well as in-state sales of certain egg and veal products) and does not regulate out-of-state producers. We believe that the previous Administration’s position on California’s Proposition 12 was based on a misconception of the law. As is stated in the ballot measure text itself, the purpose of Proposition 12 was not only to improve animal welfare, but to “phase out extreme methods of farm animal confinement, which also threaten the health and safety of California consumers, and increase the risk of foodborne illness and associated negative fiscal impacts on the State of California.” Given the impacts of the law, we urge your Department to support California and other states that restrict sales of a product with the intent of protecting the health and safety of consumers within their state.  States should not be stripped of their authority to mitigate the harm that inhumane farm animal confinement poses to animals, people, and the environment.Further, overturning this popular California law would conflict with longstanding judicial precedent and jeopardize established health, safety, environmental protection, and animal welfare regulations in dozens of states.  In our federal system, states have significant autonomy in the establishment of social and economic policy in a range of areas, from climate change (e.g., use of renewable energy), to labor, to pollution (e.g., mandatory recycled-content laws).  Expanding the Dormant Commerce Clause as NPPC seeks to do in this case would have ramifications far beyond the pork, chicken, and veal industries.Considering the serious and needless threats to animal welfare and states’ authority to protect the well-being of their citizens, we request that you support California’s Proposition 12 in further actions by your Department before the Supreme Court.  Thank you for your consideration of our request. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-announce-nearly-30-million-to-support-rural-communities-across-california/,"Funding for the Secure Rural Schools program will support public schools, roads, and other municipal servicesWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) announced that California will receive $29.9 million to support public schools, roads, and other municipal services through the Secure Rural Schools program. The program was reauthorized for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is creating jobs and improving the resilience of our rural communities,” said Senator Padilla. “With nearly $30 million coming to California, we can support projects that will make it easier for children to get to school, improve the stability of our infrastructure, and better prepare emergency services. This is critical funding when so many of California’s rural communities face an increased threat from wildfires in nearby national forests.”“More than half of the forests in California are on federal land so it’s imperative that the federal government remains committed to supporting the communities in or near our national forests,” said Senator Feinstein. “The funds we secured in the bipartisan infrastructure law are part of that commitment and will support schools, roads and other public services in California’s rural communities.”The Forest Service retains a portion of Secure Rural Schools program funds to support projects that improve forest conditions and support jobs in rural communities. Resource advisory committees, made up of residents representing varied interests and areas of expertise, review and recommend projects that meet their local needs.Since 1908, 25 percent of Forest Service revenues from timber sales, mineral leases, livestock grazing, recreation fees, and other funding sources are shared with states and counties that have national forests. By the 1990s, Forest Service payments from these sources began to decline, largely because of long-term diminished volume in timber sales. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 authorized enhanced payments to help states and counties fund local services otherwise at risk because of this decline in revenue.Over the past 10 years, the Forest Service has distributed $2.6 billion through the Secure Rural Schools program. This year, states will receive $238 million for distribution to counties. Each state’s payment amount is determined by various factors set in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including the number of counties electing to share in a state’s payment. ###"

It would also require the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to improve tribal engagement and co-management of the National Monument, including for historic preservation, archaeological sites, and forest health. Congressmen John Garamendi (D-Calif.-03) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.-05) lead the legislation in the House.Senators Padilla and Feinstein are strong advocates for the preservation of California’s natural lands. Last year, the senators introduced the PUBLIC Lands Act, legislation to increase protections for over a million acres of public lands throughout Northwest California, the Central Coast, and Los Angeles. They also introduced the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act, a bill to add more than 191,000 acres of the Rim of the Valley Corridor to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.“California has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes in the world—and it is our duty to preserve these pristine outdoor spaces and rare natural habitats to combat the climate crisis and benefit future generations,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “I am proud to be introducing this legislation to not only expand the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument, but to usher in a new era of cooperative stewardship between our federal land management agencies and local tribes. For over 11,000 years, dozens of tribes have called “Molok Luyuk” home, and with the enactment of our bill, we can ensure that their unique tribal knowledge, history, and cultural practices will permanently be part of the National Monument.”“This region of California is rich with Native American cultural landmarks and diverse ecosystems and wildlife. Since 2015, I’ve worked to protect and expand the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument, securing more than 330,000 acres for federal protection. I’m proud to join Senator Padilla to build on the work started eight years ago to add another 4,000 acres to the monument,” Senator Feinstein said.“Conserving California’s special places has been a lifelong passion throughout my tenure in the state legislature, as Deputy Secretary of the Interior to President Clinton, and now as a member of Congress representing Lake County. I introduced the ‘Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act’ with Congressman Mike Thompson in the U.S. House of Representatives to protect and expand the national monument, and I applaud Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein for championing this legislation in the United States Senate,” said Congressman John Garamendi D-Calif.-03).“Back in 2016, I worked to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Monument,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.-05). “Earlier this year, I was proud to join Rep. Garamendi to expand this designation and protect more of our pristine public lands. The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is crucial for protecting the biodiversity of the land and boosting our economy through recreational opportunities. I am glad the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act is being taken up in the Senate, led by Senators Feinstein and Padilla, and I look forward to seeing it signed into law by President Biden.”“Molok Luyuk – or Condor Ridge – is a special part of Northern California and deserves special protections. We appreciate Senator Padilla and Feinstein’s leadership on this and their insistence that Native American voices be part of the conversation,” said Chairman Anthony Roberts of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. “Our ancestors traveled and traded there for centuries.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-urges-senate-colleagues-to-pass-voting-rights-legislation-to-protect-our-democracy/,"“We must rise to this generational moment of challenge, in the spirit of Dr. King, and pass this voting rights bill.”WASHINGTON, D.C. — Following Martin Luther King Jr. Day, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Judiciary and Senate Rules committees, delivered a speech on the floor of the United States Senate urging his colleagues to take action to pass critical voting rights legislation — the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Padilla reiterated his position that in the face of Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats must change the filibuster rule to protect voting rights for every American.Padilla co-led the introduction of the Freedom to Vote Act, legislation to improve access to the ballot for Americans, help strengthen our election system, and protect our democracy from relentless voter suppression attacks in state legislatures across the country. And he is a strong advocate of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act which restores and strengthens the voting rights protections in the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Key Excerpts:The full transcript of Padilla’s remarks as prepared for delivery below:Madam President, yesterday we celebrated the moral vision and exceptional courage of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Born and raised under the violent oppression of Jim Crow segregation, Dr. King deeply felt the lasting wounds of slavery and segregation.And yet, he believed in the promise of America’s highest ideal: a system of democracy that recognizes that we are all created equal.In 1957, Dr. King told a crowd of civil rights leaders, “Our most urgent plea to the federal government is to guarantee our voting rights… Give us the ballot and we will creatively join in the freeing of the soul of America.”Time and again, from a bridge in Selma to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King—and the civil rights movement collectively—forced this country to confront the brutal injustice of white supremacy.Dr. King kindled a movement of peaceful protest, voter registration, and legal revolution.His leadership helped secure the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965—a monument to freedom, and a guardian of our multiracial democracy.As important a step that was, Dr. King also understood that the path of progress, the road to freedom, would not be linear.It would not be direct.And it would be threatened by setbacks.Recent years have illustrated just how right Dr. King was.The clock is turning back on voting rights—and too many people, inside this building and outside it, are ignoring or denying the alarm bells.Madam President, To truly honor Martin Luther King we must rededicate ourselves to the cause of freedom and equality.We cannot wait for a convenient season to act.We cannot wait for another Bloody Sunday.Look around. This is our moment.The threats to democracy today may look different than Bull Connor with a bullhorn—but they are no less real.Now, when Republicans claim this is all hyperbole, consider this:In the year since our nation’s most secure election ever, with record voter turnout, Republican state legislatures have passed 34 laws to restrict access to the ballot, and threaten election security.Just look at Georgia, where Republicans passed an elections bill, SB 202, on a purely partisan basis last spring.In the 2020 election, Georgians voted in record numbers.Many voted by mail or used early voting options to cast their ballots safely and securely during this once in a century global health pandemic.Those ballots were processed, counted, audited and certified.So how did Republicans respond?They wrote SB 202 to cut the number of early voting drop boxes in Atlanta by more than 75 percent.To make it harder for voters who go to the wrong polling place to cast a ballot and have their votes for statewide contests counted.To stop new voters from being able to register to vote in time for a runoff election.Make no mistake, Republicans will deny the intention but the effect is clear.These changes disproportionately disenfranchise the votes and the voices of people of color.And, when voters end up standing in line for hours to cast their votes on Election Day—as voters of color disproportionately have to do—SB 202 will prevent volunteers from offering them food or water.Think about that.Someone stands in line outdoors for hours to do their patriotic duty.And Georgia Republicans make it a crime to give that person a bottle of water.SB202 isn’t about election security or voter fraud.It’s about erecting barriers for low-income voters, voters of color, and younger voters to participate in our democracy.As a member of the Senate Rules Committee, I traveled to Georgia last summer for a field hearing on voter suppression.Last week, I traveled there with President Biden and Vice President Harris.So when Minority Leader McConnell tries to tell you that no state in America is making it harder to vote, he’s wrong. The people of this country deserve to hear the truth.Not just from Georgia, but in Texas, where a new law empowers partisan poll watchers to threaten election officials with lawsuits.In Arizona, where a new law will unnecessarily cut tens of thousands of voters from the Permanent Early Voting List.34 new state laws, in the past year alone, will raise new obstacles for people who simply want to cast their ballots.And that is to say nothing of the hundreds more that were proposed, and will surely be reintroduced, if we do not act.The clock on Dr. King’s victories is already turning back.The alarm bells of our democracy are ringing.They’ve been ringing since 2013, when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in their decision in Shelby v. Holder.And yet, the Senate has failed three times this last year alone to even debate a voting rights bill.We’ve failed to debate because of the filibuster rule—which allows a minority of Senators to obstruct the voice of the American majority.Republican Senators claim that our legislation is partisan and divisive.But what goal could be more American than securing the fundamental right to vote for all Americans?If Republican Senators are sincere about opposing partisan changes to election laws, they should join us in condemning partisan voter suppression in Georgia, Texas, Arizona, and across the country.Instead, Republicans only complain about and obstruct our efforts in the Senate to respond to these laws.In doing so, they leave Democrats no choice.We must change the filibuster rule to protect voting rights for every American.Madam President, the Senate exists to serve American democracy.The Senate rules exist to help the Senate serve American democracy.When those rules endanger our democracy, the answer is simple—we change them.It’s not unprecedented.The Senate changed the filibuster in 1917, to protect our nation from the threat of World War I.The Senate changed the filibuster in 1975, to try to restore the function of this body.In recent decades, the Senate has made more than 160 exceptions to the filibuster to do what’s best for people.Today, it’s time for us to do so once again.With all due respect to the history and traditions of the Senate, our job is to protect the future of this country, starting with our democracy.As Martin Luther King once told us, “America is essentially a dream—a dream yet unfulfilled.”And today, it falls on each of us to take up Dr. King’s lifelong struggle.This is our moment.Once again, we must work together to pass a voting rights law that secures the vote for every American—regardless of race, religion, ability, or gender.Sometimes, progress requires that we change the rules—as we did last month, when we changed the filibuster to protect our economy.Sometimes, progress requires that one party acts alone—as the courageous architects of the Fifteenth Amendment did, a century and a half ago.Look around this Senate, and think how surprised the men who created the filibuster in the early 1800s would be to see Senator Warnock, Senator Baldwin, myself, and others serving in this chamber.But change that strengthens our democracy is change for the better.Colleagues, we must rise to this generational moment of challenge, in the spirit of Dr. King, and pass this voting rights bill.Thank you, Madam President; I yield the floor.###"

I’ll keep working in Congress to ensure that we continue to respond with the urgency that the crisis demands to help small businesses keep their doors open and our workers safe.”Since being appointed to the U.S. Senate, Senator Padilla has advocated for funding for federal economic recovery programs like the Paycheck Protection Program, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance, and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program to ensure California’s small businesses have the resources they need. After the American Rescue Plan was signed into law, Padilla hosted a townhall with the SBA and Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to discuss how small businesses could access recovery programs.Through his casework team, Senator Padilla’s office has helped constituents navigate federal agencies and streamline the process to access Economic Injury Disaster Loans and federal grants from the Small Business Administration.California constituents encountering difficulties with federal government agencies or who otherwise need assistance from the Senator’s staff, can contact the office at (619) 239-3884 or visit https://www.padilla.senate.gov/services/agency-assistance.###"

Today, more than 150,000 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 nationwide, further straining overworked health care workers and hospitals facing severe staffing shortages. Recent reporting shows that overworked doctors, nurses, and staff have been forced to continue working in unsafe conditions and are concerned for their health and safety.“We write to urge the Department of Labor to take all necessary steps to expeditiously issue a permanent standard to protect our nation’s health care workers in the workplace,” said the Senators. “Particularly in the context of rising COVID-19 caseloads stemming from the spread of the Omicron variant, our nation’s health care workers deserve a permanent, enforceable standard that will ensure their health and safety as they continue to work on the front lines of the pandemic response.On December 27, 2021, six months after promulgation of the ETS, OSHA announced it was not ready to issue a permanent rule and would let the non-recordkeeping portions of the temporary standard expire. When OSHA issued the ETS in June 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that 491,816 health care workers had contracted COVID-19 and 1,611 had died. Today, those numbers have nearly doubled, with the CDC reporting that 848,028 health care workers across the nation have contracted COVID-19. Without a permanent rule, the health and well-being of our nation’s health care workers are at risk.In addition to Senators Padilla and Gillibrand, the letter is signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).This letter is endorsed by the AFL-CIO, NYS AFL-CIO, SEIU, 1199SEIU, 32BJ SEIU, and National Nurses United.Read the full text of the letter here and below:Dear President Biden and Secretary Walsh,Following the announcement in late December of the withdrawal of the non-recordkeeping portions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) COVID-19 Health Care Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS), we write to urge the Department of Labor to take all necessary steps to expeditiously issue a permanent standard to protect our nation’s health care workers in the workplace. Particularly in the context of rising COVID-19 caseloads stemming from the spread of the Omicron variant, our nation’s health care workers deserve a permanent, enforceable standard that will ensure their health and safety as they continue to work on the front lines of the pandemic response.OSHA’s June 21 ETS protected health care workers, who have shouldered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency temporary standard, which requires employers to implement plans to identify and control COVID-19 hazards in the workplace, helped to ensure that workers had access to effective personal protective equipment (PPE) and adequate ventilation systems, and ensured workers were notified of workplace exposures to COVID-19, providing critical protections against the risks frontline health care workers face every day in their workplaces. We were encouraged by the administration’s commitment to protecting health care workers through emergency protections by providing a clear standard detailing employers’ responsibilities to their workers.Accordingly, we were deeply troubled by OSHA’s announcement on December 27 that the agency would remove these protections without a permanent standard in place, while at the same time the agency acknowledged health care workers remain in grave danger from exposure to COVID-19. Though the agency contends that the terms of the ETS remain “relevant in general duty cases in that they show that COVID-19 poses a hazard in the healthcare industry,” we are concerned that the lapse of the temporary standard signals that OSHA no longer retains the necessary robust enforcement authority to provide adequate protections for health care workers, nor will there be a standard to provide adequate transparency or predictability for employees and their employers in evaluating health care workplace practices.We are writing to urge you to move forward with a permanent, enforceable standard that would require employers to protect workers in health care settings and to keep the emergency protections in place until a permanent standard is issued, which should be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Given the emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant, health care workers need to retain strong, enforceable protections now; these protections cannot lapse. This is necessary to adequately address the emergency context of the present situation health care workers are facing.Sincerely,###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-announce-historic-4-2-billion-investment-to-upgrade-californias-aging-bridges/,"Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Provides Single Largest Investment in Bridges in American HistoryWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) announced that California will receive $4.2 billion over five years to help California address the needs of highway bridges across the state. This funding comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—which both Padilla and Feinstein voted to pass last year—and is part of the largest single national investment in bridges in American history. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, California has 1,536 bridges rated in poor condition.“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a game-changing investment in our economy,” Senator Alex Padilla said. “Bridges are vital arteries for our economic activity, helping commuters get to work and keeping goods moving efficiently through the supply chain. With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law providing billions of dollars over the next half-decade, California will be able to renovate and upgrade bridges across the state. Investing in our bridges will create good-paying jobs, improve safety for motorists, and keep our economy moving efficiently.”“California has more than 1,500 bridges that are in desperate need of repair,” Senator Feinstein said. “This funding will go a long way to increase the safety, stability and lifespan of our state’s bridges, especially in the face of earthquakes. This funding will also generate good-paying jobs in communities throughout California.”This funding will be distributed through Federal Highway Administration’s Bridge Formula Program, which the Biden Administration launched earlier today. The program represents the largest investment ever made in fixing bridges – dedicating $26.5 billion to states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico over the five years of the law and $825 million for Tribal transportation facilities.Nationwide, the Bridge Formula Program is expected to help repair approximately 15,000 bridges. In addition to providing funds to states to replace, rehabilitate, preserve, protect, and construct highway bridges, the Bridge Formula Program has dedicated funding for Tribal transportation facility bridges as well as “off-system” bridges, locally-owned facilities which are those not on the federal-aid highway system. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-peters-introduce-bill-to-strengthen-federal-disaster-response-for-minority-rural-and-disabled-communities/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced legislation to strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) disaster response efforts for underserved communities that often face barriers to securing federal aid following an emergency, such as flooding, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Achieving Equity in Disaster Response, Recovery, and Resilience Act would establish the Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Inclusion (OCREI) at FEMA to increase access to and improve the quality of disaster assistance for, among others, minority, rural, and disabled communities. The office would be dedicated to reducing disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance.“From wildfires to floods, natural disasters disproportionately impact marginalized and underserved communities, and these communities often face additional challenges in receiving federal disaster assistance,” said Senator Padilla. “We need to close these gaps and improve equity in disaster relief efforts. This legislation will empower FEMA to work closely with underserved communities in California and across the country and help reduce disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance.”“We have repeatedly seen that when marginalized and rural communities face disasters – they are not only the most exposed to damage and the least able to recover financially – but they also often have more difficulty obtaining assistance from the federal government,” said Senator Peters. “From severe weather events in Michigan and across the nation that have devastated families and businesses – to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic – recent emergencies have shown we must do more to protect our most vulnerable and underserved communities. This bill will help ensure that our federal government is giving all communities equitable access to disaster assistance.”Underserved communities such as minority, rural, and disabled communities regularly receive less, and lower quality disaster assistance, even though they are also often disproportionately affected by disasters. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit underserved and minority communities the hardest. The senators’ bill would establish a high-level office dedicated to understanding and advocating for the needs of underserved communities and coordinating the federal response so that the delivery of disaster assistance is equitable.The Achieving Equity in Disaster Response, Recovery, and Resilience Act would establish the OCREI at FEMA to improve access to and the quality of disaster assistance for underserved communities, and eliminate disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance to these communities. This bill would also classify rural communities as underserved communities and task this office at FEMA with reducing the disparities in the delivery of disaster assistance to those communities as well. The bill requires the OCREI to evaluate FEMA programs and activities to promote equity for underserved communities, enter into agreements with and award grants to nonprofits working to support underserved communities, and engage with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governmental entities and advocacy organizations in underserved communities on a regular basis. The bill also streamlines efforts to ensure a coordinated approach across FEMA to protect the rights and needs of individuals with disabilities in disaster response. Finally the legislation would require public reporting to ensure the office is held accountable for successful implementation of efforts to improve equity in all phases of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.Below are statements in support of senators’ legislation:“This legislation will improve the quality of disaster assistance provided by FEMA and help deliver it to the communities most in need of support,” said National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson. “It will provide an advocate for underserved communities that can least afford the heavy costs of disaster recovery, including rural communities and low-income families served by electric cooperatives. We are grateful to Sen. Peters for introducing this important bill.”“We have seen time and time again how natural disasters, pandemics, and acts of terrorism have disproportionately devastated communities of color across the United States and how responses to these tragedies have been marred by racial and ethnic disparities,” said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League. “An Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Inclusion would represent an important first step in rectifying that history, and ensuring that the federal government responds fairly and equitably to all communities when they need support. The National Urban League applauds Chairman Peters’ effort to right this historic wrong, and his commitment to identifying and addressing the shortcomings in the federal government’s emergency response efforts.”“We commend this piece of legislation for recognizing and addressing two crucial realities. One, that climate change is real and it requires a full-scope effort to prepare our cities, neighborhoods, and homes for disaster scenarios and emergency events. Two, that the Middle Eastern and North African community is uniquely vulnerable during such scenarios and events, due in large part to systemic disinvestment from the broader communities in which we live,” said CEO of ACCESS, Maha Freij. “The Office of Civil Rights, Equity, and Community Inclusion promises to improve the quality of disaster assistance and expand access to include the communities that have historically been hit the hardest.”“Ensuring that critical disaster preparedness, response, and recovery support reaches the families and businesses who have been historically underserved is critical to helping those who often experience climate and disaster impacts first and worst,” said Jessie Ritter, senior director of water resources and coastal policy for the National Wildlife Federation. “Thank you to Senator Gary Peters for his leadership on this important legislation, which will work to advance equity and justice within FEMA and for all communities it serves.”“Natural disasters and the pandemic have had a significant impact on communities of color – its clear disparities still exist in our federal disaster response efforts,” said Yumeka Rushing, chief of strategy for the NAACP. “The Black community and other marginalized communities often face disproportionate effects when disaster strikes, but often don’t receive equal assistance to help recover from floods, wildfires, and severe weather events. We applaud Senator Peters for his continued leadership on this issue, and for his commitment to ensuring that our nation’s disaster response is equitable for every community. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind.”“We applaud Senator Peters for elevating the debate around disasters and emergencies disproportionately impacting low-income and minority communities across America. Equitable recovery has traditionally been a challenge,” said Michele Stockwell, Executive Director of Bipartisan Policy Center Action. “Lower income populations have fewer financial resources and, as a result, are more reliant on governmental assistance to address their recovery needs. It is critical that the design and implementation of the federal government’s response and recovery programs effectively address the needs of low-income and minority communities.”###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-cosponsors-legislation-to-give-every-american-lifesaving-n95-masks/,"More than 50 Democratic colleagues cosponsored the Masks for All Act in the House and SenateWASHNGTON, D.C. — As we enter the third year of the coronavirus pandemic, with the Omicron variant surging and cases skyrocketing, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate and House, to reintroduce lifesaving legislation to manufacture and distribute highly-protective N95 masks to every person in America.Under the Masks for All Act – which was developed in consultation with health experts including Andy Slavitt, former COVID-19 advisor to President Biden and the former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President Obama – every person in the U.S. would receive a free package of three N95 respirator masks. This includes individuals who are experiencing homelessness or living in group settings such as prisons, shelters, college dorms, and assisted living facilities, as well as all workers in health settings, from administrative and janitorial, to food service, doctors, and nurses.“Universal access to N95 masks is key to helping prevent thousands of COVID-19 infections and deaths,” said Senator Padilla. “We have the opportunity to provide life-saving supplies to people all across the country and the time to act is now. I am proud to cosponsor the Masks for All Act because everyone deserves to be safe during the pandemic.”“As we face the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal,” said Sen. Sanders. “Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N95 masks, one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the Covid virus. It is an absolute scandal that in the richest country in the history of the world, high-quality masks are not more readily available to frontline workers, health care workers, and all Americans. We are proposing that we do what our public health experts and scientists say we must do: provide all of our people with high-quality, N95 masks without cost, which could prevent death and suffering and save huge amounts of health care dollars.”This legislation would require the federal government to use all available authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to eliminate shortages of N95 respirator masks and distribute them to the public as soon as possible. The proposal would use the United States Postal Service for distribution and set up pick-up sites at convenient community locations that are already providing essential services, such as Post Offices, pharmacies, schools, public transportation stations, and COVID-19 testing sites. It would also end the U.S. reliance on China and other countries for this essential lifesaving equipment.According to recent reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering updating its mask guidance to recommend N95 or KN95 masks. When the CDC initially issued mask guidance in 2020, N95 masks were reportedly not recommended for the general public out of concern for shortages for health care workers. Health officials now say there is not a N95 shortage. However, counterfeit masks and general access remain an issue, for the public and in hospitals and health care facilities around the country.Studies have shown that the widespread use of face masks could prevent tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, while other studies indicate universal mask wearing could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. Today, the benefits of widespread N95 use would be even greater. According to recent data, an N95 respirator mask provides the individual wearer with at least 2.5 hours of protection against an unmasked person infected with the Omicron variant, compared to just 20 minutes of protection if they are wearing a cloth mask or 30 minutes if they are wearing a surgical mask.To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over 60 million Americans and killed more than 835,000, and just this week the U.S. reported a record-breaking 1.35 million new coronavirus infections in one day – the highest daily total in the world.To read a summary of the bill, click here.To read the text of the bill, click here. ###"

This funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act, which both Padilla and Feinstein voted to pass last year.In 2020, Metro’s approximately 11,000 workers provided 215 million trips. These funds will allow Metro to continue providing reliable service, which is critical to supporting the more than 12 million residents of the Los Angeles urbanized area.“Public transportation workers have been on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic,”Senator Padilla said. “Public transit agencies like LA Metro have maintained service through the pandemic, helping essential workers get to their jobs and keeping our economy moving. As overall ridership of public transportation has dipped during the pandemic, public transit agencies have faced the burden of maintaining service despite receiving less revenue from fares. This funding from the American Rescue Plan will help LA Metro keep their workers on the job and maintain service for millions of Angelenos.”“Keeping public transportation up and running is critical to ending this pandemic and allowing Californians to return to normal,” Senator Feinstein said. “LA Metro has continued operating throughout the pandemic so essential workers can get to their jobs and individuals can get to vaccine and health care appointments. This money from the American Rescue Plan will allow these operations to continue and recover as we continue to fight this pandemic.”“LA Metro is deeply appreciative to U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla, our Los Angeles County Congressional Delegation, working alongside President Biden and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, for clearing the way for our agency to be awarded $1.24 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funds today,” said Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board Chair and Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis. “As Los Angeles County experiences another surge of infections in our nearly two year battle with the COVID-19 pandemic, the resources provided to our agency through the American Rescue Plan Act will help us weather the storm, continue on our path to rebuild and grow our ridership, maintain the highest standards of service and safety, ensure no employee is laid off, and provide equitable access to transit for all Los Angeles County residents who rely on Metro buses and trains.  Metro will use the America Rescue Plan Act funds to benefit riders, including seniors, persons with disabilities, low-income and transit dependent individuals by supporting bus and rail operations and maintenance – critical activities that will ensure our transit system operates safely, efficiently, reliably, and sustainably.”This funding is part of more than $30 billion for public transportation secured in theAmerican Rescue Plan Act, which was signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021. The funding comes from the $26.6 billion allocated by statutory formulas to urban and rural areas, tribal governments, and for the enhanced mobility of seniors and individuals with disabilities.A fact sheet from Senator Padilla’s office on what the American Rescue Plan Act delivers to California is available here. The White House has provided an online resource guide to help Americans understand how the American Rescue Plan will directly benefit them here.###"

These workers, the majority of whom are Latina women, have been on strike for better wages and working conditions since November 3, 2021. They are often forced into mandatory overtime with little-to-no notice and sometimes work up to 16 hours a day.The senators urged Chairman Rich to bargain in good faith with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) union and to agree to a fair contract for the striking workers as soon as possible.“What the 100 bakery workers, who make cakes for Baskin Robbins, Safeway and Cold Stone Creamery are asking for is not radical,” the senators wrote to Rich. “These workers, 75 percent of whom are Latina women, have been working up to 16 hours a day. All they are asking for is a $1 per hour wage increase each year for three years, respect on the job, a fair attendance policy and no cuts to their healthcare benefits.”The bakery strike comes amidst a wave of worker protests across industries and states, including at least 185 strikes at 255 locations in 2021.Read the full letter here and below:Dear Mr. Rich:We write to you today to express support for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers (BCTGM) at the Jon Donaire Desserts plant in Sante Fe Springs, California who have been on strike since November 3, 2021. We urge you to reach an agreement as soon as possible on a contract that is fair and that includes good wages, decent benefits, reliable schedules and safe working conditions.What the 100 bakery workers, who make cakes for Baskin Robbins, Safeway and Cold Stone Creamery are asking for is not radical. These workers, 75 percent of whom are Latina women, have been working up to 16 hours a day. All they are asking for is a $1 per hour wage increase each year for three years, respect on the job, a fair attendance policy and no cuts to their healthcare benefits.Let’s be clear. Rich Products is not a poor company. It is not going broke. Last year, your company made over $4 billion in revenue. During the pandemic, you became over $2 billion richer and now have an estimated net worth of more than $7.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. We do not believe that it is too much to ask that you treat your workers with the respect and dignity they have earned and deserve.Average wages at Jon Donaire are less than $17 per hour – which is slightly higher than the minimum wage in California. BCTGM members at Rich Products’ facility in Murfeesboro, Tennessee—where the cost of living is much lower—make, on average, $6 more per hour than their Los Angeles peers. In your California plant workers are often penalized for absences, such as medical appointments, which are unapproved but necessary.The work at the Sante Fe Springs plant is difficult and days are long. Production line speeds continue to increase to as high as 38 cakes per minute. Many workers report hand and arm injuries and physical and emotional stress levels are high. Mandatory overtime is common, and workers can work up to 16 hour shifts with little notice. Morale at work is low, and our understanding is that these dedicated workers have reported their concerns to Rich Products headquarters. Unfortunately, these concerns continue to go unanswered and ignored.Mr. Rich: Your employees have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, keeping production lines moving at breakneck speeds and fueling company profits. Meanwhile, your employees are falling further and further behind economically.Your employees deserve better. We urge you to bargain in good faith with the union and agree to a fair contract as soon as possible.Sincerely,###"

Last week, Los Angeles County set a daily record as 43,712 new infections were recorded in the county, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic.“The rapid spread of the Omicron variant over the past weeks suggests that Americans are in a dramatically more vulnerable position than we had anticipated being just last month. There is no time to waste, and widespread and affordable access to rapid tests will be an integral part of our country’s public health response to the Omicron variant and through the duration of the pandemic,” the members wrote in the letter.“[A]s the Omicron variant spreads and we enter an ominous and unprecedented next phase of this pandemic, it is critical that we ensure these efforts meet the severity of the moment. We strongly encourage you to take additional, immediate steps to eliminate existing barriers to COVID-19 rapid tests and ensure robust access to free over-the-counter rapid tests throughout the country for the duration of the pandemic,” the members continued.On December 21, the Biden administration announced plans to purchase 500 million antigen, or “rapid” COVID-19 tests, and develop a system to distribute them nationwide at no cost. However, the rapid transmission of the Omicron variant over the past several weeks and its increased ability to spread to fully-vaccinated individuals indicate far more testing capabilities are needed, and will be needed for the foreseeable future, as well as policies that ensure testing is easy, free, and accessible to everyone.Specifically, members are calling on the administration to:The letter is co-signed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), as well as Representatives Peter DeFazio, Chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (D-Ore.), Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Danny K.

We applaud the actions announced by your Administration on December 21, 2021 to combat the dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases, including by deploying additional medical personnel, setting up additional federal testing sites, and purchasing 500 million antigen—or “rapid”— tests. But as the Omicron variant spreads and we enter an ominous and unprecedented next phase of this pandemic, it is critical that we ensure these efforts meet the severity of the moment. We strongly encourage you to take additional, immediate steps to eliminate existing barriers to COVID-19 rapid tests and ensure robust access to free over-the-counter rapid tests throughout the country for the duration of the pandemic.As you know, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the Omicron variant accounted for 95 percent of new COVID-19 cases for the week of December 26, 2021- January 1, 2022. This staggering figure grew from only 8 percent three weeks prior. In addition to the unforeseen pace of transmissibility, fully vaccinated individuals are seemingly far more vulnerable to break-through cases compared to previous variants, such as Delta. Early data demonstrates that a booster dose of the two available mRNA vaccines likely provides increased protection against the Omicron variant, but according to the CDC, only 32 percent of Americans over the age of 18 have received a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose.Ensuring widespread access to free COVID-19 rapid testing is among the most effective public health tools that the federal government has at its disposal, but the current supply shortage is preventing effective utilization of this commonsense mitigation strategy. In recent updates to CDC guidance regarding the isolation period for symptomatic individuals with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the “best approach” is to conduct a rapid test toward the end of the 5-day isolation period “[i]f an individual has access to a test and wants to test”. The language used in the public health guidance from the administration itself is indicative of the significant barriers individuals face when trying to access or purchase COVID-19 rapid tests. We applaud your most recent commitment to utilizing the Defense Production Act to increase COVID-19 testing manufacturing, as well as the executive actions taken throughout this year to expand access to over-the-counter COVID-19 rapid tests. While we are pleased to see that the administration has committed to purchasing 500 million antigen tests that will be distributed throughout the country for free, we believe that the threat of the Omicron variant demands the most comprehensive public health response possible from the federal government. We strongly urge you to consider and implement the following policies to build on your administration’s efforts to increase access to COVID-19 rapid tests.Increase Manufacturing and Distribution of Rapid Tests: Regular, consistent testing for COVID-19 will continue to be among the most effective tools we have in combatting COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. We believe that the recent announcement from the administration to facilitate production and distribution of 500 million free rapid tests is a critical step in increasing access to testing, but the introduction of the Omicron variant in the United States calls for a largescale transformation of the country’s COVID-19 testing manufacturing and distribution systems. Nearly two years into the pandemic Americans continue to struggle to find antigen tests in stock at local retailers, despite several executive actions by the administration throughout 2021 aimed at increasing access to COVID-19 rapid tests.Many public health experts believe that regular access to rapid testing as a screening tool is critical to combatting COVID-19, and some believe that rapid tests should be conducted as frequently as 2 times per week per individual, as recommended by public health officials in the United Kingdom. If the United States were to adopt similar recommendations, we would need roughly 2.3 billion tests per month – a figure several times the 500 million proposed by your administration. Understanding the complexities of the manufacturing and distribution processes, we respectfully urge that you utilize the full scope of your executive power under Defense Production Act to manufacture enough rapid tests to ensure that each American can take at least one rapid test per week.Ensure the Program to Deliver At-Home Tests is Accessible for All: We commend the administration’s plans to establish a program that will enable Americans to order free COVID-19 rapid tests directly to their homes. This is a critical step in facilitating regular, widespread testing. However, in addition to the website-based ordering mechanism discussed in the December 21, 2021 White House Fact Sheet, we encourage your administration to consider additional methods for enabling the order and delivery of antigen tests to people’s homes. Under the current website-based proposal, individuals and households that do not have regular, reliable access to broadband will not have the ability to order free rapid tests to their homes. Without alternative non-broadband-based methods for ordering these tests, low-income households, rural communities, seniors, and individuals who experience disabilities will be at a significant disadvantage in accessing tests through this program. As the administration implements this program, we strongly recommend that additional means of ordering rapid tests to be delivered to homes be included in the roll out of the program, such as a national hotline number for placing orders.Integrate Access to Testing into Daily Lives: It is critical to ensure that robust testing is available in designated medical facilities, and we commend your efforts to expand federal testing locations and home delivery methods – but the realities of the Omicron variant demand more. Access to free, rapid testing must meet people where they already are. We urge you to take additional steps to integrate access to free rapid tests in public locations that are already frequented by people in their day-to-day lives, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and local businesses. Ensuring rapid tests are accessible in the most convenient possible locations will help ensure regular, easy access to tests that some people may not otherwise have the time or resources to take. We strongly encourage you to take additional steps to integrate access to free rapid testing in public locations that are already frequented by people in their day-to-day lives, such as post offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, grocery stores, pharmacies, local businesses, and delivered as part of the Meals on Wheels program. Further, we urge you to ensure that easy access to rapid tests is also available to individuals with disabilities, who may not be able to reach many testing locations.Ensure Comprehensive Implementation of Private Plan Test Coverage: We were pleased to learn earlier this month that your administration will implement requirements for private health insurers to reimburse enrollees for over-the-counter rapid tests. However, we continue to have concerns about the reimbursement process, and the ability for enrollees to effectively navigate the process. Under the plan released earlier this month, Americans will have to purchase the at-home rapid tests, and then submit the receipts to their insurer for reimbursement. This will require time and effort that many Americans may find daunting. Additionally, the reimbursement process will require enrollees to cover upfront costs for the tests – which are currently priced at roughly $14 to $34 per testing kit. For families who are struggling financially, the overhead cost may be enough to dissuade purchasing the tests altogether. We ask that the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury take these potential hurdles into consideration while drafting the upcoming January 2022 guidance, and ensure that the reimbursement process does not dissuade Americans covered under private and ERISA health plans from regularly accessing rapid tests.The rapid spread of the Omicron variant over the past weeks suggests that Americans are in a dramatically more vulnerable position than we had anticipated being just last month. There is no time to waste, and widespread and affordable access to rapid tests will be an integral part of our country’s public health response to the Omicron variant and through the duration of the pandemic.We stand at the ready to continue to work with your administration on combatting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your continued leadership on this issue. ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-announce-over-382-million-to-help-lower-income-california-families-with-heating-costs/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) announced that California is receiving over $382 million in federal funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This funding comes from the American Rescue Plan and the Further Extending Government Funding Act, which both Padilla and Feinstein voted to pass“As we face the highly transmissible COVID-19 Omicron variant, it is especially critical for families to be able to keep the lights on and have reliable heat to stay safe at home,” Senator Padilla said. “Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, California is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to help hardworking families with the cost of heating and other utilities this winter.”“Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Californians will receive more than double the assistance to help pay for energy bills this winter,” Senator Feinstein said. “Thanks to this additional funding, more families will be able to stay warm by avoiding devastating power shutoffs and receiving assistance in weatherizing their homes.”California is receiving $382,838,846 total in LIHEAP funding. $203,610,805 comes from the American Rescue Plan, and $179,228,041 comes from the Further Extending Government Funding Act.LIHEAP is a federally funded program aimed to assist low-income households that pay a high portion of their income to meet their energy needs. Information on California’s LIHEAP program, including income eligibility, is available here.The American Rescue Plan more than doubled LIHEAP Funding. In 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats delivered $8 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally, thanks to an additional $4.5 billion provided by the American Rescue Plan. These funds represent the largest appropriation in a single year for the program since it was established in 1981.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-statement-on-anniversary-of-january-6-insurrection/,"On the one year anniversary of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) released the following statement:“One year ago today, our democracy experienced a crisis. Armed rioters stormed the U. S. Capitol and threatened the lives of Capitol Police officers, members of Congress, and staff. Waving symbols of hate and white supremacy, they disrupted Congress and turned our nation’s peaceful transfer of power into a deadly insurrection. It was a testament of the resilience of our democracy that despite the events of the day, the House and Senate resumed their work and certified the election.“I was sworn into the Senate days later after serving for six years as California’s Chief Election Officer. I was on the front lines in the effort against the dangerous spread of election disinformation, from the birther conspiracy to Trump’s lies about vote counts in 2016 – and again in the 2020 election.  “Sadly, what should have been a moment of reckoning and urgent action never materialized. Instead, in the months that followed, Republican governors and legislators in state after state worked to pass new voter suppression laws to undermine free and fair elections. Meanwhile, Republican Senators continue to abuse the filibuster to obstruct every attempt to protect voting rights.  It’s because of this blanket refusal to do what’s right that one year after the insurrection, our democracy is still in crisis.“One year ago today, hundreds of Capitol Police officers put their lives on the line to protect our democracy. They bear the physical and mental scars of that day. We have praised them in speeches and awarded them medals, but to truly honor their service and sacrifice, we must renew our own commitment to defend our democracy. We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and that oath rises above any Senate rule.“I urge my colleagues to join me in fulfilling our highest duty as United States Senators. We must reform Senate rules and pass voting rights legislation. Our democracy and future generations deserve nothing less.”Padilla joined Leader Schumer this week to renew Senate Democrats’ push for voting rights legislation and highlight the insidious impact the ‘Big Lie’ had leading up to the January 6 insurrection. ###"

He has participated in oversight hearings regarding the attack on the U.S. Capitol and joined Leader Schumer this week to highlight the insidious impact that the ‘Big Lie’ refuting the election results had in leading up to the January 6 insurrection. Padilla also underscored the urgent necessity of passing voting rights protections to restore faith in our democratic election systems.  Last year, President Biden signed into law the Capitol Emergency Assistance Act, a bill that Padilla cosponsored to prevent the Capitol Police from losing critical response time waiting for approval to call in the National Guard.Key Excerpts:Full Transcript:Sen. Padilla: Thank you. Before I get to a couple questions to prioritize, I want to take the opportunity to comment on something that Senator Cruz just raised. I appreciate the fact that he recognized, last January 6th, I believe he called it a riot and referenced rioters. I believe it was an insurrection, personally. We can discuss and debate what the proper terminology is, but even if it was just “a riot,” we saw the results of that incident. We saw violent attempts to disrupt Congress, to disrupt the process of certifying the election results and its part of the greater, peaceful transfer of power. We saw violence – it was deadly violence. We saw attacks and assaults far beyond insults and disrespect towards Capitol Police Officers. So, if we are in agreement on a bipartisan basis to recognize January 6 for what it was, then we should also agree on a bipartisan basis to ask some questions. Was it organic and spontaneous or was it organized and premeditated? If it was organized and premeditated, you’re going to have a hard time convincing me otherwise that we have to ask the question, who was behind it? Who organized, who incited this? We had the opportunity to set up an independent, bipartisan commission to answer those very questions, but unfortunately our Republican colleagues would not vote to do so. So now I and so many people across the country eagerly await the results of the Committee that was established in the House, a bipartisan committee which seeks to answer some of these questions. Let me now transition back to the topic at hand, issues at hand, and some questions that I was hoping to raise. First, in the context of this information, Chief, I thank you for the service at this time of this agency and for your more than fory years of work at law enforcement. The topic of disinformation has been raised by some of my colleagues already in this committee. I will not repeat them. But I do I want to highlight one specific question, the role of disinformation in the lead up to January 6 is one thing, but what has been done since the insurrection is another. And I am referring to the former President of the United States and his political allies seeking to whitewash in fact what happened. Some quoted publicly claiming that those who attacked the Capitol were just “peaceful protesters.” Perhaps nobody knows just how false those claims are than the men and women of it Capitol Police who were beaten and bloodied defending the people in this building and yes, defending democracy itself. So Chief, what do you say to those who continue to perpetuate the lie that last January 6 just wasn’t that bad? What do you say to that? Chief Manger: We are not concerned about political ideology. We are concerned about behavior, we’re concerned about people that break the law. People that break the law, there are extremists on both sides of the spectrum breaking the law. And we are here to protect the Capitol, the Members of Congress. I would say to anybody that wants to come to this Capitol and peacefully demonstrate, we will protect your right to do so. But anybody that comes here and decides they want to break the law, that we will do everything in our power to stop you and ensure the Capitol and Members of Congress remain safe. Sen. Padilla: Chief, I didn’t think I needed a follow up question to that, but apparently, I do. Do we what we saw in the Capitol last January 6 was just another day, just people exercising their constitutional rights, or was it unacceptable, fatal violence? Chief Manger: As I watched the events of January 6, I was, at the time, retired. I was, at the time, watching it on TV, and I was horrified by what I saw. I saw police officers being assaulted, and that is the reason I’m sitting here today is because I wanted to do what I could to help this police department and to better protect our nation and the Capitol and what this Capitol represents. Sen. Padilla: Thank you for that. Clearly we so have ongoing work to do. One other quick question, Madam Chair I know my time is up. I want to recognize that Senator Capito raised the concern and the questions about the mental health of the women and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. I share in that and stand by ready to support any additional resources or support that we can offer. I do have one question about physical health. We know that businesses, organizations, entities, public and private across the country, have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Whether it is individuals who are not able, willing to work because they have not been vaccinated or people who are not able to work because they have contracted COVID-19. Chief, can you talk about vaccination levels within the department and what steps we’re doing to encourage vaccination rates for those who are not vaccinated yet? Chief Manger: I think we are over 70% of our employees are vaccinated, but like every agency — we just had a call of law enforcement agencies around the region yesterday, we are being hit hard by folks both vaccinated and not vaccinated with this latest variant that are testing positive and we’ve got dozens of officers out on isolation. We’ve got dozens of officers that have been out long term with the impacts of COVID. So it has affected our staffing levels and again with all of the other staffing challenges that we have, COVID is wreaking havoc as well. Sen. Padilla: Well, thank you for your responses and for your service. Thank you, Madam Chair.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-paul-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-thousands-of-documented-dreamers/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced the America’s Children Act. This bipartisan legislation will provide a pathway to citizenship for ‘Documented Dreamers,’ children of long-term visa holders who have been waiting for years, and often decades for a greencard. These ‘Documented Dreamers’ face deportation if they age out of dependent status at 21 without a green card or other immigration status.  “We cannot turn our backs on the ‘Documented Dreamers’ who have spent most of their lives in this country, contributing to their communities and our economy but face continued uncertainty and risk deportation once they turn 21,” Senator Padilla said. “These young people deserve the opportunity to pursue their American dream and continue building lives in the country they call home.”“These children who have legally called the United States home for many years and even decades, are contributing members in our communities and to our economy. They shouldn’t be penalized by the government’s failures in addressing green card backlogs,” said Dr. Paul. “The America’s Children Act provides targeted relief for these children of merit-based immigrants who are at risk of “aging out” of their lawful immigration status, and I’m pleased to join Sen. Padilla in introducing this bill.”This bill is cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Susan Collins (R-Maine). Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) previously introduced this legislation in the House. “Children of long-term visa holders risk aging out and losing their immigration status as it is often tied to their parents’ status. These children unfairly lose their opportunity to secure lawful permanent residence and face the risk of deportation despite growing up in the U.S.,” said Senator Durbin. “I’m proud to cosponsor the America’s Children Act to provide these immigrants with the security they need so that they can continue to live fulfilling lives here in the U.S.”“‘Documented Dreamers’ are Americans in every sense besides legal status, and Congress should protect them and provide a secure pathway to their citizenship,” Senator Coons said. “I am proud to come together with my colleagues to end the cruel and pointless practice of ‘aging out’ in our immigration laws, which deprives America of these individuals’ contributions and forces them to a country they may not even know.  It is commonsense measures like these that we can and must work together on to reform our broken immigration system.”“Our legislation would protect ‘Documented Dreamers’ who were brought to the United States legally as children and know no other country as their home,” said Senator Collins.  “It makes no sense that children of long-term legal immigrants, who have been raised and educated in America, can be forced to self-deport even as their parents and other family members are permitted to remain in this country.  This would be a vast improvement to our legal immigration system and ensure the children of legal immigrants can continue to contribute to their communities and the economy.”“My community in North Carolina is one of many across the country that has flourished because of immigrant workers, who spend years growing our economy and raising their children as Americans,” said Congresswoman Ross. “It is unconscionable that when these children, known as Documented Dreamers, reach the age of 21, they can be forced to self-deport to countries they might not even remember, splitting their families apart. I’m grateful to my colleagues Senators Padilla and Paul for joining me in leading this vital legislation to keep our nation strong and competitive by ensuring Documented Dreamers have access to the American Dream.”“Members of Improve The Dream are extremely grateful for the Senate’s introduction of theAmerica’s Children Act. This legislation puts in place a policy that most Americans assume already exists by permanently ending aging out and providing a mechanism for a pathway to citizenship for every child who has grown up in the United States with a documented status. For too long, young immigrants like us, who have been raised and educated here as Americans, have been forced to leave the country we call home. Over 200,000 Documented Dreamers who had felt hopeless now have hope for being recognized as something we have long felt: Americans. We are America’s Children and this bill will recognize us as such,” said Dip Patel, President of Improve The Dream. “Thank you Senators Padilla, Paul, Coons, Collins, and Durbin for championing this cause in the Senate. The America’s Children Act will improve the dream for all children of long-term visa holders and allow us to fully contribute our skills to this country.”Over 200,000 children and young adults are living in the United States as dependents of long-term nonimmigrant visa holders (including H-1B, L-1, E-1, and E-2 workers). These young people grow up in the United States, but their dependent visas expire at age 21, forcing many of them to self-deport to countries they might not even remember.The H-4 and L-2 visas, which are the visas issued to dependents of H-1B and L-1 workers, are limited to dependent spouses and dependent children under 21 years of age. While H-1B and L-1 workers and their children can eventually obtain green cards, they often end up stuck in a decades-long backlog. Meanwhile, the children of E-1 and E-2 visa holders have no pathway to permanent residency. If they are unable to change temporary status when they turn 21 and age out of their dependent visas, these young adults face the choice of remaining in the United States without status or returning to their country of birth alone.The America’s Children Act:###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/feinstein-peters-padilla-introduce-legislation-to-protect-marine-corps-recruit-depot-san-diego/,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla and Representative Scott Peters (all D-Calif.) today introduced legislation to prohibit the closure of Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego.Following passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, the Marine Corps began reviewing its two recruit training locations in San Diego, CA, and Parris Island, S.C., for possible relocation. The San Diego Marine Corps Recruit Depot has served as the recruit training center for the western United States since 1923, training nearly 18,000 Marines every year. In May, the base achieved another historic milestone with its first class of female graduates, demonstrating its ability to fully integrate genders during basic training. The training mission is part of a larger presence in the region; seven military installations are located in San Diego, including three Marine Corps bases that are home to nearly one-third of all active duty Marines.“The Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego has trained new Marines since 1923. Over the years, more than 1 million Marines have graduated from the program. The base has been a strategically vital location for the Marines since before World War II and should continue to serve as such,” said Senator Feinstein. “San Diego is home to a robust military community with a rich history of service. There is no reason to relocate this important training center.”“San Diego’s Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) represents the past, present and future of our city’s rich military history and tradition,” said Representative Peters. “This bill will protect this facility and ensure San Diego continues to provide world-class Marines ready to fight our nation’s battles. MCRD’s location, proximity to other Marine Corps and Navy facilities, and connection to a vibrant defense industry in the region underscore why San Diego remains an ideal location to support initial training for the Marine Corps. I’m honored to join Senators Feinstein and Padilla in this effort.”“California has a long and rich military history with the Marine Corps that dates back nearly a century,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “Each year, San Diego’s Marine Corps Recruit Depot prepares over 18,000 Marines to serve our nation in uniform. It would be a great disservice, not only to our Marines, but to the security of our country, to close this training camp that trains and develops all recruits west of the Mississippi. I am proud to join this important legislation to keep this critical training center in San Diego open.”Full text of the legislation is available here.The San Diego Military Advisory Council, an organization that advocates for the San Diego military community, expressed its strong support for the legislation: “SDMAC strongly supports the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego Protection Act. While SDMAC also supports the ability of our Service Chiefs to plan for many possible events, we are supportive of efforts focused on keeping the Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) in San Diego.” The full Military Advisory Council letter of support is available here.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-co-leads-renewed-push-to-protect-freedom-to-vote-and-strengthen-our-democracy/,"The Freedom to Vote Act will set basic national standards to make sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best for them, regardless of what zip code they live inWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Committee on Rules and Administration with oversight over federal elections and campaign finance law and former California Secretary of State, co-led the introduction of the Freedom to Vote Act, legislation to improve access to the ballot for Americans, advance commonsense election integrity reforms, and protect our democracy from relentless attacks.The bill ensures the people responsible for implementing reforms are able to do so effectively by incorporating feedback from state and local election officials that the Rules Committee has heard throughout the year and by drawing on Padilla’s experience as California’s former Secretary of State overseeing federal and state elections in the most populous state in the nation. It also elevates the voices of American voters by ending partisan gerrymandering and helping to eliminate the undue influence of secret money in our elections.Key reforms that Padilla implemented and administered in California while serving as Secretary of State – including automatic voter registration, same day registration, online registration, and expanded early and mail voting opportunities – are reflected in the bill.Padilla specifically worked to ensure that the bill sets a national voter ID standard for states that choose to adopt voter ID requirements for in-person voting, but does not force any state, including California, to require voter ID if they choose not to.“Our democracy is under attack from Republican state legislatures across the country hellbent on suppressing the right to vote,” said Padilla. “That’s why Senate Democrats are unified in our mission to fight voter suppression and protect the integrity of our elections – the stakes are too high not to act. This bill includes proven reforms that I helped implement as California’s top elections official to make our elections more accessible and more secure – reforms that all of our Senate colleagues should support to ensure a healthy democracy.”“The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms. Following the 2020 elections in which more Americans voted than ever before, we have seen unprecedented attacks on our democracy in states across the country. These attacks demand an immediate federal response. With the Freedom to Vote Act, the entire voting rights working group, including Senators Manchin and Merkley, is united behind legislation that will set basic national standards to make sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best for them, regardless of what zip code they live in. This bill will ensure Americans can request a mail-in ballot, have at least 15 days of early voting, and can register to vote on Election Day,” said Klobuchar.“I was a civil rights lawyer for 17 years. I’ve lived through a violent attack on the Capitol by people wanting to overturn an election. And I’ve watched state legislatures scheme to reduce people’s ability to vote. I am proud to sponsor the Freedom to Vote Act because it guarantees that eligible voters anywhere in this country get access to the ballot,” said Kaine.“Any threat to the democratic process is a threat to democracy itself,” said King. “In the face of state-level threats that undercut the fundamental right to vote for millions of Americans, we must act now to protect our democracy. Our bill would set commonsense minimum standards to ensure that no state infringes upon its citizens’ right to vote and confront widespread anti-democratic practices such as partisan gerrymandering and dark money spending. Free, fair and open elections are the backbone of our national commitment to government of the people, by the people, and for the people – and through this legislation, we will do our part to pass this experiment in self-government on to the next generation of Americans.”“The right to vote is fundamental to our Democracy and the Freedom to Vote Act is a step in the right direction towards protecting that right for every American. As elected officials, we also have an obligation to restore peoples’ faith in our Democracy, and I believe that the commonsense provisions in this bill – like flexible voter ID requirements – will do just that,” said Manchin.“All seven of us working on this bill are committed to an America where all citizens have a right to cast a vote and have their vote counted,” said Merkley. “This bill ensures that no matter where we live or which party we support, all of us have an equal chance to shape the big decisions in our country by ending partisan gerrymandering, stopping billionaires from buying elections, and ensuring all of us have the same chance to cast our ballot. I hope our Republican colleagues will support Americans’ freedom to vote, but one way or another we must stand up for Americans’ constitutional rights.”“Free and fair elections are a cornerstone of our democracy, plain and simple. This bill will allow us to maintain local control over our voting systems while keeping our elections safe in the face of new and evolving threats, shine a light on dark money in politics, and close loopholes that allow foreign spending on elections. It’s our responsibility to ensure that every eligible Montanan is able to make their voice heard at the ballot box, and I’m proud this legislation will do that,” said Tester.“Voting rights are preservative of every other right. The power of people voting is what has made it possible for Congress to pass expansive pandemic relief and take up landmark legislation to create jobs, move our economy forward and invest in our nation’s future,” said Warnock. “As access to the ballot remains under threat for voters in Georgia and states across the nation, I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to introduce the Freedom to Vote Act that will protect the sacred right to vote for every eligible American, no matter where they live, and enact commonsense democracy reforms that will help ensure our government remains by and for the people. I hope senators on both sides of the aisle will support this bill and that the Senate can pass it with urgency. We are at an inflection point in our history, and future generations will judge how we act to preserve our democracy.”The Freedom to Vote Act is sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA). The Freedom to Vote Act is the product of the working group assembled and led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).This bill includes three sections, each intended to protect the right to vote and strengthen our democracy.I. Voter Access and Election AdministrationThis section includes provisions to advance voter access by implementing reliable state best practices for voter registration and election administration to ensure all Americans can easily exercise their freedom to vote regardless of where they live.II. Election IntegrityThis section includes measures to promote confidence in elections, stop partisan election subversion, and protect against election interference, both foreign and domestic.III. Civic Participation and EmpowermentThis section includes provisions to prevent partisan manipulation of the redistricting process, establishes uniform disclosure standards for money in politics, and empowers states to make critical investments in their election systems.Full text of the bill can be found HERE.###"

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-announces-legislation-to-broaden-access-improve-equity-within-school-mental-health-programs-in-light-of-covid-19-pandemic/,"WATCH: Senator Padilla announces legislation to address mental health in schoolsWASHINGTON, D.C. ­– As millions of children return to their classrooms for in-person learning, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) today announced the introduction of the Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act during a press conference with California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tony Thurmond, as well as local leaders, mental health experts, and educators.The legislation would fund pilot programs in primary and secondary schools to address mental and behavioral health issues and implement intervention programs for students. It would also prioritize funding for mental health programs for the most underserved schools across the country. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman David Trone (D-Md.).A 2021 report from Mental Health America indicates that more people are reporting frequent thoughts of suicide and self-harm than have ever been recorded. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that last year, as compared with April – October 2019, the proportion of mental health–related emergency department visits for children aged 5–11 and 12–17 years increased approximately 24 percent and 31 percent, respectively. The effects of increased learning loss, social isolation, uncertainty, and trauma may not manifest for years, and schools must be prepared to deal with this in a preventative, comprehensive, and long-term fashion.The Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act would help address this by directing the Secretary of Education to establish a $20 million 4-year pilot grant program to help schools address mental and behavioral well-being.“As the father of three young boys returning to school for the first time in over a year, I understand firsthand how important it is that our children have the support necessary to seamlessly return to school,” said Senator Padilla.“The stresses and anxieties caused by the pandemic are still very much with us, and even more so with our children. Sadly, these realities are even more severe for low-income communities and communities of color, which often have fewer resources to address mental health issues. This bill would prioritize funding for high-poverty school districts throughout America.”“With mental health declining at an astounding rate, we need to act fast to ensure our children get the mental health care they desperately need,” said Representative Trone. “This program will put preventative measures in place, deliver more resources for support, and ensure that low-income students have access to treatment. I’m proud to be introducing the Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act, and I truly believe we will be making a difference in the lives of those who are most in need.”“It is with great honor that I support U.S. Senator Padilla’s ‘Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act of 2021.’ As California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, I share Senator Padilla’s priority in addressing student mental and behavioral well-being, especially during these challenging times,” said Superintendent Thurmond. “Senator Padilla’s bill is a foundation that will give our students, especially our most vulnerable, the multi-tier support they need to be safe and to thrive in the classroom. I hope that California can leverage the funding in Senator Padilla’s legislation with the Mental Health Coalition that I recently created in California to ensure all partners are working together to develop a network of support and increase student access to mental health/wellness supports. I am looking forward to partnering with Senator Padilla and others to ensure that concrete action continues to be taken towards addressing student mental health.”“Children are experiencing more mental health challenges than ever. They need help—and families don’t know where to turn because the help just isn’t there,” said Jessica Cruz, CEO of NAMI California. “That’s why we’re grateful to Senator Padilla for introducing legislation that would provide grants for school mental health services that help children when and where they need it.”“This bill sheds light on a critical gap in our education system,” said Amy Hernandez, Wellness Coordinator for Pioneer High School at San José Unified School District. “Students learn to read and write, learn about history and science, and practice music or art, but they don’t have a place to learn where to go for help and how to ask for help when they are struggling. Mental health centers in schools teach students how to become self-aware of their thoughts and feelings and how to use coping mechanisms when they face adversity. A 20-minute break in a safe place has the power to change the day’s entire trajectory for a student who is struggling.”The Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act is supported by the American Psychological Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, National Alliance on Mental Illness California, Committee for Children, Collaboration for Academic, Social & Emotional Learning, American Educational Research Association, National Association of School Psychologists, The National Association for Behavioral Intervention and Treat Assessment, Nemours Children’s Health System, Eating Disorders Coalition for Research, Policy & Action, REDC Consortium, Sandy Hook Promise, the Jed Foundation, and Blue Shield of California.“The American Psychological Association applauds Senator Padilla for introducing this critical legislation that acknowledges the interactive relationship among the cognitive, social, emotional and academic development of children and the importance of fostering positive, equitable classroom climates,” said Arthur C. Evans Jr., PhD, CEO of the American Psychological Association. “By providing training for educators and other school staff on evidence-based, trauma-informed practices, and ensuring that the overall well-being of students is the responsibility of the entire school community, the Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act recognizes the role that psychological science plays in student learning and mental health.”“This bill represents an excellent opportunity to support evidence based, systemic SEL in support of positive outcomes for all children and communities. CASEL believes SEL can support safe and healthy learning environments,” said Collaboration for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)“The American Educational Research Association SEL Special Interest Group is proud to endorse the Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Bill. This proposed legislation speaks directly to the critical areas of need in our nation’s school communities. In the absence of systematic and sustainable supports for schools, the wildly diverse and deeply tragic lived experiences of the pandemic and losses within loss of life, security, routine, and community- can continue to exacerbate inequities and disrupt teaching, learning and thriving when all was already interrupted. At the AERA SEL SIG we are hopeful that the recommendations for sustainable investments in the social and emotional health and wellness of students and their teachers and families will provide the necessary prioritization of training, support staff, and resources to equitably support school community thriving hereafter,” said American Educational Research Association“As a leading nonprofit that exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for our nation’s teens and young adults, The Jed Foundation is well aware that, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, our youth are experiencing rising mental health challenges, but that, through schools, we can provide comprehensive mental health safety nets that help promote mental health, recognize students who are struggling and to connect them to effective mental health care,” said John MacPhee, CEO of The Jed Foundation. “That is why we are grateful for the leadership of Sen. Padilla and the supporters of the Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act, and why we wholeheartedly endorse the bill and call for its quick passage.”“This bill recognizes the need to approach student mental health in a comprehensive way and emphasizes prevention by putting evidence-based social-emotional learning at its core,” said Andrea Lovanhill, CFC and CEO of Committee for Children. “It will help millions of students develop coping and communication skills, stress-management techniques, and emotion identification and management methods. Ultimately, it equips young people with tools and resources to address mental health challenges before they arise. Committee for Children is proud to support this bill.”The Comprehensive Mental Health in Schools Pilot Program Act would address mental and behavioral well-being by:The full text of the bill is available HERE.A summary of the legislation is available HERE.A recording of the press conference is available HERE.###"

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-axios-sen-padilla-extreme-weather-events-can-change-political-discourse/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif) joined Axios ahead of U.N. Climate Week to discuss the opportunity and the urgency of incorporating bold climate action into the reconciliation process. The Senator reflected on his own history of climate leadership in California and how many of the key policies being proposed at the federal level to mitigate carbon emissions are inspired by similar efforts that were enacted in California.Key Excerpts:There’s been debate about the size of the investment in these infrastructure packages. Clearly, the bipartisan infrastructure package that has been approved by the Senate is significant, but nowhere near enough. And so we do have a part that we’ll achieve through, we’ve heard the term a lot these days, the budget reconciliation process.We have to go big in our investments in infrastructure and if you’re not convinced that we need to tackle climate with urgency, look at what’s happened in recent weeks. Hurricanes impacting the Gulf Coast, Louisiana hit hard again, the flooding that it caused in the northeast New York, New Jersey, other areas. And of course, many parts of the West, including my home state of California suffered from yet another record setting wildfire season. And so with extreme weather patterns, the sustained drought in California and elsewhere, that should be all the evidence we need to go big on climate and we have such a unique opportunity at this time.[…]I served as chair of the Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Communications, where at the time, for example, we used the Recovery Act dollars coming to California to help fund our California Conservation Corps for things like energy audits, and some of the energy efficiency projects. So it’s a great foundation to point to when I say here, and now, one of my big priorities is the Climate Conservation Corps that we’re trying to fund through the infrastructure packages, plural. We know we can tackle climate, we know that we can retrain workers or training younger workers in jobs for the future, as well, and frankly, help address not just economic justice issues, but economic justice issues because some folks that have been shut out of these investments in the past. Another area that we build on some of California’s experiences are our shift to renewable energy, including providing incentives for more solar, more wind, etc. So the clean energy tax credit that’s being negotiated, I think is an important key part. […]Several months ago, we’re referencing the recent hurricanes, the recent wildfires, but if we take ourselves back a few months, you remember the ice storms in Texas that shut down the grid and had other devastating impacts, not just on Texas but on Texans, specifically. So that I think created an opportunity for me to reach out to my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, and on a bipartisan basis suggest that we put federal funding and federal resources at play to partner with utilities for the purpose of investing in the electrical grid, not just from a reliability standpoint, but from a resiliency standpoint. And while we’re modernizing the grid, we’re also making the grid more efficient, reducing emissions, having the environmental benefits of that.For better and for worse, sometimes it does take natural disasters like this to maybe change the politics and the discourse a little bit. Our measure, which was first introduced as a standalone, POWER ON Act was so popular on both sides of the aisle, that it got absorbed into the bipartisan infrastructure package. The only change they made is they multiplied the amount of money we were asked for by five. And so, glad to see that it was approved by the Senate, can’t wait for it to get to the President’s desk for signature.Read the full interview transcript below: Ben Geman, Axios: Our first guest is the Senator from California, Senator Alex Padilla, joining us from Los Angeles. Senator, thanks for being with us.Senator Padilla: Good to see you, Ben, thank you for having me, obviously, a timely and important topic here.Ben Geman, Axios: I 100% agree and I’d actually like to start with how you think the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the separate multi-trillion dollar legislation that Democrats are trying to move through the budget process will create green energy jobs going forward. And I’d also like to get a sense of what are your top priorities for these measures?Senator Padilla: Sure, well look, there’s a lot to unpack there. But let me start with two things. Number one, reminding us all of not just the need to act, but the urgency with which we need to act on climate. There’s been debate about the size of the investment in these infrastructure packages. Clearly, the bipartisan infrastructure package that has been approved by the Senate is significant, but nowhere near enough. And so we do have a part that we’ll achieve through, we’ve heard the term a lot these days, the budget reconciliation process. We have to go big in our investments in infrastructure and if you’re not convinced that we need to tackle climate with urgency, look at what’s happened in recent weeks. Hurricanes impacting the Gulf Coast, Louisiana hit hard again, the flooding that it caused in the northeast New York, New Jersey, other areas. And of course, many parts of the West, including my home state of California suffered from yet another record setting wildfire season. And so with extreme weather patterns, the sustained drought in California and elsewhere, that should be all the evidence we need to go big on climate and we have such a unique opportunity at this time. In terms of some of the elements, the other point I wanted to make is looking at building on a lot of experience and proven policies that have played a role in the state of California, but also the state Senate. I served as chair of the Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Communications, where at the time, for example, we used the Recovery Act dollars coming to California to help fund our California Conservation Corps for things like energy audits, and some of the energy efficiency projects. So it’s a great foundation to point to when I say here, and now, one of my big priorities is the Climate Conservation Corps that we’re trying to fund through the infrastructure packages, plural. We know we can tackle climate, we know that we can retrain workers or training younger workers in jobs for the future, as well, and frankly, help address not just economic justice issues, but economic justice issues because some folks that have been shut out of these investments in the past. Another area that we build on some of California’s experiences are our shift to renewable energy, including providing incentives for more solar, more wind, etc. So the clean energy tax credit that’s being negotiated, I think is an important key part. And finally, the clean tech accelerator that you’re hearing about. In California, I authored the manufacturing tax incentives that started with clean tech, and has been brought into other areas of advanced manufacturing, but we don’t want to just invest in renewable energy sources, but try to bring a lot of the investment and job creation opportunity here.Ben Geman, Axios: You mentioned some of the extreme weather that, of course, has had a very dramatic and tragic toll on your state, but really nationwide, as you were walking me through, do you get a sense that some of these events that we’re seeing, be it the wildfires or the flooding, or other events, is that influencing the politics of this on Capitol Hill?Senator Padilla: I do think it is and I give you what I point to as an exhibit A. Several months ago, we’re referencing the recent hurricanes, the recent wildfires, but if we take ourselves back a few months, you remember the ice storms in Texas that shut down the grid and had other devastating impacts, not just on Texas but on Texans, specifically. So that I think created an opportunity for me to reach out to my colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, and on a bipartisan basis suggest that we put federal funding and federal resources at play to partner with utilities for the purpose of investing in the electrical grid, not just from a reliability standpoint, but from a resiliency standpoint. And while we’re modernizing the grid, we’re also making the grid more efficient, reducing emissions, having the environmental benefits of that. And so, for better and for worse, sometimes it does take natural disasters like this to maybe change the politics and the discourse a little bit. Our measure, which was first introduced as a standalone, POWER ON Act was so popular on both sides of the aisle, that it got absorbed into the bipartisan infrastructure package. The only change they made is they multiplied the amount of money we were asked for by five. And so, glad to see that it was approved by the Senate, can’t wait for it to get to the President’s desk for signature.Ben Geman, Axios: And, of course, that legislation, which obviously has bipartisan support is, however, on some level tethered to the plan that the Democrats, that your party, is trying to move through the through the budget process. I’m wondering, you know, you’re really trying to sort of thread the needle with that one because, of course, it requires you having every Senate Democrat on board. Are you optimistic that Senators Manchin and Sinema, who are perhaps the most high-profile Senators with some concerns about this measure — Do you think they can be sort of brought to yes, and have you had discussions with them that sort of lay out the case that you just offered to me?Senator Padilla: Look, I do believe we’re going to get to yes, at the end of the day, and that end of the day is going to be in the weeks not the months ahead, because of the urgency that I’ve just laid out. I mean, the flooding that I spoke to maybe didn’t impact West Virginia, but there’s going to be other priority elements of the infrastructure package that my friend Senator Manchin is going to want to prioritize. I know Senator Sinema, representing Arizona, is also familiar with the wildfires and the increasing sheets. And for all of us having to look at the most recent report issued by the leading scientists on climate change, that it’s not just 25 years from now, and the potential impact of a 1.5 degree increase in average temperature. But again, the impact that we’re seeing, now we need to act with urgency. We need to act boldly. That’s half the equation. So, it’s okay to have questions on what the price tag is, but of equal importance is knowing that we’re doing this in a fiscally responsible way — making sure that multinational corporations and the wealthiest families in America are paying their fair share of taxes and recovering additional tax revenue for the state by increasing the capacity of the IRS to enforce existing tax laws. So, it’s not just deficit spending, deficit spending, deficit spending, for deficit spending’s sake. We know there’s a just, progressive, way to fund this. We know the need and the urgency with which we need to invest in our infrastructure and we haven’t even started talking, by the way, about childcare, housing, health care, education, and more.Ben Geman, Axios: You mentioned sort of the emerging scientific information in the very recent report from the United Nations scientific panel, the United Nations is also convening this kind of critical, perhaps even make or break Global Climate Summit later on this fall. To what extent does the Biden administration need to walk into this summit with this legislation passed? I guess what I’m trying to say is, if the negotiations over this bill, go on and delay, and go on further and perhaps into the winter, do you think that’s going to affect the United States’ ability to bring other countries on board to sort of address what, of course, is a global emissions problem?Senator Padilla: Yeah, I think it would be a huge boost to President Biden and the administration’s efforts to bring the rest of the world along. We can talk the talk, and I think he does have a lot of goodwill with leaders around the world, but it’s always so much more impactful when you’ve said to stop what we’re saying, but what we’re doing in the United States. I do think people look at President Biden, and say, there’s a new day. This is not the Trump administration anymore, but it’s one thing to walk the walk, and talk the talk. To walk the walk is to have Congress to have acted by them, so that we can demonstrate to our partners globally, that we’re walking the walk.Ben Geman, Axios: And Senator staying in your home state of California, we just had the governor who appointed you to your, to your current seat, but of course you’ve had a long history in California politics and policy. He has just kind of beat back this effort to recall him. When people went to the polls for that recall, do you think that they had his climate change policies on their mind at all?Senator Padilla: No doubt, no doubt. You turn on the news daily in California right now, especially in the northern half of the state, you’re still seeing the impacts of fires and smoke, people that were forced to evacuate, that sort of thing. And so, I think science was on the ballots in this recall election: science about COVID and the need for vaccines, and science about climate and the urgency with which we need to act to have defeated the recall with such a significant margin, I think, tells us Californians clearly know what’s going on.Ben Geman, Axios: Well, I think we’re going to make that the last word. Senator Padilla, thank you so much for joining us today.Senator Padilla: Thank you so much can’t wait for the next one. Thank you.###"

No other state has more Hispanic-Serving Institutions than California, where we know that diversity is our greatest strength,” said Senator Padilla. “That is why I am proud to launch the HSI Caucus in the Senate with Senator Menendez to help promote equity in higher education both in the Golden State and throughout the country. I’ll continue working in Congress to ensure that HSIs have the tools and resources they need to support our students and the communities that depend on their success.”  “As a proud alumnus of one of New Jersey’s leading Hispanic-Serving Institutions, I experienced first-hand the positive impact these institutions make in the lives of Hispanic students across the country by providing them with unparalleled academic and professional opportunities,” said Senator Menendez. “It gives me great pride to join Sen. Padilla in leading this initiative in the Senate to recognize, promote and enhance the key role Hispanic-Serving Institutions play in preparing our nation’s Hispanic students to succeed academically, thrive economically, and to become our next generation of leaders. At a time when initiatives for inclusion and diversity have become an economic and moral imperative, we will also use this Caucus to support diverse leadership opportunities in higher education.”“The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities is pleased that Senator Padilla and Senator Menendez, who represent states with many HSIs will be leading the Senate HSI Caucus,” said HACU President and CEO Antonio R. Flores. “We hope that through their leadership and the support of more Members of Congress, we can continue to heighten appreciation and federal support for HSIs, resulting in increased funding allocations and enactment of laws that benefit HSIs and the students they serve – the workforce of tomorrow.”Earlier this month, Sen. Padilla supported the launch of the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge, which will work to transform HSIs throughout the California State University system and the nation in order to increase student success and equip Latino and other historically underserved students with skills for high-demand careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). As in previous years, Sen. Menendez led the Senate Resolution to designate the week of September 13, 2021 as “National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.”California is home to 175 HSIs, while New Jersey has a total of 20 such institutions.The Hispanic-Serving Institutions in California are:###"

Among the 13 servicemembers killed during the attack, 10 were stationed at Camp Pendleton and four were California residents.“We have a solemn duty to honor the lives of the 13 servicemembers we lost during the terrorist attacks in Kabul on August 26,” said Senator Padilla. “These heroes served our country through the end of America’s longest war, and we have an obligation to them, their families, and their loved ones to ensure their ultimate sacrifice is properly recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. I will work my colleagues to advance this legislation and ensure that history always remembers them for their courage, dedication, and service to our nation—they deserve nothing less.”“Thirteen brave men and women gave the last full measure to protect Americans and our Afghan allies at a critical moment in our nation’s history—they are American heroes. As the U.S. concludes 20-years of combat in Afghanistan, I believe it’s fitting that Congress commemorates their sacrifice in this moment with the Congressional Gold Medal,” Senator Daines said. “On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you to these heroes and their families, and to all who wear the uniform and protect our freedom.”“We should honor these 13 servicemembers, including U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo of Lawrence, Massachusetts, who were killed last month in Afghanistan while serving our country and working to protect the lives of others. These individuals demonstrated incredible courage throughout their careers, and we owe it to them to pass legislation to recognize their heroic service with the Congressional Gold Medal,” Senator Warren said.The senators are pushing for Sgt.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-celebrates-latino-activism-in-speech-demanding-action-to-protect-voting-rights/,"Padilla joins colleagues on Senate Floor in calling for passage of Freedom to Vote ActWASHINGTON, D.C. ­­– Today, on the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) delivered a speech on the floor of United States Senate celebrating the important work of Willie Velasquez, a voting rights leader who fought tirelessly to improve access to the ballot in Latino communities. Padilla’s speech called on his colleagues in the Senate to follow in Velasquez’ footsteps and pass the Freedom to Vote Act to secure every eligible American’s right to vote.Earlier in the week, Padilla co-led the introduction of the Freedom to Vote Act, legislation to improve access to the ballot for Americans, advance commonsense election integrity reforms, and protect our democracy from relentless voter suppression attacks in state legislatures across the country. Padilla also joined voting rights advocates and other elected officials this week at the Declaration for American Democracy coalition’s rally in support for voting rights legislation.Key Excerpts:The full transcript of Padilla’s remarks as delivered below:Padilla: Mr. President, I rise today as we mark the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month, to reflect on a historic leader whose work inspires me in the fight for voting rights, and the work we have before us.Willie Velasquez, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, dedicated his life to improving the freedom to vote in Latino communities.Everywhere he went, he brought a simple motto: “Su voto es su voz.”Your vote, your vote, is your voice.Willie Velasquez was born in 1944 and grew up in a Latino community in Texas, which suffered from the harms of segregation, redlining, and government neglect.He understood that the path to greater recognition for Latinos was through participation in our democracy.And so, Willie set out to make sure Latinos across the Southwest could participate.In 1974, Willie Velasquez founded his groundbreaking organization, the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.Through his efforts, Willie helped bring the vote—and a powerful voice—to many Latino communities.Willie’s successes built on the hard-earned victories of past civil rights leaders.Especially critical was Congress’s 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, yes, a bipartisan reauthorization of the federal Voting Rights Act, which established protections for language minorities like Spanish speakers.In just ten years, with Willie’s and other activists’ hard work on the ground, the number of Latinos registered to vote nearly doubled.And in the same ten years, the number of Latinos holding elected office also nearly doubled.That is the power of the freedom to vote—and the power of what we can do here in the Senate, here in Congress.Give every American a voice in our democracy.In his time, Willie fought to do exactly this—like generations of Americans, of all ages, colors, creeds, and genders that came before him.Their efforts reflect a fundamental truth about our country: We are stronger when more Americans can vote.We are stronger when all our communities have a say in government.But the path to realizing our highest ideals has never been easy.From a convention hall in Seneca Falls, to a bridge in Selma; from Willie’s home in San Antonio, Texas, to this very chamber, the voting rights victories of each generation have been hard-fought, and hard-won.And it is no different today.In recent months, we’ve seen the latest challenge to the core of our democracy: scores of new laws proposed by Republican state legislatures to target the past five decades of gains in voting rights. Cynical politicians spreading false claims of voter fraud because they fear losing in a fair election.You can see the danger in my home state of California, where, just yesterday, we held a recall election.Republicans ran a campaign of disinformation, spreading baseless claims of massive voter fraud before the polls even closed, before they even opened, and long before a single ballot was even counted.It’s straight out of Donald Trump’s playbook—the same playbook that perpetuated the Big Lie and fueled domestic terrorism that the world witnessed on January 6.And it’s no coincidence that these cynical claims of voter fraud are often targeted at communities of color.In the face of these challenges, we must overcome, together, again.We must renew the collective fight for our democracy.It’s up to us – the time is now to get the job done.Mr. President, it’s an honor to lead the Freedom to Vote Act alongside my colleagues, Senator Klobuchar, Senators Merkley, Warnock, Manchin, King, Tester, and Kaine.The Freedom to Vote Act will make it easier for all eligible citizens to register to vote and to cast their ballot.This bill will set a baseline of protections for voters across the country with commonsense, proven reforms that have already been successfully implemented in blue and red states across the country. I urge all of my colleagues to join us and vote to strengthen our democracy.As the first Latino to represent California in this body, in the United States Senate, I’m proud to be spending this Hispanic Heritage Month fighting for voting rights.Because so many of our community’s gains have been achieved through political participation and representation.The fight to expand voting rights is indeed part of our heritage.It’s also a tradition that unites Americans—because we have come together generation after generation to expand the promise of our democracy for all.Yes: we are strongest when every eligible voter can make their voice heard.Your vote is your voice.Su voto es su voz.Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.###"

Solo en este año, más de medio millón de acres han sido destruidos por las llamas a causa del incendio forestal Dixie, el cual se ha catalogado como el segundo incendio más grande en la historia del estado.Miles de californianos han sido obligados a escapar de sus hogares con solo la ropa que llevan puesta.Recientemente, yo visité el Puesto de Comando del Incidente del incendio forestal Dixie donde me reuní con los socorristas combatiendo los incendios en el estado para ver como el gobierno federal puede asistir a nuestras comunidades. Pero, la realidad es que California no está solo. Todo el oeste de los Estados Unidos está en llamas y los efectos se sienten a través del país.Estos eventos confirman las peores predicciones de un nuevo reporte abrumador de la ONU que señala que muchos de los efectos del calentamiento global están provocando cambios sin precedentes y quizás irreversibles. Como dice el reporte, este es un código rojo para la humanidad.Para muchas partes de California y el resto del país, estos cambios no son nuevos. Por años, comunidades han soportado los efectos de sequías históricas e incendios sin precedentes.Estas temporadas extremas de incendios han empeorado la calidad del aire, lo cual ha provocado más enfermedades respiratorias. No cabe duda que estos inmensos incendios tienen consecuencias graves, sobre todo para los latinos que son especialmente vulnerables a estas enfermedades.La comunidad latina, al igual que otros grupos minoritarios, es afectada desproporcionadamente por enfermedades respiratorias. Los hispanos tienen el doble de probabilidad de visitar el departamento de emergencias por asma, en comparación con los blancos que no son hispanos. Sin embargo, esto no es lo único que añade una complejidad al problema climático para los latinos.Desafortunadamente, en nuestro país los niños latinos tienen el doble de probabilidad de no tener seguro médico comparados a otros niños. Esto es en gran parte a causa de líderes republicanos que se niegan a extender el programa de Medicaid proveído por la ley de Obamacare. Y no podemos olvidar que muchas comunidades de color, incluyendo a los latinos, también tienen más probabilidades de vivir en áreas más vulnerables a las inundaciones y otros eventos relacionados con el cambio climático.Por eso los demócratas están luchando para asegurar que la propuesta de ley de infraestructura bipartidista y la subsiguiente propuesta de ley de presupuesto prioricen la salud de millones de familias latinas a través de inversiones para detener el cambio climático.Por ejemplo, en la propuesta de ley bipartidista de infraestructura logramos añadir medidas que aseguraran que el dinero que estamos invirtiendo también sea usado para remover escombros en las áreas verdes que son el principal combustible para los incendios. También incluimos fondos federales para limpiar la contaminación ambiental. El 29% de los hispanos viven a menos de 3 millas de un área contaminada por químicos industriales, lo que puede conducir a niveles elevados de plomo en la sangre de los niños. Este proyecto de ley invierte $5 mil millones para reducir la contaminación que ha sido heredada en estos sitios. También incluye mi provisión que invertiría $2.5 mil millones para ayudar convertir el uso de autobuses escolares diésel a vehículos de cero emisiones.Estas propuestas crearían millones de trabajos de buen sueldo además de lograr el objetivo de proteger nuestro planeta y mejorar la salud de nuestra comunidad latina. Pero esto es solo el comienzo. Sabemos que el bienestar y la salud de la comunidad latina está relacionada con el bienestar y la salud de nuestro planeta.Por eso también debemos asegurarnos que el presupuesto que estamos debatiendo no solo incluya un camino hacia la ciudadanía para los inmigrantes, pero también este enfocado en combatir las principales causas del cambio climático. Los incendios devastadores seguirán destruyendo hogares, negocios y la salud de muchas familias. Y yo seguiré comprometido a unirme al líder de la mayoría del Senado, Chuck Schumer, y a mis colegas que están dispuestos a trabajar para cumplir con el objetivo del presidente Biden de reducir las emisiones de carbono en un 50 por ciento para el año 2030.Espero que el alarmante reporte de la ONU le habrá los ojos a mis colegas republicanos y los ayude a entender la urgencia de actuar para combatir esta amenaza existencial por el bien del futuro de nuestros hijos. Pero con o sin su apoyo, los demócratas en el Senado están listos para asegurarnos que los latinos y otras comunidades vulnerables al devastador cambio climático sean protegidas.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/funding-package-includes-billions-in-wildfire-disaster-aid-pushed-by-padilla/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Democrats introduced a continuing resolution to fund the federal government through December and included major disaster funding requested by U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D–Calif.). This includes significant investments in wildfire prevention, firefighter pay, and rehabilitation of burned lands.“Funding wildfire prevention and recovery is one of the most cost-effective investments we can make,” Senator Padilla said. “The money we spend now will save lives and billions of dollars in property damage in the coming years. That’s why I have been advocating for increased funding for vegetation management, rehabilitation of burned land, and firefighter pay. The continuing resolution not only helps the federal government meet our obligations, it will help us prevent and respond to disasters. I urge my colleagues in House and Senate to vote for the continuing resolution released today.”Padilla and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Senate leadership urging them to include robust funding in the disaster supplemental funding package as requested by the State of California to support response and recovery efforts related to the historic and devastating recent wildfire seasons.The continuing resolution includes funding for the following:Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program PlusThe continuing resolution includes $10 billion for the Wildfire Hurricane Indemnity Program (WHIP+). This funding helps agricultural producers who have been affected by wildfires, including those who have smoke-tainted crops.Padilla successfully advocated for WHIP funding, including provisions to create separate payment limits for each year so that producers affected in 2020 and 2021 can access assistance without maxing out due to previous crop damage. Another provision requested by Padilla increases the payment limit for assistance, specifically for the specialty crops and high value crops prevalent in California, such as wine grapes.U.S. Forest ServiceThe continuing resolution includes $1.36 billion for expenses related to the consequences of 2019, 2020, and 2021 wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. This includes $175 million for hazardous fuels management—such as vegetation clearing—and $175 million for burned area rehabilitation activities.A waiver of the annual pay cap for emergency wildland fire suppression workers at the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service for 2021 was also included. This is a provision from the Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act, which Senator Padilla introduced with Senator Feinstein earlier this year.Department of the InteriorThe continuing resolutions includes $416 million for expenses related to the consequences of 2019, 2020, and 2021 wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. This includes $55 million for hazardous fuels management and $45 million for burned area rehabilitation activities.Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe continuing resolution includes $5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program to enable long-term disaster recovery relief for major disasters that occurred in 2020 or 2021, including restoration of housing and infrastructure, economic revitalization, and mitigation measures.Department of Homeland Security and FEMAThe continuing resolution includes $50 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants to enhance state and local emergency management capacity.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)The continuing resolution includes $20 million for wildfire research to improve prediction, detection, and forecasting going forward, and $50 million for weather, climate, and wildfire supercomputer research.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-co-leads-legislation-with-senator-warren-rep-cori-bush-to-protect-renters-during-covid-19-pandemic/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Congresswoman Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and over three dozen of their colleagues in introducing the Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021 to enact an urgently needed nationwide eviction moratorium. In direct response to the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down President Biden’s initial eviction moratorium on the grounds that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lacked the statutory authority to mandate such a moratorium, the Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021 would clarify that the HHS Secretary does permanently retain the authority to implement an eviction moratorium in the interests of public health.California has over one million renters who have fallen behind on payments. With the state’s eviction moratorium expiring on September 30, additional federal eviction protections will go a long way in complementing California’s statewide and local efforts to distribute rental assistance. Last week, California’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program hit several key milestones, including surpassing $1 billion in obligated funds and over $520 million in expenditures. This bill would continue to give California time to distribute these federal funds, which are essential to keeping individuals and families in their homes. Last month, Senator Padilla also joined Rep. Bushon the steps of the Capitol in support of extending the national eviction moratorium.“We continue to face a historic housing and homelessness crisis, which has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “In California alone, over 161,000 people experience homelessness each night – including families with young children, veterans, and victims of domestic violence. That is why I am proud to co-lead the Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021, which will ensure people in California and across the country are protected from unreasonable and dangerous evictions in the middle of a pandemic.”“Housing is a human right, not a bargaining chip to let fall between bureaucratic cracks,” said Congresswoman Cori Bush. “Nearly 40 million Americans have tested positive for COVID-19. Over 670,000 people have died of this virus, and countless are living permanently disabled from its aftereffects. As the Delta variant continues to force individuals to quarantine, close schools, and stifle businesses, we must do all we can to save lives. That starts with keeping every person safely housed. The Keeping Renters Safe of 2021 will save lives and give us more time: time for renters to receive financial assistance, time for the economy to fully recover, and time for the pandemic to finally come to an end. I’m humbled to introduce this critical, actionable legislation with Senator Warren and so many of my colleagues.”“This pandemic isn’t over, and we have to do everything we can to protect renters from the harm and trauma of needless eviction, which upends the lives of those struggling to get back on their feet,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren. “Pushing hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes will only exacerbate this public health crisis, and cause economic harm to families, their communities, and our overall recovery. Congress must pass the Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021 to put the eviction moratorium back in place and clarify that HHS has the authority to protect renters throughout this public health crisis. Safe housing saves lives.”The Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021 will protect renters from eviction and curb the spread of COVID-19 by:Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of renters found themselves behind on rent for the first time in their lives, laid off from their jobs, or found their hours cut during lockdowns. The federal, state, and local eviction moratoria were mandated because lawmakers at every level recognized the dire urgency of preventing millions of people from being thrown out onto the street in the middle of a deadly global pandemic.Since then, the majority of those eviction moratoria have lapsed, stimulus checks have come and gone, and unemployment benefits have expired. Yet, a significant portion of Americans continue to experience devastating levels of financial hardship. The Keeping Renters Safe Act of 2021 helps fulfill our promise to help renters during the pandemic.A full text of the bill can be found here.A one-pager on the bill can be found here.In the U.S. Senate, the bill is co-sponsored by: Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.).In the House, the bill is co-sponsored by: Reps.

Jackson Women’s Health OrganizationWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) joined their colleagues to file a bicameral amicus brief in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization along, urging the Supreme Court to uphold nearly 50 years of precedent in Roe v. Wade and protect the constitutional right to abortion care.After the Court refused to block the dangerous, cruel abortion ban in Texas from going into effect, Dobbsrepresents yet another case that could undermine nearly 50 years of precedent and potentially overturnRoe. Dobbs is a challenge from Mississippi’s sole remaining abortion provider against H.B. 1510, the state’s extreme law banning all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape and incest, and only narrow, inadequate exceptions for a medical emergency or in cases of a severe fetal abnormality. The law is blatantly unconstitutional under Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which held that individuals have the right to decide whether or not to be pregnant prior to fetal viability. In 2019, the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court decision halting the Mississippi law’s implementation. “This Court has made clear that abortion bans like H.B. 1510 are unconstitutional because they violate the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability; the decision below should be affirmed on that basis alone. But as a matter of public policy, it is also important to recognize that laws like H.B. 1510 do not merely encroach on individual liberty and autonomy; they also do so in a way that disproportionately imperils the health and economic security of vulnerable populations,” wrote the lawmakers.The lawmakers stressed that the only thing that has changed since Casey and Roe were decided is the composition of the Court—which is not a compelling reason to re-examine Roe. Therefore, the members emphasized that overturning Roe would represent a disregard for settled law, our legal system, and the Constitution. “Respect for precedent—a fundamental principle that is essential to our legal system, the legitimacy of judicial and legislative institutions, and the rule of law—compels affirmance of the decision below.”The lawmakers also noted that the abortion rights codified in Roe and Casey have been settled law for nearly 50 years and 30 years respectively, highlighting that, “adherence to Roe and Casey is even more necessary to protect the settled expectations and reliance interests of multiple generations of individuals who have rightly understood the freedom to decide to terminate a pregnancy before viability as a firmly established constitutional right, and who have never known a world without Roe’s constitutional guarantee.” The Supreme Court has upheld the Constitutional right to an abortion as recently as 2016, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, and again just last year in June Medical Services LLC v. Russo.Both Padilla and Feinstein are cosponsors of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that would guarantee access to and the right to provide abortion services in the United States.The amicus brief was led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Assistant Democratic Leader Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) in the Senate.  In the House, the brief was led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), House Pro-Choice Caucus Co-Chairs Diana DeGette (D-CO) and Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Representative Judy Chu (D-CA).Read the amicus brief HERE.###"

Last month, the Senators sent a letter to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh demanding DOL’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) take action to establish a federal heat stress standard to protect U.S. workers exposed to excessive heat.“I’m grateful that the Biden Administration is beginning to implement the bill Senator Brown and I introduced to protect workers from heat-related illnesses and deaths,” said Senator Padilla. “We must address the rising health risks of extreme heat in the workplace – particularly for low-income communities and communities of color who are bearing the brunt of this climate crisis. I’m proud to see the administration follow our call to take action and look forward to working with them to advance these whole-of-government solutions and create a uniform heat standard to provide workers the dignity and protection they deserve.”Researchers estimate that extreme heat causes around 20,000 workplace injuries every year in California alone. Unsafe work conditions due to extreme heat also cost the state roughly $1 billion in damages. The lowest-paid 20% of workers are more than five times as likely to suffer a heat-related workplace injury than the highest paid 20%. This announcement comes after another summer of record-breaking temperatures with the effects of climate change making extreme heat more frequent and severe.As the Senators requested in a recent letter to the Department of Labor, the Department announced it will be launching a multi-pronged initiative on occupational heat exposure to protect outdoor workers – including agricultural, construction, and delivery workers – as well as indoor workers – including those in warehouses, factories, and kitchens. Specifically, OSHA is announcing today the issuance of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on heat illness prevention in outdoor and indoor work settings. The ANPRM, which will be published next month in the Federal Register, will initiate a comment period allowing for OSHA to gather diverse perspectives and technical expertise on topics including heat stress thresholds, heat acclimatization planning, and exposure monitoring. This is part of a larger, coordinated, interagency effort to respond to extreme heat that threatens the lives and livelihoods of Americans, especially workers, children, and seniors.A full list of actions being announced by the Biden Administration today is available here.###"

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-collins-introduce-bipartisan-outdoors-for-all-act-to-fund-urban-parks-projects/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduced the Outdoors for All Act, legislation that would create a dedicated source of funding for projects that expand outdoor recreational opportunities in urban and low-income communities across the nation. This bipartisan bill is being led by Congresswoman Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.) and Congressman Mike Turner (R-Ohio) in the U.S. House of Representatives.The Outdoors for All Act establishes the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program in federal law and guarantees funding for the program. The ORLP program supports urban parks in underserved communities across the country.“No matter your zip code, everyone should have access to outdoor space in their community,”Senator Padilla said. “Having grown up in Los Angeles, I know all too well how people living in urban areas often lack adequate park space, an injustice that negatively impacts our communities and our environment. The Outdoors for All Act would invest in new parks and open spaces—and upgrade existing ones—to bring nature’s benefits to urban residents’ doorsteps.  Improving park access will provide benefits like shade, tree cover, and clean air that are critical as we grapple with the intensifying effects of the climate crisis.”“Our state is fortunate to have abundant natural resources that allow Mainers and visitors to enjoy our pristine environment,” said Senator Collins.  “Regrettably, many Americans, particularly those living in urban and low-income areas, lack access to outdoor green spaces that give them the ability to experience the beauty and tranquility of nature close to home.  This bipartisan bill would invest in these communities to support parks, playgrounds, trails, and other projects that will help ensure that all Americans have outdoor recreation opportunities.”“By passing the Outdoors for All Act, we make it crystal clear that funding for urbans parks is here to stay. Far too many low-income communities and communities of color lack access to a nearby park or green space. Green spaces are crucial for the health and well being of our communities. By preserving the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership program, we will provide much needed urban parks funding for underserved communities throughout our country,” Congresswoman Barragán said.“This bill would provide investments into parks and recreational areas in lower-income communities to ensure that they are well maintained and safe for people to gather and partake in outdoor activities,” Congressman Turner said.“According to the Trust for Public Land, 78percent of the Daytonians are within a 10-minute walking distance to a park, and with the COVID-19 still present, it is now more important than ever to give communities a well-kept outdoor space to social distance and spend time.”The ORLP program is vital for low-income communities and communities of color that lack equal access to local parks. A survey done by the L.A. County Department of Parks and Recreationfound that, while the average amount of parkland in the county is 3.3 acres per 1,000 residents, the city of Compton reported only 0.6 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. In contrast, the city of Malibu, which has three times the median household income of Compton, has 55.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents.In August, projects in California received nearly $3 million in ORLP funding. These grants will help fund the Ortega Park Revitalization in Santa Barbara, develop the Ford’s Theater trail in Los Angeles County, and redevelop Tidewater Estuary Park in East Oakland.Senator Padilla and Collins’ legislation is cosponsored by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The Outdoors for All Act has been endorsed by the following organizations: American Forests, Corazón Latino, American Hiking Society, Landforce, Latino Outdoors, Outdoor Outreach, San Diego Mountain Biking Association, America Forests, The Venture Out Project, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Pacoima Beautiful, GreenLatinos, Hispanic Access Foundation, The American Alpine Club, Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust, California Outdoor Recreation Partnership, Youth Transportation Organization (Yoots), Fairmount Park Conservancy, Pashek+MTR, Ltd., David Brower Center, Nature for All, National Recreation and Park Association, GirlVentures, Kokatat, Inc., Appalachian Trail Conservancy, Portland Parks Conservancy, Outdoor Afro, Natural Areas Conservancy, National League of Cities, Outdoor Alliance, Sierra Club, YMCA of the USA, City Parks Alliance, KABOOM!, Outdoor Alliance, REI Co-op, East Coast Greenway Alliance , League of Conservation Voters, LWCF Coalition, Continental Divide Trail Coalition, LWCF Coalition, The National Association of State Outdoor Recreation Liaison Officers ( NASORLO ), Seattle Parks Foundation, Pennsylvania Recreation and Park Society, American Society of Landscape Architects, The Wilderness Society, Justice Outside, Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association, REI Co-op, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), American Heart Association, National Wildlife Federation, and the Outdoors Alliance for Kids.Quotes from some of the organizations supporting the Outdoors for All Act can be found HERE.A fact sheet on the Outdoors for All Act is available HERE and a copy of the bill is available HERE.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-bolster-the-creative-economy-provide-relief-for-artists-and-writers/,"Creative Workers Among the Hardest Hit by the COVID-19 PandemicWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and a group of colleagues in introducing the Creative Economy Revitalization Act (CERA) to help bolster the creative economy through the creation of a workforce grants program to employ artists and writers to create publicly available art. U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) are co-sponsors of the legislation in the U.S. Senate, and U.S. Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.)introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.The creative economy was among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in 62 percent of creative workers – or more than 2 million Americans – experiencing unemployment. The arts and cultural sector lost an estimated $15.2 billion due to the pandemic. In California alone, the creative economy generates $230.3 billion per year, accounts for over 740,000 workers, and over 103,000 businesses. Between February 2020 and December 2020, total job loss in California’s creative economy workforce reached about 13 percent. During that period, the state lost 175,000 jobs in that economy, which includes architecture and related services, creative goods and products, entertainment and digital media, fashion and fine arts.The Creative Economy Revitalization Act would:“Artists are vital to the soul of our state and the country. California’s creative economy is a critical piece of our state’s success generating millions of jobs and billions in economic activity,” said Senator Padilla. “That is why we need the Creative Economy Revitalization Act to support local creators and their diverse, thought-provoking art – especially as we rebuild from a pandemic that has disproportionately affected artists’ livelihood.”“New Mexico’s vibrant creative economy is a critical economic driver for our state. As artists continue to recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s essential that Congress provides support and relief to this important industry,” said Senator Luján. “This legislation will put New Mexico artists back to work and fuel the creative economy across the country. I’m grateful to Rep. Leger Fernández and my Senate colleagues for their leadership on this issue as support for this legislation continues to grow.”“During times of crisis, we turn to the arts for comfort and expression. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic harmed the revenues and sustainability of the many small businesses, artists, and live entertainment venues that make New York State a world-renowned cultural destination,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The Creative Economy Revitalization Act (CERA) would help these small businesses and jumpstart creative economies across the nation. This legislation is inspired by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, which hired artists who collectively created more than 100,000 paintings and murals and over 18,000 sculptures that are still found in municipal buildings, schools, and hospitals. I am committed to protecting and progressing the legacy of American art and culture by ensuring that the Creative Economy Revitalization Act puts creative Americans to work in communities in New York and across our nation.”“New Mexico’s artists and cultural institutions were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Luján to establish workforce grant programs tailored specifically to the unique strengths and challenges facing our creative arts and cultural sectors. These targeted investments will help artists and performers build back what has been a key driver of our state’s economy and sustain the traditions and creativity that have long supported our diverse and vibrant cultural heritage,” said Senator Heinrich.“I grew up with musicos and poetas coming in and out of our family home. Through art, I gained pride in my identity and an understanding and appreciation for other cultures,” said Leger Fernández. “I’m inspired by the cultural legacy we inherited from the WPA. Similarly, this pandemic has devastated our creative workers and we must engage them to create art that unites and brings joy to our communities. In a time when our nation is so divided, we desperately need to be reminded of what makes our communities beautiful and diverse. This bill will provide grants to help fund projects that bring communities back together and remind us of what binds us together as Americans. We will build back beautifully.”“We applaud Senator Padilla’s leadership in joining Senator Lujan in introducing CERA, the Creative Economy Revitalization Act,” said Julie Baker, Executive Director, Californians for the Arts. “As California represents 25% of the nation’s creative industries, CERA is essential to the recovery and stability of our creative workforce and economy as a whole. Artists are our nation’s second responders and now more than ever we need to recognize, employ and value with living wages their economic, social, emotional and health benefits to every community in CA and the United States.”Earlier this month, the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution in support of the Creative Economy Revitalization Act. More than 175 organizations endorsed the legislation, including the Freelancers Union, Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, City of Albuquerque Department of Arts & Culture, Americans for the Arts, Authors Guild, American Planning Association, Arts Workers United, National Alliance of Community and Economic Development Agencies (NACEDA), U.S. Department of Arts and Culture (USDAC), National Writers Union, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), Actors’ Equity Association, and Department for Professional Employees – AFL-CIO.“Americans for the Arts, in partnership with the nation’s 4,500 local arts agencies, 56 state arts agencies, 5.2 million creative workers and the state arts alliances that advocate for them, endorses the Creative Economy Revitalization Act to invest in the creative economy. Supporting creative workers makes strong business sense as the arts drive economic and community transformation in American cities and towns. The Arts are a national asset, and our country thrives because artists and creative workers are a part of the collective workforce helping our citizens recover and grow from the trauma of COVID-19 and racial inequity, restart stalled local economies, and reimagine our shared way forward,” said Nolen V. Bivens, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts.Full text of the legislation can be found HERE.###"

SenatorPadilla also announced that since the program went live on May 12, 2021 over 730,000 households in California have enrolled in the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit program, which helps subsidize the cost of broadband for households.In July, Senator Padilla hosted an informational webinar with Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to encourage local libraries and school districts across the Golden State to apply for the Emergency Connectivity Fund. In light of outstanding demand, the FCC will open the second application filing window—which will run from September 28 to October 13—to provide support for the current school year. Funding is available for the purchase of laptops and tablets, Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers, and broadband connections for off-campus use by students, school staff, and library patrons in need, and is available to support off-campus learning, such as homework. Sen. Padilla also encouraged Californians to enroll in the Emergency Broadband Benefit which provides a discount of up to $50 per month towards broadband service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Additionally, through this program households can receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers.“As the COVID-19 pandemic made clear, internet access is essential infrastructure,” said Senator Padilla. “I’m glad to see many communities across the state take advantage of these two important programs, which will help close the homework gap for students who lack necessary digital devices or internet access. While most students have returned to in-person learning, the digital divide still affects our children’s ability to learn and succeed outside of the classroom. I encourage eligible schools and libraries to apply during the second application window to ensure that they receive the resources needed to help our students succeed.”“If we truly want to level the playing field for students in California – to ensure all students have access to the technology and tools that not only help them access their learning remotely but will be needed for success later in life – we cannot rest until we close this digital divide,” said State Superintendent Thurmond. “Together we can find solutions to the inequities our students and educators have been facing. We are grateful for Senator Padilla’s work and the fact we have already connected hundreds of thousands of children statewide through this program. More needs to be done. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for schools to apply for these funds now.”“California’s public libraries have long been advocates for digital equity and access for their patrons.  As a result of Senator Padilla’s championing of the Emergency Connectivity Fund and with the support of the California State Library to maximize this opportunity, California’s libraries have applied for millions of dollars,” said Laura Sasaki, California State Libraries Broadband Program Manager. “These much-needed funds will provide devices and hotspots, giving library patrons access to a basic need – devices and the broadband internet services that connect them to so many resources for daily life – from their own homes.  While the work is far from done, reaching beyond the physical walls of a library building is a huge step towards connecting all Californians and closing the digital divide.”Schools and libraries across California that are eligible for support under the FCC’s E-Rate program are eligible to request and receive support through the Emergency Connectivity Fund program. Tribal libraries eligible for support under the Library Services and Technology Act are also eligible for support under the program.The $7.17 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund program—which was included in the American Rescue Plan that Senator Padilla voted to enact—will help provide relief to millions of students, school staff, and library patrons for the current 2021-22 school year. Senator Padilla also recently co-sponsored the SUCCESS Act, which would provide $40 billion over five years to extend the FCC’s Emergency Connectivity Fund and enable schools and libraries to continue supporting remote learning.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-booker-merkley-lead-push-to-enhance-nations-data-science-and-literacy-education/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), along with Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), led a group of colleagues in urging the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve equity and access to high-quality K-12 data science education. The Senators also asked how Congress can better support the development and deployment of data science curriculum to reach more communities and open doors to STEM careers.Increasing access to high-quality data science education will help students keep pace with our 21st century world. One poll found that while 69 percent of employers would prefer candidates with data science skills, only 23 percent of educators said their graduates would possess those skills. Only 25 percent of students took a statistics course in 2019. Moreover, enhancing data science education would improve equity in the workforce. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of federal employment and education data, Black and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented compared with their share of all workers, occupying only six and seven percent of STEM jobs, respectively.“Enhancing data science education will have significant benefits for our nation’s citizenry and economy. Like reading, writing, and arithmetic, basic data literacy is vital for informed democratic participation. We also see employers increasingly demanding data science expertise. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of computer and information research scientists is expected to grow 15 percent between 2019 to 2029, far exceeding the average growth rate of other occupations,” wrote the Senators.The Senators asked the NSF and IES to “describe any past, existing or planned efforts to enhance equitable access to data science education and data science careers, as well as any efforts to increase research in this field.” They also ask what additional funding or resources are necessary to adequately support meaningful and coordinated research around data science education within IES and NSF.California is a leader in the nation on this issue. Los Angeles Unified School District and the University of California, Los Angeles partnered to implement an NSF-funded “Introduction to Data Science” curriculum in 2014. The course is designed to equip students with critical skills and knowledge, such as coding and media literacy, as well as to increase the number of students pursuing STEM careers, including historically underrepresented students. This curriculum has since expanded to school districts nationwide.The letter is cosigned by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Director Schneider and Director Panchanathan,We write to learn how Congress can better support the work of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to increase access to high-quality data science education, so that all students can keep pace with our 21st century world.Enhancing data science education will have significant benefits for our nation’s citizenry and economy.

It is essential that the federal government helps increase the quality and accessibility of data science education to ensure equity, foster an informed citizenry, and unlock the promise and potential of a generation of diverse data scientists who will help our society innovate. Moreover, as we learn more about how artificial intelligence algorithms may be coded with implicit biases, it is critical that we foster a diverse data science workforce that will work toward development of more equitable technologies.We have seen a successful model of this already.

It would designate nearly 600,000 acres of new wilderness, more than 583 miles of new wild and scenic rivers, and expand an existing national monument by over 100,000 acres.“I am glad to see the PUBLIC Lands Act continue to gain momentum with today’s House passage. This bill will increase access to California’s world-class nature for communities of color and all Californians,” said Senator Padilla. “Our public lands are some of our state’s greatest gifts – from the San Gabriel Mountains to the Central Coast and through Northwestern California’s forests and rivers. We must be thoughtful stewards of these special places so that communities can continue to enjoy them and benefit from our rich natural heritage for generations to come. And we must do so in a way that reverses racial and economic disparities in access to nature and our public lands. Now, I will be pushing my colleagues in the Senate to follow suit and pass these critical protections.”“Nature is priceless, but it is too often taken for granted,” said Representative Salud Carbajal (CA-24).“Pragmatic policies that defend our public lands from development make a real difference in the fight against climate change, give residents and visitors the opportunity to appreciate the great outdoors, and boost our local economy, all while preserving the plant and animal life that call these public lands home. I am proud to see the Protecting America’s Wilderness Act, which includes my Central Coast Heritage Protection Act, pass the House as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. I will continue fighting to protect the public lands that make the Central Coast uniquely beautiful, so our children and grandchildren can enjoy them for generations to come.”“The San Gabriel Mountains, with their beautiful rivers, forests, and mountain trails so close to the density of Los Angeles, are a true gift for the millions who have little to no access to parks or green space,” said Representative Judy Chu (CA-27). “That’s why I want to make sure as many people as possible have the chance to visit, both today and for years in the future. Today’s vote takes us one step closer to making this vision a reality. As our city grows and our climate changes, these untouched wild lands and habitats could disappear. This amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) will not only preserve this land for future generations, it will also create a National Recreation Area that will let even more Angelenos enjoy our mountains.”“Because of the filibuster, the NDAA is one of the few tools Congress has left to pass urgent and necessary reforms,” said Representative Huffman (CA-02). “In this year’s bill, progressives were able to secure some important provisions, including my Northwest California public lands bill. This bill is critical for building a future for the North Coast where public lands are resilient and our outdoor recreation economy grows while we preserve environmental values for future generations. I’m glad to see this make it through, but I’m going to keep working with my colleagues to decrease the bloated defense budget.”“We applaud the House for passing legislation to preserve the pristine lands and waters in the state of California, and across the nation, while also ensuring all communities, regardless of race, zip code or income, have access to the outdoors,” said Daniel Rossman California Deputy Director of The Wilderness Society. “These bills have been crafted with years of community engagement, in some cases more than two decades. Now is the time to act; we echo the call of Senators Padilla and Feinstein to get this legislation passed into law.”The PUBLIC Lands Act is a legislative package which consists of three bills that were originally introduced in the House of Representatives including:A copy of the bill is available HERE and a one-pager on the PUBLIC Lands Act can be found HERE.###"

We can create millions of good-paying jobs as we repair our crumbling infrastructure, address the climate crisis, and finally confront the long-neglected crises facing millions of low-income and working-class families across this country. But we can accomplish those goals only if we stick to our original agreement.“We voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill with the clear commitment that the two pieces of the package would move together along a dual track. Abandoning the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act and passing the infrastructure bill first would be in violation of that agreement. Congress must not undercut the President’s proposals that will create new opportunities for America’s families and workers. The House of Representatives should wait to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill until the budget reconciliation bill, which enacts the rest of the President’s Build Back Better agenda, is sent to the President’s desk.“Now is the time to pass both of these major pieces of legislation. We have no time to waste. We strongly support the Congressional Progressive Caucus and other members in the House who have said they intend to vote for the bipartisan infrastructure bill only once the Build Back Better Act is passed.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-bipartisan-group-of-colleagues-urge-treasury-secretary-to-establish-an-office-of-tribal-affairs/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.) urged U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to establish an Office of Tribal Affairs improve the Department’s tribal consultation process, strengthen the Department’s relationship with tribal nations, and provide more in-house expertise on matters affecting tribal nations.Senator Padilla has been a leading voice advocating for improved tribal consultation and elevating Tribal voices in federal decision-making. California has the largest number of Tribes in the lower 48 states, with 109 distinct federally recognized Tribal governments and a population of over 723,225 American Indians.Treasury has long had a role in matters, including tax and finance issues, that have seriously affected the welfare and sovereignty of some tribal nations. This role has increased over time and has become extremely important during the COVID-19 pandemic after Congress charged Treasury with the crucial responsibility of disbursing to tribal nations billions of dollars in relief funds. The Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Community Development Financial Institutions Program, and the Office of Recovery Programs are just some of the Treasury components that make decisions affecting tribal nations with regard to COVID-19 relief implementation, tribal economic development, taxation and tax incentives, capital finance and capital needs, trade policy, and more.“The recent tribal consultations and interactions between Treasury and tribal nations underscore the need for sufficient, dedicated, in-house expertise at Treasury on tribal policy matters. The establishment of such an office has support from Indian Country and would improve Treasury’s ability to fulfill its trust responsibilities to respect the nation-to-nation relationship between the federal government and tribal nations,” wrote the lawmakers.President Biden’s January 26, 2021 memorandum affirms the importance of tribal consultation—and states that it is his “priority” to make “regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations cornerstones of Federal Indian policy.” Treasury has acknowledged this commitment as well; the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury has “reiterated the importance of the nation-to-nation consultation process.” An Office of Tribal Affairs would help achieve this.“Although the pandemic has underscored the urgency of Treasury having proper in-house capacity to address tribal issues appropriately, this need existed before the pandemic and before this administration, and, absent institutional changes at the Department, it will continue to exist after the pandemic and after this administration,” wrote the lawmakers.The senators have requested a response no later than October 13, 2021.Full text of the bipartisan letter can be found HERE and below:Dear Secretary Yellen:We write to ask that the Department of the Treasury establish an Office of Tribal Affairs.

The recent historic appropriation of federal funding for Tribal governments via the Treasury Department has the potential to be transformative and life-altering, which places a great responsibility on the Department to ensure that this consequential funding is allocated fairly while guaranteeing that subsequent regulations are reflective of the realities that tribal nations face. The Internal Revenue Service, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Community Development Financial Institutions Program, and the Office of Recovery Programs are just some of the Treasury components that make decisions with enormous impact on tribal nations, in such areas as COVID-19 relief implementation, tribal economic development, taxation and tax incentives, capital finance and capital needs, and trade policy.The recent work of Treasury during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the Department requires a more formalized body to interact with tribal nations. Treasury needs a sufficient number of permanent personnel who can help improve the Department’s tribal consultation process, strengthen the Department’s relationship with tribes, and provide more inhouse expertise on matters affecting tribal nations. The Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee (TTAC), established under section 3(a) of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, plays an important role, but this body is not a substitute for a dedicated Office of Tribal Affairs with a sufficient number of full-time, in-house personnel. Indeed, an Office of Tribal Affairs would likely help coordinate the TTAC’s work.President Fawn Sharp of the National Congress of American Indians has testified that “an Office of Tribal Affairs is critically needed within Treasury to address tribal economic development, tax, and capital needs; integrate tribal nations within Treasury policy making; and facilitate tribal consultations.” Recent events have confirmed President Sharp’s statement. Concerns about Treasury’s interactions with tribal nations regarding pandemic relief funding were also voiced during the last administration.In light of President Biden’s memorandum affirming the importance of tribal consultation—which states that it is his “priority” to make “regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations cornerstones of Federal Indian policy”—we believe Treasury has an obligation to provide permanent personnel to ensure that the Department’s tribal consultations meet the goals set forth by the President. Treasury acknowledges this point as well; the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury has “reiterated the importance of the nation-to-nation consultation process.” An Office of Tribal Affairs would help achieve this.Although the pandemic has underscored the urgency of Treasury having proper in-house capacity to address tribal issues appropriately, this need existed before the pandemic and before this administration, and, absent institutional changes at the Department, it will continue to exist after the pandemic and after this administration. Therefore, we urge the Department of the Treasury to establish an Office of Tribal Affairs.We respectfully request a response by October 13, 2021, regarding your plans on this matter. Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,###"

The letter also requests that the agencies issue guidance to provide clarity on the current status of these types of applications.Afghans applying for humanitarian parole from outside of the United States must currently pay $575 to have their application processed by the Department of Homeland Security. For many Afghans applying for this status, these costs are a prohibitive barrier in the application process.“Given the extreme financial hardship and immediate danger facing Afghans fleeing to the United States, we urge you to implement a blanket waiver on fees for Afghans and their families when they apply for humanitarian parole into the United States, and we ask that you issue guidance for applicants and attorneys who are filing for this status,” said the Senators.“The burden of application fees is weighing heavily on communities here in the United States. Families and friends of Afghans who are trying to apply for humanitarian parole are shouldering payments and are being forced to make difficult financial decisions,” the Senators continued. The letter also asks questions related to the number of Afghans who have applied for parole and how many have been granted waivers.California is home to the largest Afghan population in the United States and Senator Padilla has remained committed to the safe evacuation of Americans and our Afghan allies, and supporting the safe relocation of Afghan refugees, evacuees, and parolees to California. Earlier this month, he led a letter to President Biden asking him to continue the safe relocation of Afghan refugees, parolees, evacuees, and Special Immigrant Visa applicants to the United States. He also joined a bicameral letter asking the administration to take specific steps to ensure that humanitarian aid can continue to reach the Afghan people.In addition to Senators Padilla and Blumenthal, the letter was also signed by Senators Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Christopher Coons (D-Del.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).Full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Director Jaddou:Given the extreme financial hardship and immediate danger facing Afghans fleeing to the United States, we urge you to implement a blanket waiver on fees for Afghans and their families when they apply for humanitarian parole into the United States, and we ask that you issue guidance for applicants and attorneys who are applying for this status.It is important to note that individuals processed as refugees are not subject to any fees, and we believe the same standard should apply to parolees from Afghanistan. However, the current fee facing Afghans who apply for humanitarian parole is $575 per applicant. Under federal regulations, the Director of USCIS holds the authority to waive fees under 8 CFR 103.7(d) which states:“the Director of USCIS may approve and suspend exemptions from any fee required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or provide that the fee may be waived for a case or specific class of cases that is not otherwise provided in this section, if the Director determines that such action would be in the public interest and the action is consistent with other applicable law.”While we understand that an application for a waiver can be filed on an individual basis through an I-912 form, many applicants are justifiably concerned the additional filing and adjudication time will slow down the processing time and require paperwork they do not have in order to show financial hardship. In addition, if parole is authorized, a second fee for the DS-160 form of $160 must also be paid to the Department of State for a nonimmigrant visa. This means each individual attempting to be considered for humanitarian parole must pay $735 in fees to reach safety.The burden of application fees is weighing heavily on communities here in the United States. Families and friends of Afghans who are trying to apply for humanitarian parole are shouldering payments and are being forced to make difficult financial decisions. Some have even appealed to local governments to help them cover the costs of these fees.For these reasons, we urge you to implement a blanket waiver on fees for humanitarian parolees from Afghanistan and to expedite their applications. We also urge you to issue clear guidance so that applicants and attorneys can understand what options are available to them and if they qualify for humanitarian parole and a waiver.In addition, we ask that you provide answers to the following questions no later than October 11, 2021:1.     How many Afghan nationals have applied for humanitarian parole since August 1, 2021?2.     How many humanitarian parole applications have been approved since August 1, 2021?3.     How many requests for fee waivers were made by Afghan nationals applying for humanitarian parole since August 1, 2021?4.     Please provide the status of those fee waiver requests including whether they have been granted, denied, or are pending review.5.     Does USCIS plan to issue guidance on the fees associated with humanitarian parole?6.     Has USCIS considered implementing a blanket fee waiver for Afghan humanitarian parole requests? If so, what, if any barriers, are preventing USCIS from engaging in immediate implementation?Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,###"

Production has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, due in no small part to the essential role these workers play in the creative process. The entertainment you jointly produce is helping to heal our nation.The current contract under negotiation covers approximately 60,000 motion picture and television production workers across the country. Failure to reach an agreement would threaten not only the livelihoods of these workers, but also their family members who rely upon work in your industry, sending shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy and the industry.The key issues in this negotiation, as we’ve come to understand them, are about worker dignity and basic human necessities. We are united in our belief in the importance of livable wages, sustainable benefits, and reasonable rest periods between shifts and during the workday.Reportedly, IATSE members are mobilizing in preparation for a nationwide strike authorization vote on October 1, 2021, because of the announcement that AMPTP does not intend to make a counteroffer. A strike would dramatically disrupt the industry, the economy, and the communities we represent. We are hopeful that both sides can negotiate in good faith and reach a consensus agreement, which necessitates both parties continuing to participate in ongoing negotiations.We ask that the AMPTP negotiate collaboratively with these workers to reach a fair contract and address the basic human needs that will allow them to do their jobs safely and with dignity.Sincerely,Members of CongressCC: The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees###"

She spent the previous decade working as a federal public defender in San Diego.“Judge Ohta is a Korean immigrant and was appointed last year by Governor Newsom to serve on the Superior Court of San Diego County. Before her appointment to the court, she was a deputy attorney general in California.“President Biden is keeping to his commitment to make the federal bench more representative. So far, the president’s nominees to fill California vacancies on the federal courts have overwhelmingly been women and people of color with diverse professional experience, highlighting his commitment to creating a federal bench that better represents the nation.“This is the type of diversity we need on our federal courts – both in their background and professional experience.

Voluntary payroll tax credits for employers with fewer than 500 employees will expire today, September 30, 2021, effectively making it harder for businesses to offer paid time off for employees seeking their first vaccinations or vaccine booster shots.As the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to infect Americans across the country, it is more important than ever to remove barriers to vaccination in order to put the pandemic behind us. Experts have suggested that one of the most effective incentives for vaccination is paid time off. In their letter, the Senators urge the administration do everything it can to ensure employers offer paid leave for working people in this country to get vaccinated.“Millions of hourly shift workers are financially unable to take unpaid time off for vaccination and recovery. These workers are disproportionately from low-income, minority, and immigrant communities. According to a recent survey, nearly 20% of workers have not been vaccinated because they are afraid of missing work or are too busy.” said the lawmakers. “In June, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 65% of workers were encouraged by their employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but only 50% received paid time off to get the shot or recover from side effects. Workers in the group that received paid time off were more likely to be vaccinated.”“We urge the Department of Labor (DOL) to identify the parts of federal law for which DOL has enforcement authority, if any, that would provide for time off for a COVID-19 vaccination. In the upcoming OSHA ETS, we ask that you clarify details on the requirement for paid time off to be given for an employee to receive the vaccine and to recover from any side effects,” the lawmakers continued.In addition to Senator Padilla and Representative Nadler, the letter was signed by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and more than 20 Members of the House of Representatives.Full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Walsh and Mr. Zients,As the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 task force executes its comprehensive national strategy to combat COVID-19, we write to urge you to continue to work with Congress, private companies, states, territories, Indian Tribes, and other jurisdictions to ensure that employees are offered full pay for any time off needed to get vaccinated, and we ask that you respond by identifying any statutory changes necessary to help you meet this goal.Millions of hourly shift workers are financially unable to take unpaid time off for vaccination and recovery. These workers are disproportionately from low-income, minority, and immigrant communities. According to a recent survey, nearly 20% of workers have not been vaccinated because they are afraid of missing work or are too busy. That proportion increased to 26% for Black workers and 40% for Hispanic workers. In June, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 65% of workers were encouraged by their employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but only 50% received paid time off to get the shot or recover from side effects. Workers in the group that received paid time off were more likely to be vaccinated.As infections with the Delta variant rise across the country, it is more important than ever for the administration to use its full authority to increase our nation’s COVID-19 vaccination rate and put the pandemic behind us. Likewise, it is vital that the federal government continues to support paid leave for working people in this country to get vaccinated and recover from any after-effects of vaccination.

I’m proud to support this bill that will provide billions of dollars in critical funding to California for wildfire disaster response and drought relief, as well as funding to help re-settle Afghan refugees. It will also ensure that current government spending continues uninterrupted while we continue to negotiate bold new investments that deliver action on climate change, immigration, affordable child care, and so much more.“Senate Republicans can’t have it both ways as they rack up debt when they’re in the majority and then avoid responsibility for it once they’re in the minority – all while they weaponize the filibuster to prevent Congress from addressing our nation’s impending credit default. Republicans’ irresponsible political games risking global economic catastrophe must stop.”The bill includes disaster-related funding for the following programs:Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program PlusThe funding bill includes $10 billion for the Wildfire Hurricane Indemnity Program (WHIP+). This funding helps agricultural producers who have been affected by wildfires, including those who have smoke tainted crops.Several provisions advocated for by Padilla were included. One will create separate payment limits for each year, so that those producers affected in 2020 and 2021 can access assistance without maxing out due to previous crop damage. Another increases the payment limit for assistance, specifically for specialty crops and high value crops, such as wine grapes.U.S. Forest ServiceThe bill helps keeps federal firefighters on the job working with our state partners to keep communities safe by including $1.36 billion for expenses related to the consequences of 2019, 2020, and 2021 wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. This includes $175 million for hazardous fuels management—such as vegetation clearing—and $175 million for burned area rehabilitation activities.A waiver of the annual pay cap for emergency wildland fire suppression workers at the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service for 2021 was also included. This is a provision from the Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act, which Senator Padilla introduced with Senator Feinstein earlier this year and pushed leadership to include in this spending bill.Department of the InteriorThe bill includes$416 million for expenses related to the consequences of 2019, 2020, and 2021 wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters. This includes $55 million for hazardous fuels management and $45 million for burned area rehabilitation activities.Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe bill includes $5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program to enable long-term disaster recovery relief for major disasters that occurred in 2020 or 2021, including restoration of housing and infrastructure, economic revitalization, and mitigation measures.Department of Homeland Security and FEMAThe bill includes $50 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants to enhance state and local emergency management capacity.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)The bill includes $6.9 million to repair or replace assets, facilities, and equipment damaged by hurricanes or wildfires. $20 million is included for wildfire research to improve prediction, detection, and forecasting going forward, and $50 million is included for weather, climate, and wildfire supercomputer research.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-demand-transparency-in-oil-spill-investigation-call-for-additional-safety-measures/,"Senators call for Biden administration’s support for West Coast Protection ActWASHINGTON, D.C.—Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (both D-Calif.) called on Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to investigate the recent oil spill off the coast of California, make public the results of the investigation and commit to clear timelines for safety regulations, such as inspections, shut-off valves and leak detection systems, in existing pipelines.The letter highlights reports that the pipeline’s owner, Amplify Energy, has a history of violating safety regulations. The senators asked the Department of Transportation, which has oversight over pipeline safety, to ensure the company properly notified authorities when it first discovered the leak and to provide a thorough public report to Congress on its findings.Additionally, the senators urged the administration’s support to include the West Coast Protection Act in the budget reconciliation bill. The legislation led by Senator Feinstein and cosponsored by Senator Padilla would prohibit new offshore oil drilling off the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. “We write with great concern regarding the massive oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, California and request that you provide us and the public with maximum transparency and identify steps to ensure this never occurs again,” the senators wrote. “The breach of the pipeline has leaked an estimated 144,000 gallons of oil into the Pacific Ocean, causing irreparable harm to local ecosystems, devastating wildlife, and closing beaches to the public.”The senators continued: “The history of Amplify Energy Corporation and its subsidiary Beta Offshore Operating Co., is of particular concern. Recent reports show that Beta Offshore has a long record of noncompliance incidents and violations, including two violations in 2013 and 2014 that resulted in two workers being injured, 72 so-called component and facility shut-in noncompliance incidents, in which violations had to be corrected before the company could continue the activities in question, and 53 additional noncompliance warnings.”Full text of the letter follows:October 6, 2021The Honorable Pete ButtigiegSecretaryU.S. Department of Transportation1200 New Jersey Avenue, SEWashington, D.C. 20590Dear Secretary Buttigieg,            We write with great concern regarding the massive oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, California and request that you provide us and the public with maximum transparency and identify steps to ensure this never occurs again. The breach of the pipeline has leaked an estimated 144,000 gallons of oil into the Pacific Ocean, causing irreparable harm to local ecosystems, devastating wildlife, and closing beaches to the public.            We urge you, in partnership with the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board, to put every resource into determining the exact details of the spill. It is our understanding that the 17.7-mile pipeline had been displaced by about 105 feet, and there was a 13-inch split along the length of the pipe. However, the public needs to know when the drop in pressure was first identified by the operator, when authorities were notified, when the spill was first detected, and what impact this timing had on subsequent response mobilization. Additionally, given differing reports about this timeline, it is imperative to determine exactly how much oil the pipeline spilled, whether automated notifications and shut-off valves were properly employed, and document the effects on local ecosystems and wildlife. We also request information on when the public can expect cleanup to be completed, and what agencies and contractors will be employed in the effort.            The history of Amplify Energy Corporation and its subsidiary Beta Offshore Operating Co., is of particular concern. Recent reports show that Beta Offshore has a long record of noncompliance incidents and violations, including two violations in 2013 and 2014 that resulted in two workers being injured, 72 so-called component and facility shut-in noncompliance incidents, in which violations had to be corrected before the company could continue the activities in question, and 53 additional noncompliance warnings.            We also urge you to clearly identify for policymakers what additional regulatory, statutory, and technological steps could be implemented, based on your investigation to ensure a spill of this magnitude does not occur again. While we work to permanently end offshore drilling, this spill has made clear that existing pipelines must be required to have modern safety technologies.            Finally, as clean and renewable energy become an increasingly large share of California’s electrical grid, such spills and destruction become even more unnecessary and wasteful. That is why we have introduced the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, which would prohibit new offshore oil drilling off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington. This bill has the support of every single West Coast Senator, and we urge the Administration’s support to include this meaningful legislation in the budget reconciliation bill.Sincerely,Dianne FeinsteinUnited States SenatorAlex PadillaUnited States Senator ###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-delivers-remarks-on-historic-nomination-of-judge-lucy-koh-for-9th-circuit-court-of-appeals/,"If confirmed, Koh will become the first Korean American woman to serve on a federal circuit courtWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) delivered remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the nomination of Lucy Haeran Koh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Koh’s historic nomination reflects efforts to rebuild the federal bench in a way that better reflects the rich diversity of our nation.Remarks as delivered are available below and video of the full remarks available here.Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Ranking Member Grassley.It’s my honor to introduce to the committee Judge Lucy Koh, from the great state of California, as President Biden’s nominee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Koh is joined here today by her family – her husband, Tino Cuellar, daughter Ria, and son Mateo.I think they’re proud of mom. So proud they took red eye flights just to make sure they were here today.She is also joined by her mother, her brother, and several other members of her extended family and I had an opportunity to welcome each one of them and thank them for sharing Judge Koh with us in public service. In many ways, Judge Koh’s story epitomizes the American dream.She is the daughter of Korean immigrants who fled communism and dictatorship in search of a better life, Judge Koh was born here in Washington, DC and raised in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Her experiences there, in public schools challenged with poverty and discrimination, along with the experiences of working in her father’s small businesses, and surrounded by the love and lessons of her immigrant family, helped shape this unique and necessary perspective that she now brings to the federal bench.Judge Koh worked her way through Radcliffe College and Harvard Law School and began her legal career right here on this Committee, as a Women’s Law and Public Policy Fellow.Judge Koh went on to build a career as a trailblazing public servant and an outstanding legal thinker.She spent seven years as a lawyer for the United States Department of Justice, earning numerous accolades for her work, including an FBI award for excellence in prosecuting major fraud. Judge Koh then found her way to Silicon Valley, where she made a name for herself as an expert litigator of intellectual property cases.Her good work and reputation extended far and wide, and in 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger—a Republican—appointed her to the Superior Court in California. Just two years later, President Barack Obama nominated Judge Koh to the federal district court bench.She was confirmed unanimously Mr. Chair, unanimously, by 97 members of this Senate—including members who serve on this Committee today.In the decade since, Judge Koh has gone on to distinguish herself as a jurist, issuing over 3,200 opinions, and presiding over more than 270 trials.She is well known, not only in her district, but across the country, as a talented, thoughtful, smart, and fair judge.In 2016, this Committee—including Ranking Member Grassley and Senator Graham—voted 13-7 in support of Judge Koh’s nomination to the Ninth Circuit.Unfortunately, Judge Koh’s nomination never received a floor vote in the Senate.So I hope that we seize this opportunity to elevate Judge Koh to the Ninth Circuit, and do so once again with strong bipartisan basis.If confirmed, Judge Koh will become the first Korean American woman to serve on a federal circuit court.The historic nature of her nomination reflects our commitment to rebuild our federal judiciary to better reflect the America it serves.And it also is a representation of Judge Koh’s great talent, intellect, and skill, that the President has entrusted her with this milestone.Judge Koh, I look forward to hearing from you today, and I thank you for your willingness to continue serving our great Nation.And colleagues, I will be urging your support of her confirmation.###"

In taking advantage of this opportunity, we must reflect the will of our constituents and permanently ban new offshore oil and gas drilling along the West Coast. Doing so would help build a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.”Full text of the letter follows:October 6, 2021The Honorable Chuck SchumerMajority LeaderUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510The Honorable Joe ManchinChair, Energy and Natural Resources CommitteeUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Leader Schumer and Senator Manchin,            In light of the devastating oil spill this month off the coast of California, we urge you to include in the budget reconciliation bill our West Coast Ocean Protection Act, which would prohibit new oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington.            A similar prohibition on oil and gas leasing was included in Section 70804 of the House Natural Resources Committee’s title of the budget reconciliation bill and its implementation is estimated to cost $50 million. Given the impacts of oil drilling on communities along the Pacific Coast, this significant priority has a small price tag and is analogous to the way Republicans used their 2017 budget reconciliation bill to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.            The West Coast Ocean Protection Act has been introduced every Congress since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010. Our states have unfortunately suffered numerous oil spills in recent history. For example, in 1991, over 900,000 gallons of oil spilled in Washington State; in 1969, over 4 million gallons of crude oil spilled in Santa Barbara, California; and, just this month, 126,000 gallons of oil spilled in Huntington Beach, California. In 2018 and 2019, the amount of oil spilled per barrel produced on the Outer Continental Shelf increased sixfold compared with the previous two years.            Any community that has been impacted by an oil spill in the last several decades is familiar with the tragic deaths of thousands of marine wildlife as well as the closure of local beaches. As clean energy becomes a larger share of the West Coast power supply, the trade-offs associated with offshore oil drilling are only becoming increasingly unnecessary and destructive.            Budget reconciliation provides us with an opportunity to construct the energy policy of the future and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In taking advantage of this opportunity, we must reflect the will of our constituents and permanently ban new offshore oil and gas drilling along the West Coast. Doing so would help build a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.Sincerely,###"

The Senate must follow in his footsteps and work urgently to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the sacred right to vote for generations to come.“The Voting Rights Act, authorized and reauthorized five times by bipartisan votes of Congress, stood for decades as a guardian of our multiracial democracy. It helped guarantee communities of color their rightful voice in our democracy—until the Supreme Court’s conservative justices gravely undermined its enforcement.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-booker-duckworth-ossoff-and-schatz-lead-25-senators-in-promoting-access-to-solar-energy-for-low-and-moderate-income-households/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla, Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) led a group of 25 Senators urging Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to include a direct pay option for residential renewable energy property tax credits in Section 25D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (25D). In the letter, the Senators detailed how a direct pay option would help low- and moderate-income (LMI) households install solar energy systems and help meet President Biden’s goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030.Senators Padilla and Feinstein are both advocates for tax incentives for low- and moderate-income families whose efforts help mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. Earlier this year, they introduced legislation to ease tax burdens on homeowners making water-efficient choices. They also introduced legislation to provide buyers of pre-owned electric cars with tax rebates up to $2,500, which would assist low- and middle-income households with purchasing electric vehicles.“This essential tax credit is designed to help residential customers install renewable energy systems such as solar, wind and geothermal, but without a direct pay option, the low- and moderate-income (LMI) households who would benefit most from distributed generation are effectively blocked from accessing this tax credit,” wrote the Senators. “We believe that a direct pay option will not only help us meet President Biden’s goal of a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over 2005 levels by 2030, but it will also help address long-standing impacts of climate injustice.”“Renewable energy and environmental justice advocates estimate that roughly half of American households – approximately 60 million households – do not owe enough taxes to fully capitalize on the 25D tax credit in a single year under current law,” continued the Senators. “However, because these LMI households spend more of their income on energy bills, they will benefit disproportionately from installing distributed generation like solar on their properties. We have an obligation to ensure that all Americans have equal access to benefit from the renewable energy transition, and securing 25D direct pay is critical to this goal.”Taking into account the number of LMI households that own their homes, the current tax code prevents an estimated 26 million households from fully benefiting from the residential solar tax credit in the same year that the system was purchased and placed in service, including 3.2 million Black households and 3 million Hispanic households. Implementing a direct pay option would allow homeowners to fully and immediately realize their tax credits through a refund provided by the IRS, providing much needed capital to LMI households while directly addressing the worsening climate crisis.To ensure that the direct pay option is used effectively and fairly, the Senators proposed “the establishment of a simple installer-based verification process at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)” in which “homeowners would provide basic data and proof to the federal government of their solar or other renewable system installation, while the installer separately submits their own data that the IRS can use to corroborate the homeowner’s claim.”The Senators concluded the letter by calling for the direct pay option to be included in the upcoming reconciliation package to ensure that our nation is able to “advance our environmental and climate justice goals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more good-paying jobs in communities across the country – building upon an estimated 85,000 residential solar installation jobs in 2020.”The letter was cosigned by Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).The full text of the letter can be found here and below:October 1, 2021The Honorable Charles E. Schumer              Majority Leader                                 United States Senate               Washington, D.C. 20510The Honorable Ron WydenChairman, Committee on FinanceUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Leader Schumer and Chairman Wyden:As you continue the critical work of developing clean energy tax credits to help the United States meet the moment of the climate crisis in the upcoming reconciliation package, we urge you to include a direct pay option for the residential renewable energy property tax credit in Section 25D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (25D). This essential tax credit is designed to help residential customers install renewable energy systems such as solar, wind and geothermal, but without a direct pay option, the low- and moderate-income (LMI) households who would benefit most from distributed generation are effectively blocked from accessing this tax credit. We believe that a direct pay option will not only help us meet President Biden’s goal of a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over 2005 levels by 2030, but it will also help address long-standing impacts of climate injustice.Renewable energy and environmental justice advocates estimate that roughly half of American households – approximately 60 million households – do not owe enough taxes to fully capitalize on the 25D tax credit in a single year under current law. However, because these LMI households spend more of their income on energy bills, they will benefit disproportionately from installing distributed generation like solar on their properties. We have an obligation to ensure that all Americans have equal access to benefit from the renewable energy transition, and securing 25D direct pay is critical to this goal.Additionally, as the country faces worsening climate-fueled natural disasters that take down the grid, it is critical to expand residential distributed generation so that communities can more quickly recover power for essential needs. Most recently, in the wake of Hurricane Ida, homes powered by renewable energy and battery storage maintained power amid a prolonged power outage. Expanded residential renewables will also decrease the greenhouse gas emissions driving the escalation of wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. Low-income, communities of color, and Indigenous communities face disproportionate climate impacts and must have access to resilience technologies. Failure to ensure that lower-income households can fully access the benefits of the residential tax credit will perpetuate historical inequities that ultimately determine which communities are able to adapt to the climate crisis.To ensure that direct pay for 25D is utilized effectively and fairly, we urge the establishment of a simple installer-based verification process at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In such a system, homeowners would provide basic data and proof to the federal government of their solar or other renewable system installation, while the installer separately submits their own data that the IRS can use to corroborate the homeowner’s claim.Overall, we are confident that adding 25D direct pay will result in more LMI households transitioning to renewable energy in the coming years. In turn, this will lower energy bills for households that need it most, advance our environmental and climate justice goals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more good-paying jobs in communities across the country – building upon an estimated 85,000 residential solar installation jobs in 2020. We urge you to include a direct pay option in Senate Finance’s updated reconciliation language and we stand ready to partner with Committee staff to advance this proposal.Sincerely,###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-urges-action-following-major-oil-spill-in-orange-county/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, released the following statement on the Orange County oil spill.“We’ve seen time and time again how damaging offshore oil spills are to our coastal ecosystems as well as to our economy. This is yet another preventable environmental catastrophe that threatens to cause years of environmental harms to critical marine and wetland ecosystems and major economic hardships for local communities. My office is closely monitoring the containment and cleanup efforts, and I will do everything I can to ensure Orange County receives the assistance it needs.“We have the power to prevent future spills—that’s why I’m committed to ending offshore oil drilling. As Congress prepares sweeping new infrastructure and climate legislation to address our nation’s needs, the message is clear: we must act urgently to end our use of dangerous fossil fuels. I urge my colleagues to move quickly to pass the West Coast Ocean Protection Act and prevent yet another unnecessary environmental tragedy.”Senator Padilla is a cosponsor of the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, a bill that would ban oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-merkley-feinstein-push-to-keep-major-investments-in-affordable-housing-in-build-back-better-package/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — As California, Oregon, and many other states across the country confront an unprecedented housing affordability crisis, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) are leading a major push to ensure that comprehensive housing investments stay in President Biden’s Build Back Better plan.If included in the plan, these investments would have a transformational impact on addressing the housing crisis in California. The vouchers in the House package would result in the housing of 259,000 people in California alone, including 87,000 children. Additionally, the state would get almost $7 billion from the Housing Trust Fund investment to build low-income housing throughout California.This push follows Padilla’s recent efforts to strengthen the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to address the nation’s lack of affordable housing as part the Senate’s budget reconciliation package. It also follows Padilla co-leading the introduction of legislation last month to protect renters and homeowners by giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to mandate eviction moratoriums in the interest of public health.The three senators were joined in their push by more than two dozen Senate colleagues: U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Rev.

But with comprehensive investments, we can create, preserve, and improve millions of homes so that we bring down the cost of housing and improve its condition. And an investment in safe, affordable housing is central to the success of proposed investments in education, health, and our local economies. At the same time, investments in sustainable, energy-efficient housing can lower families’ bills, make our homes and communities more resilient to climate-driven disasters, and reduce our impact on the planet—all while creating good paying jobs.”The senators noted that housing is the most expensive item in most families’ budget, and that more than 10 million families spend more than half their income on housing each month. As the Build Back Better plan moves through Congress in the coming weeks, this moment represents a unique opportunity to reverse these trends and improve the day-to-day economic realities for millions of families across America.The full text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Mr. President, Speaker Pelosi, and Majority Leader Schumer:We write to express the urgent need to invest in housing within legislation to enact President Biden’s Build Back Better plan.Housing is the most expensive part of most families’ budget. Nearly a quarter of renters – 10.5 million families – spend more than half their income on housing each month, and too many families who want to own their own home are locked out of the market. Nearly 19 million people live in a food desert, and 35 million homes have at least one health or safety hazard, including more than 4 million homes with young children that have lead paint hazards. Others require renovation to help an elderly family member or a person with a disability to remain in their home. And still more families do not have adequate housing at all. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic began, more than 580,000 people, including children and seniors, had no safe place to stay on any given night, and more than 3.7 million evictions were filed during the course of a year.The Build Back Better plan is a rare opportunity to deliver critical investments that we have failed to make for far too long. Housing challenges are different in every community, and we need different tools to address the growing problems they face. But with comprehensive investments, we can create, preserve, and improve millions of homes so that we bring down the cost of housing and improve its condition. And an investment in safe, affordable housing is central to the success of proposed investments in education, health, and our local economies. At the same time, investments in sustainable, energy-efficient housing can lower families’ bills, make our homes and communities more resilient to climate-driven disasters, and reduce our impact on the planet – all while creating good paying jobs.Last month, the House Financial Services Committee advanced legislation to provide investments to expand affordable rental housing, help families access homeownership, remove lead paint and other health hazards from homes, repair public and assisted rural housing, address climate change, and invest in neighborhoods. Build Back Better legislation must include these kinds of comprehensive investments in rental housing, affordable homeownership, and community needs in urban, rural, and Tribal areas.To invest in American families, we must invest in the homes and the communities where those families live. As we work to create a Build Back Better package, we must make investments in housing opportunity a central pillar of the plan because, as Evicted author Matthew Desmond wrote last week, “the success of all other opportunity-expanding initiatives depends on it.”The COVID-19 crisis revealed the depth of our country’s affordable housing crisis at the same time that it revealed how important our homes are to our health, our well-being, and our lives. We must take this opportunity to build back better by addressing housing needs in communities across the nation.Sincerely,###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-joins-merkley-colleagues-to-press-biden-administration-to-raise-the-standard-of-care-for-migrant-children/,"Thousands of children have been held in unlicensed influx facilitiesWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, joined Senator Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in a push to urge the Biden administration to make a decisive pivot away from the policies of the Trump administration and raise the standard of care for unaccompanied children in U.S. custody. Padilla and Merkley were joined in their efforts by U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).When unaccompanied, noncitizen children arrive in the U.S. to seek asylum, they are typically placed in licensed shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) before being united with a sponsor, such as a U.S.-based family member, while they go through the asylum process. In recent years, ORR has often run out of room in their system of licensed shelters, and during those periods, has opened and housed children in unlicensed “influx” facilities or Emergency Intake Sites. The use of these facilities has frequently violated the terms of the Flores settlement, a legal agreement that was put in place to protect the wellbeing of migrant children and limit the amount of time they spend in unlicensed settings, like Border Patrol holding facilities and these emergency influx shelters.The Biden administration has requested an additional $2.5 billion in emergency funding for ORR this year, and the senators urged the Biden administration to ensure that the funding is tied to a long-term plan to raise the standards of care for children and end the use of unlicensed facilities.“ORR’s reliance on unlicensed influx facilities or Emergency Intake Sites (EISs) over the last several months reflects a long-term failure to invest in high quality care for non-citizen children,” wrote the senators in a letter to ORR Director Cindy Huang. “While much of this reliance arose as a result of the former administration’s intentional decimation of the asylum process, we urge you to shape a different legacy for the Biden administration that is grounded in child welfare and exceeds the minimum standards set forth in the Flores Settlement Agreement. We can and we must do more to meaningfully improve conditions and treatment of children in federal care over the coming year, inclusive of ORR’s primary mission to move children to their families as quickly as possible and to provides services to do that well. To that end, we ask that you commit to several child welfare principles outlined below.”“We appreciate the steps that ORR has taken to place children in familial environments more rapidly over the past year—this is a critical improvement in caring for the wellbeing of children,” they continued. “However, ORR must commit to a credible plan to shut down all EISs as quickly as possible, and to not reopening similar unlicensed facilities even in response to high numbers of new unaccompanied child referrals by building a network of care providers that is resilient to large and small fluctuations in arrivals, improving case management in both quality of care and time-to-release, and by creating actionable contingency plans that ensure quality of care for children even during large numbers of arrivals.”Specifically, the senators asked ORR to commit to upholding the following principles:The full text of the letter is available here and below:Cindy HuangDirectorOffice of Refugee ResettlementAdministration for Children & FamiliesU.S. Department of Health & Human Services330 C Street SWWashington, D.C. 20201Dear Director Huang: In light of President Biden’s Continuing Resolution anomaly request that includes $2.5 billion for the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s care of unaccompanied children, we write to urge the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to exercise the highest degree of care in order to ensure this funding be used to prioritize the wellbeing of unaccompanied children. Of funds that are appropriated in a Continuing Resolution to carry out your work as it relates to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization act of 2008, the Immigration and Nationality Act, or the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, we expect that all spending must reflect the basic principle that children in the federal government’s care require programs designed around evidence-based wellbeing principles, enforced with robust oversight and public transparency.ORR’s reliance on unlicensed influx facilities or Emergency Intake Sites (EISs) over the last several months reflects a long-term failure to invest in high quality care for non-citizen children. While much of this reliance arose as a result of the former administration’s intentional decimation of the asylum process, we urge you to shape a different legacy for the Biden administration that is grounded in child welfare and exceeds the minimum standards set forth in the Flores Settlement Agreement. We can and we must do more to meaningfully improve conditions and treatment of children in federal care over the coming year, inclusive of ORR’s primary mission to move children to their families as quickly as possible and to provides services to do that well. To that end, we ask that you commit to several child welfare principles outlined below.ORR must continue to actively seek compliance with the Flores Settlement Agreement requirement for children to be placed in licensed facilities “as expeditiously as possible” and released from all forms of custody “without unreasonable delay” or within 20 days, as interpreted by judicial order in the context of family detention. In recognition of the fact that so many children have stayed in EISs for longer than 40 days—at least 600, as of May—with some staying for as long as 80 days or more, an interim requirement to limit EIS stays to an absolute maximum length of 30 days is an appropriate step towards the goal of bringing ORR back into complete compliance with the Flores standard.We appreciate the steps that ORR has taken to place children in familial environments more rapidly over the past year – this is a critical improvement in caring for the wellbeing of children. However, ORR must commit to a credible plan to shut down all EISs as quickly as possible, and to not reopening similar unlicensed facilities even in response to high numbers of new unaccompanied child referrals by building a network of care providers that is resilient to large and small fluctuations in arrivals, improving case management in both quality of care and time-to-release, and by creating actionable contingency plans that ensure quality of care for children even during large numbers of arrivals.In addition to supporting programs that treat children and families with the dignity they deserve, we ask that you commit to the following principles:Thank you for your consideration of this request and for your continued attention to these important child welfare priorities.Sincerely,###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-joins-menendez-cornyn-colleagues-in-introducing-bicameral-senate-resolution-commemorating-hispanic-heritage-month/,"Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated from September 15th through October 15thWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and 46 of their Senate colleagues in introducing a Senate resolution that recognizes September 15th through October 15th, 2021 as a month to celebrate and honor the invaluable contributions of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States. The commemoration of Hispanic Heritage Month started in 1968 as ‘Hispanic Heritage Week’ under President Lyndon B. Johnson. President Ronald Reagan subsequently expanded the celebration in 1988 to cover a 30-day period starting on September 15th and ending on October 15th.Senator Padilla is the first Latino to represent California in the United States Senate. Earlier this year, Senators Padilla and Menendez launched the first-ever Hispanic-Serving Institutions Senate Caucus, which they will co-chair. Padilla marked the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month by delivering a speech on the floor of U.S. Senate to celebrate the important work of Willie Velasquez, a Latino voting rights leader who fought tirelessly to improve access to the ballot in Latino communities.“As the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate, it is a privilege to formally recognize Hispanic Heritage Month and the significant contributions of Latinos and Hispanic Americans,” said Senator Padilla.“The success of Latino families, immigrants, and working-class individuals in the face of adversity has enriched the diversity and success of this country. And I remain committed to taking action to build a better future for Latino communities in California and across the country.”“Hispanics have always been an important part of the fabric of American society, full of only love for this country and responsible for countless contributions,” said Senator Menendez. “As the Hispanic American community continues to grow, we will only become an even more integral part of this country and will help expand economic opportunities for all. I commend my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for supporting this resolution and I hope they will work with me and others to implement policies that will provide Hispanic Americans with greater opportunity.”“Any Texan will tell you that Hispanic culture is as much a part of our state’s foundation as the ground our cities are built on,” said Senator Cornyn. “This bipartisan resolution will honor the more than 11 million Hispanic Americans that call Texas home, and I’m proud to help usher it through Congress.”“For over a year, Hispanic Americans have served on the frontlines of this pandemic, educating our children, serving as medical workers, and making sure that our communities have everything they need to survive,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The resilience and determination of the Hispanic community has played an integral role in our nation’s path to recovery, and this year more than ever it is vital that we recognize their countless contributions to the United States. In my home state of Nevada, more than one in four Nevadans is Latino, and I’m proud to continue honoring their invaluable place in our state and nation.”“With a rich culture and long-held traditions that have become part of the fabric of our nation, the Hispanic community has played a vital role in American society and continues to produce leaders in every facet – from serving in our military, to teaching in the classroom, to running small businesses, to leading in the arts, science, and medicine, and taking care of our entire country as essential workers. This year and every year, we need to honor the resilience and the creativity of our community. This resolution is an important part of that celebration,” said Senator Luján.Congressman Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.-29) led 36 of his colleagues in introducing a companion resolution in the House of Representatives.“Latino history is American history, inseparable from the birth of our nation to the present, and into its bright future,” said Representative Cardenas. “Our community’s involvement and influence on America’s cultural, economic and political tapestry is something that deserves both recognition and celebration. It is with great pride that we lead a resolution that honors the inspiring contributions of our diverse communities to this country.”The Senate resolution recognizes the immense contributions of Latinos and Latinas to the economy, culture, and identity of the United States. This point has never been more salient than during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Latinos and Latinas across the country kept our country afloat by working essential, front-line jobs and will play an even more critical role as the nation recovers from the ongoing impacts of this unprecedented health crisis.Hispanic Americans are the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the U.S., representing more than 62 million people (18.7% of the U.S. population), plus another 3.2 million in Puerto Rico. Fifteen States – Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington – have nearly one million or more Latino and Latina residents.In addition to Senators Padilla, Menendez, and Cornyn, the Senate resolution was co-sponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).In addition to Representative Cárdenas, the companion House resolution was co-sponsored by Representatives Albio Sires (D-N.J.-08), Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.-18), Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Ga.-07), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.-12), Dina Titus (D-Nev.-01), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.-32), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.-05), J.

https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-statement-on-administration-actions-to-address-supply-chain-congestion/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) released the following statement after the Biden Administration announced new actions to address supply chain congestion, including that the Port of Los Angeles will be joining the Port of Long Beach to launch 24/7 operations to help ease bottlenecks:“Today’s announcement is welcome news as two of the most critical ports in the country face a record surge in cargo shipments. As the holidays approach, we must continue to look for innovative ways to increase the movement of goods across the country. While this effort will help ease the flow of goods into the country, I look forward to working closely with the administration to address the remaining challenges in transporting goods from the ports to homes and businesses.”Senator Padilla voted to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in August, which would provide approximately $17 billion for port and waterway infrastructure, including funding to support zero-emission technology and electrification to mitigate air quality and environmental impacts on nearby communities. Senator Padilla also voted to pass the United States Innovation and Competition Act in June, which would allocate tens of billions of dollars and bolster the federal government’s efforts to mitigate and address supply chain vulnerabilities.The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach handle about 40% of the container traffic that enters the United States. This expansion to 24/7 operations means the Port of Los Angeles can nearly double the hours that cargo will be able to move out of its docks and onto trucks and trains.The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) has announced its members are willing to work those extra shifts. This will add needed capacity to put towards clearing existing backlogs.###"
https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-espaillat-castro-introduce-landmark-bill-to-remove-barriers-to-citizenship/,"Legislation Would Bring Federal Immigration Law In Line With Nationwide Immigration Reform EffortsWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Representatives Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) announced the introduction of the Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act, which would remove certain barriers to naturalization and citizenship, and prevent the unfair removal of immigrants based on a previously dismissed or pardoned conviction.The bill would ensure that past criminal convictions that have been expunged, vacated, or pardoned by the sentencing court, would not block immigrants from a path to naturalization or weigh against an immigrant in removal proceedings. In the Senate, the Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act is co-sponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-N.Y.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).“For far too long, our immigration laws have put the American Dream further out of reach by making it nearly impossible for immigrants, especially those with resolved convictions, to become citizens. We can no longer turn a blind eye to them,” said Senator Padilla. “We must ensure that our immigration system is fair and that a previously dismissed or pardoned conviction neither prevents an immigrant from being able to naturalize nor factors into any removal decisions.”“Our immigration system is broken. And for far too long, our nation’s immigrants have been unjustly denied a legal pathway to citizenship and still face deportation due to criminal convictions that have been pardoned, adjudicated, or suspended. This is unfair, unjust, and unacceptable,” said Congressman Espaillat. “No one deserves to be ostracized for their troubled past or a conviction that’s been thrown out – and no one should be denied their chance at the American Dream because of it either. It’s my hope that by passing this bill, we can begin to rebuild this country’s immigration system from the ground up, making it more equitable and accessible for all who call this nation home.”“Immigrants should not be barred from naturalization and risk deportation because of a past criminal conviction that is no longer valid in court,” said Congressman Castro. “Unfortunately, our nation’s immigration system is deeply broken and often makes it more difficult rather than helpful for immigrants to obtain a legal pathway to citizenship – Congress must pass reforms. This bill takes critical steps to prevent unjust deportations and help aspiring new Americans pursue their dreams.”“The United States immigration system imposes the harsh penalty of detention and deportation as a second punishment for people emerging from the criminal legal system, destabilizing families and communities. This injustice is even more pronounced when the underlying conviction has been vacated or pardoned or otherwise erased in the criminal legal system yet remains valid for immigration purposes. We applaud the introduction of the Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act, which would ensure no one is deported from their loved ones because of a conviction or sentence no longer recognized by the criminal court,” said Heidi Altman, Director of Policy at National Immigrant Justice Center.“The INA’s broad and distorted definition of ‘conviction’ has resulted in unjust and deeply harmful immigration repercussions for countless people, further fueling this country’s cruel detention and deportation machines,” said Sirine Shebaya, Executive Director of the National Immigration Project. “The National Immigration Project is proud to endorse the Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act because it is a critical step in ensuring immigrants are able to benefit from criminal justice reform, have a second chance at rebuilding their lives after contact with the criminal legal system, and ultimately receive fair and humane treatment in the United States.”Specifically, the bill amends the definition of “conviction” in the Immigration and Nationality Act to “a formal judgment of guilt of the noncitizen entered by a court,” and excepts the following circumstances from being considered a conviction:This bill would apply retroactively to any conviction, adjudication, or judgement entered before, on, or after the enactment of this bill. The bill also establishes that the grounds of inadmissibility and deportability do not apply to an immigrant with a criminal conviction if, after having provided notice and an opportunity to respond to the prosecuting authorities, the sentencing court issues a recommendation to the Secretary of Homeland Security that the immigrant not be removed on the basis of the conviction.Read the bill in its entirety here.The Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act has been endorsed by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, National Immigrant Justice Center, National Immigration Law Center, International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Center for Constitutional Rights, America’s Voice, Immigration Hub, United We Dream Network, Public Counsel, Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC), Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Immigrant Defense Project, Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, Legal Aid Justice Center, Make the Road New York, The Bronx Defenders, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Tahirih Justice Center, Freedom Network USA, Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence, National Partnership for New Americans, #DetentionKills, AIDS Alabama, Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, La Resistencia, United Stateless, Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Jobs With Justice, Lights for Liberty, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Immigrant and Non-Citizen Rights Clinic, CUNY School of Law, StoptheDrugWar.org, Wayne State Asylum & Immigration Law Clinic, Hispanic Federation, Migrant Center for Human Rights, Quixote Center, Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC Law), NC Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault, Alianza Americas, Drug Policy Alliance, National Network for Immigrant & Refugee Rights, Unidad Latina en Accion CT, Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Mennonite Central Committee U.S., New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC), The Advocates for Human Rights, Washington Defender Association, Immigrant Justice, Ministry Team of Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist Church, Government Information Watch, Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, Bethesda Presbyterian Church, Families for Freedom, Idaho Coalition Against Sexual & Domestic Violence, Presente.org, UNITED SIKHS, PG Change Makers, Louisiana Advocates For Immigrants in Detention, Battered Women’s Justice Project, Center for Disability Rights, Takoma Park Mobilization – Equal Justice, Jewish Activists for Immigration Justice of Western MA, Muslim Voices Coalition, Comunidad Latina De Hawaii, Hawai’i Coalition for Immigrant Rights, New Jersey Coalition to End Domestic Violence, RISE, Doctors for Camp Closure, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Arab American Association of New York, Connecticut Shoreline Indivisible, Wind of the Spirit Immigrant Resource Center, Committee on National Legislation, Women Watch Afrika, Jetpac Resource Center, African Communities Together, Just Neighbors, The Public Defenders Coalition for Immigrant Justice, Center for Victims of Torture, Disciples Refugee & Immigration Ministries, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, Bridges Faith Initiative, Mainers for Accountable Leadership, Advocating Opportunity, Standpoint, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), Adelante Alabama Worker Center, Interfaith Community for Detained Immigrants, Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Family Services, Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Immigrant Justice Network, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, Church World Service, Just Futures Law, Americans for Immigrant Justice, Immigrant Legal Defense, UnLocal, ISLA: Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy.###"
