However, there is more work ahead this Congress to deliver the kinds of reforms families need to see from FDA, from industry, and from our mental health and pandemic preparedness efforts.“As part of our agreement, we and our House counterparts are committed to continuing that work, and including strong, bipartisan legislation in a robust end of year package.” Section-by-section of the language included in the continuing resolution is available here."

Now the CBO has confirmed what we’ve known for months. The President’s student loan debt scheme will cost taxpayers a staggering $400 billion – a cost that will be borne by working Americans who chose not to go to college or who responsibly paid off their loans. Every American should be outraged by the President’s cynical ploy and by the real cost it places on those who stand to benefit the least.”"

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/9/burr-senators-oppose-biden-admin-s-title-ix-changes-call-for-enforcement-of-existing-regulations,"Yesterday, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) submitted their official comment to U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona in response to proposed changes to Title IX, asking instead for the enforcement of existing Title IX regulations. Joining the letter were Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), John Hoeven (R-ND), James Inhofe (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Roger Wicker (R-MS).In their letter, the Senators detail how the proposed changes to the current Title IX rule will harm students, underscoring its flawed frameworks, weakened due process protection, and infringement on free speech.“Title IX should be celebrated for its legacy of improving outcomes for women and girls in every facet of education,” the Senators write. “The existing regulations are founded on long-standing legal principles and have withstood multiple legal challenges.”“The Department’s attempt at rolling back protections for students is not only ill-founded but also arbitrary. The regulations that the Department aims to repeal were the culmination of a nearly three-year, thorough and deliberate process.”The Senators concluded, “The Department cannot continue to play ping-pong with student’s rights; students deserve a fair process they can rely on. Therefore, we ask that you rescind these proposed regulations and instead enforce the existing regulations in order to ensure Title IX is fairly and adequately enforced.” To read the full letter, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/9/burr-administration-has-failed-americans-on-monkeypox-response,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing titled, “Stopping the Spread of Monkeypox: Examining the Federal Response.” This is the Committee’s first hearing to examine the federal government’s response to the monkeypox outbreak.In his opening statement, Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) criticized the Administration’s poor planning, inadequate vaccine rollout, and testing failures, which resulted in the outbreak of a preventable disease already identified by public health officials as a potential threat.Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement:“Good morning. I’m glad that we are finally having a hearing on the monkeypox outbreak that is hitting our nation. While monkeypox is now a public health emergency, it did not have to become one. “Since May, when the first transmission was reported in the UK and Europe, I have been pressing the Administration for a strategy and a plan.“After almost three years of the COVID pandemic, you would think that the public health agencies responsible for our preparedness and response would be prepared for anything — particularly a threat like monkeypox which we have known about for decades and for which we have vaccines and treatments. “It is almost the definitional case of what the CDC, ASPR, and their sister agencies should be prepared to tackle.“A virus that spreads through physical contact. A virus that spreads when an infected person has an obvious sign of infection. This is not like COVID which was a newly emerged virus that spread through asymptomatic infection. “But by any measure, in fact by every measure, the response from the Biden Administration on the monkeypox crisis has been one of catastrophic failure.“You repeated each of the mistakes of the early days of the COVID response, and the cultural arrogance from the public health officials who are supposed to be at the forefront of our response let our country down, again.  “Since the COVID pandemic started, this Committee has held 13 hearings on the response – during both the Trump and Biden Administrations.“I’d think you were just as sick of being called to the carpet as we are of having to hold you accountable because of your systemic failures.“But it seems that nothing has changed. You can’t blame the last Administration for these failures; they are all yours.“The first confirmed case of monkeypox in 2022 was May 7th in the United Kingdom. “The first US case of monkeypox in this outbreak was reported on May 18th. We had warning that this was coming, and we should have been prepared to manage what came when it arrived. “Let’s review.“You failed on testing.“Although you eventually made testing available through the Laboratory Response Network, these tests were too hard to access. It took weeks before doctors were able to get their patients tested without having to first consult public health officials.“There was also a significant delay in engaging the private sector on testing at the beginning of the outbreak — you waited until June 22nd to announce any engagement with the private sector. Still, after that, companies interested in developing additional diagnostics that could help address some of the slow turnaround times and improve access have been left waiting months for samples needed to develop tests, with delay upon delay.  “You failed on vaccines.“An “enhanced” strategy to offer vaccines to at-risk individuals and known contacts was announced June 28th, but this was already after some local jurisdictions had taken it upon themselves to use the vaccine in this manner and a full month after the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation met to discuss a similar strategy for its citizens.“Why do we continue to be behind?“Meanwhile, decisions about vaccine administration in the US have been made seemingly on the fly. Even when FDA issued an emergency use authorization last month allowing the vaccine to be administered by intradermal injection, there were no meetings of FDA or CDC’s outside experts to publicly discuss relevant questions on the minds of impacted Americans and inform these decisions.“Health professionals were confused about the initial decision, and patients were scared that they were being experimented on.“To make matters worse, states had no time to prepare for this change in vaccine administration. Right after FDA made its decision, ASPR reduced states’ vaccine allocations under the assumption that every vial would yield five doses. Yet, we know that this has not been the case in every state, resulting in some states vaccinating fewer at-risk people. “You failed on having a plan.“Monkeypox outbreaks have been occurring in Nigeria and other places with increasing frequency. It was an identified threat, and a threat for which we had countermeasures stockpiled. “But it seems there was no real plan on how to respond and what information and research we needed to understand this outbreak. Only after both I and the Chair sent separate letters asking for a plan did the Office of Science and Technology Policy blog about their research priorities. But the priorities were vague, and it’s not clear what research activities HHS has actually undertaken in response.“These failures have allowed this disease to spread. 31 cases in May quickly turned into 650 cases in June, more than 6,000 cases in July, more than 12,000 cases in August, and near 22,000 so far in September. “It should have been obvious to all of you that the timing of early cases, coupled with evidence that the cases were not linked, would create a perfect storm for a large outbreak. “Monkeypox is a virus that largely transmits through skin-to-skin contact, most easily and frequently transmitted between sexual partners.“Monkeypox arrived just before pride celebrations across the country and after two years of lockdowns and social distancing. Your agencies should have been screaming from the rooftops about what you knew or suspected about how monkeypox spread. Instead, you remained silent. And people got sick because of your silence.“This isn’t rocket science.“But consenting adults need to be told what behavior changes they should consider to avoid getting a preventable disease like monkeypox.“You failed at a time when the communities most at risk needed you. “Disease control and prevention and preparedness and response is literally in the name of two of your agencies, yet you did none of that.“It was no surprise to me that the Administration, after months of floundering, appointed a new czar at the White House to coordinate the response. It shows why this committee passed the PREVENT Pandemics Act to create a mission control. The Secretary of HHS has been totally absent, and, when he has been involved, it only seems to make matters worse.“But new, ad hoc groups within government are exactly the problem. We need a consistent and coherent government-wide response to be effective, and that can only be led at the White House. I hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to get that legislation over the finish line and I’ll commit to spending my remaining weeks in the Senate doing everything I can to help the White House set that new office up with a lasting mission and clear agenda. “If I were not retiring, I would spend the next several years conducting a thorough examination of each of your agencies, highlighting each and every one of the systemic and bureaucratic failures that we have now seen in response after response and demand accountability for the American people.“It isn’t a question of authority; you have the authority. It isn’t a question of money; you have been given astonishing amounts of money.“It’s a question of leadership. It’s a question of focus. It’s a question of squashing the typical bureaucratic roadblocks, arrogance, and ineptitude.“You need to do better.“We learned in Operation Warp Speed that when you press outside the box, when you focus on public private partnerships, when you get bureaucracy tamed so that it serves the American people and doesn’t try to control them, we can actually make government work.“I’d ask you for your plan, but you don’t have one. I’d ask you what you’d change, but your agencies seem to think they are doing everything right. I’d ask who you are going to hold accountable, but failures at each of your agencies show that you don’t believe in that type of accountability.“So instead, I’ll just express my outrage and hope that eventually we’ll get people in your agencies who will do their job to protect the American people instead of protecting their bureaucracies.“Before I close, I want to address a serious issue. The last time we were here there was a coordinated assault, pretending that somehow Republicans were at fault for there not being a deal on additional pandemic money. “But let’s revisit some facts for a moment. “The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, actually passed extra funding for COVID, 15.6 billion dollars in the March omnibus for testing, treatments, vaccines, and global aid, but the Speaker of the House either couldn’t pass that legislation or didn’t think pandemic money was a priority, so she stripped it. I’ve worked with her for a long time and I’m pretty sure she’s a Democrat.“Then Senators Romney, Blunt, and myself engaged in deep negotiations with the Majority Leader and the Chair of this committee, and we reached a second deal for $10 billion in domestic funding for COVID, but the Majority Leader didn’t want to take a vote against lifting COVID restrictions on the southern border, probably because he knew it would pass, so the deal was killed. I’m pretty sure he’s a Democrat.“So then at our last hearing, the Chair, and each of you, got together and pretended that somehow Republicans were at fault. “Republicans tried twice to provide additional funding for COVID, but Democrats couldn’t take yes for an answer.“Then last month, Democrats conducted a partisan spending exercise where Republicans weren’t even in the room. They dramatically raised taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars, provided funding for 87,000 IRS bureaucrats to audit the middle class, and spent hundreds of billions on the green new deal that will mostly benefit billionaires and millionaires. “Those same Democrats who complain about no new COVID spending didn’t spend one dime of those new taxes on pandemic response.“I often hear my colleagues say that your budget shows your priorities, but Democrats had the power to spend money on the pandemic and chose not to. I guess making energy more expensive was more important. “I’ve had in my jacket a pocket card with four simple requests for this Administration, and told them that was all I needed to help me get my Republican colleagues to secure more pandemic funding. I’ve shared it time and time again, here, with my colleagues, and with the press.1.      A detailed plan2.      A detailed accounting of where previous money has been spent3.      Offsets to match any new spending on the pandemic, and4.      A simple vote on ending COVID restrictions at the border“To date the Administration has failed to deliver. Maybe they don’t want actual transparency on what they have spent or maybe they don’t want to come clean to the American people what their plans are until after the election. “But to plan ahead and blame Republicans when we’ve come to the table twice already is disappointing and I hope it doesn’t happen here again today.“This would be a good place to quote Matthew Chapter 7, verse 5 to you, but I’ll just simply say that if anyone isn’t serious about funding pandemics it seems to be this administration and their Democratic allies in Congress.  “I yield back.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/9/burr-wicker-call-on-senate-to-immediately-pass-resolution-preventing-disastrous-rail-worker-strike,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, took to the Senate floor to call on Congress to immediately pass their resolution to prevent a disastrous rail worker strike in a matter of days. CLICK HERE TO WATCH SENS. BURR AND WICKER CALL FOR SENATE ACTION TO PREVENT DISASTROUS RAIL WORKER STRIKE The resolution would adopt the comprehensive recommendations made by President Biden’s appointees to the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), if no voluntary agreement can be reached prior to 12:01 AM ET Friday, September 16, when a mandated cooling off period ends. The PEB recommendations include significant wage rate increases for workers retroactive to 2020. Without an agreement, America faces a potential rail worker strike as early as September 16th, which would cost an estimated $2 billion a day. Rail carriers have already begun to curtail shipments of certain materials and passenger routes in preparation for a potential strike.“If we do not force this issue, at 12:01 tomorrow night, railroads will shut down, and the economic impact on people is $2 billion a day,” said Senator Burr. “Not only is $2 billion a day in economic impact, this is 160,000 trainloads of agricultural product at a time of harvest across this country. There’s some that say, well, this is going to affect me. They haul coal. They haul gas. They haul petroleum. They haul gases like helium that are required for manufacturing businesses. They haul autoparts, which means you’re going to see auto assembly plants shut down – not because of China, but because we let the railroad workers go on strike and not support the president’s position.”Senator Burr continued, “This is not political. This is Republicans supporting the president’s position and only asking 12 Democrats to support this action. I ask my colleagues, drop this concern that you’re representing one side or the other. Ask yourself what’s best for America.”“Inflation is at 8.3 percent or higher. Our GDP is shrinking and supply chains have not recovered from the pandemic. The last thing we need is a shutdown of this nation’s rail service, both passenger and freight, and yet that is what we are facing in less than a day-and-a-half from this moment: a massive rail strike that will virtually shut down our economy,” said Senator Wicker. “Congress can pass the recommendation of the PEB in full… and we can avoid this strike. And that’s what we ought to be doing.”Sens. Burr and Wicker called for the Senate to pass the resolution by unanimous consent; the move was blocked by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who offered no solution to prevent massive disruptions and higher costs for middle-class Americans if an agreement is not reached in the next day-and-a-half. You can read more about the resolution here.You can read complete text of the resolution here.Background:Since 2019, the railroad industry and rail unions have been engaged in negotiations for a new contract, failing to produce an agreement. In July 2022, following the process established by the Railway Labor Act, President Biden appointed a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) to investigate the dispute and make recommendations.In August 2022, the PEB released its recommendations, which were endorsed by the White House. The recommendations proposed a 24 percent wage increase, plus $1,000 annual bonuses, to be applied retroactively dating to 2020, as well as increased health care and other benefits.If the parties have not reached a tentative agreement by September 16th, the rail unions could engage in strike activity, which would cost an estimated $2 billion a day.Senator Burr’s and Senator Wicker’s resolution further provides clarity and continuity to ensure the continued delivery of necessary goods to the American people."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/9/burr-wicker-introduce-resolution-calling-for-adoption-of-biden-administration-rail-recommendations-if-voluntary-agreements-are-not-reached,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, introduced a resolution that would prevent a disastrous rail worker strike if contract negotiations are not soon resolved.The Senate resolution would adopt the comprehensive recommendations made by President Biden’s appointees to the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), which include significant wage rate increases for workers retroactive to 2020. Despite a broad consensus on the PEB’s recommendations, two labor unions continue to stymie contract negotiations. Without an agreement, America faces a potential rail worker strike as early as September 16th, which would cost an estimated $2 billion a day.“A rail worker strike would be catastrophic for America’s transportation system and our already-stressed supply chain,” said Senator Burr. “The Presidential Emergency Board recommendations are a fair and appropriate solution to a years-long negotiation process, but labor unions are continuing to hold the entire nation’s rail system hostage as they demand more. The Biden Administration should reject labor unions’ bullying tactics. This resolution would provide certainty for Americans who have a right to travel and work freely across state lines.”“A rail strike would be counterproductive for everyone involved and would have devastating impacts on our entire economy,” Senator Wicker said. “While there is still time for the remaining parties to reach voluntary agreements to end this dispute, it is time to bring this matter to a close. This resolution would implement the recommendations as issued by the Presidential Emergency Board. They are balanced, comprehensive, and would ensure rail service is not disrupted further.”You can read text of the resolution here.Background:Since 2019, the railroad industry and rail unions have been engaged in negotiations for a new contract, failing to produce an agreement.

Throughout the decades, she was a stalwart leader for her country and a steady global presence.

Not only did Democrats’ and teachers unions’ policies that kept schools closed stunt student achievement, their policies barring children from their classrooms and from in-person instruction actually sent student achievement into a massive tailspin. American 9-year-olds showed the largest drop in reading in over two decades and math scores dropped for the first time since the 1970s. The results were even worse for academically vulnerable children, widening the gap between the academic haves and have nots.“Blame for this academic disaster rests squarely on the shoulders of Democrat politicians who put the arrogance of teacher union bosses ahead of the needs of the nation’s most important asset and future – our children. Parents are right to be angry about these results and should demand change, choice, and freedom to control their child’s education.”"

He’s asking taxpayers to subsidize debt held by some of America’s highest earners in order to court votes. Every American who paid back their student loans, who put themselves through school by saving and working extra jobs, or who chose not to go to college at all should be outraged right now.“This move will not solve sky high college tuitions. This will pour fuel on the fire, increasing college prices and accelerating inflation. It will encourage more schools to increase costs and encourage more students to take out loans they cannot pay back in the hopes they’ll never have to do so. The President knows he does not have the legal authority to unilaterally cancel student loan debt, but is ignoring the law and bipartisan opposition in Congress. I urge the Senate to pass the Student Loan Accountability Act, which would make Congress’ intent clear and prevent future sweeping, unilateral loan cancelation from this Administration.”On May 18, 2022, Senator Burr, along with Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Tim Scott (R-SC), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), and Thom Tillis (R-NC), introduced the Student Loan Accountability Act, legislation to prohibit the Biden Administration from cancelling student loan debt.Senator Burr has blasted the Biden Administration for repeatedly extending the student loan repayment freeze, which was intended as an emergency relief measure at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The repeated extensions have cost taxpayers $4.5 billion per month and added $103.5 billion to our national debt to date, according to the Congressional Budget Office."

A communicable disease outbreak following so closely on the heels of COVID-19 should be met with a swift, decisive, and organized response. Instead, HHS is repeating the exact same mistakes they made during the pandemic: painfully slow to begin testing, wholly disorganized in distributing vaccines and treatments, and messaging that’s confusing and outdated. HHS appears to have learned nothing from the tragedy of the last three years.   “I have asked HHS repeatedly for their strategic plan to combat monkeypox and have yet to receive an answer. On July 13, I sent a letter to Secretary Becerra asking detailed questions about the outbreak and the Biden Administration’s response. In the three weeks since that letter was sent, monkeypox cases have increased by more than 470 percent to 6,617 reported cases today. Still, the Administration continues to stonewall Congress.“Recognizing the threat, states are being forced to act where HHS, in particular the Centers for Disease Control, will not. My home state of North Carolina is utilizing technology like wastewater surveillance to track potential spread – something the CDC should be doing as an active collaborator working with states in real time. But the agency appears to have made no meaningful attempt to proactively use the biosurveillance tools available to them for emerging threats beyond COVID-19.“HHS’ failure to learn from its mistakes is wholly unacceptable. The American people deserve better. HHS must provide Congress and the public with a plan to mitigate these failures and combat monkeypox spread before more Americans are needlessly harmed.”To read the letter sent to Secretary Becerra today, click here.To read Senator Burr’s July 13th letter to Secretary Becerra, click here."

While not all of these studies are obvious wastes of taxpayer dollars, many still raise major concerns about the importance of your agency’s mission,” the Senators write.“These concerns are compounded when NSF funds research projects with a particular political bent,” the Senators continue. “While NSF enjoys independent status in order to protect the agency’s scientific mission, grants such as these call into question the NSF’s impartiality and whether the agency considers it is appropriate to fund projects leveraged for political advocacy.”The Senators conclude, “We live in a time where most Americans are trying to make ends meet to put food on the table and gas in the cars, meanwhile our government agencies seem to be spending money frivolously on a wish list of special interest research projects.

Just last week, two men in Washington State were charged with smuggling 91,000 fentanyl pills inside potato chip containers in connection with a transnational criminal organization.  Or the Drug Enforcement Administration, which just earlier this month, announced the seizure of 100,000 fake oxycodone pills containing fentanyl and could provide us with a clear picture of the criminal networks that are mass-producing illicit fentanyl and fake pills in clandestine laboratories.  But Chair Murray did not want to invite those agencies to this hearing, despite requests, so that we might gain a better understanding of the complexity behind the illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues problem in the United States and their sources.   “Every day, illicit drugs are entering the country from China, Mexico, and India. The recent news from Washington State is just one example of this problem. And it’s driving overdose deaths.  According to DEA, the agency’s lab testing demonstrated that 4 out of every 10 pills with fentanyl contain a potentially lethal dose. Permanently scheduling fentanyl analogues, which drug traffickers use to skirt trafficking laws, as Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act would play a significant role in reducing the supply of illicit fentanyl smuggled into the United States. I urge my colleagues to consider the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that Senator Cassidy and I worked on together that would permanently schedule fentanyl analogues as Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. “We also need to continue to support and improve public health programs charged with responding to the substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery needs of communities that were hit hard by the opioid crisis and now are grappling with high overdose rates driven by illicit fentanyl. With the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, Congress has demonstrated its commitment to supporting substance use disorder needs. We need to make sure our programs are effectively utilizing data, leveraging innovative medical products for treatment and overdose reversal, and partnering with different sectors to promote effective solutions on the ground.  I am thankful for Senator Bill Cassidy’s expertise and willingness to serve as Ranking Member for the Senate HELP Committee hearing today, and look forward to continuing to work on this issue.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/7/burr-leads-call-for-ig-audit-of-biden-s-10-billion-covid-19-vaccine-public-education-campaign,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), led a group of Republican colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Christin Grimm requesting an audit of the Biden Administration’s $10 billion COVID-19 vaccine public education campaign, which was launched in March 2021 to increase vaccine awareness and confidence.Senator Burr was joined by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), Tim Scott (R-SC), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Representatives Cathy McMorris Rogers (WA-05), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Morgan Griffith (VA-09), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Health.In their letter, the Members call for greater accountability from the Biden Administration, following its continued attempt to disregard Congressional oversight requests on how COVID-19 emergency funding has been spent.“Since the beginning of the pandemic, Congress has passed five bipartisan COVID-19 relief bills totaling $3.496 trillion,” write the Members. “Recently, it has been reported that the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats are pursuing yet another partisan spending bill, despite record levels of inflation and billions of unspent dollars in COVID-19 relief funds.  To date, the Biden administration’s accounting of how it spent trillions of dollars in past COVID-19 relief funding has been inadequate.”The Members continue, “As part of Congress’s effort to understand exactly how the Biden administration spent COVID-19 relief money, we request an audit of a $10 billion COVID-19 vaccine public education campaign launched by the Biden administration and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).”The Members also raise concerns over the involvement of highly partisan organizations in the public education campaign, potentially inappropriate direct or indirect funding to these politically-affiliated groups, and possible access these organizations may have to personally identifiable information of Americans. “It is incredible that HHS and the Biden administration would partner with partisan political organizations and Democrat-affiliated campaign consultants on a $10 billion taxpayer funded vaccine confidence public education campaign, ostensibly intended to appeal to all Americans. It is not clear from publicly available information exactly what these groups do and what benefits they may derive from being a ‘founding member’ of the COVID-19 Community Corps,” the Members write.“First, we are concerned that some of these ‘founding members’ may inappropriately receive direct or indirect funding and support from HHS for partisan activities,” the Members continue. “Second, HHS’s agencies contain or have access to vast amounts of personally identifiable information on hundreds of millions of Americans.”“We request that you initiate an audit and investigation of the HHS COVID-19 Communicators program and related public relations campaigns with a specific focus on the whether ‘founding members’ received government funding or access to Americans’ personal information.”To read the full letter, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/7/senator-burr-honors-emmett-till-s-81st-birthday-urges-house-to-support-gold-medal-bill,"Today, on what would have been Emmett Till’s 81st birthday, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement honoring his legacy and urging passage of bipartisan legislation he’s introduced to posthumously award Emmett Till and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, the Congressional Gold Medal:“Emmett Till’s horrific murder and the unjust acquittal of his killers shocked the nation and made plain the evils of racism. He was just a boy when he was killed, but, had he lived, Emmett would be 81 years old today and very possibly still with us. It is only right that we posthumously award the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to Emmett Till and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, in recognition of the grave injustices they faced and the indelible impact they had on American civil rights. I’m glad the Senate has already passed legislation I’ve introduced to do so. It is my hope that the House will do the same and take up this bill soon.” Background:In 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was kidnapped, beaten, and brutally murdered in Mississippi while visiting his uncle, Moses Wright. His murderers were acquitted despite Wright providing an eyewitness testimony of the kidnapping. The men later admitted to torturing and killing Till, selling the story for $4,000.Following Till’s death, his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, brought his body back to Chicago and demanded an open casket funeral, where 50,000 attendees viewed his body. Till-Mobley allowed a photograph to be taken of Till in his casket, rousing civil rights activists and bringing national attention to the movement.Till-Mobley continued her work for justice in honor of her son. She created the Emmett Till Players, where teenagers traveled throughout the country presenting Martin Luther King, Jr. speeches. Till-Mobley was also the co-founder of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, which significantly impacted our justice system by pushing for the re-investigation of Till’s murder by the State of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Justice in 2004, and by working to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007 to ensure the Justice Department and FBI investigate civil rights era cold cases. In 2016, Senator Burr, along with the late Representative John Lewis (D-GA), led efforts to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016, which was signed into law by President Obama on December 19, 2016.On January 10, 2022, the Senate passed legislation introduced by Senators Burr and Cory Booker (D-NJ) that would posthumously award Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley the Congressional Gold Medal. The bill was sent to the House on the following day, where it remains."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/7/cbo-jct-confirm-dems-obamacare-subsidy-expansion-would-cost-billions-more-than-previously-claimed,"Today, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) released analysis showing Democrats’ proposal to significantly expand Obamacare tax subsidies would add billions of dollars to the federal deficit to the benefit of wealthy Americans.The analysis was in response to a letter requesting the true cost of an expansion of premium tax credits (PTC) sent by Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance, and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee.Statement from Senators Burr, Crapo, and Graham in response to CBO and JCT’s analysis:“The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have confirmed what we already knew: the true cost of Democrats’ Obamacare tax subsidies is astronomically more than they’ve publicly admitted and plan to account for. Making these ‘temporary’ subsidies permanent would add $248 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade. There would be more individuals who would be forced off of their current plans than individuals who would gain new coverage under this policy. According to CBO and JCT, 2.3 million people would lose their current employer-subsidized coverage, forcing individuals and families off the plans. The effect would be to make more people dependent on government. Even worse, people earning more than $100,000 per year receive billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies.“Democrats claim to need reconciliation to reduce the deficit and inflation. Instead of proposing real solutions to fix record-high inflation, Democrats are proposing to hide the effects of inflation on Obamacare premiums by subsidizing the wealthy and already-insured. This is a proposal as nonsensical as it is irresponsible. It’s absolutely critical Americans have an accurate accounting of the real harm these proposals would have on our economy.”To read CBO’s and JCT’s response, click here.To read the full letter sent by the Senators, click here."

I am proud to work with Senator Warner on this commonsense bill that will support American energy independence for years to come.”“Renewable natural gas is a clean, affordable, and reliable fuel source that can help lower emissions from heavy-duty vehicles,” said Senator Warner. “I am proud to introduce legislation to incentivize investment in clean vehicles that will have a positive impact on our environment while significantly aiding in the transition to a clean energy economy.”Background:Previously, renewable natural gas received a lower tax credit than similar transportation fuels, despite its ultra-low emissions and ability to deliver economic growth as a scalable alternative energy source. The Renewable Natural Gas Incentive Act would create a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for sellers of renewable natural gas used for transportation.Full text of the bill can be found HERE."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/7/fact-sheet-how-dems-big-government-price-controls-will-crush-biomedical-innovation,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, released a fact sheet highlighting the innovation-killing impact of Democrats’ proposed prescription price controls.Here’s how Democrats’ partisan agenda would harm American medical breakthroughs and advancements:DEMOCRATIC BIG GOVERNMENT PRICE CONTROLS WILL CRUSH BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION & PREVENT FUTURE CURESThe Schumer plan is simply government-run price-controls paired with sky-high taxes on innovators who save lives. This plan will decrease innovation and prevent future treatments for Americans from being developed. University of Chicago economists estimate the plan will result in 135 fewer new drugs, leading to 331.5 million life years lost in the U.S., over the next 17 years.Despite these projections, Democrats have not answered the question: Which diseases don’t Democrats want to cure?Threatening drug discovery and development: Ground-breaking treatments and cures are the products of years-long investment into cutting-edge scientific discovery, rigorous clinical trials, and demanding regulatory review. Under this system, Americans usually have the fastest access to the highest-quality treatments, often before government-run health care systems. These investments, however, are extremely risky:Chilling long-term investment: Democrats’ government price-setting would curb investments in drug development – leading to fewer novel medicines reaching patients. Pharmaceutical manufacturers invested more than $120 billion in 2021 in research and development, an average of 25% of their net revenues. These investments, while costly, have developed cures for diseases like hepatitis C, vaccinesagainst some of the most deadly diseases in human history, and immunotherapies that are revolutionizing care for cancer patients. On the horizon are innovations that offer hope to patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening conditions like sickle cell disease, heart disease, and neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Generic and biosimilar medicines at-risk: The Democrats’ proposal will decimate developmentof generic and biosimilar medicines, which are generic versions of biologic drugs, like insulin. Biosimilar medications have the potential to save patients and the health care system $40 billion through 2026 alone – exceeding by eight times the projected savings from the Democrats’ “negotiation” scheme over the same period.Biosimilar development is also an expensive endeavor, costing $100 to $200 million to bring a biosimilar to market. Undermining the incentives to develop these medicines means patients may never experience the benefits of the biosimilar pipeline, which includes at least 26 TNF blockers (immunotherapies), 16 cancer medicines, and seven biosimilar insulins, among numerous others. The Democrats’ reckless price-control scheme will cause patients to pay more for fewer choices. To download a copy of the fact sheet, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/5/burr-leads-letter-calling-out-brazen-unilateral-attempt-by-irs-to-expand-obamacare-subsidies,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, along with Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, and Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) sent a letter to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig demanding clarity on its proposal to illegally expand the Affordable Care Act’s premium tax credit (PTC), which would cost taxpayers billions more each year and give the federal government an even larger role in families’ health care decisions. On April 5, 2022, the Biden Administration proposed a change to the affordability test of employer-sponsored insurance by basing affordability on the cost of family coverage, not self-only coverage, in clear violation of existing law. Given ongoing concerns about the ability of the IRS to act as a non-partisan enforcer of tax law, the Senators question the IRS’ decision to reverse its long-held practice of following the law, as written.“The proposal in question runs contrary to the long-held position of the IRS, including under former President Obama,” the Senators wrote. “This not only runs counter to the plain reading of the law, but would dramatically expand spending on Obamacare plans and result in a significant shift of individuals out of employer-sponsored insurance and into government-designed and subsidized Obamacare coverage.”The Senators also criticized the Administration for its unconstitutional attempt to unilaterally change existing law and for failing to provide necessary analyses of the rule’s effects on government spending and health coverage. Past estimates from the Urban Institute and Congressional Budget Office project the proposal will cost taxpayers tens of billions over the next decade. The senators continued, “According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress is empowered to ‘lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.’ The IRS has no constitutional basis for unilaterally changing the laws Congress has enacted.“Moreover, in its proposal the IRS did not include necessary projections of its impacts on cost and coverage. President Biden and White House officials are touting estimates that nearly 1 million Americans who already have insurance would receive additional subsidies, while just 200,000 previously uninsured Americans would gain coverage under the proposal. This would suggest an analysis has been conducted, raising questions as to why such an analysis was not published in the proposal.”To read the full letter, click here.Background:During consideration of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, several provisions were included to prevent the erosion of employer-sponsored health insurance. One specific provision prevented individuals from receiving subsidies for Obamacare plans if they had an offer of “affordable” coverage from their employer. Obamacare specified that if a family received an offer of employer-sponsored health insurance, each family member is considered to also have an offer of “affordable” coverage if the employee’s premium contribution for self-only coverage – not family coverage – is less than 9.5 percent of income. The IRS’ proposed rule reverses this long-held practice of following the law, as written, and threatens Americans’ access to employer-sponsored insurance."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/5/burr-questions-biden-eeoc-nominee-s-lack-of-impartiality-commitment-to-transparency,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a nomination hearing for Kalpana Kotagal to be a Member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).In his submitted statement for the record, Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) expressed his concern on Ms. Kotagal’s radical political ties, lack of impartiality, and unwillingness to commit to transparency that is critical to the Commission.Senator Burr’s submitted statement for the record:“Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, submits the following statement for the record in opposition to the nomination of Kalpana Kotagal to be Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:“Since its inception in 1965, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been integral to this country’s fight against discrimination in the workplace.  For nearly sixty years, the EEOC has used its resources to improve or in many cases eliminate discrimination and impediments to equal opportunity in the workplace.  To ensure public trust, it is essential that the EEOC strive to be above politics and partisanship and enforce our nation’s laws. Ensuring equal opportunity for all within the workplace—regardless of race, sex, gender, and numerous other protected categories—is a fundamentally guaranteed American trait. “However, Ms. Kalpana Kotagal’s nomination undermines those fundamental notions of fairness and would bring partisanship and political interpretation to the EEOC. For this overriding reason, I oppose Ms. Kotagal’s nomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.“As a public institution, the EEOC must be accountable and responsive to the public.  Under the previous Chair Janet Dhillon, the EEOC has reformed itself to be more transparent. Commission votes, public meetings, and hearings are posted on the EEOC’s website and easily accessible to the public. The General Counsel was required to submit certain classes of proposed litigation to the Commission for a vote by every Commissioner. These basic measures of transparency and accountability allowed for greater confidence among the public, employers, and workers in the Commission’s decisions.“Yet Ms. Kotagal refused to commit to any of these reforms during her interview with my staff.  The EEOC has not held any public meetings since January 7, 2021, and has held only one public hearing since that date.  Basic measures of transparency, as well as Commission deliberations on whether to proceed on certain classes of litigation, particularly litigation that raises novel areas of law or issues upon which the Commission has not released guidance, is integral to due process and fairness. Ms. Kotagal’s refusal to continue these common-sense measures speaks volumes of her lack of commitment to due process and transparency.“I am concerned Ms. Kotagal lacks impartiality to interpret the law, and I will oppose her nomination.  The nominee testified as an expert in favor of banning the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements in the workplace, or in the least only permitting unions to reap arbitration’s benefits. The nominee has also failed to explain why it is permissible to uphold the bargaining power of unions but limit that of individual workers.  Ms. Kotagal has criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the plain language of the Federal Arbitration Act, and wishes to curtail employees’ ability to enter into arbitration proceedings. To Ms. Kotagal, class-action litigation seems to be the only effective means of obtaining relief for discrimination. However, Ms. Kotagal failed to note that class-action plaintiffs often get less monetary relief as a result of courts liberally certifying large classes of plaintiffs with uncommon interests. The process for class certification is itself often costly, requiring the hiring of attorneys at great expense to the average person. All of these are factors Ms. Kotagal failed to consider, or even acknowledge, in her submitted congressional testimony. “Ms. Kotagal has a history of political activism whose policy judgments would bring partisanship to the EEOC.  As a class-action lawyer in the private sector, Ms. Kotagal served as a Board Advisory Member to the People’s Parity Project, an affiliation she initially failed to disclose.  The People’s Parity Project has become notorious for launching intimidation campaigns against law firms and law schools to prevent the hiring of public servants who previously served in the Trump Administration. In an open letter, the People’s Parity Project proudly asserts their intention to criminalize policy differences by naming a number of esteemed public servants and demanding employers refuse to hire any of those distinguished individuals ‘to show there are consequences’ for serving a disfavored Administration.  Instead of condemning the leak of a draft, pre-decisional Supreme Court opinion, the People’s Parity Project instead urged more intimidation against the Court through their rhetoric, referring to the Supreme Court as an ‘illegitimate political actor’ and urging its followers to allow the leaking of the opinion to ‘radicalize us.’“Additionally, Ms. Kotagal has not been transparent with this Committee regarding her social media presence, having admitted to deleting thousands of Tweets.  For these reasons, I oppose Ms. Kotagal’s nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.”"

In their letter, Senator Burr and Representative Foxx criticized the Administration for their unwillingness to be transparent on its failures to protect student data privacy.“Once again, the Biden administration is attempting to evade Congressional oversight while it willfully violates the privacy of millions of students around the country,” the members write.“The importance of protecting student’s information cannot be understated. To ensure student data privacy, our offices requested a briefing with the Department to better understand the extent of the information given to Facebook and what was being done to remedy the situation. That request has been denied. It wasn’t until the story was published by The Markup that the code was turned off and Federal Student Aid Chief Operating Officer, Richard Cordray, stated that this information was ‘inadvertently’ shared after FSA engaged in an advertising campaign.  However, the article notes that the existence of the Pixel code predates that advertising campaign, thereby leading us to believe your staff is either obfuscating the truth or completely disregarding its responsibility to protect personal information.” “It is essential that you cooperate with Congressional oversight on this issue,” the members concluded. “The Department’s continued failure to be transparent harms FAFSA applicants and their trust in our institutions. It also harms Congress’ ability to trust you and your agency.”To read the full letter, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/4/burr-fda-must-be-held-accountable-to-meeting-terms-of-its-commitments-in-user-fee-programs,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing titled, “FDA User Fee Agreements: Advancing Medical Product Regulation and Innovation for the Benefit of Patients, FDA Center Directors.” This is the Committee’s second hearing to examine the commitment letters submitted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry leaders for the reauthorization of the prescription drug, generic drug, biosimilar, and medical device user fee agreements. The first hearing was held on April 5, 2022, with industry leaders.In his opening statement, Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) underscored the FDA’s responsibility to meeting the terms of its commitments in each user fee program and reiterated Congress’ critical role in holding the agency accountable to Americans.Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement: “Madam Chair, I’d also like to take a moment to reflect on the passing of former Chairman Hatch.“When the Reagan Revolution came to the Senate, Orrin Hatch became this committee’s Chair. He was a remarkable Senator and a good friend to so many of us in the Senate.“His work in this committee, and others, is something we should all be proud of.“Without Orrin Hatch, we wouldn’t have the generic drug industry.“Think of how many lives have been saved because of that and how many billions have been saved on lower-cost drugs.“He was also the author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, helping improve the lives of millions of Americans with disabilities, giving them opportunities and freedoms to live good quality lives. “The list of what he accomplished could go on and on. I am saddened by his passing, and my heart and prayers go out to his beloved Elaine and their children, and to his friends and the staff who worked for him because I know they are hurting today, too.“Thank you for holding this second hearing today on FDA’s user fee programs, and for working with my staff and me on policies that have the potential to go along with legislation to reauthorize them. “The user fee reauthorizations provide one of those rare opportunities in Congress for true bipartisan work, and should be seen as a time to take a hard look at policies that affect the daily lives of Americans. “I would bet that each person watching and participating in this hearing has already used several products today that are regulated by the FDA.“That is why it is so important for the agency to keep pace with the advancements in the products that it regulates.“If today’s hearing had a theme, it would be accountability. You are here today to be held accountable to the Congress and the American people.“During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA leveraged its authorities and responded swiftly to help private sector partners develop and bring tests, treatments, and vaccines to Americans in record time. “I was thrilled that the agency embraced the letter and spirit of the law.“But this seems to be the exception, reserved for emergencies, and not the rule. COVID-19 was a crisis, and you acted fast, but a diagnosis of cancer and or Alzheimer’s is also a crisis for families facing this news each day. “The agency needs to apply practices it used during the COVID response to its every day operations to help speed not only the review of products, but their development as well.“Why shouldn’t we expect you to treat more things with the same urgency you applied to the pandemic?“As we learned during the pandemic, FDA has a fractured framework for clinical tests. It has blind spots where some of the most important tests for patients and their doctors are concerned – like genetic tests. “I want to work on updating FDA’s regulation of diagnostic tests, and I am working with the Chair to update the regulation of other products like cosmetics and dietary supplements, too.“I am glad the chair is interested in rolling up her sleeves with me on each of them.“But there is an elephant in the room. The FDA has a responsibility to meet the terms of the commitments it has made for the user fee programs.“Based on my evaluation, you have not fully delivered.“During the last two decades, I have legislated major reforms at FDA across almost all of its programs:“The 1997 user fee bill was my bill, FDAMA. It brought needed reform to streamline drug review, established risk-based regulation of medical devices, and required the agency to be more flexible with the types of evidence it considers for the products it regulates.   “In 2010, I worked with Senators Judd Gregg, Ted Kennedy, Lamar Alexander, and others to write the Food Safety Modernization Act, aimed at reducing foodborne illness and deaths, and modernizing the food safety programs at the agency. “In 2012, I worked with late Senator Tom Coburn to hold FDA more accountable, reduce product review times, and address culture challenges at the agency to reinforce that review speed matters – especially to patients with a ticking clock.“In 2013, this Committee worked to provide regulatory certainty for compounded drugs, and I worked to ensure the agency had the track and trace authorities it needed improve its ability to detect unsafe, counterfeit medicines. “However, I have also been the roadblock to many proposals when I feared the agency was not ready for the role Congress wanted it to play, or its mission was at risk.“I have also objected to giving FDA new or expanded authorities that they shouldn’t have, especially when FDA fails to address my concerns about accountability.“I fought against the passage of the 2009 tobacco law, because I knew the FDA didn’t have what it takes to regulate these products.“Thirteen years and more than $7.5 billion later, and it has authorized only one vapor product. Only one potentially less harmful alternative for life-long smokers.“I held the 2012 user fee bill on the Senate floor and spoke for hours to run through my longstanding concerns with the user fee programs, and FDA’s posture that a user fee bill could be dropped in the lap of the U.S. Senate and passed without question. “I have fought to uphold FDA’s gold standard of review, including when other agencies thought they could perform FDA’s function better.“I deeply value and believe in the mission of the Food and Drug Administration, which is why the commitments that FDA makes are so important, and the goals it misses are so concerning.“The user fee legislation that will come before this Committee for a vote in just a few weeks must hold the FDA accountable for its actions and inactions.“Accountability is not an option. You don’t get to set goals you know you can meet and pretend that’s accountability.“Each of the new agreements this Committee is evaluating reflect major new commitments. More money, more staff, more government.“But what are we to do about previous commitments that went, or remain, unfulfilled?“For the drugs program: In fiscal years 2019 and 2020,  FDA missed 12 out of 14 user fee goals in the new drug program related to product development meetings with sponsors – leaving the innovators in limbo. “Meeting only two of 14 goals is a 15 percent success rate. I believe that would be an ‘F’ pretty much everywhere.“For the biosimilars program: In fiscal year 2020, FDA only reviewed 50 percent of applications on time. And, FDA missed seven out of 15 goals related to biosimilar product development meetings.“Fifty percent and seven of 15 goals would also be an ‘F.’“And, for the medical device program: Not only will FDA be three months late in finalizing an agreement, it took so long because you refused to acknowledge that the agency didn’t meet all its goals from the last time around. “And now, the FDA wants double the money for mediocre performance improvements, and, for certain devices, longer review times.“But the missed commitments don’t stop there.“Missing explanations on deficiency letters, a carryover balance the size of a whole year of user fees, and the failure to finalize a guidance critical to some of the most advanced products in the field. “More money. Lower expectations of accountability. No accountability for past failures.“Add on top of this, a new, costly program aimed at shepherding certain devices through the review process for which FDA has zero clear deliverables. When you already essentially have this authority because I already gave it to you.“And you expect Congress to rubber stamp these agreements? My friends, I don’t think so.“After two transformative, challenging years at FDA, I know you can do better. The American people saw you do better, and you have an opportunity today to convince me that the agency is on the right path for patients. “The more you use the user fees process to bully dollars out of industry, holding them hostage in the negotiating room, the less accountable FDA is to the American people and their elected representatives. Period. “American patients deserve user fee programs that bring medicines to them on time, that keep pace with technology, that reduce the time and cost of development of treatments, and that do not grow just to put more government between patients and cures. “I come to this process as a good faith partner to my colleagues and as a long standing advocate of the FDA, but not as a doormat.“This Committee has never shied away from difficult FDA policy discussions.“I promise that this process will be thorough and critical, so that the agency can rise to the challenge of the next generation of scientific advancements to improve the lives of Americans.“I know you can do it. And with just a little more accountability added to these programs, I am optimistic that my colleagues and I will be able to get these agreements signed into law.“But if there’s not more accountability, I see no reason why I shouldn’t stand in the way.“I thank the chair.”"

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/4/senator-burr-blasts-biden-administration-for-fourth-extension-of-student-loan-repayment-freeze,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement after the Biden Administration announced its four-month extension to the student loan repayment freeze, the fourth such extension under this Administration:“The Biden Administration wants to have their cake and eat it, too: they want to tout America’s return to normal following the pandemic, but also want to keep extending emergency relief policies. It’s long past time for student loan repayments to resume as normal. Extending the freeze on student loan repayments, yet again, contradicts reality and exacerbates the moral hazard this Administration has created.“Each time the Administration has kicked the can down the road by extending the repayment freeze, it’s cost taxpayers an estimated $5 billion per month. This four-month extension is estimated to cost $20 billion, which is in addition to $100 billion Americans have already spent on the ‘temporary’ executive action.“This is an unacceptable burden on taxpayers, which disproportionally benefits higher-income earners who have advanced degrees. Instead, the Administration should work with Congress on existing, bipartisan proposals to simplify student loan repayment programs to give borrowers greater flexibility and certainty.”Background:On August 6, 2021, Senator Burr criticized the Administration’s decision to again extend the repayment freeze for four months. On June 2, 2021, Senator Burr and Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) sent a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona urging the Department to not extend the repayment freeze and requesting an update on its plan to transition student loan borrowers from the COVID-19 freeze to active repayment status.On March 18, 2021, Senators Burr and Angus King (I-ME) reintroduced the Repay Act to reform federal student loan repayment programs by consolidating the existing nine programs into tow, easy-to-navigate repayment plans.On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which paused student loan repayments through September 30, 2020. The pause was extended by then-Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on August 21, 2020, through December 31, 2020, and extended again through January 31, 2021. On January 20, 2021, President Biden announced the extension of the loan pause through September 30, 2021. Another extension was announced by the Biden Administration on August 6, 2021, through January 31, 2022. The freeze was extended again on December 22, 2021 through May 1, 2022. Today’s announcement is the fourth extension by the Biden Administration and sixth overall extension since the program was created by executive action."

Such blatant disregard is yet another example of this Administration ignoring the will of Congress and acting by executive fiat.”To read the full letter, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/4/burr-presses-cdc-for-science-behind-title-42-decision,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, sent a letter to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky pressing the agency to clarify the science behind its decision to terminate the Title 42 order after apparent inconsistencies between the rationale used to support the decision and the current state of the ongoing response.“I believe that I understand the Administration’s progressive politics driving the decision, but I do not believe that there is adequate science that would allow such a decision to be made,” wrote Senator Burr.“In the announcement, CDC noted, ‘97.1% of the U.S. population lives in a county identified as having ‘low’ COVID-19 Community Level,’” Senator Burr continued. “However, as of today, CDC assesses the risk of COVID-19 transmission in Mexico to be Level 3, or high, and all other countries in Central America are at or above Level 3, except for those that CDC recommends U.S. travelers entirely avoid due to lack of information about COVID-19 transmission levels.“CDC also cites the importance of vaccination in preventing severe disease during the Omicron surge, which CDC uses as evidence to support the decision to terminate the previous order. However, the durability of immunity among the U.S. population over the coming months remains to be seen, as much of the population continues to be ineligible for a fourth dose. This could, in turn, lead to increases in severe disease during future waves and will be exacerbated by the introduction of additional cases and likely undetected variants through illegal border crossings.“Access to treatments is similarly cited as a mitigating factor. However, it is my understanding that the administration is unable to procure sufficient doses of these products for American citizens without additional funding from Congress.”This letter follows a statement released by Senator Burr last week highlighting the Administration’s contradictory messaging on COVID-19 after the Administration announced that it would discontinue the Title 42 order on April 1, 2022.To read the full letter, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/4/burr-on-fda-user-fee-agreements-innovation-is-key-when-fda-does-not-live-up-to-commitments-patients-suffer,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing titled, “FDA User Fee Agreements: Advancing Medical Product Regulation and Innovation for the Benefit of Patients.” This is the Committee’s first hearing to examine the commitment letters submitted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry leaders earlier this year for the reauthorization of the prescription drug, generic drug, biosimilar, and medical device user fee agreements.Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement:“Chair Murray, thank you for holding this important hearing today.“To the witnesses, welcome. I am looking forward to our discussion.“Every five years, this committee is charged with evaluating FDA’s user fee programs and the agency’s performance in meeting its existing commitments.“At their core, these programs are about bringing new hope to Americans. The faster, more predictable, and more accountable the programs are, the more patients stand to benefit from life-saving, innovative drugs and devices. “When FDA does not live up to its commitments, patients are the ones who suffer.“I have served in Congress since 1995, so I have been here for all but the very first user fee process.“Each time, I have gradually added provisions to improve FDA’s accountability to the commitments it makes.“Every five years, industry agrees to provide more funding under the duress of negotiating with their regulator.“So, it is Congress’ job to make sure that the negotiations were not a hostage situation, and that these agreements are a good deal for patients and the industries that bring them hope.“The user fee programs are intended to supplement FDA’s congressionally appropriated resources to speed the review of medical products and get treatments to patients as quickly as possible.“The user fee agreements negotiated between FDA and industry partners lay out the process for bringing new products to market that will treat, prevent, and cure diseases.“In 1992 under the first prescription drug user fee agreement, or PDUFA, the drug application fee was about $100,000. Today, the drug application fee is more than $3.1 million.“The medical device user fee agreements were first signed into law in 2002.“In 2007, a 510(k) submission was just over $4,000. Today, this application costs more than $12,700.“When Members of Congress complain about the cost of prescription drugs or medical devices, we should evaluate all aspects of the pipeline, including the cost of development and regulatory review to make sure costly and burdensome regulations are not part of the problem.“The enormous growth in the oldest of the user free programs underscores my longstanding concerns.“In 1993, FDA collected just over $35 million in annual fees for the prescription drug user fee program.“Today, FDA collects over $1 billion in PDUFA user fees annually. Even accounting for inflation, that’s an increase of more than 1,500 percent since the start of the program.“Yet FDA continues to request more and more resources from industry, even when they don’t meet the agreed upon performance goals.“For example, in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, FDA missed 12 out of 14 goals related to scheduling meetings, delaying needed conversations for innovators to move forward with their products.“As part of the proposed new prescription drug program commitments, FDA is requesting an additional $324 million over the five year cycle.“The proposed agreement includes $111 million for hiring an additional 352 new people. That’s 122 more new hires than the agency committed to in the last cycle.“In fact, across all four programs, FDA is committing to more than 880 new hires, when the agency has more than 700 vacancies outstanding.“Generic and biosimilar drugs are our best tool in driving down the cost of prescription drugs, and should be a top priority of the agency.“The biosimilar agreements should help bolster the number of biosimilars in the market, including biosimilar insulin products.“FDA, again, has struggled to meet some important program goals. “During fiscal year 2020, FDA missed nine out of 15 goals related to product development meetings.“Under the proposed biosimilar agreement, FDA is requesting an additional $5 million over the five-year cycle and 15 new hires.“The generic drug program collects more than $494 million in annual fees and supports more than 2,100 staff positions. Under the proposed generic drug agreement, FDA is requesting additional funding of more than $40 million and 128 new hires. “While FDA appears to be on track to meet the majority of its commitments under the current generic agreement, its performance has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of delayed facility inspections. “As of last August, these inspection challenges had delayed more than 29 generic drug applications, with many more applications likely delayed since then.“Turning our attention to the medical device agreement, I’ve watched this very carefully and I am concerned.“This committee only recently received the draft medical device commitment letter. The final medical device agreements were due, by law, to Congress on January 15.“By the time we receive these final agreements, the device commitment letter will be more than three months late.“Under this proposed agreement, FDA is requesting up to $1.9 billion dollars over the five-year cycle, nearly a $1 billion increase.“This proposed increase is roughly doubling fee collections.“Yet again, FDA did not meet deliverables under this user fee program. The FDA missed goals for 510(k) reviews, resulting in longer review times; failed to explain its reasoning to sponsors each time it sent a letter of deficiency about their product; and failed to issue an important digital health guidance on time.“Let me remind my colleagues, these were not optional actions, these were requirements under the last deal.“Under the proposed agreement, FDA is committing to holding steady or improving performance for most categories of submissions.“For the first two years, review times for Premarket Approval applications would hold steady at 290 calendar days, and in the last three years, review times would reduce to 285 calendar days.“However, FDA is significantly walking back its current commitment to review 510(k) submissions within 108 days. Instead, FDA is proposing longer review times of 128 days.“The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, which we passed in 2012, required FDA to review 95 percent of these applications within 90 days.“This agreement almost doubles the user fees, and includes longer review times for some categories of products.“Pay more, get less is not exactly a selling point to me.“MDUFA V also includes a new pilot program called TAP that aims to initiate early and frequent engagement between FDA and sponsors of innovative devices.“As the author of the breakthrough device pathway, I still can’t figure out whether this new program will offer anything different from FDA’s current activities for breakthrough devices.“This new pilot program is set to grow over the five year cycle, without clear accountability metrics or deliverables to help measure the success of the program.“The pilot has the ability to grow to 325 devices, which would cost at least $338,000 per device. Congress deserves a full accounting of how FDA plans to spend these resources and operate this new, nebulous program. “And I’ll tell you right now, Congress is going to require accountability in here for this new program.“With each reauthorization, FDA receives huge increases in resources, despite not fully delivering what it previously promised.“And with a declining percentage of congressional appropriations for the overall programs, FDA is increasingly removing itself from Congress’ reach.“I question whether the agreements, both past and proposed, reflect a good deal for the patients they are designed to serve.“In 2017, during the user fee hearings in this Committee, I asked each industry representative testifying about the importance of the user fee agreements and whether they would support a mechanism to hold FDA more accountable.“The response was clear: FDA should be held accountable to its commitments.“I look forward to hearing from each of you about why you have agreed to these commitments and how they will accelerate innovative products for Americans.“I yield back.”"

On the one hand, the Administration is clamoring for additional emergency funding and costing taxpayers $5 billion per month by delaying student loan repayment, citing the continued threat of COVID-19. On the other hand, they’re rescinding safeguards in place to prevent new, potentially undetected variants from entering the country and encouraging Americans to return to normal life. They cannot have it both ways. The inconsistencies, particularly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, do not inspire confidence that these decisions are being made based on science instead of politics.”"

Court packing is a transparent power grab – one that would forever compromise the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer both rejected court packing and the next justice who joins the Court should do the same. “Unfortunately, Judge Jackson’s answers on the question, in both her confirmation hearing and our personal discussion, continue to be unsatisfactory. While she is undoubtedly highly qualified, knowledgeable, and experienced, based on our discussion, I cannot support Judge Jackson’s nomination when it comes before the Senate.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/3/senate-help-committee-examines-ways-to-enhance-american-retirement-savings-encourage-participation-and-planning,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing titled, “Rise and Shine: Improving Retirement and Enhancing Savings.”Ranking Member Burr’s prepared opening statement:“Good morning.  Thank you Chair Murray for scheduling this hearing to highlight the need for Congress to consider legislation to encourage Americans to save more for their futures. “It’s not often we have hearings on the pension part of the HELP Committee, but as I look at my remaining nine months in the Senate I’m very aware of the importance of working and saving towards a secure retirement. “Our labor committee hook into retirement issues is ERISA – the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  ERISA sets standards for retirement and health plans in private industry to protect individuals in these plans.  The Finance Committee handles the Internal Revenue Code portion.“Retirement bills require our Committees to work in concert so that ERISA and the tax code properly work together to help Americans save for their own retirement. “As a member of both HELP and Finance Committees, I consider my office a one-stop shop on retirement matters.  Not only will I help shepherd ERISA matters through this Committee, I will also shape the work of the Finance Committee.  “At our hearing last year, we focused on defined contribution plans, the reliable superstar of the retirement world.  Today we will examine how we can make further improvements to these plans.   “The questions before us are simple: what is working well and what needs improvement?“The answer to that first question seems easy at the surface level.  The system works great, when you participate.“The two most important words for a secure retirement are compound interest.“If you put a little bit of money aside every paycheck and let it grow, your future retirement will be a lot better off.“But the system doesn’t work great when individuals don’t or can’t participate.   “What we need to do is help Americans and their employers offer, operate, and fund individual retirement plans. “One option we’ll learn about from TIAA, which has a great North Carolina presence as all smart companies should, is Multiple Employer Plans.  TIAA has picked up the mantle as an administrator and advocate for the enhancement of these plans.  “Under these plans, employers pool together to gain efficiency to reduce costs and administration of plans.  Less money spent on administration means more money being saved.“Congress has been working to reinvigorate these pooled employer plans to get retirement plans out to more and more worksites and employees, especially small business employees.“The wonderful thing about defined contribution plans is that Americans who participate in them can pick up a piece of paper and see at least two things: their name and an account balance. “It’s their money.  And it’s there.  It’s not a concept. It’s not an accounting notation.  It doesn’t require a bailout. “It requires personal contributions, maybe an employer match, some basic financial knowledge, and then compounded interest does its work. “Here’s a truth: Americans need to save more.“The gap between the retirement savings that Americans have and the savings they need is already in the trillions of dollars and likely to grow.“Not only are many Americans struggling to keep track of their savings needs, even more alarming is how many people have no savings at all, outside of Social Security.“The data we’ve seen says that over one-quarter of non-retirees have nothing in their retirement piggy banks, many of whom are already nearing traditional retirement age.“And while the long-term impact of the pandemic and economic lockdowns and the Great Resignation remain to be seen, we know that many Americans chose to tap into their retirement savings, draining assets from their intended retirement purpose. “The bright side is that we’ve learned some good lessons.“According to AARP, workers are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if they can make a payroll deduction to a savings plan at work – you don’t spend what you don’t see.“We have also seen the success of automatic enrollment and employer matching to defined contribution plans. “So, the challenge to this Congress is finding ways to help employees and employers take advantage of the savings programs that already work.“I look forward to hearing from the panel today about how to overcome the barriers individuals face in their retirement planning, and the barriers employers face in offering retirement plans to workers. “I hope throughout this process Congress remembers that we shouldn’t be trying to take our opinions of how to plan for the future and take choices of retirement options away from individuals.“The American people didn’t send us up here to be maternalistic or paternalistic and make their investment decisions for them or limit their choices.“If we were all that good with planning ahead we probably wouldn’t have a $30 trillion debt.“What I want the most is for Americans to control their own money, have safe options on how to invest and save, and live with as few government and industry middlemen or middlewomen as possible.“Thank you.  I look forward to our discussion.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-burr-urges-federal-officials-to-apply-lessons-from-pandemic-to-address-mental-health-and-substance-use-disorder-challenges,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held a hearing titled, “Strengthening Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Programs: Opportunities, Challenges, and Emerging Issues.” Today’s hearing follows Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) and Chair Patty Murray’s (D-WA)announcement last month that the Committee would be working on meaningful, bipartisan proposals to reauthorize, improve, and expand federal mental health and substance use disorder programs.Ranking Member Burr’s prepared opening statement:“Good morning. I am glad that the chair is holding this bipartisan hearing today.“Even before the pandemic, we knew the need to address mental health and substance use disorders was dire. Opioids took hold and the result was a crisis families and communities had not dealt with for some time. “As we look to reauthorize a number of these programs, we face a problem that has been compounded by the pandemic, but can be informed by our COVID-19 response.“We learned that research, innovation, partnerships, and real-time data are the keys to our success in overcoming an unprecedented public health challenge. Today’s hearing will help us determine how to apply these lessons and these actions to the mental health and substance use challenge that continues to devastate our communities.“The last time the committee examined our mental health and substance use programs, we heard from Sam Quinones on opioids, who shared his belief that isolation and lack of community was a driving factor in the substance use disorder crisis facing America.  “Isolation only worsened when the pandemic struck. Months on end of remote learning, time separated from aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, and teachers, and families with critically ill and dying loved ones who could not say goodbye has taken a tremendous toll on America, especially our children. “We are seeing the results of the past two years in the alarming rates of people, particularly young children, arriving in emergency departments in a state of mental health crisis.“In 2020 alone, the number of young people seeking care for their mental health in an emergency room increased by 31 percent.“Between 2016 and 2020, the number of children experiencing depression increased by 27 percent, and the number of children experiencing anxiety rose by 29 percent.“Last year, more than 100,000 people lost their lives to a drug overdose, a nearly 30 percent increase from the year before.  Two-thirds of these deaths were linked to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl.“But in the face of these tragedies, we see strength and resilience.  Families turning tragedy into action, to bring awareness and understanding to help others. “In hearings over the past year, we have heard examples of leaders and local communities ready to meet these challenges, partnering to bring local solutions to address local challenges.  As we consider reauthorizing these programs, it would serve us well to remember this too.“Since 2016, we have authorized or reauthorized more than 40 different federal programs to address mental health and substance use disorders.“In addition, the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill provided nearly $5 billion for mental health and substance use disorder-related programs.“But at least nine of these authorized programs did not receive funding.“We have seen time and time again that creating a new program that does not get funded is a false promise. That creating new program for the press release at a markup isn’t actually a solution.“So, we need to figure out what we can do with the tools that we have, improve current programs, and fund the programs we do create.“And we should be honest with ourselves and the country and terminate programs that haven’t received funding in the last five years. If a program hasn’t received funding, it shouldn’t stay on the books.“We will have to prioritize and answer key questions, like how to better target our programs to make sure they’re both meeting the needs of today, but also have the flexibility to address the needs of tomorrow.  “To our witnesses, welcome. We need your expertise to ensure we have the right performance measures in place to track progress in the programs you oversee. “GAO recently found that many of our mental health and substance abuse programs lack the measures we need to know whether programs are working.“You only know what you can measure.“If we cannot track progress in a meaningful way, we will not know how to improve programs to better meet the needs of the people they are intended to serve and reprioritize those that are underperforming.  “Additionally, we need to make sure that we are using up-to-date data to inform our response and address emerging issues. “States and local communities must be empowered to address these issues, and they need accurate information to identify the problems they are facing – like emergence or reemergence of a new drug in an area, or identifying increased rates of suicide in certain populations.“Sometimes this requires thinking outside the box. We saw communities pull together during the pandemic to come up with solutions that worked – and we need the same spirit and ingenuity for this challenge. “One of the trends in that success was partnership with the private sector. Local public-private partnerships are the foundation of many of our successful federal mental health and substance use disorder programs.“I look forward to hearing more about how SAMHSA is encouraging partnerships and facilitating local engagement through its programs and how this can be improved.“Leveraging innovation to help address our mental health and substance use disorder crisis is another area I look forward to focusing on and hearing more about. NIMH and NIDA supported research has the potential to advance the field and improve our knowledge of the causes and consequences of mental illness and drug use to better inform prevention and treatment activities.“And critical to all of this is a strong workforce. This committee reauthorized a number of health workforce programs in 2020 in addition to those included in the pandemic package.“The health workforce, particularly our doctors, nurses, counselors, and therapists, have been through a lot. They rose to the challenge during this pandemic and it has taken a toll.“Earlier this Congress, the committee passed the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which was just signed into law, to make sure that these providers get the support and care they need for their own mental health and substance use concerns, especially as they continue to care for all of us. “I look forward to hearing more about how HRSA is leveraging and prioritizing existing federal health workforce programs to fill gaps in the mental health and substance use disorder workforce.“I thank the chair.”"

I want to thank the witnesses for testifying here today.“I also want to thank every child care provider across the country for their dedication to children and parents over the last two years.“As I’ve said many times before, child care was the one education sector that never abandoned working parents and their children during COVID. Unlike public schools, child care understood that for parents to work, they needed to be open. So again, thank you all. “Forty-seven weeks ago, this Committee had a productive bipartisan hearing on child care.“In fact, every other hearing this Committee has ever held on child care has been bipartisan, until today.“Today we abandon the precedent of decades of bipartisan hearings and markups of crucial legislation such as the Child Care and Development Block Grant and Head Start, for the Committee’s first partisan child care hearing on a terrible partisan bill. “In the 329 days since our last bipartisan child care hearing, rather than seeking a bipartisan solution, some have tried to impose their progressive vision, which would destroy child care as we know it. “Thankfully, that plan has gone nowhere as folks read past the one-pager of talking points and discovered in hundreds of pages of legislative text a ‘bait and switch on our kids’ future,’ as one Minnesota state education chair called it.“With no plan for paying for two new entitlements, the proposal hides the long-term costs by baiting states with ‘free money’ in the first two or three years, then socking states with ever increasing costs just as the federal spigot cuts off. “Worse, all the promises to make child care affordable under this partisan plan are nothing but empty promises to the 35 to 40 percent of kids living in states that CBO estimated would refuse to participate in these new child care and pre-k programs because of the unaffordable costs mandated from Washington.“And what about families that have to balance their own budgets? Even some progressive analysts estimate this partisan proposal will raise child care costs by $13,000-a-year on middle class families. “Finally, faith-based providers have made it very clear that this proposal would end the 30-year bipartisan agreement allowing religious providers to participate without compromising their religious mission, causing immediate harm to the 53 percent of parents who choose to use a faith-based provider for their child care.“With all these concerns raised, we have two paths before us.“Path one: you can continue to go it alone. Some will try to bully their own side into submission, yell at states that say they won’t participate, and pretend that religious providers are wrong about their inability to participate in this poorly designed proposal.“Or path two. The path our voters sent us all here to take: come to the table in a bipartisan way as is the history of this Committee and seek common ground.“I still believe it’s possible to return to a bipartisan consensus on child care.“Just over six years ago I worked with Barbara Mikulski on the last CCDBG reauthorization.  Her charge to us was simple: ‘Let's see what we can get done…Where can we find common ground? Where can we find that sensible center? How can we move things forward on a bipartisan basis where we add value to our country but don't add to our debt?’“That bill passed 88-1 in the Senate and by voice vote in the Republican-led House.“When everyone agrees that there is a shortage of affordable, quality child care, it is my belief that CCDBG is that sensible center from which to start a bipartisan discussion.“CCDBG is the right platform because it proved itself exactly the right architecture for delivering federal child care assistance during COVID.“With the extra funding, States were able to expand access to child care for essential workers, reduce parent co-pays, increase provider reimbursement rates to cover fixed and operational expenses, reimburse providers based on enrollment versus attendance to stabilize provider cash flow, and provide wage supplements and bonuses to raise child care staff wages and incentivize staff to stay.“Additionally, when public schools shuttered their doors and turned kitchen tables and a laptop into classrooms, countless essential workers turned to their local child care providers who welcomed school-age children, providing them a safe place while mom or dad worked.“If you have a program with 30 plus years of bipartisan support and a program that has shown it can not only withstand but excel during a pandemic, CCDBG seems a remarkable foundation from which to build. “So, I’m offering an olive branch to my colleagues today, to encourage them to take the bipartisan path.“This morning, Senator Tim Scott is leading our charge to find common ground. Along with several colleagues, we are introducing the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act Reauthorization of 2022.  “In crafting this legislation, we have sought to build on the bipartisan CCDBG program which has been assisting American working families with their child care for the last 30 years and that has allowed parents maximum choice in their child care providers, including:·         “Providing greater support to help working families afford child care, through increased eligibility and lower parent copays, so that more families can get the help they need to afford child care;·         “Improving reimbursement rates for child care providers to cover fixed costs, operating expenses, and staff salaries and benefits necessary to recruit, train, and retain qualified staff, so that we can make child care more affordable and pay child care workers more;·         “Providing greater support for child care teachers through financial assistance in the attainment of post-secondary credentials and degrees and financial assistance to providers to recruit and retain child care teachers, through bonuses, retention grants, and wage supplements, so we can raise the quality of the education and care provided;·         “And, expanding the supply and capacity of child care providers, so working parents have multiple quality child care options to best suit their family’s needs and ensuring child care facilities are designed and equipped to keep children healthy and safe. “This is the foundation we should be working from, not a partisan bill that destroys the system we have built together.“I am hopeful members will give this bill consideration, let us know what we got right, what we got wrong, and most importantly how to make it better.“That’s the legislative process I hope that we pursue, that we put the reckless partisan exercise aside, that we go back to the greatest traditions of this committee and the Senate and seek a reasonable solution that works for all of the country. “I thank the Chair.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/3/senate-help-committee-considers-bipartisan-prevent-pandemics-act,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held an executive session on the Prepare for and Responded to Existing Viruses, Emerging New Threats, and Pandemics Act (PREVENT Pandemics Act), legislation recently introduced by Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) to strengthen the nation’s preparedness and response framework amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The PREVENT Pandemics Act represents nearly a year of Committee work reviewing the nation’s pandemic response and includes critical reforms to improve Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) accountability and transparency, support federal leadership and coordination through the establishment of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy at the White House, ensure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) keeps pace with cutting-edge platform technology, and enhance the nation’s lab safety and security architecture.Senator Burr’s prepared opening statement:“Good morning. This legislation before us is a true milestone in recognizing lessons learned during our nation’s pandemic response, and the Chair and I want to thank each of our colleagues for their efforts to bring us to this markup today.“I am pleased that the Committee is building on the bipartisan foundation of three decades worth of work to enhance the preparedness policies that our country has relied on to respond to this terrible pandemic. “My friends, we should remember that this Committee last acted on preparedness legislation in May 2018 to reauthorize the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.“While we knew it was an important bill at the time, we had no idea just how much our work then would impact our daily lives now.“When COVID-19 first arrived in the United States two years ago, Congress responded in a bipartisan and unprecedented way to bring relief to Americans and shore up our country’s response.“In my 27 years in Congress, I have rarely seen this body move so quickly – an extremely difficult task.“The work of this Committee was the foundation of the government’s response.“Our Committee must once again step up to the task of considering legislation that will help us be better prepared against future threats.“All of us on this Committee have spent countless hours compiling policies that drive at one point – how do we do it better next time.“I am proud of the work we have done together. The PREVENT Pandemics Act is a very good bill.“The central issue facing us today is how can we better anticipate what threat we will face next, and innovate quickly enough to rise to the challenge.“The future, unfortunately, is hard to predict.“I introduced one of my first pieces of preparedness legislation in 2001.“At the time, I knew that we needed rapid medical response teams to surge for emergency events.“So, I wrote a bill to create the National Disaster Medical System, which still plays a key role in surging to address pockets with high COVID-19 cases across the country. One of these teams was sent to North Carolina just six weeks ago. “What I’ve learned is that when we write preparedness legislation we do not always know what our tools will be used for, but we know that we need them.“Over the last two years we have learned that more effective leadership is needed to direct and coordinate the work of federal departments during a response. So, we have created the White House mission control office to bring a unified, whole-of-government approach to responses and to keep us sharp during peace time.“During each of our hearings, members on both sides of the aisle rightfully challenged the CDC for their actions, confusing directives, and inability to provide realistic guidance to Americans. Through this bill, we are putting into place real, meaningful reforms that take important steps to improve the culture of the CDC, which desperately needs changing.“Along with cultural reforms at the CDC, the modernization of public health data and surveillance capabilities will be key in providing early warning signs of the next threat we face. I especially appreciate the work of Senators Cassidy, Romney, Hickenlooper and Kaine to bring these capabilities into the 21st century.“Senators Cassidy, Romney, Collins, Marshall, Smith, and Hassan identified critical gaps in our medical supply capabilities, so we are adding new tools to engage states and private industry in stockpiling and ensuring that we maintain a warm base for countermeasure manufacturing.“Senators Marshall, Braun, and Paul helped to highlight vulnerabilities in our research enterprise. This legislation brings a new strategy to federal high-containment labs in the US, reforms our approach to overseeing federally funded research with high-risk pathogens, and protects American innovation against the efforts of our adversaries to steal our discoveries.“The historic success of Operation Warp Speed illustrated the importance of countermeasure research. Senators Hickenlooper, Braun, and Kaine worked to incorporate provisions to ensure access to virus samples to help bring tests, treatments, and vaccines to Americans in record time.“The FDA stood out as a success among our public health agencies, leaning heavily on its emergency authorities this committee provided.“This bill builds on that success, creating a new designated pathway for platform technologies to support the technologies we saw create life-saving vaccines and therapeutics, and a program to support advanced manufacturing technologies, an effort led by Senators Scott and Rosen. Senator Scott has also championed policies to encourage broader use of innovative and adaptive clinical trial designs, which are included in this bill.“Ultimately, we learned that countless lives were saved because of new and creative partnerships with the private sector. This bill preserves and encourages these partnerships, so that next time they are not stood up on the fly, but are established, well-oiled agreements with innovative partners.“My colleagues worked on many more provisions included in this legislation – all with the same preparedness focus for the threats of tomorrow. With this bill, Americans can rest assured that we will be ready with better tools, better partners, a stronger workforce, and more leadership, for the next threat that we will face.“I was pleased to also work with the Chair to authorize ARPA-H so that we establish a framework by which to advance breakthrough technologies that will revolutionize biomedical science. By partnering with innovators across sectors and fostering an environment where innovation is the norm, I hope that this will result in the discovery of platform technology to treat and cure many diseases.“Our manager’s amendment makes many important improvements to the bill we introduced last week and adds many of your important priorities to make this legislation stronger. I appreciate the work of you and your staff to make these improvements.“As we open this bill up for amendment and debate, I would like to ask my colleagues to resist the temptation to add legislation that is not related to preparedness policies to this bill. This legislation should stay focused on the important task at hand. “I look forward to working with you to continue to improve the bill both here in Committee and as we work to move the bill to the Senate Floor and to the House. My hope is that the President will be able to sign this bill into law as soon as possible. “Madam Chair, thank you for the long hours and hard work that have gone into this bill. What we are doing is important and reflects the best traditions of this Committee.“I thank the chair.”Background:Last year, Senators Burr and Murray announced their intent to begin bipartisan discussions to consider how to better prepare the nation for future public health emergencies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.On January 25, 2022, Senators Burr and Murray released their discussion draft on the Prepare for and Responded to Existing Viruses, Emerging New Threats, and Pandemics Act (PREVENT Pandemics Act). In the months since, the Committee has worked with Congressional colleagues, public health experts, and private sector leaders to further improve the legislation to ensure our preparedness and response framework remains forward-looking.On March 9, 2022, Senators Burr and Murray introduced the PREVENT Pandemics Act."

If enacted, the federal mandate would affect 84 million workers, regardless of whether or not they face occupational risks from COVID-19. As the Court notes, the Biden Administration is attempting to instate a broad public health requirement that far exceeds OSHA’s legal authority and historic precedent."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/1/ranking-member-burr-votes-to-advance-fda-commissioner-nominee-to-full-senate,"Today, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) held an executive session to consider the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to be the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and other nominees to fill vacancies at the Department of Labor and Department of Education.Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate HELP Committee, voted in support of Dr. Califf to serve as FDA Commissioner. The Senate HELP Committee reported Dr. Califf out of the Committee by a vote of 13-8.Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared statement for the record:“Good morning. Thank you, Chair Murray for holding this markup today.“I am pleased to vote to report the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf for Commissioner of Food and Drugs out of the HELP Committee so that the full Senate can consider his nomination as soon as possible.“The position of FDA Commissioner is one of the most significant public health positions in the federal government. “This nomination took too long to be made. The Biden Administration took over 10 months to make a decision on this critical public health nomination, but I’m glad that the Chair and I are on the same page of moving this nomination forward as quickly as we can. We’ve worked together every step of the way to make this process efficient, and I appreciate her efforts to get this done.“The FDA has regulatory oversight over one fifth of the United States’ consumer spending and touches the lives of every American. It serves as the international gold standard of safety and efficacy and companies around the world look to gaining FDA approval as a key component of their business strategy. “It is critical that we have effective and accountable leadership at the FDA, particularly as we continue to battle against the worst pandemic in over a century.“Dr. Califf brings nearly unparalleled experience to this role, and he will provide leadership at a time when we need it. I believe Dr. Califf is the right person to lead the FDA right now, and address the challenges facing the agency and those to come.“At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Califf committed that the pandemic response will be his first priority.“He will be responsible for maintaining FDA’s mission as we enter a new era of biomedical innovation and build upon successes that resulted in faster medical product development learned during this pandemic. “He has committed that he won’t take the agency backwards, that he will build on the success in modernizing and speeding up development and review that the FDA has done in the past two years.“He is supportive of helping to develop adaptable platform technologies that will move innovative products to patients more quickly.“He plans to address FDA’s systemic hiring challenges and prioritize improving the workforce at the agency to ensure it has the right scientists and experts to keep pace with biomedical technology and innovation.“Dr. Califf is up to the task of leading the FDA as Congress evaluates its human medical product user fee programs and considers their reauthorization. “Dr. Califf understands the importance of the accelerated approval pathway and its significance for patients who may gain access to a life-saving treatment faster.“He does not believe FDA has a role in evaluating the cost or price of a medical product. Dr. Califf is supportive of increasing competition in the marketplace to help lower the cost of drugs, including through more generic and biosimilar products.“He supports clarifying the diagnostic test regulatory landscape with a law that encourages innovation and provides a clear and predictable pathway to market for diagnostic tests.“I believe Dr. Califf will build on the successful lessons learned and progress made during the pandemic response over the last 2 years, and that he will continue to uphold FDA’s gold standard.“I’m pleased to be able to support his nomination.“I look forward to working with him as the next FDA Commissioner and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on his nomination.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/1/help-ranking-member-burr-statement-opposing-biden-labor-nominee-david-weil,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, opposed advancing the nomination of Dr. David Weil to serve as Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.The HELP Committee previously voted on Dr. Weil’s nomination in August 2021, but failed to favorably report the nomination on an 11-11 vote. The nomination advanced today on a narrow 11-10 vote, despite previous bipartisan opposition.                                  Senator Burr Statement for the Record:“I am opposed to the nomination of Dr. David Weil, and encourage my colleagues to oppose his nomination as well.“We are currently in the midst of some of the greatest economic uncertainty on jobs, inflation, and energy that this country has faced since the 1970s. Inflation surged to 7 percent in December, its highest rate in 40 years, thanks to extravagant and haphazard expenditure.  And despite profligate amounts of spending, Covid tests remain unavailable to a vast majority of Americans and schools remain closed to far too many students in need of academic and personal growth.  Inflation has reduced take home income and imposed a tax on the working class. “The Biden Administration has re-nominated Dr. Weil despite bipartisan opposition all last year. This is an individual who seems to have made it his life’s work to shackle innovation, burden small employers, and implement policies that harm workers. “As the old adage instructs, ‘if someone tells you who they are, believe them.’ And Dr. Weil has been telling us who he is throughout his career. As Administrator under the Obama Administration, he was the chief architect of the anti-growth policies and regulations resulting in one of the weakest periods of economic growth in history. Dr. Weil’s tenure at the Wage and Hour Division became notorious for burdening business with sweeping restrictions on the use of independent contractors, a new “joint employer” edict that imposed crushing operational and legal costs on small companies, and an overtime rule that blatantly ignored plain statutory text.  Dr. Weil has a clear record of hostility to franchising, independent contracting, and the gig economy-in short any business model innovative enough to fit in a modern economy.  These models provide flexible employment to millions, and are an engine of economic growth and mobility for many women and minority entrepreneurs.“As a tenured professor at Brandeis University, Dr. Weil scapegoated the franchise, supply-chain, and subcontracting industries for the creation of a so-called “fissured workplace.” Dr. Weil is on record asserting that the flexibility that comes with owning one’s business or participating in the gig economy is responsible for a lack of access to long-term career opportunities and worsening work conditions. As Administrator, he used government enforcement resources to target certain industries in order to lend credibility to his academic theories. One industry he seemed intent on targeting was the natural gas industry, a foreboding prospect as Americans face the certainty of higher heating costs this winter.“Dr. Weil took particular steps to sanction gas companies with punitive fines and liquidated damages. In a press release announcing enforcement measures against a natural gas company operating in West Virginia, Dr. Weil referred to the natural gas industry as “one of the most fissured industries” that is “ripe for noncompliance.” If confirmed, working Americans should be prepared for even greater heating costs this winter, as Dr. Weil uses government resources to intimidate, target and harass certain industries in accordance with his radical theories.“Dr. Weil has consistently scapegoated franchising, the primary engine of economic mobility for lower income families, for everything ailing the labor market. As Administrator Dr. Weil avoided even the most basic transparency in his actions. Instead of following the law to provide for notice-and-comment rulemaking or even soliciting feedback from stakeholders, Dr. Weil issued interpretation letters attempting to implement via executive fiat what he could not achieve by legislation, or even rulemaking. Dr. Weil used an interpretation letter to dramatically expand joint-and-several liability to franchisors that exert little to no direct control over the work rules of their franchisees. When asked by my staff why he failed to submit such controversial, substantively new enforcement policies to notice-and-comment rulemaking, Dr. Weil evaded. The real-life consequences of these policies  were calamitous, resulting in franchise businesses paying $33.3 billion a year in costs, a 93 percent increase in frivolous lawsuits, and the loss of 376,000 jobs over 2016-2018 according to the International Franchise Association.“Dr. Weil issued yet another edict to stakeholders all but obliterating the clear distinctions between an employee and an independent contractor. In 2020, nearly 30 percent of Americans were self-employed according to a Gallup survey.  Yet, Dr. Weil wants to destroy the ability for these Americans to work for themselves and set their own schedules. These actions stand in sharp contrast to the joint-employer and worker classification rules promulgated under the previous administration, which were finalized only after conducting rigorous economic impact analyses and soliciting comments from numerous stakeholders. As Americans continue to struggle in today’s economy, we cannot afford to confirm Dr. Weil.“Under Dr. Weil’s tenure, the Wage an Hour Administration promulgated a rule grossly overstepping its authority to set overtime eligibility.  A federal court later struck down the rule, noting in its opinion the brazenness with which the Wage and Hour Division failed to honor the plain language of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by supplanting FLSA’s command to consider workers’ job duties in addition to their minimum salary level. The results of such a misguided policy were stark: the Final Rule would have knocked salaried workers back to hourly wage earners, stripped them of their benefits, and prevented the advancement and economic mobility of those working to gain new skills. Thankfully the court stopped that from happening.“Additionally, serious questions have been raised about Dr. Weil’s work with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office regarding legal action against Uber and Lyft. At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Weil contended that disclosure of documents from his work with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office is dependent upon the Department of Labor. Yet despite numerous production requests of Dr. Weil’s documents and correspondence, the Department has thus far failed to comply with legitimate oversight requests. I am concerned such stonewalling and lack of transparency, stymying Congressional oversight, will continue if he is confirmed.“I urge all of my colleagues who value economic stability and job growth to vote against Dr. Weil’s nomination and tell the President to send us someone that can garner bipartisan support. I also wish to submit two documents to the record, one a letter from a coalition of independent business groups, and another from a taxpayer advocacy group, warning of the consequences of Dr. Weil’s nomination.“Thank you.” "
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/1/senators-burr-hickenlooper-introduce-bill-to-bolster-research-and-better-detect-prepare-nation-for-future-threats,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), and Senator John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Chairman of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, introduced the Early Countermeasure Discovery Act. This legislation will enhance the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) collaboration with academic institutions, research centers, and relevant government agencies to support the research and development of medical countermeasures for pathogens with pandemic potential.“Two years into this pandemic, it’s clear that early stage discovery of effective countermeasures to combat diseases that may cause a pandemic are critical to our nation’s safety,” said Senator Burr. “This is the time to prepare for the next potential threat. This legislation will help strengthen our medical countermeasure enterprise by improving our partnerships with the academic institutions researching and developing innovative products that target these threats. I’m proud to work with Senator Hickenlooper on this important initiative, as Senator Murray and I continue our work to craft effective, bipartisan solutions to address the gaps in our public health architecture.”“COVID-19 won’t be the last pandemic, but we can’t be caught off-guard again,” said Senator Hickenlooper. “Pandemic preparedness is possible, affordable, and irresponsible to ignore.”Background:The Early Countermeasure Discovery Act will direct the NIH to establish and support research programs with academic institutions to advance the discovery and preclinical development of medical products that target priority virus families and other dangerous pathogens of concern. Additionally, this legislation would improve the medical countermeasure research coordination between the NIH and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).On April 29, 2021, Senators Burr and Patty Murray (D-WA) announced their plan to develop bipartisan legislation to address the shortfalls in our nation’s federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.In this announcement, Senator Burr outlined key priorities, including strengthening our nation’s readiness within the medical countermeasure enterprise to ensure these medical products are rapidly identified and advanced through clinical development and manufacturing. The Early Countermeasure Discovery Act includes reforms to address these shortfalls experienced throughout the pandemic."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/1/senator-burr-demands-clarity-on-covid-19-strategy-amid-disastrous-shortage-omicron-surge,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), demanded answers from federal officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Administration’s COVID-19 communication failures and testing strategies as Omicron variant cases surge. Senator Burr questions federal officials on communication failures and testing strategies In today’s hearing, Ranking Member Burr called on the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Dawn O’Connell, to clarify the Administration’s plan to procure 500 million COVID-19 over-the-counter tests after they failed to anticipate the additional testing we need in the face of the Omicron variant: Senator Burr: “So, is what you’re telling me is that they’ve got 50 million tests in warehouses in the United States and all we did was access that inventory?”Dawn O’Connell, ASPR: “That is my understanding.”Senator Burr: “This is a very, very important piece. When you’ve got companies that don’t manufacture tests and all of the sudden we’re giving them $190 million contracts for about 14 million home tests and their expertise is the importation of vodka.”Senator Burr continued: “Right now, Ms. O’Connell is struggling to buy 500 million tests where 47-50 million there that leaves another 450 million to purchase. And we are going to distributors trying to buy their inventory, not going to manufactures trying to buy their capacity. Something is not right here, guys, on testing…I say to all of you now: ‘testing is broken.’”Senator Burr continued to press Ms. O’Connell on these shortage concerns and overall confusing messaging coming from the Administration:Senator Burr: “Well, I'm not sure you addressed my concern, which is it's more profitable to sell [tests] to the federal government than it is to put it on retail, based upon the reimbursements that this Administration has now required of insurers. I hope you'll think about that. This is alarming to me. And as we've all displayed, there are no tests out there. There are no tests on the shelves of [pharmacies] that people can go in, buy, and take home and do it. So, it makes even more confusing CDC’s policy that if you want to take a test, go ahead and take it. It's not required, but you can take it. You can’t get it.”Ranking Member Burr concluded his remarks by demanding greater transparency from federal officials on the billions of dollars appropriated by Congress for testing:Senator Burr: “I, for the life of me, can’t figure out after $82 billion…how you can let [test manufacturers] close two lines because there wasn’t any business. These are some of the most premiere manufacturers in the world that we’ve let get out of the mass manufacturing of home test business. If I'm wrong, tell me I am. I respect all four of you in a huge way, but I also express my disapproval very quickly. And that's what I'm doing today. Anything you want to add to that Ms. O’Connell?”O’Connell: “Let me just clarify, of course, that the initial contracts you're speaking of, towards the 500 million, were the available inventory that these distributors had. These are the distributor contracts. The manufacturer contracts are currently being worked, you will see that capacity come on quickly.”Senator Burr concluded: “We're here to support. What you need, tell us. But don't think that we're just going to sit here and print money without a full accountability of where it has gone. And, I hope the [HHS] Secretary is listening to [this] conversation today…There has got to be accountability on the money and the way it's spent.”Last week, Senators Burr and Blunt sent a letter urging HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra to detail the lack of a federal testing strategy despite Congress appropriating more than $80 billion for testing capabilities over the last two years. This request has still been unanswered.This is the Committee’s fifth hearing with federal officials on the COVID-19 pandemic in the 117th Congress. In his opening statement, Ranking Member Burr criticized the Administration’s lack of transparency to the American people, its inability to anticipate the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its communication failures as Omicron variant cases surge. To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here.Today’s full Senate HELP Committee hearing can be found here."

This is the Committee’s fifth hearing with federal officials on the COVID-19 pandemic in the 117th Congress.In his prepared opening statement, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate HELP Committee, criticized the Administration’s lack of accountability and transparency with the American people and highlighted its continued communication failures on testing, boosters, and masks. Senator Burr also questioned the Administration’s ability to anticipate and prepare for the next phase of this pandemic, despite billions of dollars Congress has appropriated for the federal response and recovery efforts over the last two years.Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement:“Thank you, Senator Murray. To our witnesses, welcome back.“Today is going to be a tough hearing, but the American people deserve accountability and transparency.“I appreciate that you all have cleared your schedules to allow for multiple rounds of questions today.“Next week marks one year of this Administration. It also marks two years since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the U.S.“President Biden said his first, second, and third priorities would be bringing us out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that his team would “shut down the virus.”“This administration was lucky. It started off on day one with the tools to change the trajectory of our COVID response.“Operation Warp Speed worked with the private sector to bring us groundbreaking vaccines and treatments – in record time.“Although we had a very bumpy start with testing early in the pandemic, we successfully built strong partnerships with the private sector to support the development and manufacturing of more tests.“State and local leaders were rising to the challenge of testing and vaccinating their citizens.“There was reason for hope.“Instead, now a full year later, here is where we are:“More than 830,000 deaths caused by COVID-19, the majority of which have occurred during this Administration, despite having many tools and significant resources from Congress, including $80 billion for testing.“A variant is now spreading out of control across the country, with places like Washington, D.C. seeing a staggering increase in case counts over the holidays, and now my state of North Carolina is following suit, with a 319 percent increase as of yesterday.“Over the holidays, when Americans were instructed to do the responsible thing and get a test to see their loved ones, there were no tests on the shelves or online, and hours-long lines were the norm at testing sites across the country.  The testing situation was worse when many sought tests to safely return to work and school.“And the most vulnerable Americans who contracted the virus could not get the treatments designed to help them because those are now in short supply, too.“This Administration has time and again squandered its opportunities and made things worse in the decisions you’ve made on testing and treatments and most crucially in communicating with the American people.“The American people are right to be confused when it seems like you all don’t even talk amongst yourselves.“Some examples:“Last August, the President announced that boosters would be available by the week of September 20th. Three of you signed that statement.“But neither the FDA nor the CDC had yet approved boosters when the President made that promise.“And when you went to your advisory panels with a predetermined outcome already made, those independent experts pushed back and ultimately had to be overridden to meet the President’s goal on boosters.“I know the data shows that boosters are necessary. I’m boosted myself. I want everyone to get vaccinated and boosted. The facts about the value of vaccines and boosters are crystal clear.“But the way this Administration rolled out boosters was a disaster. You created confusion, skepticism and mass confusion.“Example 2: Last summer, the President dramatically announced that CDC recommendations changed so that vaccinated Americans didn’t need to wear masks indoors, implying that the worst of the pandemic was behind us, even as the Delta variant was exploding in India.“Only after Delta hit America did the CDC begin to take it seriously, and the Administration had to change course.“Example 3: Last week, when Dr. Fauci said that the CDC was going to update its guidance on quarantine, he left the American people with the impression that CDC’s guidance was going to include a testing component to reduce the quarantine to five days.“But when the CDC did update its guidance there wasn’t a testing requirement.“Again, I’m not questioning the science. I’m glad you refrained from a testing mandate. But I’m questioning your communication strategies.“It’s no wonder the American people are confused.“When the President announced on December 21st that 500 million tests were going to be purchased, he left out that the contract wasn’t going to be signed for weeks, and it would take even longer for all of those tests to materialize.“Immediately, other experts and medical professionals were asking what the value of just one-and-a-half tests per person was when CDC’s own guidance says that you need multiple at-home tests to be assured of the results.“Yesterday, the Administration mandated that insurers now cover the 170 million Americans that are covered by private insurance. They must cover up to eight tests per person, per month. That would be 16 billion tests and we have 500 million today that are aspirationally contracted for.“It’s still unclear when these tests will be available, how to get them, and whether any more are on their way.“But it’s especially frustrating that the White House Press Secretary had previously mocked the very idea of doing what the President later announced. In a sarcastic and withering tone when this was first proposed, she had four questions: whether we should just send one to every American? Then what happens? How much does that cost? What happens after that?“Those are all good questions that remain unanswered by this Administration.“My final example, though there are many more to choose from, happened last week too.“The White House Press Secretary, a repeat offender in poor communication, was asked about boosters. The Press Secretary said, and I quote – ‘They can get boosted now, regardless of what the CDC guidance is, whether you were just approved for the booster or you were approved weeks ago.’ End quote“Regardless of what the CDC guidance is.“From the White House podium.“And then I was amazed when I got home Sunday and I had this letter from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services telling me that as a Medicare beneficiary that I’m eligible to get a free vaccine booster. Five months after the President announced we are going to have boosters, this is the first communication from CMS that I’ve gotten as a Medicare beneficiary in the two years of COVID. And, all the sudden I get a request to get boosted.“When the former president and his advisors were so cavalier about the CDC my friends on the other side of the aisle found it to be a national disgrace.“When a Republican governor or senator, including some on this committee, suggest concern about CDC guidance, Twitter and MSNBC can’t react fast enough with scorn and anger.“So, it can’t come as a surprise that there is confusion and anger when your own White House says to ignore the CDC guidance.“I tell my staff, as I’ve repeatedly said to you all in previous hearings, to look 30, 60, 90 days ahead.  Look six months ahead.  Look abroad and see what’s happening in Asia, Europe, Africa, Israel, the UK, and elsewhere around the world. What do we need to anticipate?“At our hearing on July 20th, I warned that Delta would not be our last variant and pleaded with each of you to have a plan in place for the next mutation of the virus.“So, why was the Vice President surprised that Omicron came to our shores?“I will say it very clearly, so that the Administration does not, yet again, say they are surprised: viruses change. Viruses mutate. There will be more variants. They will come to America. Period.“I don’t understand why, after tens of billions of federal dollars were given to you, this Administration has failed to ensure that Americans have the tests they need.“I don’t understand why suddenly it’s OK to take into account the economic and job impact of your guidance and recommendations.“You shortened the quarantine guidance because too many people would be out from work. Was that because of science or was it because you now know that lockdowns, shut downs, and school closures come with a significant downside impact?“You ask the American people to trust you, but you’ve lost that trust.“You need to earn it back.“I’ve asked you before: what’s the plan?“The Administration has not responded to my letters. Maybe folks at the White House think they don’t need to respond to Republican Senators, but I think my record shows that I’m approaching all of this as I have for 20 years. I’m trying to help you. I love this country and its people and I know we can do better.“You have to do better.“Maybe I’m wrong about this, maybe you’ll tell me where I got it wrong.“Instead, I’m hoping that you’ll understand that my criticism comes from a place of concern. Because your communication efforts are a mess and have only made things worse.“I’m at the end of my rope. I think you’ll see today that most of my colleagues are as well. I have tried to give my best advice and share what we hear and see, because no one is paying attention to the messages from the Administration now.“Maybe today you’ll respond to my request to learn what the plan is.“Hopefully, you’ll take this as a challenge to rebuild that trust. Not just with me, not just with my colleagues, but with the American people we all serve.“What are you changing and fixing to restore confidence with the American people that there is a strategy for testing, for treatments, for fixing your communications strategy.“Because if you don’t change, things will get worse before they get better.“I yield back.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2022/1/burr-foxx-press-biden-admin-for-clarification-on-unilateral-changes-to-public-service-loan-forgiveness-program,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, sent a letter again calling on U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to clarify the Department’s statutory basis for reforming the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.In October 2021, the Department of Education claimed it had executive authority to waive existing PSLF Program requirements created by Congress. On October 29, 2021, Senator Burr and Representative Foxx sent a letter to determine the Department’s rationale in its move to unilaterally change existing law and to request a briefing with Under Secretary James Kvaal and General Counsel Lisa Brown. Today’s letter is a follow up to their original oversight request.“When announcing these changes, the Department claimed a liberal reading of a statute to find the executive authority to move forward,” the letter states. “In light of this overtly political reading of the statute, we requested the production of various documents to understand the Department’s rationale for its decision and the supposed authority to change unilaterally statutory requirements prescribed by Congress.”“While the briefing with Mr. Kvaal was finally scheduled months after our request, your staff refused to include the General Counsel in that briefing,” the letter continues. “In further proof that Ms. Brown’s absence was detrimental to our oversight effort, when Mr. Kvaal was asked to provide a copy of the legal memorandum from [the Office of the General Counsel], Mr. Kvaal declined to provide a direct answer and asked that we submit this request in writing, despite this request being among the many that remain outstanding from the letter.”Click here to read the full text of the letter."

It does not appear to be because of lack of funding, but a more fundamental lack of strategy and a failure to anticipate future testing needs by the administration,” the senators wrote. “As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that Congress, and the American people, have an understanding of the administration’s strategy and accounting of how the Department is using taxpayer funding.”Click here to read the letter."

Ranking Member Burr also criticized Secretary Su’s role in failing to address the massive fraud within California’s unemployment insurance system and questioned whether Secretary Su has the skills to lead a larger department.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before Julie Su’s nomination hearing Key excerpts:“California is not a model to emulate for the country. “According the Bureau of Labor Statistics, California’s unemployment stands at 9%, the second highest in the country and has had one of the worst increases in unemployment over the last year of COVID.“The state has imposed some of the most onerous restrictions on businesses and individuals and has been one of the slowest to recover from the pandemic. California is also known for high taxes, and that applies both to individuals as well as businesses, and those rates aren’t likely to go down anytime soon considering the staggering amount of state liabilities on the state’s balance sheet.“The tax and regulatory burden weigh heavily on employers, and it is another reason why we are seeing businesses flee California in favor of states with more reasonable policies. Maybe that explains why so many companies are moving from California and bringing their jobs with them to North Carolina, Texas, and elsewhere.…“Turning to our nominee, you have a few challenges to gaining support for your nomination.“First, some of your friends have made it clear that they think you will be a shadow Secretary, when the role of Deputy Secretary is really that of a Chief Operating Officer…I hope you can convince the Committee that you understand the job you’ve been nominated for. I also hope you can demonstrate that you aren’t aiming to drag Mayor Walsh away from the sensible agenda he committed to pursuing when he was sitting where you now sit.“Second, and more importantly, I’m even more concerned about the failures and fraud in the California Unemployment Insurance system. California has suffered from some of the largest fraud in our nation’s history during the pandemic. Over $11 billion, perhaps as much as $30 billion, in fraud occurred in California’s unemployment system. Even death row inmates received unemployment checks.“What’s worse about the fraud committed on California and U.S. taxpayers is that it was entirely preventable.“It’s my understanding that an auditor made a series of recommendations just as you took office, specifically recommending that California exclude sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, from its identification system.“But nothing changed.“In fact, when the fraud was ramping up, and billions being stolen from taxpayers, California actually made things worse. You ordered the agency to eliminate some important safeguards to speed up payments, which led to even more fraud.“What’s worse is that California has received hundreds of millions a year, every year, over the past decade, in federal funds for administration of their unemployment systems, but no changes or improvements to those systems were made.“As we discussed yesterday, it is true that all states struggled, but California’s struggles swamp everyone. And none of their Secretaries of Labor are here today seeking a promotion.“So, while you may not be personally responsible for every case of fraud that happened, the fraud did happen on your watch.“Please help this Committee understand why that is an experience the Senate should reward with a promotion.“I’ll keep an open mind as we go through this hearing, and I appreciate you being willing to discuss these issues with us today.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full opening remarks, click here."

The Senators first introduced the bill in July 2020.“Western North Carolina is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the country,” said Senator Burr. “The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area is not only a stunning part of the country and culturally important, it is also a critical component of our state’s economy. It is vital that Congress take steps to preserve the rich history of this area to ensure visitors can continue to enjoy all that Western North Carolina has to offer for years to come. This legislation does just that by extending the program’s funding for the next 15 years.”“The Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountains were the most visited national parks in 2020, seeing more than 12 million visitors,” said Senator Tillis. “The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area, including the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains, means so much to North Carolina and everyone who visits. Equally, it is important to the Western North Carolina tourism industry, creating thousands of jobs and contributing billions of dollars to the local economy. We are so lucky to have this beautiful land in our great state, and I am proud to have worked with Senator Burr on this important legislation to extend this program to continue to preserve and develop the unique culture of Western North Carolina.”Background:The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area (BRNHA) was created by Congress in 2003 to preserve and develop the distinctive culture of Western North Carolina and South Appalachia. It includes North Carolina’s 25 western-most counties and two of the state’s most visited National Parks, the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.Since 2003, BRNHA has awarded 188 grants totaling over $2.4 million, with $5.7 million leveraged in matching contributions from local and private investments. Additionally, BRNHA supports more than 30,000 jobs and has an annual total economic impact of $2.39 billion.In 2017, Senators Burr and Tillis introduced legislation to extend the BRNHA authorization through 2021. This legislation was reintroduced last year and it was included in the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, which was signed into law on March 12, 2019.The Blue Ridge National Heritage Area (BRNHA) Reauthorization Act of 2021 will go one step further by extending BRNHA’s authorization through 2036. Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10) is leading companion legislation in the House of Representatives."

I applaud the Senate’s bipartisan support of this qualified nominee, and look forward to working with him in this new role.”“Michael Regan has a strong record of service to the state of North Carolina, earning a reputation for being a thoughtful, engaging, and well-qualified leader through his work with the EPA, the Environmental Defense Fund, and as Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to support Secretary Regan for Administrator of the EPA, which I conveyed last month when I had the honor to introduce him before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. I have no doubt he will do a great job and serve our country well.”Background:Secretary Michael Regan was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 66-34.Senators Burr and Tillis introduced Regan before his Senate confirmation hearing on February 3, 2021. Regan was confirmed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee by a vote of 14-6 on February 9, 2021.  Prior to being nominated by President Biden to serve as EPA Administrator, Regan served as Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality from 2017 to 2021. He also served at the EPA for nine years across a variety of policy positions. Regan is a proud North Carolinian, born and raised in Goldsboro, and a graduate of North Carolina A&T University.His nomination was supported by more than 20 of the largest agriculture organizations in the country."

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr urged the Committee to exercise its oversight responsibility by regularly holding COVID-19 hearings to receive updates from Administration officials on the nation’s ongoing response efforts.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr’s opening remarks before the Senate HELP Committee’s first coronavirus pandemic hearing this yearKey excerpts:“We must take stock of lessons learned from the response to the coronavirus pandemic and learn together to see what worked, what didn’t, and what needs to be done to be more prepared in the future.“We should be proud of the important laws and programs and policies we have worked together to create and fund, because so much of it worked exactly as we envisioned. FDA used its emergency use authority to get vaccines and therapeutics to Americans in record time, while maintaining the gold standard of safety and efficacy. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response coordinated with health care providers on the ground to ensure the sharing of critical information and supplies as quickly as possible during the response… Using BARDAs authorities, Operation Warp Speed developed and scaled manufacturing for multiple vaccines in record, life-saving time.“But we should also be humble enough to know that more needs to be done to be prepared for the future. I hope now that the partisan spending bill - that only had 5% of its funding dedicated to the public health portion of the COVID response and 1% of their massive spending bill dedicated to COVID vaccines - has passed, we can shift our attention back to working together.“As we start this thorough review process, it is important to remember that we are still in the midst of our current response. But the tools we have today look very different than where we started over one year ago, largely because of the authority we have given the executive branch. In May of last year, some experts were predicting that a vaccine could take years – in partnership with the private sector, we did it in ten months. Testing is now widely available, with the FDA announcing just last week the emergency authorization of another test that delivers results at home, thanks to the public private partnership and leadership from the NIH…and our state and local officials have led the charge in tailoring our response to their communities’ needs, as they should.“Alongside our successes, we must acknowledge our failures. At the beginning of the academic year, just 17 % of our nation’s schools had fully returned to in-person learning... Businesses are still closed…And, the tool we have to solve these urgent problems – a vaccine – should be reaching more Americans, faster… The CDC stated that we are averaging 2 million shots in arms per day – but this Administration has not updated its goal to reach 100 million shots in 100 days, which was already the trajectory when the President took office in January. Instead, we should set aspirational goals, like we did with the development of the vaccine, not easily attainable ones.“When we look at where we are in the response today, the data shows a significant decline in COVID cases and hospitalizations. I share this with my colleagues, not because we should let-up on our response, but because I believe we are at the greatest moment, right now, to learn from our progress and our failures. The time to capture the lessons we are learning is now, in real time, and not months down the road when case levels are low, attention spans shorten, and urgency fades.….“I’d like to set the expectation for all of us on the committee, on both sides of the aisle, that we should expect to hear from Administration officials on a regular basis just like we did with the last Administration, if not more often. They have an obligation to be open and transparent with Congress, and the American people about what they are doing, in real time, and I know all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in that request.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full opening statement at today’s hearing, click here."

Dr. Cardona brings with him the background, qualifications, and temperament needed to serve in this position at a very challenging time. I’m glad to be able to support his nomination today, and I look forward to working with him on these important initiatives.”On February 26, 2021, Senator Burr delivered floor remarks expressing his support of Dr. Cardona to serve as U.S. Secretary of Education. Dr. Cardona testified before the Senate HELP Committee on February 3, 2021, and was confirmed by the Committee by a vote of 17-5 on February 11, 2021."

The Senators first introduced the bill in September 2020.“Sixty-five years after his horrific murder and the acquittal of his killers, Emmett Till’s life and legacy continues to reverberate throughout this country,” said Senator Burr. “It is only right that we posthumously award the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to Emmett Till and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, in recognition of the grave injustices they faced and the indelible impact they left on America’s Civil Rights movement. I am proud to work with Senator Booker on this important effort as we celebrate Black History Month.”“The lynching of Emmett Till and the impunity that followed was wrenching in its horror, and revealed the persistence of racialized terror and violence waged against Black Americans across the United States,” said Senator Booker. “The courage his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, displayed in allowing the world to witness the unspeakable violence her son endured forced our nation to confront its collective failure to address the evils of racism and white supremacy. The Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor Congress can bestow, is a long-overdue recognition of Emmett and Mamie Till-Mobley’s legacy.”Background:In 1955, Emmett Till was kidnapped, beaten, and brutally murdered in Money, Mississippi while visiting his uncle, Moses Wright. Till’s murderers were acquitted despite Wright providing an eyewitness testimony that the men on trial kidnapped Till.Following Till’s death, his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, brought his body back to Chicago and demanded an open casket funeral with more than 50,000 attendees. Till-Mobley allowed a photograph to be taken of Till in his casket, which galvanized activists who were working for civil rights.Till-Mobley continued her work for justice in honor of her son. She created the Emmett Till Players, where teenagers traveled throughout the country presenting Martin Luther King, Jr. speeches. Additionally, Till-Mobley was the co-founder of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, which significantly impacted our justice system through pushing for the re-investigation of Till’s murder by the State of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Justice in 2004, and by working to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007, to ensure the Justice Department and FBI investigate civil rights era cold cases.In 2016, Senator Burr, along with Rep. John Lewis, led efforts in the Senate to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016, which was signed into law by President Obama on December 19, 2016."

Parents are at their wits end because many of the adults running public schools across our country are failing to actually follow the science. We should be seriously talking about reopening schools as quickly as possible. That's what the science tells us. And it's what students need.“When Dr. Cardona testified before the Senate HELP Committee, he stressed the need for students to get back in schools, and I'm glad that's now, finally, a bipartisan mission. At the same time, each school district, college, university, state, and local community faces different circumstances in dealing with this pandemic. Trying to treat them as a monolith, instead of providing flexible advice for states and localities to use if applicable and useful, would be a mistake. Dr. Cardona said he understands that one size fits all mandates from Washington won't work.“Dr. Cardona also agreed to be responsive to our oversight requests and to keep us updated on his plans and departmental actions. “We won't agree on everything, but we should be able to find places where we can agree. I support the nomination of Dr. Cardona and I look forward to working with him.”Dr. Miguel Cardona testified before the Senate HELP Committee on February 3, 2021, and was confirmed by the Committee by a vote of 17-5 on February 11, 2021."

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr underscored the importance of the Biden Administration filling the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the top advisor to the Secretary of HHS during public health emergencies.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the nomination hearing of Drs. Levine and MurthyKey excerpts:“Each of you have accepted nominations at an important time, when our country is facing one of the most challenging times in our history as we combat COVID-19… As Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Levine, you would be in charge of a range of health issues, including human research protections and research integrity.  As Surgeon General, Dr. Murthy, you would be responsible for providing Americans with the best scientific information and overseeing the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, both of which continue to be critical to the pandemic response.“But I am very concerned about a nomination that is not before us today, in fact it hasn’t even yet been made by the Biden Administration.“The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response – or the ASPR for short – is the top advisor to the Secretary of HHS during public health emergencies…We have before us the nominees for both the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General, but not their coordinator, the ASPR.“…While the words of this administration claim urgency in their response to COVID-19, their actions, or lack thereof, speak otherwise…the nominations before us today, while important, do not fill the role at the Department charged with leading an emergency response. This Administration claimed to be ready on ‘Day One’ but the fact that a nomination for the ASPR hasn’t yet been made, and no meaningful effort at consultation with Congress about filling that position, raises serious concerns. …“Dr. Levine, you have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 response in your home state of Pennsylvania, which faced great challenges with testing capacity early in the pandemic and vaccine rollout to this day… Along with the testing challenges from last spring, your state failed to adequately protect nursing home residents from the virus, and is making unacceptable mistakes in the vaccine distribution process. Pennsylvania ranks as one of the most dangerous states for long-term care residents battling COVID-19. “While you have stated that you relied on federal guidance for nursing home care during the pandemic, the tragically high mortality rate in your state’s nursing homes shows that more needed to be done, but wasn’t. “…At each step – testing, treatment, and now vaccination – your state’s response has fallen short. As the state’s health secretary, this track record reflects on your ability to meet the challenges that would come across your desk immediately, should you be confirmed for this role.…“[Dr. Murthy]… I worry about your ability to separate political influence from your ability to communicate health care decisions. In fact, you spoke at the Democratic National Convention – a wholly political event – just a few months ago.“As Co-Chair of the transition team’s Coronavirus Taskforce you said that the President’s goal of 100 million vaccinations by 100 days was ‘doable,’ lowering expectations for an accomplishment well within our reach today. Before President Biden took office our country was already vaccinating 900,000 people a day and had administered over 20 million shots. I’m in politics, so I know lots of people try to lower expectations in order to look like they are accomplishing something when they are simply showing up, but the Surgeon General has to be trusted on the facts… The American people deserve a Surgeon General who will separate fact from fiction and level with us on the science.“Strong leadership will continue to be an absolute necessity through this phase of the pandemic response, and I will use my time today to get an answer to the question of ‘who is in charge?’”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full opening remarks delivered at today’s hearing, click here."

Members of Congress are granted security clearances because they become Members of Congress. It’s automatic. Members of Congress do not become subject matter experts just because they are Members of Congress. Just because they sit on a committee that has health responsibilities.“I’ve said often that I think you could count on both hands and both feet the number of Members of Congress that can actually understand the health care system in America. I may be wrong, but I think I’m right.“So, it doesn’t automatically give you expertise because we serve on this committee. So, I’m concerned at this time in Congress. As the Attorney General sits before us I’ll say what I’ve said to him privately. I’m not sold yet. I’m not sure that you have the necessary experience or skills to do this job at this moment. I’m not sure that you have the appropriate respect for the private sector, and innovation, and intellectual property needed to bring more exciting treatments and cures to save lives in this country.“General, you have an opportunity today and tomorrow in public hearings to prove that that expertise is there. I told you I would remain open for this hearing and tomorrow’s Finance [Committee] hearing…But I do come with an open mind and now the job is up to you.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement at today’s nomination hearing, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/2/senator-burr-statement-on-vote-to-convict-former-president-trump-on-article-of-impeachment,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) voted in favor of convicting former President Donald J. Trump on the article of impeachment presented against him. After the Senate vote, Senator Burr released the following statement:“January 6th was a grim day in our nation’s history. The attack on the U.S. Capitol was an attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and overrule the will of the American people through violence, intimidation, and force.“Seven lives were tragically lost as a result of that day. Law enforcement officers, outnumbered and overwhelmed, sustained debilitating injuries as they bravely defended Congress against an angry mob. We now know that lawmakers and congressional staff came dangerously close to crossing paths with the rioters searching for them and wishing them harm.“When this process started, I believed that it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office. I still believe that to be the case. However, the Senate is an institution based on precedent, and given that the majority in the Senate voted to proceed with this trial, the question of constitutionality is now established precedent. As an impartial juror, my role is now to determine whether House managers have sufficiently made the case for the article of impeachment against President Trump.“I have listened to the arguments presented by both sides and considered the facts. The facts are clear.“The President promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election because he did not like the results. As Congress met to certify the election results, the President directed his supporters to go to the Capitol to disrupt the lawful proceedings required by the Constitution. When the crowd became violent, the President used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault.“As I said on January 6th, the President bears responsibility for these tragic events. The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a coequal branch of government and that the charge rises to the level of high Crimes and Misdemeanors. Therefore, I have voted to convict.“I do not make this decision lightly, but I believe it is necessary. “By what he did and by what he did not do, President Trump violated his oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.“My hope is that with today’s vote America can begin to move forward and focus on the critical issues facing our country today.”"

By marking March 29th as Vietnam Veterans Day, we have the opportunity to show our gratitude for those who bravely served their country and to demonstrate that we will not forget their service.”“West Virginia is one of the most patriotic states in the country and we know all too well the sacrifices that come with protecting our country,” said Senator Manchin. “West Virginia has more names on the Vietnam Wall memorial per capita than any other state in the nation and many of our Veterans served in Vietnam. I am proud to join Senator Burr in leading this resolution to recognize March 29, 2021 as Vietnam Veterans Day to honor the selfless service of these brave Veterans and remember the sacrifices they made to keep us safe.”On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act. This legislation designated ‘National Vietnam Veterans Day’ as a national holiday to be recognized on March 29th. Senators Burr and Manchin’s resolution ensures the Senate joins the nation in commemorating this day.The full text of the resolution is available here."

Additionally Ranking Member Burr underscored the importance of maintaining flexibility as part of the nation’s emergency response and leveraging new technology to better analyze, prepare for, and respond to the next public health emergency.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the Committee’s third coronavirus hearingExcerpts:“The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minority populations, people in rural areas, and others has revealed cracks in our health care system that persist despite efforts to improve care... This pandemic has given us another perspective on these challenges and demonstrates a need to redouble our work to address the underlying problems facing these and other affected populations. Each response requires the ability to identify the problems local communities will face, strong leadership to recognize the best solutions, and an ability to leverage the right approaches and technology to execute those changes.“With each emergency response, we learn about the ways each threat affects Americans differently and have adjusted our laws and plans accordingly. That is why we designed a response framework that is flexible – you never know quite how a new infectious disease or a natural disaster may impact us until it is on the ground and we are forced to respond. For example, during the last PAHPA [Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act] reauthorization, Senator Casey and I included new advisory committees to identify the specific needs of our seniors and Americans with disabilities during emergencies…“We have also made changes to the PAHPA statute to improve the development of countermeasures to meet the needs of different populations, and made sure we wrote it in a way that allowed maximum flexibility to respond to effected populations.“This virus has also compounded existing challenges that many communities—including rural, racial and ethnic minority, and low-income populations—face.  These differences underscore the importance of maintaining flexibility as part of a public health response so that the state and local government can most effectively reach those in their communities most at risk for a particular public health threat.“The novel coronavirus has again shown us that we cannot fully anticipate the ways in which a threat will affect different communities across the country. We have utilized new technologies throughout the response to better understand just how the virus takes its toll and to do something about it. The FDA has provided greater flexibility in clinical trial design, working with drug developers to enhance enrollment in clinical trials in ways that reach more communities by deploying remote technology that allows for patient monitoring without traveling to a major hospital. Manufacturers have gotten creative with targeting their trials to those who stand to benefit the most from a drug, with one developer creating mobile units to bring their COVID therapeutics directly to nursing homes as soon as they found an outbreak of the virus.  Mobile health units have also been deployed to bring testing and vaccines to areas that need these countermeasures, and partnerships with historically black colleges and universities improved outreach to racial and ethnic minority populations on testing, participation in clinical trials, and providing information on vaccines and ways to prevent COVID-19.“Now, as we look toward the weeks and months ahead, this ingenuity needs to continue. Our response efforts must leverage technology to improve our surveillance capabilities and inform our public health decision making. And, our policies should encourage the incorporation of new technology, strategies, and partnerships to solve old problems and challenges.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here.

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/3/ranking-member-burr-supports-deputy-secretary-of-education-nominee-urges-democrats-to-follow-suit-despite-historical-practice-,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held its nomination hearing for Cindy Marten to serve as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education.In his prepared opening remarks, Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) highlighted Ms. Martin’s experience in elementary and secondary education and underlined the importance of having experience in the higher education system, especially as federal student loan debt has taken on a new urgency. Additionally, Ranking Member Burr noted his Democrat colleagues’ abandonment of their “guilty until nomination” practice that was frequently used against nominees under the previous Administration. WATCH: Ranking Member Richard Burr delivers opening statement before the nomination hearing of Cindy MartenExcerpts:“Ms. Marten, you have been nominated to serve as Deputy Secretary of Education… “Your experience as a teacher and principal and, since 2013, as superintendent of the San Diego Unified School District, which annually receives millions of dollars for various federal K-12 programs, certainly gives you experience implementing a number of programs that ultimately report into the Deputy Secretary’s office. “You might be the best possible nominee for Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education in the history of the agency. However, your record as superintendent highlights some challenges you’ll have should you be the Deputy.“In particular, you appear to have little or no experience working in a higher education system or institution, working on higher education policy, or managing a large student debt portfolio. I recall several questions to officials in the last Administration about their experience managing a $1 trillion student loan program so I assume that those questions will be asked of you today…“So, despite any reservations, I believe your passion for education and helping students learn will enable you to succeed in the position of Deputy Secretary of Education. I very much want you to succeed, I’m inclined to support your nomination, and want to extend to you an offer to provide whatever assistance I and my staff can to help you.   “Having said that, I would also like to point some things out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle because I firmly believe that if Ms. Marten were a Republican or was being nominated by a Republican President, they would be lined up in opposition against you. “First, I don’t believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would support a Republican nominee who was superintendent of a school district with large disparities on how minority and white students were disciplined…“I don’t believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would support a Republican nominee whom disability advocates claimed has been, and I quote, ‘difficult to deal with in terms of transparency and sharing information with families of students with special needs as Disability Rights California claimed about you’…“I [also] think my colleagues would vigorously question a Republican nominee who oversaw a school district where top level administrators were trained on how to delete emails from the public record, in violation of state public records law, as local news reports have claimed occurred in your school district…“Finally, I can picture the letter demanding testimony from the local NAACP not only publically opposed their nomination, but stated the nominee has, and I quote, ‘been an ineffective leader of California’s second largest school district’ and are ‘ill-equipped for the tremendous responsibility of serving the needs of your entire nation’s young learners’…“So, I’m glad to see that my Democratic friends have abandoned their guilty upon nomination stance that they have taken for the past four years, and I hope they will reflect on the damage they did to the Senate by unceasingly opposing any and all nominees basically just because they accepted a nomination from the last President.“Ms. Marten, I hope you take this opportunity to help the Committee understand why your background, experience, and record of work merit a promotion. And I hope you are able to convince my Democratic friends that they should support you as well.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening remarks, click here."

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr stressed the need for payment models, in both public and private health care programs, that can keep pace with new products coming to market and increase Americans’ accessibility to life-saving therapies and cures.Excerpts:“The drug pricing debate has been underway in the Senate for many years, with numerous bipartisan proposals put forward during the 116th Congress. But, I would like to remind my colleagues that the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered these debates, showing us in Congress, Americans, and those around the globe the undertaking associated with biomedical research, and the importance of fostering an environment that rewards and stimulates innovation so we can bring treatments, therapies, and vaccines to market in as timely a manner as possible.“I agree with my colleagues that the cost of medications is an issue that deeply affects Americans, and our payment models in public and private health care programs must keep pace with the new products that come to market. The new ways in which we are able to address devastating diagnoses that, at one time, had no options for care are only as good as the ability for Americans to access them.“The novel coronavirus pushed the American biomedical research enterprise to the brink of what few thought would be possible – three authorized vaccines in ten months. Not only were these vaccines brought through large-scale phase 3 trials, but they were made available to the American people immediately upon their authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This availability was made possible through the foundational laws that streamlined the process for making these life-saving drugs available to the American people…“This hearing comes at a moment when every American stands to benefit from the efforts of the biomedical research community. We have three authorized vaccines to combat COVID-19, multiple medicines to reduce hospitalizations and deaths, and hundreds of tests to detect the virus.“As we examine our policies and programs that affect the costs of medications in the United States, we must balance the changes that we propose against the affects that they will have on the ability for our developers to innovate. America’s ability to respond to the everyday health care challenges we face, as well as the next public health threat in the future will impacted by this balance. If we do not get it right, we will not have the countermeasures, medicines, and technologies we have today to save as many lives as possible, and that cost, would be too high.”You can read Senator Burr’s complete statement as submitted for the record here."

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr highlighted the successful policies and programs that enhanced America’s response efforts, such as the laws allowing for Emergency Use Authorization and Operation Warp Speed. Ranking Member Burr pressed these officials to apply this framework in addressing the nation’s next set of public health challenges.WATCH:  Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the Committee’s first coronavirus hearing with federal officialsExcerpts:“Continuity will be critical as we work through the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and move into the next phase of our response and, hopefully, our recovery.“America needs to reopen our schools, reopen our businesses, and open up to global commerce. The actions taken by each of your offices affect these goals.“This pandemic has shown us, very clearly, how we can better prepare for the next threat, and that is by being a better partner to the private sector.…“Dr. Walensky, I am going to start with you because you have the hardest job ahead of you. The bottom line is that there is a clear and compelling need for significant reform at the CDC. Your agency is responsible for communicating to Americans, based on facts, how to return to some form of normalcy, but the guidance documents coming out of the CDC have been two steps behind the data.“As I mentioned, your best tool to keep pace with the science is the private sector. Let me be blunt: CDC’s go-it-alone mentality on testing was arrogant and wrong. Let me propose a solution based on the success that Dr. Hahn at the FDA led last year: lean on your private sector partners – commercial labs, academic centers, and large-scale test makers…“The same is true of your surveillance systems… We need a layered surveillance system, in partnership with the private sector, states, and local public health experts to get a true picture of the threats on the ground. The COVID relief packages have given CDC billions of dollars to modernize these systems. CDC must not hoard that money for yourselves, instead use these funds to identify technologies that better equip us.…“Dr. Fauci – welcome back. You and I have worked on these issues together for more than two decades. A lot of what we built worked. The NIH recognized the importance of technology, leveraging existing clinical trial and research networks, extending partnerships with the private sector… Now, the challenge will be for your center, along with the other institutes and centers at the NIH, to maintain this pace, and apply it to the next challenge or set of health care challenges in the future. Voices at the NIH will be important in determining how can we expand, solidify, and maintain this public-private approach to the biggest health care issues facing our country.…“Dr. Marks, this is where you, and your efforts at CBER come in. The pandemic has broken the model at the FDA, and the agency should not go back to its historical approach. Dr. Hahn used his emergency authorities exactly how we envisioned the FDA using them. In my mind he, you, and the dedicated professionals at the FDA are the unsung heroes of the federal response… Now, as the makers of these products – vaccines, tests, and treatments – apply for full approval, the agency should take this opportunity to use real world information to inform their review, and I hope that you take advantage of the unique opportunity you have here.“Each medical product center at the FDA can apply their practices during the pandemic to the applications that come across reviewer’s desks. We can accelerate development to the benefit of patients here in the United States, and around the world for more than just COVID but for cancer, diabetes, and more.…“Dr. Kessler, you were serving as FDA Commissioner when our first conversations about pandemic preparedness began. Now, you are in a position to help use those authorities to their fullest extent. Operation Warp Speed has used NIH’s expertise in early research, BARDA’s contracting, advanced development and manufacturing capabilities, and the [Department of Defense’s] logistical muscle to achieve scientific breakthroughs that can rescue the world from this virus. Operation Warp Sped was a huge success and I’m glad that you are planning on building on that success going forward.“Warp Speed showed us where some of our gaps in countermeasure development existed. We need ways to rapidly identify candidates for tests, treatments and antivirals, and vaccines. This is an area primed for partnership with academia and especially the private sector. We also learned that our manufacturing capabilities came up short. But we saw a remarkable thing when private sector drug makers partnered with their competitors to make more vaccine.…“Now, one year into the pandemic, even as the vaccine offers hope that the return to normal will continue and speed up, the offices and responsibilities that each of you hold will become more challenging. Not only will you be required to maintain the pace and urgency of our current response, but to begin to change the architecture of our public health agencies. The novel coronavirus has irreversibly altered our ability as the federal government to interact with innovators that bring real solutions to the greatest health care challenge in generations. Do not take this moment for granted. Strengthen the relationships and partnerships that have been established during the response. Take stock of the needs that still exist, and how partnerships like these can help to address them.”Last week, the Senate HELP Committee held its first hearing of the year focused on the response to the coronavirus pandemic with state and local officials.

Senator Burr released the following statement after voting against Mr. Becerra’s confirmation: “The Department of Health and Human Services deals every day with our nation’s most difficult and complex challenges,” said Senator Burr. “Leading a federal agency of this size and scope requires sound subject matter expertise and experience navigating comparable organizations. I’m concerned that Mr. Becerra lacks the experience needed to address these critical issues during this unprecedented moment. In addition, Mr. Becerra hasn’t proven that he has the appropriate respect for private sector innovation, which has been such an important factor in developing multiple effective coronavirus vaccines at a historic rate.“For these reasons, I have opposed Mr. Becerra’s nomination. I plan to conduct rigorous oversight as we identify the gaps in our preparedness, response, and recovery framework. It is my hope that Mr. Becerra will listen to and work with both sides of the aisle as we begin to address these public health challenges.” Background: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra testified before the Senate HELP Committee on February 23, 2021, and testified before the Senate Finance Committee on February 24, 2021.During Mr. Becerra’s confirmation hearing before the Senate HELP Committee, Ranking Member Burr expressed his concerns regarding Mr. Becerra’s lack of experience in the health care sector, especially as the nation continues to respond to the public health challenges of the pandemic.On March 3, 2021, the Senate Finance Committee considered advancing Mr. Becerra’s nomination to the full Senate. The Committee voted 14-14, leaving it to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to advance the nomination.

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/3/burr-king-renew-bipartisan-effort-to-reform-student-loan-repayment-programs,"Today, Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Angus King (I-ME) reintroduced the Repay Act, bipartisan legislation to reform federal student loan repayment programs. This legislation simplifies and streamlines the current repayment programs by establishing two, easy-to-navigate repayment plans: a fixed, 10-year repayment plan and a single, simplified income-driven repayment option.“The rise in federal student loan debt has been a cause for concern for years, but the issue has taken on a new urgency given the economic challenges of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Senator Burr, Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. “As the American economy begins to recover, it’s more critical than ever that Congress address the current, overly-complicated student loan repayment system and propose simpler, more effective solutions. “That’s why Senator King and I are reintroducing the Repay Act, a commonsense, bipartisan solution with two key goals. First, it simplifies the repayment process by establishing two repayment plan options that are easier to navigate and more predictable for students and their families. Second, it limits the number of taxpayer-funded subsides, which incentivize over-borrowing and drive up program costs. Although much more needs to be done to address the underlying factors of increased student loan debt, this commonsense, bipartisan bill is a sustainable policy change that promotes fiscal responsibility and helps borrowers determine which system works best for them.”“The coronavirus pandemic’s economic effects destroyed millions of jobs across the nation, compounding the financial worries of Americans who are working to pay back their student loans,” said Senator King. “In the face of these added pressures, it is more important than ever that Congress acts to simplify the loan repayment process for the students who borrow money to invest in their futures. Our bipartisan bill establishes two clear repayment plans, helping students better understand the choices, evaluate which option is right for them, and make payments at a realistic level. This legislation will make the repayment process easier, and should be considered as part of the federal government’s work to address the challenges posed by America’s student debt crisis.”Background:Currently, student loan borrowers have multiple federal student loan repayment plans from which to choose. This maze of options often leaves students confused about the plan that best fits their needs. Over the last decade, updated eligibility terms and new, added programs have further complicated the process. As a result, taxpayer dollars have been misdirected to subsidize borrowers who do not need additional assistance.The Repay Act is a commonsense solution to make loan repayment more affordable to the middle-class by removing duplicative repayment options, streamlining eligibility terms, and ensuring borrowers never direct more than 15 percent of their discretionary income to their loan payments. Additionally, this legislation ends the disproportionate subsidization of loan payments for high income borrowers and sets limits for the amount of debt that can be forgiven over a certain amount of time.Significantly, this legislation is estimated to save taxpayers billions of dollars over the next decade.The Repay Act is supported by the Bipartisan Policy Center Action and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Senators Burr and King previously introduced this legislation in 2015 and 2017.To read more about the Repay Act, click here."

I believe that the most important action we can take to help people is to reopen as much of our country as quickly and safely as possible. “Bring hope back to Americans. Let neighbors celebrate birthdays and milestones, and let students see and interact with their peers. “My state of North Carolina has taken important steps in this process, announcing plans to lift COVID restrictions on June 1, if our metrics continue to show progress against the virus. “Vaccination rates are a key metric. “We have got to look at the next few weeks and months down the road to address the next phase of the response – getting more shots into arms.“The return of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is an important part of that, and I am glad that the CDC and FDA finally reaffirmed the safety and efficacy of that shot. But I worry that the ham-handed way they handled this has led to even more vaccine hesitancy. “Americans should all know that the benefits of using this vaccine far outweigh its potential risks.“Now, with 37 percent of adult Americans vaccinated, we are seeing the demand slow. “So, painting a picture of the benefits of all three vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson, will be important in driving down our infection rate and improving our chances for recovery. “Getting people back to work is a big part of that picture. And we can’t do that until children are back in daycare and school.“The reopening of our restaurants, ballparks, and small businesses mean more opportunities for Americans to return to activities they love, but it also means more jobs, and more opportunities to restore livelihoods. “We invited the witnesses here with us today because they have seen the mental health effects of the pandemic and the response in their communities first hand. But also, because they have raised their hands with local solutions. “I look forward to hearing more about those solutions today and how they can help to accelerate our country’s broader recovery from COVID.“Our message, and the message of this administration, should be that we will have teachers and students safely back in the classroom this fall, that main street is open, Thanksgiving plans are on the books, and that this summer, you can attend a baseball game – even if things look a little different.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here.

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr underscored the importance of prioritizing parents’ choice and state flexibility in any meaningful, bipartisan child care solution.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before Committee hearing on strengthening the nation’s child care sectorExcerpts: “Americans can’t work if they don’t have safe and reliable child care for their family. “I hope rather than a partisan reconciliation process that you and I can listen to each other’s ideas and work together on meaningful legislation that stabilizes and strengthens child care and respects and honors parent choice in the care of their young children. “I remain committed to seeking workable, bipartisan policy solutions on child care. …“I first want to highlight and thank child care providers as the one education sector than never abandoned working parents and their kids during COVID.“Child care understood that, even in a pandemic, many jobs can’t be done remotely, and that parents have to have a safe and reliable place to leave their children so that they can work…“While COVID stay-at-home orders forced many Americans to work from home, nurses, EMTs, firefighters, grocery store clerks, and all other essential workers had to be on time each and every day and not be distracted. Child care understood this. “Throughout the entire pandemic, child care stayed open to care for the children of other essential workers. For almost a year before schools, and their unions, even got around to figuring it out, child care implemented numerous enhanced health and safety protocols that by and large, even in the absence of vaccines, kept children and staff safe.“And when K-12 closed its doors to students, child care, in addition to caring for children birth to five, opened up for the school age children who needed a safe and supported place to do their online learning.“A key lesson learned from COVID-19 is that K-12 has a great deal to learn from child care.…“Even before the pandemic, providers were operating on razor thin margins. Additional staff and supplies to implement health and safety protocols, on top of recurring fixed costs and in an environment of significantly reduced enrollments, ensured that every day child care remained open it was operating well into the red. “In the last year, in three different bills, Congress has provided approximately $50 billion in emergency child care funding to stabilize providers financially so that as parents return to work child care is available to them. “As of today, we have limited to no insight from HHS as to how states plan to use the majority of these dollars and what affect these dollars are having on providers being open and parents being able to find and afford reliable care that meets their needs.“As we look to build a stronger child care sector for the future, I think understanding how this incredible influx of new dollars is being used will be critical. “We also need to understand how the flexibilities given to states to support both parents and providers during the pandemic might best be continued on an ongoing basis.“We need to continue to allow states to more quickly respond to the unique needs they see on the ground rather than waiting for a national emergency or the hopes of a reauthorization happening on time.“Most critical, however, is that we understand parent wants and needs for child care going forward. I cannot say it enough – parent choice and flexibility are paramount.“Parents, not government, know their children best. Whatever we do in child care policy we must respect and support parents’ choices.“As we look to improve access, affordability, and quality in child care and stabilize and better support a labor intensive, thin margin industry, we must do so in ways that build up the things we have right – respecting parents’ choices in the care of their young children through a rich and diverse mixed delivery system.To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here.

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/4/sens-burr-tillis-reintroduce-lumbee-federal-recognition-bill-,"Today, Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) reintroduced the Lumbee Recognition Act, legislation to grant long-overdue federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.“For more than 130 years, the Lumbees have sought the same federal recognition that other tribes across the nation enjoy,” said Senator Burr. “This federal recognition will help the Lumbee people not only improve their economy, but enhance their health care systems and schools.“Despite broad bipartisan support of this legislation over the last three decades, Congress has yet to act on this important bill. This has been a grave disservice to the Lumbee people and the rich culture the tribe contributes to North Carolina. It’s time to get this done. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass this bill.”“The Lumbee Tribe has been fighting for more than a century to gain federal recognition and, as long as I’m in the U.S. Senate, I’m going to continue my work to make sure this happens,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to co-introduce this legislation again and continue my work with Senator Burr to get this legislation across the finish line.”Background: The Lumbee Tribe is the largest American-Indian tribe in the Eastern United States. In 1885, North Carolina formally recognized the Lumbee Tribe. Three years later, the Tribe began to seek federal recognition. In 1956, Congress finally passed legislation recognizing the tribe, but the bill included an unfair caveat that denied the Lumbee benefits that every other federally-recognized tribe receives.Senator Burr has been an unwavering advocate of the Lumbee Tribe. In 2007, Senator Burr first introduced the Lumbee Recognition Act and has since testified multiple times before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on the tribe’s qualifications and unjust treatment.The Lumbee Recognition Act has broad bipartisan support. In October 2020, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump announced their support of federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe. Since 1988, legislation to federally recognize the Lumbee Tribe has been introduced in Congress 29 separate times – 15 times by a Democrat and 14 times by a Republican.Representatives G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), Dan Bishop (R-NC), David Price (D-NC), and Richard Hudson (R-NC) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives on April 22, 2021."

Ranking Member Burr also highlighted the valuable role of the private sector, academia, and global collaboration in maintaining America’s leadership in biomedical innovation.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening statement before Committee hearing on protecting American investment in biomedical researchExcerpts:“From where I sit now, and how I spend my time, I want to impress upon my colleagues here today – this threat is real, it is credible, and it is dangerous to our way of life in America.“We cannot be complacent.“This hearing is about the efforts of foreign actors to influence the biomedical research enterprise.“The Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party are the most sophisticated perpetrators, but other foreign actors are also engaged in efforts to subvert our biomedical research. “Our adversaries are engaging in a systematic effort to infiltrate the academic research community and siphon away the results of United States spending on biomedical research...“Our enemies are targeting vulnerabilities in our biomedical research enterprise because it is an easy target...This means that our advancements in biomedical research are at grave risk. It means that the billions of taxpayer dollars that are invested each year toward discoveries are leveraged or outright stolen by our adversaries. And, it means that our enemies can capitalize on the billions of dollars that American taxpayers invest every year to beat us to the punch on the next game-changing technology to save lives or to cause unimaginable harm.…“This year, Congress appropriated 43 billion dollars to the NIH for biomedical research.  And we know that over time, for every one dollar spent on basic research at the NIH, the private sector spends about eight dollars. “That’s a lot of money, and the United States has historically been the undisputed leader in biomedical innovation, so it’s easy to see why the government of China is trying to steal our secrets and eliminate our competitive advantage. “Global collaboration has been, and will always be, the key to our success in maintaining global leadership in our advancements... “So, we must think about how to foster greater innovation at home, mitigate potential risks associated with foreign influence, and maintain our edge.“Because deception and theft are not a valid competitive tool, and we need to be aware that this is happening more than we’d like to admit.“I made this case for Five Eyes partners, the intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to tackle the issue of 5G for our cellular technology, and I think it also makes sense when we discuss our funding and advancements in biomedical research.…“North Carolina benefits each year from over $1 billion in NIH-funded research. “Along with their accomplishments and discoveries, our research institutions have seen firsthand what our enemies will do to steal our most valuable secrets and assets in research. “There is a concerted effort by individuals from China, backed by their government, to be educated in America and to work for 10 years here, with the full intent to bring back to China’s government everything they can learn, store, or steal.“I have cautioned the research institutions in my state to prepare for a reality with different revenue streams, and encouraged them to rely less on researchers from the countries whose governments seek to do us harm. “We must balance the rewards of this research with the risks to our country. …“This threat reaches into many facets of our country.“The private sector is also experiencing this threat, and our solutions to these issues will require their input, participation, and partnership.“There is no easy path, but if we concede the innovation race, our global competitiveness and our national security will be at risk.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full opening statement, click here. "

As part of that plan, we need to make sure we have better systems in place that are equipped to connect job-seekers, employers, and education opportunities... “As we begin these discussions on how best to help American workers get the skills they need, we have to look at what we have already done and what new ideas we need to include. “We can start with the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. This is our country’s primary law focused on workforce development, and it’s due to be reauthorized. We need to take this opportunity to see how this important law can be updated to meet the needs of workers and employers…“We need to be innovative. More bureaucracy and paperwork is not the answer. We have to look at the system as a whole and make sure it is equipped to meet the demands of 2021 and beyond…“If we want these programs to prepare people for good jobs, employers need to have a seat at the table. If training programs do not teach anyone the skills employers are actually looking for then we haven’t really helped anyone.“We need to make sure that this law fosters strong collaboration between the public and private sector... “Last year, state and local workforce boards had to respond to the pandemic and quickly adapt to a world where virtual services are the norm. These systems should be able to rapidly respond to meet the needs of their community, and we need to make sure that the law supports this responsiveness.... “The apprenticeship model is a great way for individuals to earn a wage while learning an in-demand skill. Unfortunately many employers are unable to access the federal system because of red tape and rules that favor labor unions.“We saw a glimpse of the type of innovation we need through the Department of Labor’s rule on Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs that was issued by the previous Administration. This policy can expand the apprenticeship model to include more industries and provide new opportunities for training.“To build on this idea, a bipartisan apprenticeship bill will need to find a way to support both traditional registered apprenticeship programs and programs that are developed and recognized by industry.“I understand that there are important conversations to be had about accountability and quality for industry recognized apprenticeship programs, and we welcome that.“We need all the tools in our toolbox to get people back to work – an ‘all of the above’ approach. But that does not mean we need to create a variety of new programs. “The federal government already funds dozens of training programs across multiple federal agencies. We need to take a look at how we can improve and better align these programs, not just add a new layer of programs and mandates, so that state and local leaders, employers, and job seekers can reap the maximum benefits.“Workforce development has been and should continue to be a space for bipartisan solutions.…“This is just the beginning of the conversation. We all have a big task ahead of us.“I look forward to working with our witnesses, Chair Murray, and our colleagues to get our workforce programs up to speed and our country back to work.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here."

I’m proud to work with Senator Burr to properly highlight dispatchers’ roles as safety leaders during times of crisis and the work they do to keep our communities safe.”Background:The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) is a tool used by federal agencies to classify the workforce into useful, occupational categories. Currently, the SOC system categorizes 9-1-1 call takers and dispatchers as “Office and Administrative Support Occupations,” which also includes secretaries, office clerks, and taxi cab dispatchers.The 9-1-1 SAVES Act would instead recognize these dispatchers as “Protective Service Occupations,” which includes lifeguards, firefighters, TSA baggage screeners, among others.As co-chairs of the Congressional Next Generation 9-1-1 Caucus, Senators Burr and Klobuchar earlier this year reintroduced the Emergency Reporting Act, legislation to improve the resiliency of communication networks during emergencies, including hurricanes. Specifically, this legislation directs the FCC to work with state and local governments to improve the standards of mobile carriers in reporting network outages to 9-1-1 centers."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/4/burr-cancelling-extraordinary-amounts-of-student-loan-debt-wrong-solution-for-borrowers-taxpayers,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held its nomination hearing for James Kvaal to serve as the Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education.In his prepared opening remarks, Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) underscored his disapproval of massive student loan debt forgiveness and offered his legislation, the Repay Act, as an alternative and sustainable bipartisan policy solution that simplifies repayment options for borrowers by establishing one easy-to-navigate income-based repayment plan.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the nomination hearing for James Kvaal to serve as Under Secretary of Education.Excerpts:“I want to be clear about some worries I have about proposals by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as suggestions within the Biden Administration, to cancel extraordinary amounts of outstanding federal student loan debt.“I firmly believe this is the wrong solution to what I think most of us agree are challenges faced by many current and future student loan borrowers.“The Higher Education Act – or HEA – was enacted in 1965. Are we supposed to believe that for the last 56 years that the HEA has been in place, the Secretary has been able to cancel vast amounts of debt for every single borrower in the United States this whole time and we just didn’t know about it until now?“Mr. Kvaal, I must be honest with you and with everyone else on this Committee: this does not pass the laugh test.“Importantly, I believe the negative implications of unilaterally cancelling outstanding federal student loan debt would be more than enough to deem this bad policy.“For starters, this has a one-time cost of as much as one trillion dollars shifting that burden onto unsuspecting taxpayers. It’s also a regressive policy, meaning it will benefit the rich, mostly people who will already earn more because of their college education. It would be a huge gift particularly for Americans with student loan debt from graduate school who disproportionately earn higher incomes. It is also a very poorly targeted use of federal resources that does nothing to benefit the more than 200 million Americans that do not have federal student debt and never attended college. Finally, the promise of cancelling mass amounts of student loan debt creates a significant moral hazard.“So, we know what will happen if we cancel tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt for individual borrowers. What will stop schools from raising tuition higher and higher and digging an even deeper debt hole? Without institutional accountability, will you be asking the American taxpayer to foot another loan forgiveness scheme every 5, 10, 15, 20 years? Where does it end?“In addition to asking colleges and universities to play their part to stem this debt spiral, I have a better idea for loan repayment. A few weeks ago, my colleague Angus King and I reintroduced the Repay Act.“Instead of making students choose between nine unique loan repayment plans, our plan would allow borrowers to choose between two simple plans.“The first is what most borrowers already pay now: a fixed, 10-year repayment option. The second is a Simplified Income-Driven Repayment Plan. It simultaneously accounts for how much a student borrowed, and how much they currently earn.“I believe the Repay Act is a commonsense solution to our over-complicated student loan repayment system. It’s fair to students and fair to taxpayers.“Mr. Kvaal, if confirmed, I would look forward to working with you on this pragmatic bipartisan solution and others, and I hope you would do the same.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening remarks, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/4/senator-burr-statement-on-announced-withdrawal-of-us-forces-from-afghanistan,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement in response to the announcement that President Biden intends to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021:“The Biden Administration is within its rights to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but I’m concerned this Administration, like the last, has made this decision without fully considering the consequences. A complete withdrawal of U.S. troops will have long-term security ramifications, regionally and globally, for which the U.S. must be adequately prepared. Instead, we appear to be doubling down on ill-considered timelines without any of our conditions having been met. It’s incumbent on this Administration to tell Congress and the American people how it intends to withdraw U.S. forces, the timeline and reasoning behind it, and whether and how it intends to maintain a U.S. diplomatic presence in Kabul moving forward.”"

Marking today in their honor allows us to say ‘thank you’ for the sacrifices they have made on our behalf.”“America will never be able to repay our brave patriots and their families who have paid the ultimate price to protect their fellow Americans. Gold Star families and spouses have sacrificed so much for their country, and I can only imagine the pain that comes from losing your partner in the line of duty. I am proud to lead this resolution recognizing April 5, 2021 as Gold Star Wives Day to honor their dedication and sacrifice to our country. I extend my deepest condolences and sincere thanks to every Gold Star family and spouse,” said Senator Manchin.On April 5, 1945, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt helped convene the first meeting of the Gold Star Wives of America, a Congressionally-chartered non-profit to acknowledge the incredible sacrifices of the families of those who died in service during World War II.

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-bennet-renew-effort-to-provide-financial-stability-to-americans-battling-terminal-diseases,"Today, in recognition of ALS Awareness Month, Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) introduced the Kathryn Manginelli Act, or the Compassionate Retirement Act, which will provide more financial stability to families battling devastating diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This bipartisan legislation will allow individuals, who are diagnosed with a terminal illness, to use retirement savings without incurring an additional 10 percent penalty if withdrawing before the age of 59 ½.“Americans who have been diagnosed with ALS and other terminal illnesses share unexpected emotional and financial hardships,” said Senator Burr. “Many North Carolina families I’ve met with over the years have similar stories of the difficulties they face, including Kathryn and Joe Manginelli. The Manginellis brought to my attention the fact that those with terminal illnesses still face penalties for early retirement withdrawals. If Americans with terminal illnesses need to access their retirement funds to help cover unplanned health care costs, they shouldn’t be penalized for it. This is a commonsense fix. That’s why I’m honored to reintroduce this legislation in memory of Kathryn to provide more financial flexibility to Americans suffering from these terminal diseases and their families.”“Individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness face immense physical and emotional hardship,” said Senator Bennet. “On top of that, the financial challenges of battling a terminal illness can be overwhelming. Patients are often left to shoulder the burden not only of the cost of their care, but also their family’s financial future. We can do more to ease some of that financial hardship for families by allowing individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness to access their retirement savings immediately and without penalty.”Background:Under current law, the disability exception requires the individual to be unable to carry out Substantial Gainful Activity. However, Americans diagnosed with degenerative, terminal illnesses, such as ALS, are still subject to the 10 percent penalty if they continue working in the months prior to becoming disabled to help cover their medical or disability-related expenses.Named in honor of Kathryn Manginelli of Durham, North Carolina, who passed away from ALS on November 11, 2018, this legislation will provide families battling terminal illnesses with the ability to use their retirement savings without incurring this additional 10 percent penalty.Senators Burr and Bennet first introduced this legislation on September 18, 2019.To read a section-by-section of this legislation, also referred to as the Compassionate Retirement Act, click here. "
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-tillis-call-on-gov-cooper-to-help-nc-small-businesses-struggling-to-find-new-hires,"Today, Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) called on Governor Roy Cooper to address North Carolina’s employment shortage, which is harming small businesses across the state. The Senators released the following statement:“The employment shortage caused by exorbitant federal unemployment benefits is a real and serious threat to North Carolina’s recovery. “Over the last several weeks, we’ve heard from countless small, mid, and large-sized business owners across North Carolina struggling to hire enough workers to reopen this summer. Employers, particularly in hard-hit industries like tourism, service, and hospitality, are finding they can’t compete with excessive federal benefits. Time is running out for industries that rely on the summer season for a large portion of their business. “We are still far away from reaching our pre-pandemic unemployment level, and it’s not because of a lack of jobs. “Dismissing these concerns by telling employers to ‘pay more’ demonstrates an ignorance of the math at play. The business owners we’ve spoken to have offered higher wages and other incentives, despite operating on razor-thin margins. Even if a small business could afford to pay the progressives’ ideal of $15 per hour – and most can’t – it still wouldn’t be enough. A person making $15 an hour earns $600 for a 40-hour work week; expanded federal UI pays up to $650 for a zero-hour work week. It’s no wonder so many have delayed returning to work as long as possible.“Governor Cooper needs to acknowledge the existence of a problem and take action to fix it. While the governor recently announced he will finally start reinstating the job search requirement, that’s merely enforcing existing law. It’s not enough. The governor should immediately end expanded federal unemployment insurance and focus on incentives to encourage more people to return to the workforce, as nearly half of states already have. “Thanks to growing vaccinations and the heroic efforts of our health care workers, America is turning the tide in the fight against COVID-19. We won’t have truly recovered from this pandemic, however, until North Carolina’s economy and workers are back in full force.”"
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/senate-help-committee-passes-six-bipartisan-bills-to-improve-maternal-mental-health,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee passed six bipartisan bills, including legislation to improve maternal care and to provide mental health support for health care professionals.The bills passed during today’s executive session include the Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act, the Rural Maternal and Obstetric Modernization of Services (MOMS) Act, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act, the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, the Supporting the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act, and the Promoting Physical Activity for Americans Act.Senate HELP Committee Ranking Member Richard Burr (R-NC) applauded the Committee’s bipartisan work to address these critical initiatives during his opening statement before the Committee’s vote.Excerpts of Senator Burr’s Opening Statement:I am pleased to move these important public health and workplace priorities through the HELP Committee this morning.“These policies demonstrate the ability of this Committee to accomplish meaningful, bipartisan progress on issues that affect millions of Americans.“Some of today’s legislation touches on very personal aspects of health care policy – caring for mothers, supporting our health care providers, improving our own health, and strengthening the research that supports all of this work.  “Along with caring for those on the front lines, today’s docket includes new tools for the public health agencies that provide the resources necessary to advance our health care for the future.” Background: The Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act would support grant programs through the Department of Health and Human Services to improve maternal and infant health care quality and outcomes and to enhance prenatal, labor, and postpartum training for health care professionals. This legislation passed the Committee by voice vote.The Rural Maternal and Obstetric Modernization of Services (MOMS) Act would take steps to address the United States’ high maternal mortality rate by improving rural maternal and obstetric care data, establishing rural obstetric network grants, expanding existing federal telehealth grant programs, and creating a report on maternal care in rural areas to identify gaps in care and recommend data collection to improve maternal care. This legislation passed the Committee by voice vote.The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act would provide updated workplace accommodations to protect working mothers and clarifies existing guidance for businesses across the nation. This legislation passed the Committee by voice vote.The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act would address the need to support the mental health of doctors and nurses given what they face every day in their work, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, by enhancing training and educational programs to increase awareness on suicide and other mental health concerns. This legislation passed the Committee by voice vote.The Supporting the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act would increase both the minimum and maximum authority that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can allocate to their respective foundations. This increase will advance collaboration and innovation with both foundations to address cutting-edge regulatory science challenges. This legislation passed the Committee by voice voteThe Promoting Physical Activity for Americans Act would require HHS to update and publish the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans every 10 years, review best practices in examining barriers to physical activity every five years, and ensure any recommendation is consistent with current science. This legislation passed the Committee by voice vote."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-statement-on-proposed-january-6th-commission,"Today, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) released the following statement on the proposal to establish a new commission investigating the Capitol attack on January 6th:“As I’ve said before, the Capitol assault on January 6th was a grim day for our nation. In its aftermath, the Senate held the unprecedented impeachment trial of a former U.S. president. The Justice Department is currently conducting one of the largest federal criminal investigations in history and has already made hundreds of arrests. Congress has also been conducting multiple ongoing investigations.“These investigations are being led by the committees with jurisdiction, and I believe, as I always have, this is the appropriate course. I don’t believe establishing a new commission is necessary or wise.“Many called for the creation of a joint committee or commission to investigate Russian interference following the 2016 election. Leader McConnell kept the investigation with the Senate Intelligence Committee, where we already had the staff, relationships, and expertise to conduct a thorough and fact-based review. It was the right call. The investigation would not have had the same success and bipartisan support if Senate leadership had not trusted the Committee to do its job. I hope Senate Democrats have the same faith in their colleagues.”"

Thank you Chair Murray for scheduling this hearing to examine paid leave.“As a father, husband, grandfather, and son, I understand the need to balance family life with the workplace.“I support, and I believe most people support, people being able to take time off of work when they are sick, their family member is sick, or after the birth or adoption of a child. “I also support and encourage the idea of paid leave for workers. During my time in Congress I have cosponsored bills to help Americans earn more paid leave, such as the Working Families Flexibility Act, which would allow private-sector employers to offer all employees who work overtime to choose between monetary compensation or comp-time, just like the federal government does.“There are great benefits to providing paid leave.  It helps attract talent, improves retention, increases employee health and wellness, and it increases employee engagement. “However, there are big questions of disagreement surrounding paid leave: Is it mandated?  Who pays for it?  Who gets it and for what reasons?“Many of my colleagues are lawyers or have never had a job outside of government. It shows in the policy proposals they pursue.“It’s easy to come up with a good idea and tell someone else to pay the bill.“As my friend John Boehner used to say, ‘everyone wants to be Santa Claus.’“So, as we look at paid leave proposals, no matter how well intentioned, we can’t just say to the private sector now you need to pay for our extremely generous brilliant ideas. “Some large businesses currently provide paid leave and aren’t looking for a new federal mandate but instead want a common sense approach to help them deal with the varying requirements across different states. “However, there are others that endorse a federal mandate.“I am skeptical this is a selfless act and worry that this is a form of corporate rent seeking where they are trying to impose costs on their smaller competitors to drive them out of business. “Most small businesses already offer some form of paid sick leave, because most people agree if someone is sick they should not come to work. But a costly new mandate imposing a one-size-fits-all policy of paid leave on small businesses can’t be easily absorbed and could force businesses to cut jobs.“If Washington wants to come up with the idea Washington needs to pay for it - with tax credits, subsidies, grants – at least for small businesses.“The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 provides eligible workers 12 weeks of leave, but it does not have to be paid leave.“In 2017, thanks to Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Congress provided tax credits to encourage eligible employers to provide paid leave.“I supported Senator Fischer’s employer credit as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This tax credit now has been extended through 2025.“It provides a credit for eligible employers ranging from 12.5% to 25% of wages paid to employees for up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave. Employers must provide at least 50 percent of wages.“Senator Fischer deserves a lot of credit for pressing us to include that into law.“Also, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, bipartisan legislation, supported by both sides of the aisle, provided businesses with fewer than 500 employees payroll tax credits for paid leave related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These tax credits have been extended through September 2021.“Let’s talk about Private Sector Leave programs.“Job creators want talented workers and want to provide benefits for those workers.“The private sector has many creative ideas to provide paid leave such as Paid Time Off purchase plans that allow workers who want more leave to purchase additional paid time off either through employer flex credits or salary reductions with pre-tax dollars.“Others are providing short-term disability insurance to provide employees income security due to time off from an injury, illness, or even pregnancy.“Flexibility for the employer and the worker makes it work for all involved.“State governments are coming up with paid leave programs of their own.“For example, as Sen. Murray noted, Washington State provides a family and medical leave program funded through premiums paid by the worker and employer, with the worker paying the larger share of the premium.“Small businesses with fewer than 50 workers are not required to pay the employer premium.“There is a lot of bipartisan interest in the Senate surrounding paid leave, including expanding the Fischer tax credits I’ve already mentioned.“But we need to remember that we are not really good at running a business here in Congress.“The one-size fits all approach does not work on any issues, especially paid leave.“So, instead of pushing our brilliant ideas, with arbitrary decisions made by Congress or bureaucrats in Washington, we should make sure we give business a lot of flexibility to help employers make paid leave work. “This is an important issue, and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today and ideas they may have.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-retirement-works-when-americans-control-their-own-money-,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing entitled, “Retirement Security: Building a Better Future.”Ranking Member Burr’s Prepared Opening Statement:“Good morning.  Thank you Chair Murray for scheduling this hearing to highlight the need for Americans to save more for their futures. “I hope this bipartisan hearing is a sign that the Committee will work collaboratively on retirement legislation in our jurisdiction instead of using reconciliation again to move partisan ideas or more expensive bailouts.“Some members of the HELP Committee – like myself – serve on other committees like Finance and Aging who have held recent hearings on retirement matters. “The hook into retirement issues for our labor committee is ERISA – the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  ERISA sets standards for retirement and health plans in private industry to protect individuals in these plans.  The tax committees in Congress handle the Internal Revenue Code portion.“There’s overlap between Committees that gets worked out in a very smooth fashion. “That said, as a member of HELP, Finance, and Aging – I consider my office a one-stop shop on retirement and aging matters.  I’ll personally get engaged in any bipartisan retirement matter without worrying about jurisdiction, but for today we’ll concentrate on our HELP piece.“Our particular focus today is defined contribution plans, the reliable superstar of the retirement world. “The question before us is what is working well and what is lagging and needs improvements.“The answer to that question is easy at the surface level.  The system works great. “The system doesn’t work great when you don’t or can’t participate.   “What we need to do is help Americans and their employers offer, operate, and fund individual retirement plans. “We also need to make sure that the people who have screwed up nearly every other retirement plan in America don’t get their hands on the freedom and flexibility Americans have in their private retirement accounts.“Many Americans who look ahead at their retirement have to look at the newspaper to see what’s happening with Social Security, with their company or union defined benefit pension, or their catastrophically underfunded state and local pension plan.“Not so with the defined contribution plan.  Americans in defined contribution plans pick up a piece of paper and see at least two things.  Their name.  And an account balance. “It’s their money.  And it’s there.  It’s not a promise. It’s not an accounting notation.  It doesn’t require a bailout. “It requires time, personal contributions, maybe an employer match, and some basic financial knowledge. “While investments must be managed well, market fluctuations must be weathered, and smart decisions made as you near retirement, no politician can steal your 401(k) or IRA.  At least not yet.“Congress is good at two things – overreacting and underreacting. “Individual retirement plans haven’t gotten a lot of attention in some respects because they work. “Individual retirement plans show that regular folks benefit from the success of corporate America and the stock market. “Despite the anti-business rhetoric we hear from some in Congress and the Administration, it would surprise many that the energy or pharmaceutical companies the Biden Administration intends to put out of business are mainly owned by the retirement plans of Americans. “That’s you and me, and anyone else with a retirement account.“This irks some.  It doesn’t jive with their government-centric philosophy.  It doesn’t jive with their desire to demonize business when business is owned by Americans’ retirement plans.“Retirement works when Americans control their own money.  It goes wrong when we add middlemen with goals other than putting real money into a nest egg and growing it. “What happens when people other than you control your retirement?“In the American Rescue Plan Act passed by the Democrats and signed into law in March, they included a massive bailout for certain multiemployer pension plans.“These are retirement plans negotiated and promised by private sector employers and unions to private sector workers. “Employers and unions couldn’t afford the promises they made to workers over the past several decades – so the Democrats gave them over $80 billion.“That is, they gave them $80 billion in taxpayer funds to make private agreements whole.“A bailout, pure and simple. With no reforms to these plans to make sure that promises will be able to be honored in the future.“The federal government can’t afford to guarantee every retirement promise made between private companies and their workers or between poorly run states and their public unions. “We have a national debt of over 28 Trillion dollars. And that’s just today.“There are numerous mismanaged pension systems that have failures looming both in the private and public sectors. “The latest data in 2018 from the Federal Reserve estimates $4.5 trillion in public plan underfunding.“Employers, states, and retirees should not and cannot rely on the government for future bailouts.“So, that means Congress needs to work together to shore up retirement options and help Americans save for their own retirement.“Americans needs to start saving more.“With fewer Americans having access to an employer-sponsored pension plan, old rules of thumb about how much to save are outdated.“The gap between the retirement savings Americans have and the savings they need is already in the trillions of dollars and likely to grow.“Not only are many Americans struggling to keep pace with their savings needs, even more alarming is how many people have no savings outside of Social Security at all.“The data we’ve seen says that over one-quarter of non-retirees have nothing in their retirement piggy banks, many of whom are already nearing traditional retirement age.“And while the long-term impact of the pandemic and economic lockdowns remains to be seen, we know that many Americans needed to tap into their retirement savings to pay for more immediate needs in the past year, draining assets from their intended purpose.“On the bright side of these discouraging numbers is that we know what works.“AARP says that workers are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if they have access to a payroll deduction savings plan at work – you don’t spend what you don’t see.“We have also seen the success of Defined Contribution plan features like automatic enrollment and employer matching, which show that most workers will not opt out of an employer-sponsored savings plan if they are already enrolled, and many will set their payroll deduction to the maximum level that earns an employer match.“So, the question of how to improve the average American’s retirement outlook is not ‘How do we bail out the system to make up the multi-trillion dollar savings gap?’ Instead, it is ‘How do we help employees and employers take advantage of the savings programs that already work?’“I look forward to hearing from the panel today about some of the barriers individuals face in their retirement planning and the barriers employers face in offering retirement plans to workers, and what can be done to overcome those barriers.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-ip-protections-are-part-of-reason-we-have-life-saving-vaccines,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing entitled, “An Update from Federal Officials on Efforts to Combat COVID-19.” This is the Committee’s second hearing with federal officials on the COVID-19 pandemic in the 117th Congress.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the Committee’s second hearing on the coronavirus pandemic with federal officialsRanking Member Burr’s Prepared Opening Statement:“Chair Murray, I am glad that we are holding another hearing to update us on the status of the COVID-19 response.“To our witnesses, welcome back. “It has been almost 18 months since the initial reports of a severe pneumonia from Wuhan, China surfaced.“Since that time, we have tragically seen over half a million deaths in this country from COVID-19. Government-backed shutdowns have jeopardized the livelihoods of millions of Americans and we have spent more taxpayer funds than I could have ever imagined in response to this virus and the devastating effect it has had on our economy. “But now, more than ever, there is reason for hope. We are seeing the promise of vaccines and treatments in real time.“A month ago, the case counts in the United States were averaging 70,000 new cases per day, now they are down to 40,000.“CDC is projecting continued declines in death and hospitalization rates.“Because of Operation Warp Speed and Stephen Hahn and FDA, we have fully vaccinated 115 million Americans, which is roughly 44 percent of adults, and delivered almost 330 million vaccine doses to states.“Warp Speed and BARDA spent more than $18 billion to make vaccines available to Americans, manufacturing vaccines at-risk – and the American people are benefitting from that. “Manufacturers were able to produce enough vaccine that the U.S. is now able to help provide vaccines to countries in need, countries like India.“Because of the collaborative efforts over the last year, we are ready to turn the corner. “The partnerships developing and manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccines have been one of the biggest scientific success stories in generations.“Industry answered the call at the start of the pandemic and partnered in unprecedented ways to bring us these life-saving products. “Intellectual property protections are part of the reason we have these life-saving products. If these protections are not in place for innovators of life-saving medicines, we will not have them for the next pandemic. It’s that simple.“We held a hearing on the threat of China taking intellectual property from U.S. research, and now the Biden administration has agreed to just hand it over. “There is a way to support the manufacturing for vaccines globally and to help countries in need without acting in bad faith against innovators who stepped up when the world needed them most.“It’s the partnerships we are already seeing today that are saving lives, not silly ideas about socializing the means of production. “The action from the Biden administration to support waiving intellectual property rights will undermine the innovation we are relying on to bring this pandemic to an end and will leave us less prepared in the future.“I’m encouraged that some of our European allies are cautioning against this reckless action, and I hope that the adults in the Biden Administration will realize that what sounds good in a grad school ivory tower thesis paper doesn’t make sense in the real world.“You four are supposed to be the adults in the room, and I urge each you to think about those real consequences if we just give away this science and technology. “The next part of our job is going to be difficult. “I have been looking to Israel to help predict the challenges that may be in store for the U.S., since they are ahead of our vaccination rates today. “Israel was able to vaccinate 40 percent of its adult population by the end of February. Their data shows that uptake stalled once they vaccinated about 60% of the adult population. While there are differences between our countries, we have to use the information we’ve got to best predict our road ahead. “Every adult has the opportunity to be vaccinated, and supply is starting to exceed the demand. We have more shots than arms. We need to address vaccine hesitancy. “I know this is the case in my state, with recent reports from Wilmington, that local officials are changing their approach as vaccine demand slows.“We must paint the picture for Americans showing the benefits of both a vaccine, and of reopening our country. “This is a simple message for those of us in leadership positions.“I got the vaccine, my wife got it, my sons and their wives got it. I have encouraged all of my staff to take it as soon as they can.“I would guess that everyone in this room is vaccinated, which means if we follow the CDC guidance we can dispense with masks and social distancing.“I hope in the near future this leads to a return to normal life, full reopening of our economy, more in person hearings, and a day when we are no longer wearing masks for average, daily activities. “Very soon we will have a vaccine for kids over 12, and one for younger children hopefully as soon as this fall.“We must reassure Americans that the COVID vaccine is safe. Vaccines save lives. And we must reassure Americans that if you get a COVID vaccine, our lives will return to normal. “Today’s response is preparing us for tomorrow’s threat.  “Recently Sen. Murray and I launched a joint effort to strengthen our public health preparedness programs for the next threat we will inevitably face.“That threat could be an emerging or new virus, another curveball from Mother Nature, or the result of a deliberate, man-made attack on our country. “Our framework has always been flexible, and it needs to stay that way. “There will always be lessons that we learn from each response, and our threat landscape is constantly evolving. “Our experience with this pandemic has made that even more clear. “Senator Murray, I am looking forward to working with you and the members of the Committee on this project to take stock of lessons learned and put them into action. “To our witnesses today, thank you for all you have done so far during this response. Let’s learn from it for the next one.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here."

The Biden Administration should not support waiving intellectual property protections, which would undermine the very innovation we are relying on to bring this pandemic to an end. Instead, it should work with innovators and manufacturers to continue scaling up production and increase vaccine availability around the world.”"

Additionally, Ranking Member Burr expressed concern over Ms. Abruzzo’s involvement in the Agency Review Team for Labor and questioned Ms. Nanda’s partisan agenda.WATCH: Ranking Member Burr delivers opening remarks before the nomination hearing for Jennifer Abruzzo and Seema NandaExcerpts:“President Biden called for bipartisanship and unity in his inaugural address stating ‘this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge. And unity is the path forward.’  Yet, while he was reading his speech, his staff was engaged in unprecedented firings of government officials…“One of those firings during the President’s call for unity was the removal of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb. This was the first time a newly elected President has ever fired the NLRB General Counsel, a Senate-confirmed position that under the National Labor Relations Act serves a four-year term.“Congress set a specific term for the General Counsel to provide integrity and independence to the position.“We need both independence and integrity in the General Counsel’s office, which we had with Peter Robb until he was abruptly fired by White House staff while the President was still standing on the Capitol balcony calling for unity…“President Biden’s actions not only harm the independence of the Board and the General Counsel, but this is an aggressive and unnecessary partisan escalation.“So, while President Biden was reading pretty words about unity, his politically motivated staff escalated the unending partisan war, and as a result workers and business will suffer.“I’d say, ‘Say it ain’t so, Joe,’ but unfortunately we have the nomination before us, so I know it is so.“Ms. Abruzzo says she wasn’t involved in the firing, but that’s frankly a little hard to believe as she was heavily involved in the Agency Review Team for Labor, which covered the NLRB. “I can’t imagine this firing was a surprise to her.“Ms. Abruzzo’s fingerprints are on many of the NLRB’s most radical decisions and some of the Administration’s most partisan post-election labor moves.  “If confirmed, she will come in with a dark cloud over her head.…“Turning to Seema Nanda, the solicitor of the Department of Labor should be someone with balance, without an ideological agenda. But Ms. Nanda is a highly partisan individual.  “While she has Department experience, it was under Tom Perez who was himself a radical partisan. Ms. Nanda followed Mr. Perez to the DNC where she was his top executive in charge of fundraising.“I find it hard to believe that the American people want labor laws enforced by someone whose job it was to raise money for the Democratic Party. “She has used her time at the DNC to make a series of inflammatory, aggressive, and narrow-minded tweets and re-tweets about and against Republicans.“Ms. Nanda has accused Republican Senators of wanting to ‘break’ the government when it was Democrats who were ruthlessly filibustering much needed aid for COVID-19 last year…“I’m sure she’ll offer some form of an apology, but I suspect that she’s simply sorry she got caught.“But such rhetoric is in sharp contrast to the bipartisanship the President promised as late as last night.“Ms. Nanda seems to view employers not as job creators but as cartoonish evildoers set upon disadvantaging and harming the American worker. “I fear her confirmation would lead to a partisan assault against employers, the great majority of whom are eager to comply with their regulatory obligations and keep their workers safe. “Ms. Nanda’s zero-sum mentality of American labor-management relations – that in order for the worker to gain the employer must suffer – is an out-of-the-mainstream view that has no place in American government.…“I welcome this hearing as an opportunity to understand exactly what this Administration and the Majority intends to attempt to impose on business and job creators in the coming months.“Hopefully instead they will set aside their partisan, ideological agendas and instead work together to protect workers, create jobs, and grow our economy, not our government.“Since the foundation of the American Federation of Labor, American union members, the actual workers – not their union bosses – have been engaged in a struggle against radical socialists who wish to seize control and repurpose the labor movement away from prioritizing the economy and creating jobs to pushing socialism where government reigns…“That battle for the soul of labor continues today.  “The labor of American workers drives our free-market economy and their demand for good jobs and fair wages helps our competitive spirit thrive, but some unions have instead become partisans masquerading as worker advocates.  “Workers should be protected, and their rights to organize, and not to organize, should be respected under the law.“But partisan legislation, like the poorly named PRO Act, masquerading as a pro-worker bill, is truly a dagger aimed at the heart of America’s free enterprise system.“Our two nominees today have fine qualifications for their previous jobs – Ms. Abruzzo, as a union lawyer and Ms. Nanda, as a Democratic party activist, but they represent the wrong side of the struggle for the soul of the American worker.  “It’s unclear to me that they will ever enjoy the confidence of anyone outside of the biased anti-business bubbles that fester in the fringes of the left, further undermining public confidence in the independent nature of the positions they seek to hold.”To read Ranking Member Burr’s full prepared opening statement, click here."

The concern I raised with Acting Commissioner Woodcock is the same I’ve raised for years: the FDA has yet to provide sufficient new scientific data justifying a ban on menthol cigarettes. I also remain concerned that after more than 10 years and $5 billion dollars, the FDA still has not released official guidance for reduced harm tobacco products. If the FDA is going to pursue a menthol ban, it’s only fair it issue foundational rules for the approval of reduced harm tobacco alternatives. Doing so is essential for having a robust discussion about the future of an industry that is vital for millions of American consumers and workers.”"

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/6/-senate-help-committee-considers-bipartisan-child-abuse-prevention-and-treatment-act-first-reauthorization-in-decade,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held an executive session to consider the bipartisan Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) Reauthorization of 2021.Earlier this week, Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Patty Murray (D-WA), the Ranking Member and Chair of the Senate HELP Committee, introduced the CAPTA Reauthorization of 2021.Ranking Member Burr’s Opening Statement:“Good morning Chair Murray.“Thank you and your staff for the bipartisan work that has brought us to considering the reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021.“I also want to thank all the members on the Committee, as well as members off the Committee, for the ideas that have helped form the first comprehensive reauthorization of CAPTA in over a decade. “Among all the laws that come before this committee, CAPTA may be the most important for stating who we are as a nation in our relationships with children and families.  How we respond to the needs of abused and neglected children directly determines how children will grow into adulthood.“The COVID-19 pandemic has painfully demonstrated the need for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Emergency room visits due to abuse have climbed while reports of abuse into Child Protective Services have fallen.  “In their role as mandated reporters, K-12 teachers are the most important eyes and ears for the safety of children. With so many K-12 schools closed to in-person instruction, that critical safety net was pulled down for too many children across the country. “All of us have a role to play in keeping our children safe. I am hopeful the bill before us strengthens all the systems of supports for families to prevent or mitigate child abuse and neglect and to treat the effects of abuse and neglect when it does occur. “Since reauthorizing CAPTA in 2010, we have learned a great deal more about what Congress got right and what we got wrong in past reauthorizations.“In crafting this bipartisan reauthorization, we have tried to heed those lessons – doubling down on what we got right and changing course where we made mistakes.“First, this bill doubles down on prevention of abuse and neglect. This bill emphasizes the provision of community-based family strengthening and prevention services to reduce the number of children ever referred to child protective services. “Second, one-size-fits-all approaches don’t serve children or families well. We continue to emphasize the use of differential response in instances of abuse and neglect.“Additionally, while there are instances when children must be removed from their homes to ensure their safety, in far too many instances children are separated from their families due to income or housing insecurity. These families and their children need help, not the trauma of separation.“This bill emphasizes the implementation of alternative pathways to connect families experiencing basic needs to voluntary community-based services.“Serving families with basic needs through alternative pathways allows investigators and social workers to dedicate their time to children most at risk of serious harm – children with multiple referrals and children under the age of three. “Of the 1,800 child fatalities due to abuse and neglect in 2019, 45 percent were children under the age of one, and 31 percent were children ages one to three. These are the children whose safety and lives most depend on a rapid response. “In our efforts to improve the Child Protective Services system and prevent and treat child abuse and neglect, it’s essential we listen and learn from those with personal experience in the child welfare system. In this reauthorization we have added provisions to include youth, parents, and those who were themselves victims of child abuse and neglect in state and local plans and programs.“We’ve also added provisions to improve and protect the legal representation of both children and families caught up in the system. Separating children from their parents, whether temporarily or permanently, is a wrenching experience and all parties deserve voice and representation.“Finally, within this CAPTA reauthorization, we are bringing a public health approach to two areas both Congress and the field have struggled with for years – identifying and preventing child fatalities and near fatalities due to abuse and neglect; and infants affected by substance use disorder.“Through coordinated leadership and shared responsibility at the federal, state, and local levels, this reauthorization seeks to implement data-driven strategies and reforms to prevent child fatalities and near fatalities due to abuse and neglect from occurring in the future through the use of improved collection, reporting, and analysis.“Ensuring data collections can be used effectively to drive policy and supporting State and local child fatality review teams in the review of all cases of child fatalities and near fatalities due to abuse and neglect are important steps to understand and learn from each tragedy and improve the system for all children in the future.“We are also bringing a different approach to infants affected by substance use disorder in this reauthorization. Because it was probably the vehicle moving at the time, this issue got shoehorned into CAPTA two decades ago. As a result, in many places this issue has been viewed as child abuse rather than an issue of addiction.“In this reauthorization, we are clearly stating that the purpose of plans of safe care is to bring a public health response to infants and their mothers affected by substance use disorder and to support the health and well-being of the infant and mom rather than penalizing the family.“Although there will be instances when it is safer to remove the child from their mother, far more children and moms would be better served by increasing access to treatment for moms with substance use disorder and providing access to screening, assessment, and intervention service for affected infants.“I’m also pleased that we have been able to include in this bill the reauthorization of the Adoption Opportunities Act.“Adoptive families bring great joy and I’m glad we are doing more to help families successfully adopt and grow their family.“This reauthorization provides additional supports for prospective adoptive parents as well as post adoptive services for families.“Additionally, the bill seeks to improve adoption opportunities for children who have been waiting too long to find a loving forever home.“Finally, I want to thank Senators Blunt and Klobuchar for their work on unregulated custody transfers as we all seek to prevent adoption dissolutions from occurring.“I want to thank all the members again for your work on these important reauthorizations. I know all of us wish there was no need for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.“However, listening to those with personal experience who have lived the child welfare system, I believe we are taking positive steps forward in this reauthorization to preventing future incidents of child abuse and neglect and to better responding to those incidents that do occur.“I thank the Chair.”"

Equally troubling, your testimony was also inconsistent with the representations in your April 22, 2021, letter responding to questions Ranking Member Burr had concerning the CDC’s guidance for vaccinated people.”The Senators continue, “Americans need to be able to trust the CDC to give them accurate, unbiased health information, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. That your agency would give teachers’ unions privileged access to the agency’s internal decision-making process on an issue as critical as school re-openings is a betrayal of that trust. That you then would appear to try to avoid Congressional scrutiny by providing incomplete testimony is deeply troubling. As a first step to rebuilding public confidence, the CDC needs be transparent about how the teachers’ unions came to have such extraordinary input in school re-opening guidance.

This news is a reminder of what’s possible when we partner private sector innovation with the public sector’s resources and reach. I hope it will force the Biden Administration to reconsider and withdraw its support for the disastrous TRIPS waiver, which would jeopardize future innovations and effectively turn over American companies’ intellectual property to China and Russia.”At a May 11th hearing held by the Senate HELP Committee, Senator Burr questioned Administration officials on the delay in donating COVID-19 vaccines doses not approved for U.S. use to countries with limited supply.Senator Burr has opposed the Biden Administration’s support for waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines, urging officials to instead “work with innovators and manufacturers to continue scaling up production and increase vaccine availability around the world.”"

Candidly, I wish that this hearing was held months ago.“This administration has had an acting ASPR since January 20 – in the middle of our response to a pandemic.“The statutory lead on public health emergencies was left open during the most significant public health emergency of our lifetimes.“ASPR should have been one of the first slots filled by this administration.“I will also point out to my colleagues that there is another absolutely critical public health position that has not yet been named.“The FDA Commissioner.“I have the greatest respect for Janet Woodcock, she is leading the FDA ably, and I think she “has all of the qualifications needed for this moment, but we need a fully confirmed person in that role.“We need a nominee and I look forward to vetting her in this Committee. “Ms. O’Connell, in our previous conversations we talked about the reason we wrote the ASPR into statute.“It was to answer the simple question of – who is in charge during a public health emergency.“The statute is extremely clear. The ASPR is in charge, and serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary on these matters.“This is not a political or a personal choice for any administration, it is the law. “It is a role that we envisioned with two types of responsibilities.“First, the ASPR serves an operational role.“During an emergency, the ASPR coordinates the public health and medical response – whether that threat is a hurricane, a novel virus, or a chemical attack.“Another part of the day job is the assessment of, and investment in, our medical countermeasures enterprise.“As the head of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise or PHEMCE and with oversight of BARDA and the Strategic National Stockpile, this job covers the research, development, procurement, and deployment of these life-saving products. “Second, the ASPR is a policy job, assessing the threat landscape and adjusting our strategies to best position the United States for the threats we face today and in the future.“My questions today are designed to make sure that you are a good candidate for the entirety of the role as developed and envisioned by this Committee.“With each iteration of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act – or PAHPA for short – we have adjusted our emergency preparedness and response framework, including the role of the ASPR.“During the last reauthorization we more closely tied the position to the intelligence community, providing the ASPR with a greater line of sight into the ever-changing landscape of the threats that we face. “We made ASPR the head of the PHEMCE to coordinate and make decisions on medical countermeasure investments.“And, we updated the ASPR’s job description to ensure a focus on both of these operational and policy roles.“ASPR’s responsibilities also now include the stockpile, a move that strengthens the operational side of this job.“With the ASPR over the stockpile, he or she can follow taxpayer investments from the advanced research at BARDA all the way through to the last mile of deployment during an emergency.“Yet the office of the ASPR has also been utilized in ways that are outside of its scope.“This distracts ASPR from its mission and ultimately makes us less prepared.“When we wrote the first PAHPA we hoped that we would never have to use this law to its fullest extent, but the time came during COVID-19.“A lot of the framework that this Committee designed worked very well during the pandemic.“We have three authorized vaccines with more on the way, dramatically changing the trajectory of our response to COVID-19 for the better. “But the response was not perfect, and the work is not done.“Instead of looking to the ASPR, the last Administration created its own leadership structure for the COVID response, building the plane and flying it at the same time. “Congress intentionally created ASPR to avoid this confusion, and to tip of the spear during a response.“I know who was supposed to be in charge, because I helped write the law putting ASPR at the front.“So as our Committee looks at what improvements need to be made in law, I hope that, if you are confirmed, you and my colleagues will work with me: to see what mistakes were made and how to learn from them, to make it more clear that the ASPR is in charge, that you have the tools you need, and that when the next pandemic comes, because it likely will, that ASPR is ready to stand up and take the lead“The American people expect us to do all we can to protect them from public health threats and to communicate those actions to them.“They deserve an ASPR that can command the response and coordinate their colleagues across HHS.“And that brings the same urgency and vigilance to the role in peacetime as in the middle of a response.“I look forward to our conversation today and hearing whether you are ready to rise to this challenge.“I yield back.”"

America’s key technology sectors and research institutions are particularly at risk. To better protect these vital sectors and foster American innovation, we need focused, robust, and thoughtful policies that defend against IP theft. Unfortunately, this legislation lacks the necessary targeted approach and falls short of guaranteeing critical protections. For these reasons, I have voted against this bill.”"

Over more than 40 years, he led Duke to five national championships, a dozen ACC tournament championships, a dozen regular season titles, and coached three gold-winning U.S. Olympic teams. What made Coach K a truly exceptional coach and will serve as his most important legacy is the way he prepared his players for life on and off the court.

The loan pause through executive action has cost taxpayers $40 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020. These costs do not include the costs that have accrued for FY 2021, or the $63 billion in loan re-estimates added to the program costs in FY 2020 due to previously unanticipated levels of forgiveness.“Your recently released FY 2022 budget documents estimate that the loan pause currently set to expire at the end of FY 2021 will cost an additional $36 billion to taxpayers. Further, for FY 2021 the Department’s budget documents indicate that there will be another re-estimate in costs due to unanticipated levels of forgiveness in the future, currently estimated to cost $53 billion. “Millions of families will depend on the Department’s ability to reactivate the frozen loan portfolio. Your job is to plan and execute a seamless transition, which we expect you have been preparing for since you were confirmed in March.”To read the full letter, click here."

Throughout the pandemic, the CDC failed to meet the mark. Its guidance and public statements have been contradictory, confused, and often lagged behind the latest science. The public’s trust in the CDC’s ability to fulfill its core mission has been threatened by a series of missteps.“The CDC has also struggled to fully leverage new technologies and public-private partnerships, creating delays when we could least afford them. Early in the pandemic, problems with the CDC-developed COVID-19 test led to an unacceptable shortage of reliable tests at a critical moment.“The CDC must be able to keep pace with the rapid developments, using the latest technology to advance the public health. This report outlines the cultural and structural changes necessary to ensure the CDC is better able to respond to the next public health threat. It recommends strong, accountable leadership, strategic planning to make sure the agency’s programs are supporting its priorities, and the development of effective public-private partnerships.”Key Recommendations: The policy brief, “Modernizing CDC: Ensuring a Strategic Approach and Improving Accountability,” includes the following recommendations:To read the full policy brief, click here."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/5/burr-criticizes-democrats-endless-spending-proposals-urges-colleagues-to-focus-on-getting-americans-back-to-work,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held its nomination hearing for Rajesh Nayak to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy, Taryn Mackenzie Williams to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy, and Doug Parker to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.Ranking Member Richard Burr’s Prepared Opening Remarks:“Good morning. Thank you, Chair Murray for scheduling this hearing to examine these Department of Labor nominees.“Congratulations Mr. Nayak, Ms. Williams, and Mr. Parker on your nominations and welcome.“These are important labor policy positions. “The role of Assistant Secretary for Policy will be involved in virtually every major decision to come out of the Department of Labor.“The Disability Employment Policy office plays a key role in helping get unemployed and underemployed Americans with disabilities back to work.“The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, is tasked with the job of ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for workers.“As we consider our nation’s labor agenda going forward, we should recognize that America’s fundamentals are strong. The best way to keep these fundamentals strong is easy. It’s pro-growth legislation and regulatory relief. It’s support for workers in the ways they want to work in the new economy.“It is not tax hikes, increased regulation, and doing the bidding of trial lawyers. It’s not coercing workers into unions they don’t want to join or preventing the growth of the gig economy where workers decide their work life.  “There is no need to fundamentally restructure our nation from free-market capitalism to a pretend workers’ paradise under the thumb of Washington. “The closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic are beginning to come to an end.  “Trillions have been spent – some of it for good effect – but now my friends on the other side of the aisle want to spend trillions and trillions more – all in an effort to fundamentally change the fabric of our country.  “Trouble is, it gets a little hard to ask for trillions more when we haven’t even really begun to spend much of the last round of funding and what we have spent outside of actual response to the Covid-19 crisis is making things worse.  “It is the policy ideas of Democrats that are holding America back.  The confusion these policies are causing job creators is only matched by their counter-productiveness.“While restaurants and businesses are desperate to hire workers, Democrats want to pay people more to stay home.  Then they scratch their heads at the terrible unemployment numbers.“Just last week, I was told the story from a carpenter who upgrades residential kitchens and bathrooms that he has constant inquiries to take on new business, but he can’t find crews to do the jobs.  The crew workers are making so much due to the increased unemployment benefits that they are just taking time off.“It made sense to provide extra benefits last year when businesses had to close and people needed extra help because jobs didn’t exist. But as the jobs numbers last week told us – the economy is reopening and we need workers now. “We’re also faced with the challenges of reopening the economy post-COVID. “America will open safely because of vaccines not because OSHA throws a new rule book at business owners.  “CDC just recently followed the science and updated the mask mandate rules.“Science is what we should rely on when setting standards and when the science changes so rapidly we cannot set a static and arbitrary standard for COVID-19 prevention as the Biden Administration is considering doing.  “Last week, I wrote Secretary Walsh and Acting OMB Director Young to stand down and not issue an emergency temporary standard.“Employers and workers together have navigated Covid-19 together, making decisions based on the constantly changing science and guidance provided from CDC and Department of Labor. “However, the nominee for the OSHA position did exactly the opposite of that. California’s state OSHA put in place an emergency temporary standard in the midst of the pandemic. “Instead of providing employers with clear, operational guidance, I am told the temporary standard resulted in confusion to employers as to how to comply.“Cal/OSHA had to post 70 frequently asked questions to clarify for the regulated community what was expected of them.“On May 20, Cal/OSHA proposed to dramatically scale back the requirements in the standard to align with the dramatic improvements made with the large number of vaccinated individuals and the dramatic reduction in infection rates.“I hope the lesson learned here is that we should not follow another failed model from California.“I hope the Administration changes course and listens to the concerns I raised with them.“On the other hand, I would like to say we’ve got some potential areas of agreement.“As we talk about disability employment policy, we can talk about how to build upon the bipartisan work we’ve done with ABLE Accounts – to help the disabled and their families save for the future without endangering their current benefits.  “Senator Casey and I have long worked on this issue.“The nature of work has changed and disability employment policy needs to change with it.  For example, virtual work can help people with disabilities use technology to erase outdated notions of disability for many.“We also need to help those with disabilities who are determined to return to work but worry about the financial consequences of doing so.  Lessons from Ticket To Work will help find newer and more effective strategies.“We must incentivize a return to work for those who are willing. “And we also need robust continuing disability reviews to make sure those who are un-willing, but capable of work, are not simply using up resources better sent to those in actual need.“Everyone knows a disability benefits abuse story.  There should be a bipartisan commitment to rooting it out.  It’s just plain stealing from the most vulnerable.“So, to our witnesses again: welcome. I look forward to hearing from you and asking how you will approach the management of these very important agencies within the Department of Labor.” "

During her nomination hearing in April, Ms. Abruzzo admitted she recommended firing General Counsel Robb from the very position she is now nominated, apparently contradicting her previous statement to Congress that she had no involvement in the decision. It’s important we have both independence and integrity in the General Counsel’s office. I remain unconvinced that Ms. Abruzzo will bring these values to the position. For that reason I have voted against advancing her nomination.”On May 12, 2021, the Senate HELP Committee voted 11-11 on Ms. Abruzzo’s nomination. As a result of the tied vote, the Senate today voted 50-48 to advance Ms. Abruzzo’s nomination to be considered by the full Senate.On April 29, 2021, before her nomination hearing, Senator Burr raised concerns about the Biden Administration’s unprecedented firings, partisan actions, and qualifications of President Biden’s labor nominees.Senator Burr later questioned Ms. Abruzzo on her involvement in the partisan removal of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb."
https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/7/burr-raises-concerns-over-lhamons-record-at-department-of-education-partisan-rhetoric-on-title-ix-rule,"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held itsnomination hearing for Catherine Lhamon to be Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education, Elizabeth Brown to be General Council of the Department of Education, and Roberto Rodriguez to be Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development at the Department of Education. Ranking Member Richard Burr’s Prepared Opening Statement:“Good morning. Thank you Chair Murray for scheduling this hearing to examine these Department of Education nominees.“To our witnesses, congratulations on your nominations and welcome.“These are important education policy positions. “Today, I’m going to spend most of my time talking about the role Ms. Lhamon will play at the Office for Civil Rights and the serious concerns I have from the last time she had this job.“I have two chief concerns. First, if confirmed, it seems that Ms. Lhamon will charge ahead unraveling significant pieces of the previous Administration’s Title IX rule.“Second, I am not convinced Ms. Lhamon understands, or at least appreciates, the limits of her authority.“When Secretary DeVos issued the Title IX rule on campus sexual assault, Ms. Lhamon tweeted about it saying, “Secretary DeVos presides over taking us back to the bad old days that predate my birth, when it was permissible to rape and sexually harass students with impunity. Today’s students deserve better, including fair protections consistent with law.”“That’s just plain offensive. This type of over-heated rhetoric doesn’t reflect the actual facts or ease partisan tensions on important and sensitive topics. “Ms. Lhamon admitted in her meeting with me and her interview with Committee staff that she agreed with many aspects of the rule; yet, by her tweet, no one would know it.“I imagine that she was taking aim at the due process protections in the rule — the opportunity for a hearing and cross-examination.“But those two provisions are rooted in federal court precedent.“For example, the 6th Circuit has said, ‘[t]he Due Process Clause mandates that a university provide accused students a hearing with the opportunity to conduct cross-examination….if a public university has to choose between competing narratives to resolve a case, the university must give the accused student or his agent an opportunity to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder.’“And the 3rd Circuit has said, ‘[t]he basic elements of federal procedural fairness in a Title IX sexual-misconduct proceeding include a real, meaningful hearing and, when credibility determinations are at issue, the opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses.’“And no greater authority on legal protections for women than the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg echoed a similar position telling The Atlantic in 2018, ‘there’s been criticism of some college codes of conduct for not giving the accused person a fair opportunity to be heard, and that’s one of the basic tenets of our system, as you know, everyone deserves a fair hearing.’“But I have concerns Ms. Lhamon doesn’t share these views. The last time she had this job she issued guidance that allowed schools to forgo hearings and the due process rights of both parties to have a cross-examination. “Instead, the guidance allowed schools to use what is known as a single-investigator model, which vested in one person the power to be the judge, jury, and executioner.“So it seems to me instead of listening to Justice Ginsburg our nominee is listening to Lewis Carroll and has a sentence first, verdict afterwards mentality.“I don’t think due process protections or even the concept of cross examination warrant the level of vitriol aimed at the DeVos rule and I think Secretary DeVos deserves an apology.“And if Ms. Lhamon is confirmed, I think she will need to be very careful about any changes to this rule.“Federal courts will stand up for due process even if the Biden Administration won’t.“Ms. Lhamon also doesn’t seem to appreciate the limits on the power of the Executive Branch.“For example, she has expressed a distorted view of the appropriate use of agency guidance, which, unlike regulations, do not go through a formal notice and comment process.“At a hearing before this Committee in 2014, Ms. Lhamon told the former Chairman of this Committee, Lamar Alexander, that she believes that guidance is binding on institutions of higher of education.“Yet, here is what the experts say on that. The Administrative Conference of the United States says that guidance documents are nonbinding statements of interpretation, policy, and advice about the implementation of statutes or regulations. “The Supreme Court has said that guidance is meant to advise the public and does not have the force and effect of law.“However, Ms. Lhamon bullied schools into complying with guidance by telling them that they could lose federal funding —  the ultimate punishment that has rarely been used — if they did not abide by guidance documents, saying and this is a quote, ‘do not think it’s an empty threat.’“While Ms. Lhamon told me that her enforcement practices were enforcing the law, not guidance, her guidance laid out overly prescriptive requirements on institutions like a specific standard of evidence and specific investigative practices not found anywhere in civil rights laws. “Courts have also criticized this enforcement posture of OCR under Ms. Lhamon’s leadership.“The 7th Circuit pointed out that multiple circuit courts have considered that the guidance and accompanying pressure of a Department Education Title IX investigation gives an accused student a story about why an institution ‘might have been motivated to discriminate against males accused of sexual assault.’“Even OCR employees during Ms. Lhamon’s tenure recognized the pressure OCR put on universities. A lawyer who worked in OCR in both the Obama and Trump administrations, said in an interview that ‘[w]e did see some bad cases in the Obama era, cases where it basically didn't matter what evidence there was. The college was going to find against the defendant, the male defendant, no matter what. I think the schools felt pressure under the Obama guidance.’“So, colleges and universities are right to be confused if she’s saying to them that following her guidance is mandatory and then she’s telling Congress that she means something different.“That sort of pressure comes from the top, and Ms. Lhamon’s history is deeply troubling if not outright disqualifying. “Lastly, I would like to submit six letters into the record representing over 100 professors, attorneys, Title IX experts, and other professionals opposing Ms. Lhamon’s return to lead OCR at the Department of Education.“Next, I want to touch briefly on the general counsel position. The general counsel probably has the more difficult job of making sure Department officials follow the law the way we here in Congress wrote it. “So, I hope that, as a lawyer, Ms. Brown, you will see that happens.“One of the big issues I am concerned about is that this Administration is going to take the position that they have the authority to issue mass student loan forgiveness.“The Department of Education is expected to issue a legal opinion on that issue. However, the Trump Administration determined that the Department did not have such authority and their legal argument is very convincing. “Ms. Brown you will likely play a role in formulating and signing off on the legal opinion for this Administration, so I am interested in hearing your thoughts on that.“In my view, nowhere in the law do I see that authority. To quote the Supreme Court, ‘Congress…does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouse holes.’“To find that the federal government has had this authority and no one knew it until now would be a huge elephant so to speak. “Lastly, before I close, I want to mention an issue I’m having with this Administration when it comes to responses from nominees.“As part of the vetting process, I have been asking all nominees about their social media accounts.  One, to tell me if they have them and what they have posted, and two, to tell me if they’ve ever deleted a post or an account.“For some reason, none of the nominees want to answer the second question.  This is unacceptable and makes it seem like these nominees have something to hide. I’ve written to the White House about this and I hope we can get answers soon. “So to our witnesses again: welcome. I look forward to hearing from you and asking how you will do these very important jobs within the Department of Education.”"

After failing to implement recommended reforms upon taking office, Ms. Su instead eliminated important safeguards at the height of the pandemic, contributing to up to $30 billion lost through fraudulent payments. This directive, among many others, led to operational failures of extreme proportions and should not be rewarded with a promotion. I remain concerned that Ms. Su’s record leaves her unqualified for the role of Deputy Secretary of Labor and for these reasons I have voted against her confirmation.”The Senate HELP Committee voted 13-9 to advance Ms. Su’s nomination to be considered by the full Senate on April 21, 2021.On March 16, 2021, before her nomination hearing, Senator Burr questioned Ms. Su on California’s massive unemployment crisis and fraud."

https://www.burr.senate.gov/2021/6/burr-murray-announce-new-oversight-as-part-of-bipartisan-pandemic-preparedness-effort,"Today, U.S. Senator Richard Burr, Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate HELP Committee, announced three new areas of bipartisan oversight as part of their ongoing work to develop policy proposals aimed at improving the nation’s public health and medical preparedness and response programs.At the Senators’ direction, bipartisan HELP Committee staff will begin oversight and investigation aimed at the following:  “More than 600,000 Americans have died as a result of novel coronavirus, but the trauma and tragedy inflicted by this pandemic is sadly not over yet,” said Ranking Member Burr. “The Senate HELP Committee is preparing to draft legislation to implement lessons learned from COVID-19 and to address shortcomings in America’s public health architecture, medical preparedness, and future pandemic responses. As part of these investigations, Committee staff will be looking into the origins of COVID-19. This bipartisan, all-source investigation will examine the differences between a natural viral outbreak of animal origin and a possible release from a laboratory, leveraging information from federal agencies and relevant experts. Our goal is to provide a clearer picture of what we know so far about the origins of this outbreak, so we are better prepared to respond to future public health threats.”“As we continue the work of ending this pandemic, I’m determined to make sure we ask the questions about how we got to this devastating point, and that we learn the lessons we need to learn so our country is never in this situation again,” said Chair Murray. “Questions around supply shortages, vaccine equity, and biosafety are among the many we need answered. I am hopeful these new oversight efforts will help us develop policy proposals that strengthen our public health infrastructure, improve our preparedness, and help ensure a more effective and equitable response to future public health crises. In addition, Congress should enact an independent, comprehensive assessment of our nation’s COVID-19 response—and I look forward to working with the Ranking Member on that issue.”These oversight efforts will aim to inform bipartisan policy proposals being developed as part of the committee work Senators Burr and Murray announced in April 2021 on considering lessons learned during the COVID-19 response, and improving the nation’s public health infrastructure, medical preparedness and response programs, and capabilities at the local, state, territorial, Tribal, and federal levels."

This bipartisan legislation would level the playing field by establishing a new regulatory framework for the review and approval of diagnostic tests, accelerating innovation and ensuring Americans can rely on the test results they receive.“The coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the importance of diagnostic testing, particularly in the nation’s ability to respond quickly and effectively,” said Senator Burr. “Our testing framework must keep pace with today’s medical advancements to better prepare us for the next generation of products to detect diseases and help Americans engage in their health care choices. This legislation will help modernize the FDA review process for diagnostic tests for the first time. By creating a unified framework, we not only give test developers the certainty they need to invest in cutting-edge technologies and products, but also give Americans confidence in their tests results when making critical health care decisions. I’m proud to reintroduce this legislation with Senator Bennet and Representatives DeGette and Bucshon during this historic time.”“Diagnostic tests are integral to patient care and have the potential to save lives and costs to our health care system,” said Senator Bennet. “The rise in diagnostic innovation has produced more complex tests, which require the highest standards to ensure safety. By creating a new FDA regulatory process for diagnostic tests, our VALID Act would protect patients, create certainty to support innovation, and improve health outcomes for all Americans.“If we’ve learned anything from combatting the spread of highly contagious viruses – such as MERS, SARS, Ebola and now COVID-19 – it’s that time is of the essence,” said Representative DeGette. “We can’t allow an outdated and inefficient system to hold us back when trying to respond to an emerging threat, such as the coronavirus. This legislation will ensure that our hospitals and laboratories have the ability to respond quickly, accurately and efficiently to help us detect and stop the spread of these diseases before it’s too late.”“In the operating room time is a precious commodity – even the smallest delay can be the difference between life or death for a patient,” said Dr. Bucshon. “Recent advancements in diagnostic testing technology have transformed the speed and accuracy in which doctors receive this life-changing information, giving patients and doctors what they need most: more time. The VALID Act makes sure that a safe, accurate, and risk-based framework is in place to allow leading edge development and innovation to thrive in our hospitals and laboratories, while assuring doctors and patients that their test results are analytically and clinically valid.”Background:The landscape of diagnostic testing has advanced at a rapid pace over the last two decades. Today, more tests are available to help doctors and patients make health care decisions, Americans are purchasing direct-to-consumer tests, and new tests are being developed at a rapid pace.While the use of diagnostic testing has grown, much of the regulatory framework for these tests is outdated, having been established more than 30 years ago under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988. The VALID Act will modernize the review process for diagnostic testing, clarify the regulatory authority between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and limit duplication between the two agencies. This legislation will ensure the same standards are in place regardless of the test’s developer, allow laboratories to develop diagnostic tests within the same category without pausing for additional regulatory review to foster more innovation, and give Americans the assurance they need to rely on their test results.The VALID Act section-by-section can be found here and the bill text can be found here."
