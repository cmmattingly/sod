https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-visits-with-oklahoma-state-chamber-in-washington,"September 23, 2022This week, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), spoke with the State Chamber of Oklahoma during their annual fly-in trip to Washington. The group discussed a number of topics, including Inhofe’s continued work on the National Defense Authorization Act and his career-long effort to continue to make Oklahoman’s priorities heard in Congress. “For the last time in Washington, I had a great the honor of meeting with the Oklahoma State Chamber,” Inhofe said. “I have had the pleasure to work with the Chamber for all of these years to make Oklahoma’s priorities a reality in Congress, and I loved getting to reminisce on all we’ve gotten done together.“Without the Oklahoma State Chamber, we would not be in the great shape we are as a state today and I am proud of all we have been able to accomplish together over the years. We also had the opportunity to discuss all we have proposed in my last National Defense Authorization Act and all I am working to accomplish in this year’s defense bill. I know the state is in good hands with these folks working hard at the helm.””It’s always great when Oklahoma business leaders have the chance to go one-on-one with our delegation in Washington, and be able to talk in-person about the issues and challenges facing our economy and business community,” said Chad Warmington, President and CEO of The State Chamber of Oklahoma. “Time with Sen. Inhofe is invaluable. Our D.C. Fly-In delegation of members voiced their concerns and gained valuable insight into national issues that impact their businesses.”Additional photos from the event can be found here.   "

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) joined Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Republican Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), as well as 30 other colleagues, in sending a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding that U.S. Attorney David Weiss be extended special counsel protections and authorities to conduct the investigation into Hunter Biden:“There is no way of  knowing the entire scope of the investigation, but evidence seems to be mounting that Hunter Biden committed numerous federal crimes, including, but not limited to, tax fraud, money laundering and foreign-lobbying violations,” the senators wrote Attorney General Garland.“Given that the investigation involves the President’s son, we believe it is important to provide U.S. Attorney Weiss with special counsel authorities and protections to allow him to investigate an appropriate scope of potentially criminal conduct, avoid the appearance of impropriety and provide additional assurances to the American people that the Hunter Biden investigation is free from political influence.”“Given the politicization of the DOJ under your watch and the importance of avoiding any appearance of impropriety, the undersigned request that you provide U.S. Attorney Weiss the full protections and authorities of a special counsel. This is one important action that you can take that will go a long way in restoring faith in our governmental institutions.”                Full text of the senators’ letter is here.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-recognizes-2022-oklahoma-angels-in-adoption-award-recipient,"September 22, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) yesterday congratulated Edmond resident Sarah Tippit for receiving the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute’s “Angels in Adoption” award.         “Having experienced the joys of adoption within my own family, I am all the more excited to congratulate Sarah Tippit on being selected as a 2022 Angels in Adoption® Honoree.“For four years now, Sarah has been a beacon of light and hope to many children in her community. By giving her foster and adopted children a safe and loving home, Sarah is a beautiful example of how adoption can bless your life and the lives of those around you.”More about Sarah’s story:Sarah Tippit was initially exposed to the foster care system through her friendship with a family with foster kids. That family’s friendship and example inspired Sarah to begin fostering children on her own, beginning in 2018. Over the course of her fostering and adoption story, she has fostered six kids and adopted three, all the while making an incredible impact in the lives of these vulnerable children.What’s most inspiring about Sarah is the fact that she saw an opportunity to do something that would improve the lives of children in her community, and she didn’t hesitate to act. Although she had no prior experience with foster care or adoption, she devoted herself to providing a safe and loving home for these children. Like many children in the foster care system, the children she has fostered and adopted have had unique struggles which have not been easy to overcome.One of the many ways that Sarah has bettered the lives of the children in her home is by keeping sibling units together through foster care and adoption. She had already adopted two children out of the foster care system when she received a call about adopting one of her children’s biological brother. She didn’t think twice and said yes to adopting her third child.As a single mom, Sarah has devoted herself to loving and caring for the children who have come into her home. She has committed herself to understanding the ripple effects of childhood trauma and how to care for children with unstable backgrounds. Sarah now lives in Edmond, Oklahoma with her three adopted children and continues to be a force for good in the lives of her children.The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute’s Angels in Adoption® Program honors a wide spectrum of individuals and organizations making extraordinary contributions in adoption, permanency and child welfare. Each year, the Angels in Adoption® awardees travel to Washington, D.C., to both celebrate their hard work and dedication to the issues and participate in special events designed to engage them in using their personal experience to effect change on behalf of children in need of families."

Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, expressing concerns with the recent announcement regarding changes to the United States Anti-Personnel Landmine policy.The members wrote: “We are writing to you today to express our concerns regarding the June 21 announcement regarding changes to the United States Anti-Personnel Landmine policy.”The members continued: “Specifically, we are concerned that the review process described by the administration failed to adequately account for the likely negative impacts to U.S. military operational effectiveness; used overly-optimistic assumptions in evaluating the projected costs and timeline estimates associated with the destruction and replacement of existing Department of Defense equipment inventories; and ultimately sought to implement the provisions of the Ottawa Convention, a treaty to which the United States Senate has not provided advice and consent.”The full letter can be found here and below:Dear Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, and General Milley:We are writing to you today to express our concerns regarding the June 21 announcement regarding changes to the United States Anti-Personnel Landmine policy.Specifically, we are concerned that the review process described by the administration failed to adequately account for the likely negative impacts to U.S. military operational effectiveness; used overly-optimistic assumptions in evaluating the projected costs and timeline estimates associated with the destruction and replacement of existing Department of Defense equipment inventories; and ultimately sought to implement the provisions of the Ottawa Convention, a treaty to which the United States Senate has not provided advice and consent.As we have seen in the recent conflict in Ukraine, landmines remain an important tool in modern warfare – one that the United States military should not unilaterally relinquish in the absence of a readily accessible alternative capability. During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2022, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley noted:I do think landmines are important, especially if you're in the defense, but also in any other capability in order to shape enemy operations... We need to look no further than what's happening actually in Ukraine. Landmines are being effectively used…to shape the avenues of approach by Russian armored forces…So that's one of the reasons why you see column after column of Russian vehicles that are destroyed. So anti-tank or anti-personnel mines are very effective use in combat.Considering the obvious operational benefits of anti-personnel landmines, the United States should not unnecessarily issue a policy depriving U.S. troops access to anti-personnel landmines currently in DoD stocks simply to pursue an ideal that our adversaries will not follow. Implementing such a blanket policy seems particularly questionable when one considers that all landmines currently in the U.S. operational inventory already incorporate technologically advanced safeguards limiting harm to noncombatants – safeguards that exceed the standards outlined in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.In addition to our concerns regarding the impact of this newly-implemented landmine policy on U.S. military effectiveness, we are also deeply troubled by the ends the administration purports to achieve through issuance of this policy.The White House press release outlined an objective to make the United States “…compliant with and ultimately acced[e] to the Ottawa Convention…” However, the administration has not indicated any intention or plans to submit the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (the “Ottawa Convention”) to the United States Senate for advice and consent. Such actions appear to be an attempt to circumvent the Senate’s exclusive Article II, section 2 constitutional authority and bind the United States to the requirements of an unratified treaty,. Such actions threaten to erode the vital system of checks and balances upon which our democracy depends.For these reasons, we request that the Secretary of Defense provide our committees with:We further request the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provide an assessment of the effects of the elimination of the existing anti-personnel landmine inventory, to include the family of scatterable mines that contain anti-personnel or anti-handling submunitions, on current U.S. operational plans and our ability to provide effective support to allies and partners in shaping enemy operations, such as in the current situation in Ukraine.Finally, we request the Secretary of State provide our committees with:We thank you for your prompt reply to these important matters of national security.  Sincerely,"

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) released the following statement after voting against the ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the United Nations’ Montreal Protocol which seeks to phasedown the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): “The Kigali Amendment is an Obama-era, United Nations proposal that further advances the climate alarmist agenda that the Biden administration has proudly made their own—this is a bad deal for America,” Inhofe said. “While I applaud Senator Sullivan’s amendment that ensures China is not given a pass from adhering to the same commitment as the U.S., unfortunately, the Kigali Amendment yields American sovereignty on environmental regulation to the United Nations and will send consumer prices higher in the process. Not only has the Biden administration continued to push their liberal agenda on the rest of us, sending inflation rates skyrocketing, but now this amendment will make it more expensive for Oklahoma families and businesses to purchase and maintain household goods like refrigerators and air conditioners. I had to vote against ratifying it today.” "

Hazy Lecturer at Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Center for International Security and Cooperation; the Honorable Eric S. Edelman, Counselor at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and Director, of the United States Institute of Peace. Inhofe: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Maybe it’s my age, but I enjoyed some of the reflections from the past that we shared this morning. Mr. Edelman when you said, “When we quit building, the Soviets build.” How prophetic that was.Mr. Miller, numerous Senior military officers have testified to their support for the continuing the Sea Launch cruise missile program as a means of offsetting the growth of Russia and China’s nuclear arsenals, and I agree with this support. I’d ask you, first of all do you believe we should continue this program, and you should be able to continue other enhancements as well? Now, you offered in your opening statement to elaborate a little bit on that subject and I’ll give you that chance now.Miller: Thank you, Sen. Inhofe. Yes, I agree that a nuclear sea launch cruise missile is important, both to deter Russia and China, each of which have large tactical nuclear arsenals, and to reassure our allies who are faced by those specific tactical nuclear arsenals. So, it is a program that I think is modest but I think makes a useful contribution, and I don’t think it creates any sort of arms race potential because we are basically at low levels there and Russia and China have much higher levels.Inhofe: Yes, I agree with that excellent statement. This question is for all of the witnesses: considering what we know about China’s nuclear breakout and Russia’s large non-strategic nuclear weapons arsenal, do any of you believe that the United States should not continue modernizing its own forces? I’d like to have each one of you respond to that.Creedon: Sen. Inhofe, I completely agree that the United States must continue its modernization programs of all three legs of the triad.Gottemoller: I too agree that the United States must continue its modernization programs at pace across the program of record.Edelman: Sen. Inhofe, as I said in my opening oral remarks, I think it is imperative that we do so to sustain deterrence into the future.Miller: Senator, I absolutely agree. As I said in my remarks, I think in the out-years in the 2030’s we may need to augment that program by buying more SSPNS and more long-range stand-off weapons, and I’m happy to elaborate on that at some point, if you want.Inhofe: Thank you very much and I appreciate the specifics from each one of you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-speaks-on-senate-floor-urging-schumer-senate-democrats-to-take-up-must-pass-defense-bill,"September 20, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, spoke on the Senate floor today urging Senate Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to bring to the floor the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which authorizes funding levels and provides key authorities for the U.S. military and other defense priorities. As Prepared for Delivery:There’s this little old document that no one reads anymore called the Constitution, and I think some of my colleagues should give it another read today. The Constitution tells us what Congress is supposed to be doing here, and that’s national defense. It’s right there at the top. So, for 61 years in a row, Congress has fulfilled this duty by passing a National Defense Authorization Act to strengthen the common defense and support our troops. 61 years – that’s a pretty long track record. This year will be number 62, and I’m proud to say that I’ve had the opportunity to vote on over half of them. So I think I have a pretty good understanding of what it takes to get this bill done. The way this typically works, the House does their bill. Then the Senate does ours, and we go to conference and create a bipartisan, bicameral conference report. That takes time — months really. So, when I look at the legislative calendar, I get concerned. The days are ticking down, and frankly, we’re running out of time to get this bill done the right way. Senator Reed and I believe deeply in this bill. We held a markup on June 15 and reported out a strong, bipartisan bill. That’s three months ago. We’ve got an election in November that will likely eat away at the limited time we do have. We saw last year what happens when this bill isn’t given enough floor time. Last year, Majority Leader Schumer waited until the last possible moment to try to jam through the NDAA without debate right before Thanksgiving. If he delays again, we don’t get an open amendment process, where every Senator has another chance to improve the bill. If he delays, we get jammed in negotiating a conferenced bill with the House. The whole process will take longer, which leaves our military with more uncertainty and prevents them from moving out and getting things done. There are real consequences to waiting this long. It’s bad for this institution, it’s bad for our troops, and it’s bad for our national security. I understand some of my colleagues, including the Majority Leader, have different priorities than I do, but I think this is the most important bill we do all year. This year, that’s as true as ever. It’s hard to overstate the scale and scope of the threats we face. Senator Reed and I believe deeply in this bill because it responds to those threats and it takes care of our troops. We finished markup three months ago. We could have gotten started on it already. Selfishly, I want to get this bill done because it will be my last. I would hate to leave here without finishing the NDAA — without fulfilling our promises to our troops and to the American people. I would hate even more to see this bill’s six-decade track record broken. For the last four years, as Chairman and now as Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, I have fought tirelessly to pass this bill. I know the Majority Leader doesn’t want to be responsible for the demise of Congress’s last remaining annual authorization bill.  There’s really no time to waste. The Senate must consider the NDAA now."

I also want to welcome our witnesses, and thank you all for your long service to our nation. Today, we are facing greater nuclear threats than at any time since the worst days of the Cold War – threats that are expected to become even worse in the coming years.China’s massive military investments, especially its stunning nuclear breakout, will reshape the global balance of power in ways we have never seen before. Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and his pursuit of new nuclear capabilities clearly demonstrate that Russia remains a primary threat to the West.The U.S. has never faced two nuclear armed peer adversaries. It's clear to me that we are not prepared for this reality. Despite ongoing efforts to modernize, our own nuclear forces are older and less capable than they have been in the past. Our supporting infrastructure is literally crumbling.Thankfully, the Biden administration did not adopt some of the more radical options discussed during the recent Nuclear Posture Review. However, the administration’s decision to discard planned enhancements to our forces, even as China and Russia grow their arsenals, was disappointing to say the least.Based in part on the advice of numerous senior officers, we have taken bipartisan steps to reverse those faulty choices, but we have much more work to be done. Each of you represents decades of experience in nuclear issues, and I am glad you are here to offer us your perspectives on the challenges we face and how we can best prepare our nation for dealing with a dangerous future. I look forward to your testimony. Mr. Chairman"
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-fights-for-oklahoma-small-businesses-urges-nlrb-to-abandon-harmful-joint-employer-standard,"September 19, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) sent a letter today urging the National Labor Relations Board to abandon efforts to implement a rule that, if finalized, could deeply harm thousands of Oklahoma small businesses. Under the Obama Administration, a similar rule cost the franchise sector $33.3 billion per year, resulting in more than 375,000 lost job opportunities, and almost doubled the amount of costly and time-consuming litigation against franchise businesses, which thwarted economic growth.Inhofe writes: “On September 6, 2022, the National Labor Relations Board announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revisit the current regulation setting forth standards for joint­ employer status under the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA"" or ""the Act""). I write to urge the Board to abandon this effort in order to prevent the deep harm that it would cause to our nation's economy, particularly for small business owners.”Inhofe continues: “…In contrast to the current rule, a more expansive joint-employer standard in place prior to the current rule was inefficient, exceedingly expensive, and resulted in the creation of fewer jobs. In fact, an economic analysis by the International Franchise Association in 2019 concluded that, in the franchise sector alone, this standard cost businesses $33.3 billion per year, resulted in more than 375,000 lost job opportunities, and almost doubled the amount of costly and time­ consuming litigation. At a time when we are facing the highest inflation rates in four decades and arguably are already experiencing an economic recession, a reversion to such ill-advised policies would only make these problems worse.”Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Chair McFerran:On September 6, 2022, the National Labor Relations Board announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revisit the current regulation setting forth standards for joint­ employer status under the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA"" or ""the Act""). I write to urge the Board to abandon this effort in order to prevent the deep harm that it would cause to our nation's economy, particularly for small business owners.According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there are over 360,000 small businesses in Oklahoma, and nearly all are subject to the NLRA. In 2020, the Board, via notice and comment rulemaking, published a final rule adopting a standard for joint-employer status under the Act. That rule, which continues to be in effect today, provides that an employer will be considered a joint employer under the NLRA only where it exercises ""substantial direct and immediate control"" over the essential terms and conditions of another company's employee. The rule rejected prior standards adopted by the Board, which held that indirect control or the mere reserved right of control - even if never exercised - could be sufficient to find one company liable as the joint employer of another company's employees.The 2020 rule protects employees whose employment terms are truly controlled by more than one company, while allowing employers clarity and certainty as to their obligations under the law. I urge the Board to maintain this standard.In contrast to the current rule, a more expansive joint-employer standard in place prior to the current rule was inefficient, exceedingly expensive, and resulted in the creation of fewer jobs. In fact, an economic analysis by the International Franchise Association in 2019 concluded that, in the franchise sector alone, this standard cost businesses $33.3 billion per year, resulted in more than 375,000 lost job opportunities, and almost doubled the amount of costly and time­ consuming litigation. At a time when we are facing the highest inflation rates in four decades and arguably are already experiencing an economic recession, a reversion to such ill-advised policies would only make these problems worse.Further, revising the Board's existing rule is premature and cannot be sufficiently justified under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). It is well-settled that under the APA, an agency may change existing policy but must ""provide a reasoned explanation for the change,"" Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 57 U.S. 211,221 (2016); and ""show that there are good reasons for the new policy."" Id at 221. The Board adopted the existing rule in 2020, but since that time the Board has not issued any decision actually applying the current regulatory framework. In the absence of any experience with the new rule, or evidence to show how or why it purportedly fails to effectuate the purposes of the Act, it is difficult to understand how the Board could justify any significant update to a rule that is two years old.For these reasons, I urge that the Board reconsider its NPRM for joint-employer status under the National Labor Relations Act that could deeply harm small businesses in Oklahoma and throughout our country.Sincerely,  "

U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, questioned General Anthony J. Cotton, USAF, nominee for
reappointment to the grade of general and to be Commander, United States
Strategic Command. Click here to view Inhofe’s
remarks. Inhofe:
Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I do have three questions, and while you have addressed all
three of these I will give you the chance to elaborate a little bit more, if
that's your desire. General Cotton, we all know how critical it is that we
rebuild our nation’s nuclear deterrent, but we’re still years away from
fielding any new systems. In terms of your priorities, how important is it that
we accelerate as much of the U.S. nuclear modernization plan as possible?Cotton:
Senator,
thank you for the question. I think about it this way, if confirmed I think the
challenge of strategic command is to ensure that we sustain legacy system as we
transition to the modernized system. That's going to be key for us. In order to
do that, it's going to take the full power of government to be able to pull
that together. Especially when we're talking about the sentinel weapons system,
and Columbia, and all the five that I have under my purview as a current Joint
Forces Air Component Commander working for the Commander of STRATCOM. Being
able to do that, sir, I think a couple of key things are going to be required
from us. We are going to need stable, predictable, and adequate and timely
funding. My job if confirmed as a commander of STRATCOM is to ensure that we
also have stable requirements because what we're going to see, and what I think
is going to be great for us with the new modernized systems, is the fact that
were by design building in a system that we know will last for decades because
that's built into the system. The modularity that we will see will be able to
keep pace with the threats that we will see in the future. What we need to do
in the meantime though, is sustain the legacy system that is still safe, secure
and effective as we make that transition.Inhofe: That's good, and
I appreciate that very much. It's already been mentioned a couple times,
talking about the two peer adversaries, this is something that we have not done
before. This is new. Even though you did already address this, you've been
asked this question even by the Chairman. I'd like to give you the opportunity
to expand, if you want to, on how we are going to handle this. What's going to
be different about two adversaries?Cotton:
Thank
you, Senator. What's different, is two near peers that actually act differently
from a doctrine's perspective. We understand Russian nuclear theory and nuclear
doctrine, minimal deterrence is what we thought of when we talked of China, as
recent as 2018. We have seen the incredible expansiveness of what they're doing
with their nuclear force, which does not, in my opinion, reflect minimal
deterrence. They have a bonafide triad now. We're going to have to understand,
more deeply, the Chinese nuclear strategy.Inhofe: Alright, I
appreciate that. Now the Chairman did talk about this before, I am going to
frame the question as my last question a little bit differently, General
Cotton. A number of senior military officers have testified to their
support for continuing the sea-launched cruise missile program, including the Chairman
and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Chief of Naval Operations and
the Commanders of U.S. Strategic and European Commands.  Do you agree with
these leaders and your colleagues that we should keep this program going? I'd
like you to be as specific as possible, because we all know what the program is
and we've all expressed ourselves on it, so I'd like to have your thoughts on
this.Cotton: Yes, Senator.
So, the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and the current commander of the US
Strategic Command absolutely understand where they are on the endorsement of
continuing.Inhofe: That's correct.Cotton: From my
perspective, I absolutely understand that they're looking at the capability gap
to be able to do that. The only thing that's different between they and I, is I
have yet to do an assessment on the weapons system itself. I absolutely
understand where they are on being able to have a capability gap that is filled
that they have seen. I have seen that capability gap as well, and I endorse the
fact that we need to fill that capability gap.Inhofe: Thank you,
General."

I also want to welcome General Cotton, and thank him for his long service in defense of our nation. General Cotton, your predecessor appeared before this committee several times over the past few years, warning of the growing strategic threats we face as a nation.China’s massive military investments are shifting the balance of power in the Pacific, even as its builds the capacity to extend its reach across the globe. Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and his reckless threats of nuclear escalation remind us of some of the worst days of the Cold War. Effectively resisting Russian and Chinese aggression requires that we remain resolute and deal with the world as it is, and not simply with how we might prefer it to be.I was pleased that the administration’s nuclear posture review declined to purse many policy options that would have severely damaged our nation’s deterrent. However, the administration’s decision to discard planned enhancements to our forces, even as China and Russia grow their arsenals, was disappointing to say the least. Your predecessor, along with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other senior officers, voiced their objections to these decisions, and, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken steps to reverse those faulty choices. Moving forward, we need to accelerate the work to right-size our forces to meet the strategic deterrence requirements of the coming decades. I trust you will be an advocate for such efforts if confirmed as the next STRATCOM commander. I look forward to your testimony. Mr. Chairman."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) joined his fellow Senate Republicans, led by U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), in expressing concerns with the establishment of a permanent government price-setting program, funded by billions of taxpayer dollars, in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act, and raising questions regarding federal health agencies’ plans for program implementation. In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator (CMS) Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the senators highlight the outsized risks the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses and the American economy as a whole, and urges the officials to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D) and domestic manufacturing.From the letter:“As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years.…“Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.  The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.”The letter is signed by: Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Thune (R-S.D.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary Becerra and Administrator Brooks-LaSure:Congress recently acted, on a party-line basis, to establish a permanent government price-setting program for prescription drugs, financed with billions of taxpayer dollars and enforced through an unprecedented excise tax of up to 95 percent. We write to express concerns with the disruptive and distortive administrative undertaking that the implementation of this far-reaching federal expansion will inevitably represent, as well as to raise a number of questions regarding your department’s plans for putting this new program into practice. Given the outsize risks that the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, we urge you to weigh both direct and indirect impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), and domestic manufacturing as you take the first steps toward implementing this program.As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years. Scores of life-threatening conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer’s and sickle cell disease, could see a substantial decline in possible treatment options on the horizon. Moreover, based on CBO’s analysis, some manufacturers may choose to terminate participation in Medicare and Medicaid altogether as a result of the compulsory new price-setting program, jeopardizing access to a range of therapies and cures for the most vulnerable Americans. Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars. The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts. In light of the urgent importance of clarity and caution regarding the forthcoming implementation of this colossal government initiative, please provide the following information by the close of business on October 28, 2022:If you have questions about this request, please contact Conor Sheehey of the Senate Finance Committee staff. Sincerely,"
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-joins-letter-to-hhs-biden-administrations-overreaching-child-mask-mandate-must-end,"September 14, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Oka.) joined Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, yesterday in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra requesting that the department rescind its one-size-fits-all federal mask mandate on Head Start programs. Children six months to five years of age are currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but an HHS interim final rule (IFR) still requires all Head Start staff, volunteers, and children two years of age and older to wear masks – including when they are outside on the playground – and requires all staff and volunteers in Head Start educational facilities to be vaccinated.“This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it,” the senators wrote. “The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.”The Head Start program is a federal program that provides qualifying, low-income children with early education services. Program facilities are located throughout the nation and, up until the issuance of this IFR, individual locations had been able to set and enforce their own COVID-19 protocols. Although this rule has been halted by federal courts in several states, the only way to ensure it never sees the light of day is to permanently rescind it nationwide.  The letter was also signed by U.S. Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho). Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Thom Tillis (N.C.).  Full letter below:The Honorable Xavier Becerra                                                                                                           Secretary                                                                                                                                             U.S. Department of Health & Human Services                                                                              200 Independence Avenue, Southwest                                                                                  Washington, D.C. 20201Dear Secretary Becerra:Since November 2021, vaccine and mask mandates on Head Start and Early Head Start programs have been in effect as a result of a U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) interim final rule (IFR). We write to highlight how unnecessary these mandates continue to be and request that this IFR be rescinded immediately.As you know, as of January 31, 2022, this IFR requires Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. It also requires Head Start staff and volunteers to wear masks. But beyond these mandates, the IFR also requires students two years of age and older to wear masks despite the World Health Organization advising against mask mandates for children five years of age and younger.Up until the publication of this IFR in late 2021 – more than 18 months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic – individual Head Start programs across the nation had the flexibility to implement their own precautions that effectively protected staff, volunteers, and students in these facilities. This flexibility afforded each individual program the opportunity to establish health and safety protocols and other mitigation strategies that were consistent with state and local laws and recommendations that worked best for their staff, volunteers, and students. In fact, according to a December 2020 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this flexibility was effective, as the CDC found that individual programs successfully implemented recommendations that limited the transmission of COVID-19 in their facilities.The application of inflexible federal rules on individual Head Start programs through this IFR and the forcing of toddlers enrolled in these programs to wear masks even caught the attention of Congress. On May 3, 2022, the U.S. Senate passed a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of this IFR by a bipartisan vote of 55 to 41, with seven Democrats supporting the resolution and opposing the IFR.Prior to Senate consideration of the resolution, President Biden unfortunately committed to vetoing it. A primary reason for his opposition was because, at the time of Senate consideration, the CDC had not yet approved children five years of age and younger to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, on June 18, 2022, the CDC approved certain COVID-19 vaccines for children six months through five years of age. Head Start-aged children are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if their families so choose.This IFR continues to be an overly rigid, inflexible rule that complicates individual Head Start programs’ ability to operate and attract staff and volunteers – though there is a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – and we request that you immediately rescind it. The nation must continue to transition toward treating COVID-19 as an endemic condition and return to a sense of normalcy, and it is past time for Washington bureaucrats to allow Head Start programs to do the same.Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.   Sincerely,"
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-questions-nominee-to-be-the-administrator-of-the-federal-highway-administration,"September 14, 2022Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), questioned Mr. Shailen Bhatt, nominee to be the next Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration.Click here to view Inhofe’s remarks. Inhofe: Thank you Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that very much. I have the same problem I had once before – I will make sure that it doesn't happen again. But, Mr. Bhatt, in my home state of Oklahoma, our state Department of Transportation maintains an eight-year transportation plan, directing funds to projects that will have the greatest benefit to the people of Oklahoma. And I mention this because as we discussed in my office, that's what really needs to be done. Get on with it and get it done, and quit talking about it. You have a great reputation for keeping that kind of discipline which I appreciate very much. Due to the great work of our people in Oklahoma, Oklahoma has climbed from, and listen to this, from 49th to 5th in the nation in highway bridge infrastructure condition rankings with less than 1% of all highway bridges considered to be structurally deficient. And I bring this up because this flows right into the amount of work that you can get done because of your proven work ethic, and I look forward to that. So, in your experience, how do project delays affect infrastructure investments made by states and the Federal Government?Bhatt: Well thank you for that question, Senator Inhofe. I am still good friends with the former Director Mike Patterson, and I'm really pleased to hear that Oklahoma has made such great progress in bridge condition because that's a critical component of the transportation network. In terms of project delays, I think that whenever you have a project that is delayed, as the ranking member mentioned, the costs tend to go up because the longer things go, the more that they cost. I would start with safety as our number one priority, and I believe that hopefully every time we do a new project, we are increasing safety, and so any time we have a project that is delayed we are continuing in an unsafe condition up until we can get that project delivered as quickly as possible. So, in my time as a DOT leader, I've tried to always push as quickly as possible to get projects completed and, if confirmed, I will bring that same mindset to the Federal Highway Administration.Inhofe: Good. And I have no doubt about that because I'm concerned the Department of Transportation may not award, or may unfairly limit, future grant funding to eligible projects simply because those projects do not meet the Administration's overarching policy goals. So, Mr. Bhatt, what would be your vision of how the Department of Transportation would judge projects that add capacity to future grant programs?Bhatt: And thank you for that question as well Senator Inhofe. I think you started by talking about the plan that Oklahomans have come up with for their transportation system and that is a product of input of local officials, state officials and, to me, that represents the will of the people of Oklahoma for the transportation system...Inhofe: And the priorities that...Bhatt: ...the priorities that they would put forward. And so I believe that in terms of capacity projects – if there are capacity projects that states are going to bring forward – as a DOT director, I've had a capacity in every state that I've worked in, and if confirmed, judge those projects according to the law.Inhofe: I'm sure you will, and I have to add that it's unfair that you have all that beauty wrapped up into three little girls.Bhatt: Well, just in the interest of time I will be brief. I was hoping that they wouldn't look like me until later in life, but they don't. Inhofe: Thank you. Mr. Chairman."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-joins-lankford-colleagues-to-challenge-dept-of-education-on-its-progressive-gender-ideology-in-proposed-title-ix-rule,"September 14, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) joined a group of 12 Republican senators, led by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), to file a public comment on Department of Education’s recently proposed rule regarding Title IX compliance in schools and asking Secretary Miguel Cardona to withdraw the rule, citing that it undercuts the purpose of the law and promotes the left’s progressive gender ideology.Joining Inhofe and Lankford in sending the letter were U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Roger Marshall, M.D., (R-Kan.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) is leading the letter in the House of Representatives.The members write in their letter, “Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.”Inhofe also recently joined Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) and colleagues to send a letter to Education Secretary Cardona criticizing the Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX and urging an extension of the public comment period by 30 days.You can read the full letter HERE and below:Secretary Cardona,We write to express our grave concern with the intent and implications of the US Department of Education’s Proposed Rule: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, RIN 1870-AA16 (Proposed Rule), and urge the Administration to immediately withdraw the rule. Among other harmful changes, the Proposed Rule expands the scope of Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as Congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety.As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.1.      The Proposed Rule is inconsistent with the law, and is the latest attempt to erode the Congressional intent and statutory text of Title IX.On June 23, 1972, after in depth Congressional consideration and subsequent agreement, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX into law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives either direct or indirect federal funding.Title IX ensures women and girls are given the same opportunities in school afforded to men and boys. Unfortunately, over the past decade, two Administrations have attempted to undercut the statutory purpose of the law and to use it as a way to promote progressive gender ideology.In 2010 and 2011, the Obama Administration sent multiple Dear Colleague letters to every public school and university in the country to expand policies related to campus assault and harassment. Since it was merely a Dear Colleague letter and not a rule, these “regulations” were implemented outside of the formal federal rulemaking process, clearly in order to bypass such process.The Departments of Education and Justice subsequently sent another Dear Colleague letter in 2016, again to all public schools and universities in the country, claiming that, “[a]s a condition of receiving Federal funds,” schools must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX.”As a result, schools were prohibited from maintaining separate locker rooms, shower facilities, and restrooms for male and female students based on their biological differences. Because the letters lacked foundation in Title IX’s statutory text, and it attempted to create federal policy outside of the public rulemaking process, they did not carry the force of law, and created a lack of clarity around the scope, application and enforcement of Title IX. The policies pushed in the letters caused mass confusion among states, schools, parents and children.Thankfully, both letters were swiftly revoked in 2017. Further, the Trump Administration issued a rule to prevent and respond to instances of sexual harassment and assault. Among other things, the rule respected Title IX’s statutory text and Congressional intent; it protected both victims and the accused, while also taking important steps to ensure that religious freedom protected by clarifying what institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX.The current Administration has seized our nation’s primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, to enact political, social and cultural change, with no regard for the harmful repercussions or the rule of law. On his first day in office, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. Contrary to the protections Congress afforded to women and girls under Title IX, this Executive Order unfairly called for the elimination of equal opportunity for girls in sports and dangerously suggested that children in schools should not have access to sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms and other private spaces.As if that wasn’t enough, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a memorandum in March 2021 that further misinterpreted Title IX.  As a legal foundation for its misapplication of the law, DOJ cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that “an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.’” Notably, the opinion in Bostock explicitly stated that it applies only to hiring and firing decisions under Title VII, leaving other issues and other laws for another day.The Department of Education followed DOJ’s lead by publishing a notice of interpretation to assert that Title IX’s protections extend to claims based on “sexual orientation and gender identity.” This interpretation, which rewrites the plain meaning of sex, is now in the Proposed Rule.The Proposed Rule would radically redefine discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity (both of which are left without clear definitions), sex stereotypes, (defined as “fixed or generalized expectations regarding a person’s aptitudes, behavior, self-presentation, or other attributes based on sex”), and sex characteristics, (which includes “a person’s physiological sex characteristics and other inherently sex-based traits,” or “intersex traits”).The Proposed Rule claim that because the statute does not explicitly define sex as biological, “the Department does not construe the term ‘sex’ to necessarily be limited to a single component of an individual's anatomy or physiology.”To be clear, sex is biological. Unlike the assertions in the Proposed Rule, “sex” does not “encompass many traits.” Sex is not one’s self-asserted belief about himself or herself based on emotions, preference, self-presentation or behavior. Sex is binary. People are either male or female as demonstrated by their DNA, reproductive biology and other immutable characteristics. The proposed rule’s attempt to expand the definition of sex, while simultaneously neglecting to clearly define what the Department means by such an expansive definition, demonstrates that it is more focused on pushing an ideology rather than protecting individuals from discrimination.There is no question that this expansion of the meaning of sex goes far beyond the statute, Congressional intent, and Supreme Court opinions. Indeed, while the Proposed Rule attempts to find its footing in the holding of Bostock, the Court’s decision is based on the reality that sex refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female.”It’s clear that regardless of Title IX’s statutory text and the requirements of the rulemaking process, the Department of Education is pushing schools to apply Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to sexual orientation and gender identity. This is antithetical to the statutory text and congressional intent of Title IX and should not be finalized.2.      The Proposed Rule undercuts equal opportunities and neglects the safety and privacy rights of women and girls in education. By passing Title IX, Congress recognized the need for explicit laws to protect women and girls and promote a level playing field for equal opportunities within education. In addition to its dissonance with the law, the Proposed Rule will disadvantage and harm women and girls, as we have already seen a number of times where similar policies have been in place. The Proposed Rule says that “preventing any person from participating in an education program or activity consistent with their gender identity would subject them to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex and therefore be prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by Title IX or the regulations.” This scope reaches far and wide with little guardrails to protect women.Under the Proposed Rule, sex-specific spaces, including housing, bathrooms and locker rooms, at primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions will be based on undefined “gender identity.”The Proposed Rule rewrites the intent of Title IX in such a way that it could, and will, be used by those who desire to cause harm. The Proposed Rule will only make it harder for school officials to protect children, as child predators and those who are intending to cause harm to children could use these policies to gain access to private spaces such as bathrooms or locker rooms.The Proposed Rule should be clear that under Title IX, sex is biological and binary.Policies included in the Proposed Rule could require teachers, administrators, contractors and grantees to undergo training to “affirm” students’ sexual identities. This is a clear violation of the free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. Such policies could also purportedly compel teachers and school personnel to participate in teaching gender ideology in the classroom, including using preferred pronouns and names. Children and educators would be forced to learn and accept curriculum that affirms a progressive and baseless ideology with contrary opinions shared because of the threat of such dissent being considered discriminatory. For example, in Virginia, a French teacher was fired for refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns.The 2020 Title IX rule made clear that the Title IX does not restrict any rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, so it would not limit free speech or the free exercise of religion. The Department should similarly ensure that the Proposed Rule will not limit these Constitutional protections, especially for people of faith, at Title IX entities. Without such clarifications, it is possible that the Proposed Rule would have a chilling effect for people and groups of faith or those who hold prolife views, who will be afraid to speak about their beliefs at risk of being unjustly accused of harassment.Similarly, as the Proposed Rule promotes the affirmation of gender ideology and abortion, the Department should make clear that no student, teacher, administrator or employee of a Title IX covered entity will be compelled to affirm, teach or promote gender ideology in or out of the classroom.Neither the federal government nor any school, is in a position to govern the conscience and beliefs of students, parents, teachers or administrators. Traditional beliefs about gender, sex and marriage should be honored and respected in the public square, including schools. Our Constitution distinctly protects free speech and religious freedom. As such, the Department of Education must ensure these rights are afforded equal protection and respect.Further, parental rights must be foundational. Yet, the Proposed Rule seems to forget them. The Department should make clear that any attempt by a school to “affirm” a student’s gender identity that is incongruent with the child’s biological sex must be made known to the child’s parents, including anything related to social or medical transition. Schools and the government have never been and will never be a substitute for parents. All gender alterations – whether social or medical – could present serious, long-lasting physical, emotional and relational harm to children, such as infertility, bone development, brain development, and more. As such, schools should never hide such information from parents.The Proposed Rule claims to remain silent on the application of its policies to athletics, with the announcement of a separate, forthcoming rule. However, the policies outlined in the Proposed Rule have already and will continue to be a detriment to ensuring an equal playing field for women and girls in sports.The Department purports to claim that the Proposed Rule does not address women’s and girls’ athletics. Instead, the Department of Education said it “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.” But nothing in the text of the proposed regulations state that the prohibition against limiting participation based on gender identity does not apply.It is obvious that the Proposed Rule, as written, will disadvantage women and girls in sports, regardless of future rulemaking specific to athletics.The Proposed Rule explicitly states that a “recipient's education program or activity would also include all of its academic and other classes, extracurricular activities, athletics programs (emphasis added), and other aspects of the recipient's education program or activity.”The Department claimed to remain silent on the issue of sports, but they ignore the plain text of the Proposed Rule, which will quickly erode the integrity of athletics by requiring biological males who identify as transgender to compete on girls and women’s teams. By doing this, the Department is putting women at a disadvantage. Both the law and public opinion are clear; women and girls should be afforded equal opportunities to men and boys, and should not be forced to compete against males in athletics.The effects of the Proposed Rule will eliminate women's athletics by allowing individuals to compete based on definition-less gender identity. Despite 50 years of progress toward achieving equal opportunities for women and girls in education, this Proposed Rule will force women to sacrifice, by allowing men to take, athletic opportunities, team participation, trophies, awards, scholarships and more on the altar of progressive gender ideology.For example, high school girl track athletes were disadvantaged in Connecticut after the state’s unfair, gender identity policies permitted two biological males to compete in, and subsequently win a combined fifteen girl’s track championship titles previously held by nine women. One of these participants set a first-place record for the girl’s track event. The males’ participating and success prevented the girls from advancing to regional meets, taking away an opportunity for the girls to compete in front of college scouts.Men and women are biologically and physiologically different, which is why there are different men’s and women’s sports in the first place. It is self-evident and a scientific fact.It is also important to note that it is not discriminatory to acknowledge the difference between men and women. Disregarding it would, in many instances, such as athletics and physical capability, subject women to unfair standards and limit their ability to fully participate in educational opportunities. The Department has an obligation to ensure that any policy it puts forward, including this Proposed Rule, does not discriminate against women. This Proposed Rule completely misses that mark.3.      The Proposed Rule should explicitly affirm the previous rule’s clarification on religious freedom.Religious freedom is fundamental to society, including education. Since our nation’s founding, our laws have reiterated the importance of protecting, upholding and advancing religious freedom. In addition to both the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, Congress has enacted laws such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that the government cannot substantially burden religious exercise without a compelling government interest.Congress explicitly included language in Title IX to ensure that no part of the law would require religious institutions to forfeit their sincerely held religious beliefs in order to partner with the government or provide educational opportunities to students, regardless of whether the students share those religious beliefs.The law states that Title IX “shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” As such, religious educational institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization, even if the educational institution receives Federal financial assistance.Unfortunately, under the Obama Administration, religious schools were unfairly targeted. Schools were publicly shamed for living out their faith. They were also required to seek permission from the government to be exempt from Title IX.No law or policy should ever require religious organizations to seek permission from the government to live out their faith, nor should policies unjustly target or discriminate against schools based on religious status. The Proposed Rule should ensure that the integrity of the statutory exemption is upheld, and that the Department will not retaliate against schools that are exempt from Title IX by creating a public list, which will shame schools for living out the principles of their faith.When the current rule was proposed and finalized, it rightly clarified that Title IX applies only to recipients of Federal financial assistance. It expressly exempted educational institutions controlled by religious organizations from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the religious organization even if the educational institution does receive Federal financial assistance. It ensured that instead of actively having to seek an exemption that bureaucrats at the Department of Education get to evaluate, institutions can simply claim an exemption. The statute does not require schools to ask permission to live out their faith, so neither did the existing rule.It is notable that the Department does not address religious liberty in this rule, despite the fact that the “Religious Liberty and Free Inquiry Rule” is simultaneously pending with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). To the extent that the Department intends to propose changes in the Free Inquiry Rule that will impact the scope of which organizations qualify for religious exemptions under Title IX, the Free Inquiry Rule should be considered in conjunction with this Proposed Rule to ensure commenters and stakeholders have a fair opportunity to engage and comment. Further, we strongly encourage the Department to expressly maintain all of the protections afforded to religious institutions by the underlying statute and made clear by the 2020 regulation.4.      The Proposed Rule neglects to explicitly include and apply the abortion neutrality language in Title IX.In 1988, Congress amended Title IX to include abortion neutrality language to make clear that it does not confer a right to abortion. Congress clearly and deliberately, said that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require … any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.”Not surprisingly, the Administration is using this Proposed Rule, based in a law from 1972, to promote its pro-abortion agenda in the wake of the repeal of Roe v. Wade.We are concerned that the Proposed Rule’s definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” includes “pregnancy or related conditions,” which is defined as ""(1) Pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; (2) Medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; or (3) Recovery from pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, lactation, or their related medical conditions""). This definition disregards the abortion neutrality language and attempts to use Title IX to promote, and confer a right to, abortion. Notably, the Proposed Rule makes no mention of the existing, statutory abortion neutrality language. Further, the proposed rule expands the scope of pregnancy discrimination to apply to all education programs and activities, rather than just admissions.While we agree that no woman should be punished or discriminated against on account of her pregnancy, it is concerning that the Department goes as far as redefining sex discrimination to include “termination of pregnancy,” essentially equating abortion to pregnancy and childbearing. As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there is no federal right to abortion. That includes Title IX.The inclusion of this language in the proposed rule raises a number of unanswered questions, including whether educational institutions that refuse to provide access to abortion or abortion counseling will be deemed discriminatory. While we maintain that the Proposed Rule as a whole should be withdrawn, at a minimum, the Department must clearly define in the regulation that schools will not be compelled to promote abortion, and that speech, organizations, events and speakers that promote the sanctity of human life beginning at conception will not be considered to be in violation of Title IX.Further, regarding curriculum pertaining to reproductive health and sex education in schools, the Department must clarify that schools are not directed to promote abortion, including abortion counselling or referrals.While we oppose the inclusion of termination of pregnancy as part of the definition of sex, it is important to ensure that women are not prevented from equally participating in education programs or activities based on pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation.We maintain that the proposed rule should be withdrawn, but affirm the inclusion of lactation in this context. Schools should be required to reasonably accommodate pregnant and lactating women in accordance with Title IX to ensure that no woman is ever forced to choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy or her education. The Department should take all steps necessary to ensure that its policies promote life and that no woman is ever pressured or compelled to seek an abortion by her educational institution. Notably, such action would explicitly be discrimination based on sex, as childbearing, childbirth and lactation are inherent, biological capabilities of women.5.      The Proposed Rule purports to preempt state law.Of additional concern due to the underlying policies, the Proposed Rule broadly defines any Program or activity under Title IX to mean all of the operations of (1) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or local government; or (II) The entity of a State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government.Further “recipient” is defined to mean, among other things, “any State or political subdivision thereof.”Regardless, Title IX does not give the Department the authority to compel states to disregard their own laws related to protecting children from harmful gender ideology, ensuring equal opportunities for women, and upholding the sanctity of human life.The Proposed Rule should make clear that no part of the regulation would preempt state laws that are contrary to the far-reaching and unsubstantiated attempts of the Proposed Rule to indoctrinate students.The Proposed Rule should explicitly acknowledge that no schools, students, teachers, parents, or states would be subjected to unfair or discriminatory practices or actions by the Department on the basis that such individual or entity understands sex to be binary and based in biology, or upholds equality for women in sports by ensuring that biological males are not allowed to compete against women and girls in female athletics.Similarly, the Proposed Rule should also ensure that those individuals and states that affirm protection of all life, including the lives of the unborn, do not face discrimination. The Department must make clear that Title IX does not preempt prolife state laws by encouraging and facilitating abortion tourism through enabling students to access abortion regardless of school policies, under the guise of Title IX protections.6.      The Proposed Rule will have a far-reaching, negative impact beyond education.As drafted, the Proposed Rule will have ripple effects in other nondiscrimination laws written by Congress, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, Food and Nutrition Services and more. We have already seen the harms causes by such policies, including compelling doctors to perform harmful, irreversible and experimental gender alteration procedures on minors, and strong-arming schools into adopting progressive policies by tying such policies to school lunch programs. The broad, harmful, and lasting impact that this Proposed Rule would have on other agency programs is just one reason that the Department should withdraw it.If the Department moves forward with the Proposed Rule, it must consider the impact in such areas and explicitly state that such regulation does not apply to these or any other area of law that is not clearly addressed in the Proposed Rule.7.      ConclusionThe Proposed Rule seeks to unilaterally expand the scope of the law contrary to the text of Title IX and Congressional intent. The proposal would harm women and girls, violate First Amendment free speech, religious freedom and parental rights, and promotes abortion. The Department of Education should promptly withdraw the rule and instead focus on upholding existing law and regulations consistent with our law.  Sincerely, "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-joins-colleagues-in-introducing-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation,"September 13, 2022Yesterday, Sen. Inhofe (R-Okla.) joined 37 of his Republican colleagues, led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, in introducing the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act, comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform legislation.“There are two things we should be doing here in Congress: defending America and supporting our nation’s infrastructure. After being neglected by Democrats for far too long, I am proud to join my Republican colleagues in introducing legislation that would put in place strong reforms to the onerous regulations that have long delayed critical nationwide energy and infrastructure projects,” Inhofe said. “I am also pleased this bill incorporates legislation I’ve previously introduced that support our energy independence. I am proud to work alongside Sen. Capito to introduce this important legislation.”“Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Ranking Member Capito said. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish line.”Sen. Inhofe was joined in cosponsoring Ranking Member Capito’s bill by 37 senators, including, U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).BACKGROUND:In August 2022, Sen. Inhofe joined Sen. Capito in sponsoring a similar amendment to the reckless tax and spending bill that would have enacted important permitting reforms aimed at reducing burdensome regulations currently delaying key energy and infrastructure projects across the country.The START Act incorporates Inhofe’s S.2394 – the Federal Land Freedom Act, a bill that gives each state the right to develop all of the energy resources on the federal lands located within that state’s borders and S.2393 – the Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands (FRESH) Act, a bill that states explicitly a state is the only authorized entity to regulate hydraulic fracturing on any land located within its borders.BILL DETAILS:Read the full text of the legislation here.A section by section summary can be found here and below.Section 2 - Codification of NEPA Regulations1.       Codifies the Trump Administration’s modernized National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations.Section 3 - Providing Regulatory Certainty2.       Codifies the Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule’s definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. 3.       Codifies the Trump Administration’s Section 401 Certification Rule under the Clean Water Act to prevent state actions that unreasonably block energy projects. 4.       Codifies Nationwide Permits issued in 2021 that streamline Section 404 permitting for the development of critical energy projects and other activities under the Clean Water Act.5.       Lengthens the available approval term of permits issued under delegated state water permit programs from 5 to 10 years.Section 4 - Limiting New Red Tape and Costs for Gasoline and Other Fuels6.       Prohibits the use and adoption of the Biden Administration’s interim estimates for the “social cost of greenhouse gases” and any other estimates that may raise gasoline prices.Section 5 - Expediting Permitting and Review Processes7.       Codifies key elements of the One Federal Decision framework for energy projects, including timely approvals for projects, permitting review schedules for projects that are no longer than two years, and limitations on the page length of environmental documents.8.       Provides litigation certainty on the timing of judicial challenges to energy project approvals.9.       Allows agencies to share and use one another’s categorical exclusions for energy projects under NEPA.Section 6 - States’ Authorities in Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations10.   Grants states the sole authority to promulgate or enforce any regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing on or under any land within their boundaries.11.   Clarifies that the exclusivity of this regulation applies to all federal lands located in the state.Section 7 - Federal Lands Freedom Act12.   Grants states the right to develop energy resources on the federal lands located within their borders. This section gives states the ability to proactively and responsibly develop energy on federal lands.13.   Allows a state to develop a regulatory program governing the leasing and permitting of energy activities on its federal land.Section 8 - Expedited Approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline14.   Expedites the approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project within 21 days of enactment. This section paves the way for another American energy revolution by taking concrete steps to buck the policies that are holding American energy producers back to the benefit of hostile regimes with inferior environmental standards.Section 9 - Reducing Timeframes for Endangered Species Act Consultations15.   Reforms the Section 7 consultation process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by shortening consultation timelines from 90 to 60 days.16.   Also shortens thresholds for ending or extending consultation times from 150 to 100 days. This section reforms a well-known roadblock to efficient permitting.Section 10 - New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act17.   Reforms the New Source Review (NSR) program under the Clean Air Act. This environmental regulation actually prevents industry from making upgrades to existing facilities to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Provides greater regulatory certainty about when facility upgrades require a permit.Section 11 - No Retroactive Permit Vetoes18.   Clarifies existing law to promote timely and thorough consideration of Clean Water Act Section 404 permits, and eliminates unfair and confusing permitting actions in order to support domestic energy production.Section 12 – Policy Review under the Clean Air Act                                                                                                                                                          Strikes the statutory mandate under the Clean Air Act Section 309 that EPA review and comment on newly authorized federal projects for construction or any major federal action that falls under NEPA for environmental review as well as agency regulations."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned Lieutenant General B. Chance Saltzman, nominee for promotion to General and to be the next Chief of Space Operations. Click here to view Inhofe’s remarks. Inhofe: Okay, General Saltzman. Let me get the two required questions out of the way so no one else will have to do it. The two are: What worries you the most and what do you intend to do about it? And secondly, what will be the first challenge that you go after? Two questions.Saltzman: Yes sir, thank you. The most immediate threat in my opinion is the pace with which our strategic challengers, first and foremost the Chinese, are aggressively pursuing capabilities that can disrupt, degrade and ultimately even destroy our satellite capabilities and disrupt our ground infrastructure. They have watched how we perform joint forceoperations. They know how critical the U.S. space capabilities are to the joint force. They've learned from that, and they recognize that it is an asymmetric advantage of theirs to go after our space capabilities and deny them to the joint force. They've invested heavily in demonstrated capabilities that can deny us this. So, it is one of my earliest priorities tomake sure that we are on track to build and field affective capabilities and then train the guardians to operate in a contested domain, so that we can counter this activity by our strategic competitors. Inhofe: Thank you, General Saltzman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

I would also like to extend a welcome to the General, and I appreciate the time you spent with me, giving me an idea of what you have in your mind and also the fact that you have your family here today, it’s very meaningful to us. We appreciate that very much, because you are not going to see a lot of them in the days to come.Our National Defense Strategy is not shy about the scope and scale of the threat from China, and the speed of their advances. There’s no better example of that than space. In a decade, the United States has gone from the unquestioned leader in space to merely one of two peers in a competition. Most people don’t realize that.There’s a lot China and Russia are doing in space we can’t talk about today, but even what we can talk about publicly is very concerning. For years, we kept noting that everything our military does relies on space. But we never really acted like it. Worse yet, space is no longer simply an enabler for other functions. So, we have a different environment all together today, and you're only the second one to take on this awesome responsibility, and we appreciate very much the effort that you're making and the background that you bring. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-lankford-move-to-protect-oklahoma-ag-land-from-foreign-purchases,"September 13, 2022U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) yesterday introduced the Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act in order to provide oversight and transparency of purchases of U.S. agricultural land that threaten national security. The senators continue to respond to concerns from Oklahomans about the multiple recent purchases of Oklahoma agricultural land by foreign entities.“Over time, foreign investors, including international criminal entities who are trafficking illegal drugs, have bought up large amounts of United States agricultural farmland – putting Oklahomans and Americans across the U.S. at risk,” said Inhofe. “There is no question that caution must be taken when we consider who buys American land and what they plan to do with it. We need to be vigilant in implementing safeguards, like those in the Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act, in order for our nation to maintain security, uphold human rights and increase transparency.” “The state’s ‘legal’ marijuana trade has also predictably attracted transnational criminal organizations to Oklahoma that are trafficking drugs and people,” said Lankford. “The transnational criminal organizations have partnered with Chinese nationals to buy land and businesses throughout Oklahoma. This is a national security issue and a human rights issue. We need to know who is buying our land, how they are using it, and if any criminal activity is occurring.”BackgroundThe SOIL Act deters potentially criminal investment in U.S. agriculture by: The SOIL Act is supported by Heritage Action for America and the America First Policy Institute."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-questions-nominees-to-tennessee-valley-authority-board-of-directors,"September 07, 2022Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) questioned three nominees to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors at an EPW hearing. The nominees included Mr. Bill Renick, Mr. Adam Wade White and Mr. Joe H. Ritch. 
Click to watch Sen. Inhofe's Remarks.Inhofe: Thank you Mr. Chairman. While my home state of Oklahoma is not part of the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA] region, having been a former chairman of this committee, I have come to know and appreciate the vital role that the TVA plays for the states of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia. The Tennessee Valley Authority keeps the lights on for nearly ten million Americans and it does so with an all-of-the-above energy approach to power generation, which includes nuclear energy and fossil fuels. Today, nuclear energy and fossil fuels make up nearly 70% of the Tennessee Valley Authority's electricity generation portfolio. The calls to eliminate fossil energy sources from the power sector are foolish and would be devastating for the American people by further increasing already sky-high utility bills and creating greater unreliability for the electric grid. The Tennessee Valley Authority should continue to prioritize reliable and abundant power sources that continue to keep the lights on for the American people. It is my hope that these nominees recognize the need for an all-of-the-above energy approach that includes nuclear and fossil fuels for the power sector now and into the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.…Thank you Mr. Chairman. So that people know what is going on here, this happens every once in a while, when they start and we keep the meeting going and so we will kind of go back and forth in that manner. It's worked now for 200 years, so it'll work today. First of all, I'll say to all nominees, as you know, one of the Tennessee Valley Authority's main responsibilities is to ensure energy security to the federal facilities that provide power to the over 10 million people living in the Southeast region of the United States. In 2019, the Tennessee Valley Authority became the first utility in the nation to receive an early site permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license Small Modular Reactors at the Clinch River Nuclear Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Energy security leads to electric grid reliability and Americans must continue to have grid reliability in the future. So I'd just say to all three of you, do you believe that nuclear should continue to be part of the power mix at the Tennessee Valley Authority and would you agree that nuclear is vital to keeping the lights on and ensuring grid resiliency? Starting with you, Mr. Renick.Renick: Thank you, Senator. I do believe that there must be a mix of fuel to energize our grid. Nuclear needs to be a part of that. I do also believe that America has the ability and the technology to produce safe, clean nuclear, along with other fuels.Inhofe: Very good, very good, thank you. Mr. White?White: Thank you Senator, I've read about the SMR's that you're talking about, Clinch River, fascinated by it. The thought of the new technologies that are coming our way are something that I think TVA has a chance to be at the forefront of leading that, and learning new ways, and seeing how we can become more efficient. I know they have done some updates recently at some of the nuclear sites now, which has dramatically increased the ability to produce electricity. So yes, I see nuclear as a strong part of what we do in the future.Inhofe: Alright, thank you. Mr. Ritch?Ritch: Yes, I thank you for the question. Advanced nuclear projects I think are critical to the future of TVA and security necessary for our grid, so yes I do agree.Inhofe: Alright, thank you very much. And I say to the three of you: As you know, the Tennessee Valley Authority has announced plans to close both units of the Cumberland, Tennessee coal power plant, which generates enough electricity each year to power 1.1 million homes. Considering the coal plant's significant power output, in April 2022, the TVA announced its preferred replacement for the first unit to be a natural gas power plant. Despite the economical and timely environmental benefits that natural gas provides, this decision upsets many climate alarmists who oppose any fossil fuel generation. So I would say to all nominees: Do you agree that the Tennessee Valley Authority's leading priority when deciding to replace any existing power plant should be ensuring that customers continue to receive reliable and low-cost electricity? Yes sir.Renick: Thank you Senator, I do believe strongly in the Tennessee Valley mission of providing low cost, safe, reliable energy. You know, I think back to those small companies like TCI in my hometown – they must have reliable energy in order to produce for the livelihoods for the people that work there. I'm a big believer in the mix. I can only commit to you that I will study this as much as I possibly can, try to make decisions based on facts, but also using that common sense that has served me well.Inhofe: Yeah there's no rule that you can't use common sense, in spite of some people that have tried. And I appreciate your comments very much on that. You know you're dealing with something here that is life threating. This is not a little deal, this is important, this is our ability to compete in the real world and you folks are in a very good position. And you have excellent backgrounds – all three of you – in pursuing this effort here. I'd ask the same question, Mr. White?White: Thank you Senator. I'm looking at it from the outside, not privy to all the information that has been provided to previous boards. But I can tell you this, when I go looking at how is our mix going to be, one thing I've noticed is that they plan out 10, 20 years in advance, so we have to take into consideration everything. Things from your staff, hopefully that you'll provide us, TVA, all the different things that we've got to look at. I don't come into this with an agenda, but I want to make sure that we are providing the lowest cost possible and it's clean, and it's reliable, and it's resilient and it's sustainable. And when I match those things up, we can use our common sense that we were talking about.Inhofe: I think that concludes your comments then, that's a good statement, I appreciate that. You've got to keep in mind what this is really for and also you touched on something there, Mr. White, that is significant and that is: There may be things that are popular today, and maybe those things won't be quite as popular six months from now. But nonetheless, the mission goes on, and you've got to keep providing. While some things will become popular and unpopular to different administrations, your mission is obvious - you've got to keep it pumping out there so the people know that they are going to be able to live their lives. That's all. Yes sir, Mr. Ritch.Ritch: Thank you sir for the question. The closing of the coal plants in the history of my time on the board is because they were obsolete and so the need for replacement power is obviously there. So yes, I think we need to look at all types of forms of generation of electricity because of our need to make sure we have that reliable, safe, clean process in place. And so I think for the main thing for TVA is to always weigh the options and make sure we are making the best case. And as directors we look at that, as he said in a practical sense, but also in a way that reflects the mission of TVA. Inhofe: Well I think also, recognition that times change, and priorities change and we have to have that common sense, that was referred to by Mr. Renick, available to us at all times."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-reed-release-statement-on-nas-study,"September 09, 2022U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking member and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the below statement after the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) committee released its study, as required by Congress, on FCC Order 20-48.“From the beginning, we have expressed strong concerns with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision to grant Ligado Networks their license modification request, and the unacceptable risk it would cause to the Department of Defense (DOD), the Federal Government Global Positioning System (GPS) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) operations.“Before the Ligado Order was issued, fourteen federal agencies and departments expressed strong opposition to the application sought by Ligado over concerns about potential harmful interference with GPS operations. Afterward, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and numerous impacted stakeholders urged the FCC to stay and reconsider their Order—expressing concerns with the same potential harmful operations to GPS and satellite communications.“In the FY21 defense bill, Congress directed the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent technical review of the FCC Order. We agree with the Department of Defense’s assessment that this study ‘confirms that Ligado’s system will interfere with DoD GPS receivers, which include high-precision GPS receivers’ and that ‘Iridium satellite communications will experience harmful interference caused by Ligado user terminals.’  “Furthermore, the National Academy of Sciences’ review concluded that the FCC Order’s outlined procedures to mitigate interference may not be operationally practical, validating our concerns.“In the time since the FCC issued its Order, it has become increasingly clear to us the national security implications of Ligado’s operations pursuant to the FCC’s Order. With this new information, we again urge the FCC to stay and reconsider their 2020 Order.” On August 17, 2022, Inhofe and Reed led a group of their colleagues in sending a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urging the organization to reconsider granting the license modification request of Ligado Networks, which seeks to use a part of the communications spectrum in a way that risks interference with Global Positioning System (GPS) reception.On January 1, 2021, the enacted Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision authored by Inhofe and Reed directing the Secretary of Defense to contract with the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine for an independent technical review of FCC order 20-48."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-mourns-september-11-attacks,"September 09, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) released the following statement in remembrance of the upcoming anniversary of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, honoring the men and women who lost their lives and the first responders and service members who continue to fight the global War on Terrorism:“Our nation mourns as we remember that fateful day: September, 11, 2001. We must never forget the 2,977 innocent lives lost and over 6,000 injured when terrorists carried out an attack on our homeland 21 years ago or their family members and loved ones who had to continue on after this awful tragedy. We remember our first responders for their bravery that day and those who continue to put themselves in harm’s way for our country. The terrorists tried to steal our sense of security, but they failed. America rose up and rebuilt, but the fight is not over. “Islamic extremists continue to target Americans and our freedoms at home and abroad. A harsh reminder of this anniversary is the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2012, when we lost four brave Americans from a terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya.  Now, more than ever, it’s important that we prioritize our national security, starting with our military. We rebuilt after 9/11 and came back stronger, and we must continue building on that strength and resolve today.”"

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) questioned two witnesses at a Senate EPW Full Committee Legislative Hearing entitled, “Legislative Hearing to Examine the RPM Act, the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act, the Smoke-Ready Communities Act, and the Smoke Planning and Research Act.”Witnesses included: Honorable Antron Brown, National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel Drag Racer and Honorable Scott VanderWal, President of South Dakota Farm Bureau and Vice President of American Farm Bureau Federation.Click here to view Inhofe's questions.  Carper: Senator Inhofe.Inhofe: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the really interesting thing that we are experiencing right now, and we have some star power here that we're happy to have.Mr. Brown, as you know, the EPA is threatening to restrict America's ability to convert motor vehicles into racing vehicles. Recognizing the protection of the Motorsports Act would clarify that it's legal for car racers to convert street vehicles into a dedicated race vehicle. The bipartisan legislation provides certainty to motorsports companies employing tens of thousands of American workers that produce and sell special parts that racers need to build. You're the one who's really interested, and you're on the line on this thing and you've done a very good job. My kids will be very proud that we're spending this time together. I would like to have you characterize the type of people – you know Oklahoma's a small state, we're a rural state, we're an Ag state, and I look at both of these bills that we're going to be talking about today as things that will be very helpful. They're kind of geared for Oklahoma. I'd just like to have you share a little bit about the mom and pop type of population that benefits the most from this, Mr. Brown.Mr. Brown: Benefit from this you said, sir?Inhofe: No, how they benefit, because we're talking about Oklahomans. Now, these are not giant corporations, these are mom and pop operations.Mr. Brown: Yes, well the way they benefit is, believe it or not, in our community of motorsports, our 1,500 tracks reach across the whole country, even in the small neighborhoods. I grew up in New Jersey, but I go to 22 different venues across the country for drag racing. We'd go from all the way down there in Tulsa, that racetrack in Tulsa, Oklahoma; all the way down to Dallas, Texas, Gainesville, Florida; all the way up to Brainerd, Minnesota. We impact so many of the small grassroots people that come in and we effect the communities.I'm not going to lie to you: I grew up on a 15 acre farm ground in the little town of Chesterfield, New Jersey. It's in the middle of nowhere… cattle up the road. I drove a Combine; my family had an excavating business on the farm. What we did was do-it-yourselfers, so a lot of do-it-yourselfers back in those areas, this is actually who it benefits from because they work on their vehicles and they're the ones that are able to take it. Racing and motorsports, when you take it to the area where you're able to take that Station Wagon that your mom had and you can actually modify it, doesn't take a lot of money. And you can take it to your local drag strip, where at your local drag strip in those little towns across America and you can go there and spend twenty bucks. You can actually race that vehicle.  Inhofe: We're operating on limited time here, and I want to come back because I've been fascinated by your background and what it's meant to you.I had one question for Mr. VanderWal. As you mention in your testimony, agriculture accounts of approximately 10% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in livestock accounts for less than 4% of overall emissions. I think John Thune did a good job of explaining what a Cow Tax would do and who that would effect.Mr. VanderWal, will you explain how passing the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act would keep food costs down for Americans buying beef, pork, eggs and egg products?Mr. VanderWal: Well thank you for that question, Senator. That's very important because, like I said, food security is national security to our country. The more times we have put more regulations on our farms and ranches it causes people to quit if they can't afford to follow those regulations or meet them, if they have to hire more people and in turn it reduces the supply which increases prices to consumers.It's certainly in our country’s best interest to use common sense and keep those regulations low. I talked about the fact that agriculture is doing such a good job already through innovation in the last decades, and we're doing things on a voluntary basis, always looking for a way to improve and doing the best we can.Inhofe: I really believe that we have an opportunity to yield to the pressures that are out there on overregulation. Overregulation is something people don't understand until they are among those who are overregulated.Mr. Brown, is there any other thoughts - we're running a little short on time - that you'd like to talk about that further economic impact that this legislation would have on states, like my state of Oklahoma.Mr. Brown: Absolutely, sir. One thing that I would like to share too: In just our motorsports industry throughout the whole country we have over a $100B impact on the communities and states across the country that motorsports resonates and goes to. It's definitely a big impact from communities, from hotels, from everything that surround it. It has a huge impact, and also for the small business owners that actually make these parts and pieces and also for the development of future technology that goes into vehicles tomorrow.

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) sent a letter to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Ronald Davis urging answers after reports that the USMS is considering a new policy to permit the release of dangerous, criminal aliens before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is able to apprehend these illegal immigrants.“We are deeply concerned to learn that USMS is even considering adopting a policy where it fails to cooperate with a fellow federal law enforcement entity,” the senators wrote. “The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.”The senators continued, “The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of “gotaways” entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies.”The senators concluded, “Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies. Speaking before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that some cities are releasing illegal immigrants, “even if those individuals pose a public safety threat,” and that, “the public’s safety, the public’s well-being . . . is I think at issue.” In light of this public safety risk, Secretary Mayorkas indicated he would be going to municipal leaders and “asking you to reconsider you position of non-cooperation . . .”Read the full letter here.   "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-statement-on-one-year-anniversary-of-afghanistan-withdrawal,"August 31, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the ranking members of the Senate and
House Armed Services Committees, released the following statement on the one-year
anniversary of President Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. “One year ago, the world saw
firsthand the results of the Biden Administration’s
horrible political decisions play out in Afghanistan. President Biden’s
botched withdrawal embarrassed our nation, caused allies to second-guess our
resolve, and created a vacuum for the Taliban to retake Afghanistan.“President Biden and his political
appointees at the State Department and the National Security
Council clearly did not see what everyone else saw: A hasty,
unconditional withdrawal was certain to fail. Yet, they overrode military
officials and pushed forward – ignoring what was occurring on the ground in
Afghanistan. The cost of President Biden’s withdrawal was paid for with the
lives of brave U.S. servicemembers and innocent Afghans.“We repeatedly warned that without
a plan to prevent the resurgence of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, the country would
once again become a beacon for terrorists. We were proven right. Ayman
al-Zawahiri, one of the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks, had been
living in Kabul for months. It would be reckless to assume that the threat
al-Qaeda poses to our homeland has dissipated – yet the Biden administration
has still not provided Congress with the counterterrorism strategy we asked
for.“There has also been no
accountability whatsoever for the chaotic and deadly withdrawal. Last August,
President Biden pretended as though the disaster was inevitable when he
said, ‘The evacuation of thousands of
people from Kabul is going to be hard and painful no matter when it started and
when we began.’ We could not disagree more: Democrats and Republicans in
Congress urged the Biden administration to begin the evacuation of American
citizens and Afghan partners sooner. The fact that the President left
Americans behind was neither inevitable nor excusable, and it’s stunning that
the exact same national security team remains in place despite this
unprecedented dereliction of duty.“It’s clear that our nation is
less safe due to President Biden’s decisions. We will continue to hold the
Biden administration accountable for this tragedy, and we will get the
answers the American people deserve.”

Republicans on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Armed
Services Committees urged President Joe Biden to re-establish Operation Warp
Speed to develop new vaccines and medical products that can counter the ongoing
COVID-19 and future pandemics.“Operation
Warp Speed was a singular, history-making success - harnessing American
innovation, bolstered by the support of the federal government, to bring
effective COVID-19 vaccines from idea to reality in a matter in months.
Unfortunately, the Biden administration inexplicably gutted this program,
leaving us steps behind as new variants continue to pop up,” Senators Burr and
Inhofe said. “A change in administration doesn’t need to mean a complete
reversal of key policies and programs. Instead of rejecting a significant
achievement of his predecessor, President Biden should build on the successes
of Operation Warp Speed. With the acceleration of new vaccines and
therapeutics, we can turn the page on this terrible pandemic once and for all -
a goal we know President Biden shares.”In
a letter to President Biden, the senators asked him to submit to Congress a
“concrete proposal” to establish an “Operation Warp Speed 2.0” by the end of
the year. This proposal would: outline the successes of President Trump’s
Operation Warp Speed; create a plan to replicate it; describe how the
Departments of Defense and Health and Human Service could support this effort;
and develop a structure for a public-private partnership to avoid placing the
full burden of cost on the American taxpayer. “[T]he federal government is not reacting with sufficient
urgency to new variants of COVID-19,” the senators wrote. “Bottom
line: Operation Warp Speed was the most successful public health program since
small pox.  It saved millions of lives, and it should be resurrected as
soon as possible.”The
full text of the letter can be found here
or below. Dear
Mr. President:The tragedy of the COVID-19 pandemic has touched the lives of
every American, but it has also revealed some of America’s greatest strengths.
In 2020, American scientists and biopharmaceutical industry achieved a success
on par with the Manhattan Project or the Apollo Program. It was called
Operation Warp Speed, and it saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans
and millions around the world.The original COVID-19 vaccines were quickly developed, tested,
approved and delivered — not by chance, but by a coordinated policy effort of
your predecessor’s administration. This effort cut regulatory red tape, reduced
risk and uncertainty, mobilized military operational capacity, and set a clear
target for the private sector to hit.Unfortunately, the original vaccines have limitations: they do
not successfully prevent transmission of new COVID variants, and the protection
they offer vaccinated Americans against severe COVID cases is declining. 
Most worrying: since early 2021, the pace with which new variants emerge has
increased substantially, and the likelihood that the existing vaccines will be
ineffective against future variants is constantly growing.This is why we need a Warp Speed 2.0 to develop better vaccines.
In particular, intranasal products that reduce transmission and pan-coronavirus
approaches that provide durable protection against the emergence of new
variants could let us turn the page completely on COVID-19 and help other
countries do the same. There are promising efforts to achieve these goals, led
by American scientists, businesses and the military, but your administration
has neither prioritized them nor charted a clear path for their delivery.The team that led Operation Warp Speed has been disbanded, and
the federal government is not reacting with sufficient urgency to new variants
of COVID-19. We strongly urge your Administration provide to Congress by the
end of this year a concrete proposal for an “Operation Warp Speed 2.0.”
This would rapidly accelerate the development and deployment of the next
generation of medical products needed to defend America from COVID-19 and
future pandemics. We believe such a proposal should include: Bottom line: Operation Warp Speed was the most successful public
health program since small pox.  It saved millions of lives, and it should
be resurrected as soon as possible.Sincerely,CC:

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-eaa-airventure-today-leaving-a-legacy,"August 26, 2022In the 35 years since he was first elected to Congress, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), EAA 179992, has continually fought for the rights of pilots and the general aviation industry as a whole. After three-plus decades in Congress, Inhofe has decided to retire at the end of the 117th Congress, which concludes on January 3, 2023.For his many years of service and advocacy in support of general aviation, Inhofe will be presented with EAA’s Freedom of Flight Award today. The Freedom of Flight Award is EAA’s highest honor, bestowed annually to recognize contributions to aviation that closely mirror the integrity, entrepreneurship, and innovativeness of EAA members.“I think it’s great. It’s really something when you think about the number of people who’ve done some good things [who also earned the award],” Inhofe said.In his final trip to Oshkosh as a sitting U.S. senator, Inhofe reflected on the two aspects of attending AirVenture that he enjoys most — the friends he sees and the aviation-related legislation he gathers support for.“People will ask, ‘What rewards you the most?’ There are really two things,” he said. “The first is the people. There are people that I’ve known all my life, and I only see them once a year. I look forward to it. They know me; I know them. It’s just fun spending time with them. The second thing is probably the most productive thing, and that’s getting things passed.”The legacy Inhofe leaves when it comes to legislative wins for general aviation is impressive. As an avid pilot with more than 11,000 hours, Inhofe’s passion is aviation, and it shows with what he’s been able to accomplish in Congress.When legendary military, test, and air show pilot Bob Hoover’s medical certificate was revoked by the FAA, Inhofe helped shepherd legislation through the Senate to protect FAA certificate holders from bureaucratic overreach by providing pilots the ability to immediately appeal emergency revocations of their certificates to the National Transportation Safety Board.“Nothing was more significant than seeing the look on Bob Hoover’s face that he was back in the air,” Inhofe said.To match the international standard for commercial pilots, Inhofe helped pass legislation to raise the mandatory retirement age for American pilots from 60 to 65 years. Inhofe was also instrumental in helping to create the Pilot’s Bill of Rights, which creates a level playing field between individual pilots and the FAA by ensuring pilots have access to all the information required to appropriately defend themselves during an FAA enforcement proceeding or NTSB review.Inhofe’s involvement in third-class medical reform also cannot be understated. The result was BasicMed, which eased the medical certification process for pilots by cutting bureaucratic red tape and encouraged pilots to disclose and get treatment for medical conditions that may affect their ability to fly.To address the shortage of pilots and aviation maintenance professionals, Inhofe created the Aviation Pilot and Maintenance Workforce Development Program that supported career development, as well as directed the FAA to modernize the mandatory curriculum for aviation maintenance technician schools for the first time since the 1960s.Recently, Inhofe was vital in defeating the ATC privatization movement, which was an effort to take away the freedom to fly from GA pilots by privatizing air traffic control. Additionally, he’s helped in designated pilot examiner reforms, which ensured the FAA updates regulations and policies related to the selection, training, and deployment of DPEs to ensure commercial and recreational pilots have access to an adequate number of examiners.As someone making his 43rd straight trip to AirVenture (excluding 2020’s cancellation), aviation events like Oshkosh are close to Inhofe’s heart, and he’s passed legislation that directs the FAA to provide air traffic services for these types of gatherings without additional cost to participants.In his remaining months in Congress, Inhofe does have some legislative goals when it comes to general aviation, particularly when it comes to the transition to unleaded avgas.“On top of my mind this year is how we can provide a safe and smart transition to unleaded aviation gas so that pilots can keep flying,” he said. “We must all work together to provide the smoothest transition to an unleaded aviation gas. One of the ways we can ensure this is to make sure airports continue to make available for sale 100LL aviation gas until there is an unleaded fuel solution approved for use and available, enabling pilots to keep on flying. Second, we can provide airports across the nation with additional flexibility to use Airport Improvement Program funding to make the infrastructure upgrades necessary to quicken the transition to unleaded aviation gas.”In addition, Inhofe supports a number of other initiatives to help general aviation. The National Center for the Advancement of Aviation (NCAA) ensures the development and sustainability of the civil and military workforce via the promotion of youth aviation programs and the availability of aviation-oriented curriculum for students of all ages, and empowers collaborative and cross-disciplinary efforts between private sector organizations, higher education, and other relevant entities to develop cutting-edge aviation materials, technology, and avionics. The PLANE Act ensures tax receipts from all aviation fuel sources are deposited in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund so all aviation user fees go to support aviation infrastructure and the aviation community, as well as empowers DPEs and DARs by giving them necessary civil liability protection and designates qualified GA airports as “disaster relief airports” so they have the needed infrastructure. The Certainty for General Aviation Pilots Act provides certainty that pilots engaged in flight training and flight testing are not considered as “carrying persons or property for compensation or hire,” while the HANGARS Act funds the construction of hangars at general aviation airports to address the growing aircraft hangar shortage.While Inhofe is retiring from the Senate, this won’t be the last time he’ll be back at Oshkosh, as this event is his passion and he won’t stop advocating for aviation even when retired. “It’s the most enjoyable thing I do every single year,” he said. “When you have the job that I have, there’s a lot of misery. I come here because I know a bunch of people. I have friends here that I see once a year. The second thing I do, we’re passing laws and all that, and the best place to get support is to do it here.”"
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-honored-with-eaas-freedom-of-flight-award-at-airventure-oshkosh-2022,"August 26, 2022Last month, the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) presented U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) with the Freedom of Flight Award for his contributions to aviation throughout his tenure that closely mirror the integrity, entrepreneurship and innovativeness of EAA members. Sen. Inhofe has continuously advocated for the general aviation community during his 35 years in Congress.“I am truly humbled to receive EAA’s Freedom of Flight Award from Jack Pelton,” said Inhofe. “EAA AirVenture Oshkosh is a unique experience, and one that I have enjoyed for 43 years. Each year, I hear directly from pilots and it has been an honor to have made their priorities my own during my time in Congress. Working together, we have accomplished much throughout the years, ensuring the general aviation community has prospered and will be ready for the next generation of general aviation pilots. While it is hard to believe that this year’s EAA AirVenture Oshkosh is my last while serving in Congress, I am looking forward to returning next year and continuing to be a voice for pilots.”“EAA’s Freedom of Flight Award recognizes contributions to EAA and aviation that protect and preserve our unique opportunities to fly,” said Jack J. Pelton, CEO and Chairman of the Board for the Experimental Aircraft Association. “Over the past 30-plus years, general aviation has had no greater advocate in Congress than Jim Inhofe. He embodies everything that the Freedom of Flight Award represents. He has been nothing short of our biggest and sometimes only advocate we have. He’s always attentive and cares, but the thing that’s most important to me is that he always gets things across the finish line. Senator Inhofe, on behalf of all of us at EAA, thank you very much.”During his time in the Senate, Sen. Inhofe has led the effort on countless aviation victories: ensuring Bob Hoover could return to flying; passing the original Pilot’s Bill of Rights; securing BasicMed privileges for thousands of pilots by reforming the third-class medical process; expanding liability protections under the Volunteer Protection Act to include volunteer pilots; and bolstering the future of the aviation workforce.Sen. Inhofe has served in the U.S. Senate representing Oklahoma since 1994. An avid pilot with over 11,000 flight hours, Inhofe became the first member of Congress to fly an airplane around the world when he recreated Wiley Post’s legendary trip around the globe. Prior to serving the people of Oklahoma in the U.S. Senate, Inhofe served in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Oklahoma House and Senate and as Mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Read more below about Inhofe’s most recent work for the general aviation community:On July 25, 2022, the EAA AirVenture Today published an op-ed entitled “Looking Back, Looking Ahead,” by Sen. Inhofe. On July 29, 2022, Sam Oleson, with EAA AirVenture Today, published an article entitled “Leaving a Legacy.”"

Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union and six-month anniversary of
Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine: “The 31st anniversary of Ukraine's

Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the respective ranking members of the Senate committees on Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, are calling on the FBI to provide additional information on these evacuees. Specifically, they are seeking a follow-up briefing on the FBI’s role in further evaluating flagged evacuees as well as the justification for pairing categories of new information that are usually unclassified with classified material, given the significant public interest.“The American people deserve answers about President Biden’s decision to parole individuals into the country without adequate screening and to understand the FBI’s role in assessing and investigating these security concerns,” the senators wrote in an unclassified cover letter accompanying a classified inquiry to FBI Director Chris Wray.The senators previously raised concerns about the government’s failure to use all vetting tools available to prevent potential security threats from exploiting the Biden Administration’s resettlement program. As a result, at least 50 evacuees who’ve arrived in the United States were later identified as having potentially significant security concerns. Since then, the senators’ committee staffs received a classified briefing that revealed new information beyond the previously reported scope of evacuees flagged by the National Ground Intelligence Center. However, it remains unclear whether the vetting breakdowns have been resolved and what the FBI is doing to further assess flagged evacuees to make sure Americans are protected.Read the full text of the letter here and below:August 22, 2022VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSIONThe Honorable Christopher WrayDirectorFederal Bureau of InvestigationWashington, DC 20535Dear Director Wray:On May 26, 2022, we wrote to you regarding Afghan evacuees, which number at least 50, who were flagged for the FBI by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) as “potentially significant security concerns.”  On July 14, 2022, the FBI participated in a classified multi-agency briefing to congressional staff regarding this matter and shared new information beyond the more than 50 individuals initially flagged by NGIC.  While administration officials asserted that the relevant information provided at that staff briefing was classified, similar information in other contexts is unclassified.  The American people deserve answers about President Biden’s decision to parole individuals into the country without adequate screening and to understand the FBI’s role in assessing and investigating these security concerns. During the August 4, 2022, Senate Judiciary Committee FBI Oversight Hearing, you were asked by Ranking Member Grassley whether the FBI knows where certain flagged evacuees are located.  You responded,We have a lot of information about where people are located. I can’t sit here right now and tell you that we know where all are located at any given time.  That’s probably true.Your response does not inspire confidence that the FBI knows the exact location of at least 50 Afghan evacuees with significant security concerns.Based on the information provided at the July 14 briefing, we request an in-person briefing and information from you regarding the FBI’s activity with respect to those evacuees and an explanation of the rationale behind the classification decisions.Finally, administration officials have been unable to confirm the status of an enduring agreement between DHS and NGIC to share the tactical database used by NGIC to flag Afghan evacuees with security concerns.  As a result, we request that the briefing also address steps the FBI is taking to assess any concerns posed by Afghan evacuees who are still in process for being admitted into the United States.Accordingly, please review the attached classified letter and clarify whether information provided by the FBI to Congress is in fact classified and, if it is, provide a rationale for the classification of the material given the strong public interest and the different classification treatment of similar information in other contexts.  We request that you make yourself available to brief us in person no later than September 15, 2022.

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) cosponsored the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act, which was introduced by Sen. Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kans.) and would prohibit any employee or contractor with U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) from transporting any illegal immigrant across state lines for the purpose of procuring an abortion.“The Biden administration continues to push their liberal agenda on hardworking Americans and it has to stop,” said Senator Inhofe. “As if trying to use taxpayer dollars to fund American citizens’ abortions was not enough, the Biden administration now wants to use taxpayer dollars to fund illegal migrants’ abortions. To protect our nation’s integrity and safety, we must ensure that ICE and HHS cannot sponsor transportation for illegal immigrants to obtain an abortion.”“No American’s tax dollars should pay for any illegal alien’s abortion, just like they should not pay for any American citizen’s abortion. Deportations are the only form of government-funded travel ICE should be providing to illegal immigrants. Additionally, with a major strain on resources and manpower on the southern border, we should be prioritizing activities performed by ICE and HHS that keep Americans safe,” said Senator Marshall. “We’ve seen President Biden and his cabinet secretaries repeatedly abuse their power to enact a radical agenda that is failing the American people. The deterioration of our country will not stop unless Congress acts to put a check on this far left administration.”Other original cosponsors joining this legislation are Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).“A massive wave of illegal immigration is providing cover for human smugglers and sex traffickers. We know that thousands of vulnerable women and girls have fallen victim to these criminals, yet the Biden White House has done nothing to stop it. It’s up to Congress to step in. Joe Biden’s taxpayer-funded welcome package already includes a free phone, free plane ticket, and free baby formula – this legislation will stop the administration from adding free abortions to the list,” said Senator Blackburn. “American taxpayer dollar should never go to fund abortion, and definitely should never be spent on transporting illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions,” said Senator Braun.“Rather than getting control of the southern border crisis President Biden created, he wants to ship illegal immigrants across the country to get taxpayer funded abortions. This is a gross abuse of Montanans’ taxpayer dollars and should never be allowed,” said Senator Daines.“The Biden administration’s willingness to act outside the law makes this legislation necessary.  The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.  Whether it be ICE personnel or any other executive branch employee, spending American tax dollars to escort illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions is a clear violation of the law.  It must be stopped,” said Senator Hyde-Smith.“In a new low, even for the most pro-abortion President in US history, President Biden apparently only wants pregnant women, including minors, who illegally cross our southern border to be placed in states where they can get an abortion,” said Senator Lankford. “His priority seems to be increasing abortions in America, rather than stopping illegal immigration or protecting the lives of children.”Senator Scott said, “Taxpayers should never be on the hook to pay for abortions, and the thought of forcing Americans to foot the bill for transportation so illegal immigrants can get abortions is horrific. Just when you think that the Biden administration couldn’t get any more radical, it doubles down by pairing its failed open borders policies with its extreme anti-life agenda. I’m proud to join Senator Marshall and our colleagues in introducing this good bill to protect the unborn and prevent this gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.”“Abortion is wrong, and American taxpayers should never have to pay for it, whether for citizens or illegal immigrants,” said Senator Wicker. “I am proud to stand with my fellow pro-life legislators to protect the sanctity of all human life.”Background:Specifically, the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act would: "

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking member and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led a group of their colleagues today in sending a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urging them to reconsider granting the license modification request of Ligado Networks, which wants to use a part of the communications spectrum in a way that risks interference with Global Positioning System (GPS) reception. Joining Inhofe and Reed were Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska).The senators write: “Staying and reconsidering the Ligado Order is necessary to address the imminent risks associated with Ligado’s intention to ‘commence operations in the 1526-1536 Mhz band on or after September 30, 2022.’ We remain gravely concerned that the Ligado Order fails to adequately protect adjacent band operations—including those related to GPS and satellite communications—from harmful interference impacting countless military and commercial activities.The senators continued: “We urge you to set aside the Ligado Order and give proper consideration to the widely held concerns across the Executive Branch, within Congress, and from the private sector regarding the expected impact of the Ligado Order on national security and other systems.”A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Chairwoman Rosenworcel:We write to you today to urge the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to stay and reconsider the FCC’s order granting the applications of Ligado Networks LLC (Ligado) to deploy a terrestrial wireless network in the L-band satellite spectrum neighborhood, FCC 20-48, adopted April 19, 2020 (the Ligado Order). We remain extremely concerned that terrestrial L-band operations would cause unacceptable risk to Department of Defense (DOD), the Federal Government Global Positioning System (GPS), and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) operations.Prior to the issuance of the Ligado Order, fourteen federal agencies and departments expressed strong opposition to the applications sought by Ligado over concerns about potential harmful interference with GPS operations. In May 2020, shortly following the issuance of the Ligado Order, on behalf of the executive branch, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) petitioned the FCC to reconsider its decision. That filing requested that the FCC “rescind its approval of the mobile satellite service (MSS) license modification applications” granted to Ligado, which the NTIA asserted would “cause irreparable harms” to federal government GPS users.Staying and reconsidering the Ligado Order is necessary to address the imminent risks associated with Ligado’s intention to “commence operations in the 1526-1536 Mhz band on or after September 30, 2022.” We remain gravely concerned that the Ligado Order fails to adequately protect adjacent band operations—including those related to GPS and satellite communications—from harmful interference impacting countless military and commercial activities. We urge you to set aside the Ligado Order and give proper consideration to the widely held concerns across the Executive Branch, within Congress, and from the private sector regarding the expected impact of the Ligado Order on national security and other systems. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure that federal spectrum policy adequately protects the millions of military and commercial users who rely on L-band satellite services every day."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today voted against Senate Democrats’ more than $1 trillion tax and spending bill:“Democrats under Joe Biden have spent trillions, creating the worst inflation in over four decades, and now their answer to this disaster of their own making is to tax us into a recession. Yet again, their response to current spiraling inflation caused by their out-of-control spending spree is to raise taxes on small businesses and middle-class Americans, spend more money on their ‘Green New Deal’ agenda and impose government-run price controls on prescription drugs that will thwart future medical innovation - a dangerous recipe for worsening inflation and sending us into an economic downturn. I had to vote against this radical proposal today.“Leftists are cheering this reckless and irresponsible bill which is quite clearly the most far-left legislation in American history. This proposal could put more than 100,000 American jobs at risk and inflict a severely disproportionate economic impact on natural gas producing states, like Oklahoma. Raising taxes on job creators in the oil and gas sector, wasting more taxpayer money on subsidizing the liberal coastal elite’s electric vehicle purchases and hiring over 80,000 new IRS agents to target America’s middle-class will not provide relief to American families at the gas pump, the grocery store or when paying their mortgage. This legislation will undoubtedly contribute to higher bills for every American. Period.”Early this morning, the Senate voted on an amendment filed by Sens. Inhofe and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) to the reckless tax and spending bill that would have enacted strong permitting reforms aimed at reducing burdensome regulations currently delaying key energy and infrastructure projects across the country. This amendment incorporated legislation authored by Sen. Inhofe that gives states the right to develop all of their energy resources on federal lands within that state’s border and empowers states to be the sole authorized entity to set fracking laws within their borders. All 50 Senate Democrats voted against this commonsense amendment. Read more about the amendment here.Inhofe also offered five motions or amendments that would have forced Democrats to modify their bill with provisions that would support American energy independence, ensure vital medical student education funding, empower parents with resources to choose life for their unborn child with Down Syndrome, force countries like China, India and Russia to adhere to President Biden’s Paris Climate Agreement emission reduction targets he set for America, and permanently extend accelerated depreciation tax status for business property on Indian reservations. These efforts closely mirror legislation Inhofe has introduced this Congress.  "

Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, and John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced a resolution expressing support for
the United States’ actions that will strengthen the military interoperability
and resiliency of Finland’s and Sweden’s militaries, prior to their anticipated
accession to the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. “The
United States Senate rightly voted by an overwhelming majority to welcome
Finland and Sweden into NATO,” said Inhofe. “While we wait for other
members of NATO to do the same, the United States and fellow allies should intensify
coordination with these partners to underscore our commitment from the get-go
and make it clear to Russia that we will not be deterred by their meddlesome
threats in the meantime. Our resolution calls on the President to strengthen
the defense cooperation that is at the root of these nations’ historic decision
to join NATO.”“Finland and Sweden will bring their own unique capabilities and industries to NATO that will strengthen the alliance, expand its geostrategic position, and bolster its deterrence posture,” said Thune. “Purposeful engagement at this time would not only deepen our interoperability, but demonstrate reassurance before Finland and Sweden formally join the treaty. It would also help signal to other NATO members to quickly complete their respective membership approvals.”The
resolution was cosponsored by U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst
(R-Iowa), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).Inhofe and Thune's resolution specifically addresses the interim period before all
NATO members have completed their respective ratification protocols, while
Finland and Sweden will not yet have the full collective security protections
of the alliance. It also supports a spectrum of actions to enhance bi-, tri-,
and multilateral interoperability of Finland and Sweden to ensure both nations
can fully contribute as NATO members on day one of their membership. Such
actions, including exercises and training, bomber task forces, and freedom of
navigation operations in the Baltic Sea, would also serve as de facto near-term
security assurances from Russian aggression while highlighting the capabilities
Finland and Sweden will bring to NATO.









Many
of the actions enumerated in the resolution already take place. However, the
resolution seeks greater emphasis and intent from the administration to set
U.S. posture for the next phase of the broader accession effort, as well as
maintain U.S. leadership in support of these historic additions to the alliance.
It also would assist in countering disinformation that targets a number of NATO
member nations that could potentially delay their timely consideration of
Finland’s and Sweden’s bids for NATO membership."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement on Chinese military drills threatening Taiwan and other countries in the region, and the reported decision by the Biden administration to delay a previously planned Minuteman III ICBM test:“Weakening our nuclear posture will not reduce the threat of nuclear blackmail by Beijing or Moscow; it will only waste taxpayer dollars, undermine allied confidence in U.S. leadership, and embolden our adversaries to take even more aggressive actions when they see that they can. To truly lead against the rising tide of authoritarianism that China and Russia represent, we must project strength, rather than offer empty, conciliatory gestures. We cannot afford to mortgage our future security to appease bullies like Xi and Putin.“The Biden administration clearly does not fully grasp the seriousness of this challenge, and the imperative of quickly modernizing our strategic forces to meet both the Chinese threat, as well as that posed by Russia. Earlier this year, the administration canceled a critical test of a U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile in response to Russian threats over Ukraine – as we know, that decision didn’t deter anything. Now, we have new reports that the administration is once again allowing hostile powers — this time China — to dictate how we sustain and modernize our nuclear deterrent.“As we’ve seen this week, China is engaged in a reckless, aggressive demonstration to threaten Taiwan and intimidate any country that would oppose Beijing’s quest to dominate the region. This exercise, initiated hours after the U.S. Speaker of the House of Representative’s visit, is a crystal ball into China’s likely plans for isolating and eventually forcibly annexing the island. The United States must prepare accordingly. “I have been warning about the threat an increasingly militarized China poses to our allies and partners in Asia. I have worked to reform our military and better posture our nation for the long-term competition that we all know has arrived. This is especially true with regard to modernizing our aging nuclear deterrent and preserving the ultimate guarantee against existential military threats to the United States and our allies and partners. It’s time the administration catches up.”"
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-joins-introduction-of-bill-to-support-faith-based-organizations,"August 04, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) cosponsored the Lifting Local Communities Act, led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), which would make it easier for faith-based organizations to apply for and receive government grants, as well as other types of funding, without fear of arbitrary religious limitations and vindictive litigation. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are also cosponsors of the bill.“It’s critical that religious organizations be able to keep their federally-funded social services protections, without having to compromise their religious beliefs and actions based on which administration is in office. Faith-based organizations, who serve the most vulnerable among us, deserve the same rights as secular organizations, and should not worry about being stripped of their name, structure or practices because of their beliefs. This bill is vital and would ensure that these organizations’ religious protections remain and would prohibit the government from discriminating against these religious entities any further,” said Inhofe.“Churches and other faith-based organizations play a vital role in lifting up their communities. These organizations should not be discriminated against because of their faith or held back by bureaucratic red tape. This bill would ensure that faith-based organizations do not have to compromise their beliefs to provide critical social services to those in need,” said Rubio.“Religious organizations should be allowed to serve their communities without being punished on account of their convictions. This bill will shield organizations helping the most vulnerable from left-wing activists seeking to drive them out of the public square,” said Hawley.“Every day the Biden administration persists in its efforts to roll back protections for religious organizations. It’s not right. The LIFTING Local Communities Act would protect religious organizations from the unfair policies that make religious organizations subject to requirements that secular organizations don’t have to worry about. This bill would codify the right of faith-based organizations to do their work without the government threatening their religious liberties,” said Hyde-Smith.“Faith-based organizations are constantly responding to crises within our communities, yet they often face difficulties seeking federal resources. This bill will ensure they do not face federal discrimination for their deeply-held religious beliefs, enabling them to continue uplifting local communities across the nation,” said Tim Scott.“Faith-based nonprofits serve families and individuals all across our nation as one of our most important social safety nets. The US Supreme Court continues to affirm that faith-based organizations cannot be prohibited from living their faith and partnering with their government simply because of their religious identity. I will continue to champion legislation that seeks to ensure our faith-based nonprofits can serve equally alongside secular entities around the country so no one who needs help is left behind,” said Lankford.                            “During my years as both Governor and Florida’s U.S. Senator, I’ve seen the incredible positive impact that faith-based groups and charities have on Florida’s families and communities in times of need. These groups deserve more of our support, not less. The Lifting Local Communities Act ensures that federal grant programs respect the First Amendment and do not unfairly discriminate against religious groups that dedicate themselves to serving others,” said Scott."

member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and member of the Senate Ukraine
Caucus, voted in support of ratification the accession of Finland and Sweden to become members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He joined an overwhelming majority of both
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who voted 95-1 in favor of ratification.“Amidst Russia’s reckless invasion of
Ukraine, Putin seeking to bully and intimidate his NATO neighbors, and both
Russia and China using military and economic power to control Europe, voting to
ratify Finland and Sweden accession into NATO was a no-brainer. Both nations have
already proven they’re net contributors to NATO and U.S. security for years.
Once they join NATO, those contributions will grow even more.“Finland spends 2 percent of its GDP on
defense, fields one of Europe’s largest armies, and recently signed a deal to
buy 64 F-35 fighter aircraft, which will increase interoperability with the
U.S. and numerous other nations flying that aircraft. Sweden has plans to reach
the 2-percent benchmark, and this year approved a 40 percent increase in its
defense budget to achieve that mark, while also making key investments that
support NATO’s ability to deter Russia, including the U.S.-built Patriot air
defense system.“Beyond their militaries, Sweden and
Finland are key partners in mitigating and deterring threats from various
hostile actors. Each nation is home to telecommunications companies that
provide competitive, viable alternatives to China’s Huawei. They also take
strong stances against Russian meddling and coercion in the increasingly
significant Arctic region. And they’ve consistently made meaningful
contributions in support of U.S.-led efforts to fight terrorism across the
globe.“Following the Senate’s vote, the U.S. will now join
many of our fellow allies in ratifying the
accession of Sweden and Finland, and I urge the rest of the NATO members to do
so as quickly as possible. This strengthens our collective defense, sends a
signal to Putin that he has no veto power in the alliance, and further bolsters
the transatlantic community against both Russia and China.”

This comprehensive, bipartisan legislation would deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits. The legislation passed by a vote of 86-11.“I am proud to support this final piece of legislation paving the way for those who have sacrificed for this country to receive the care they deserve,” Inhofe said. “This legislation, when enacted into law, will expand Veteran Affairs health care eligibility to Post-9/11 combat veterans and create a framework to ensure continued care for veterans suffering from illnesses related to toxic exposure. While I hoped to pass Sen. Toomey’s commonsense amendment to the original bill, I am glad were finally able to consider amendments on the Senate floor under regular order. I commend Sens. Moran and Tester for their leadership and am proud to stand alongside my colleagues on this important issue.” Inhofe voted in favor of Sen.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-colleagues-introduce-legislation-requiring-biden-admin-to-regain-control-of-our-southern-border,"August 02, 2022Yesterday, U.S Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) introduced the Comprehensive Southern Border Strategy Act, legislation that will require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary to complete a comprehensive strategy for the southern border within 12 months of enactment. The strategy must address how to maintain operational control and situational awareness across the entirety of the southern border as well as a strategy for combatting human smuggling and drug trafficking. U.S. Representative Young Kim (R-CA) previously introduced the Comprehensive Southern Border Strategy Act in the U.S. House.“It is alarming to watch how long the Biden administration has stood idly by while our country faces a record-breaking border crisis, as thousands of individuals – including criminals involved in drug and human trafficking – flood our borders daily,” said Senator Inhofe. “Due to President Biden’s failed policies, there have been over 3 million illegal immigrant encounters during his presidency, proving that this administration does not have any sort of handle on the issue. That’s why I am glad to introduce legislation alongside Sen. Tillis that would require DHS to address this crisis and develop an action plan to fix the real issues taking place at our border.”“The Biden Administration has proven time and time again that they have no strategy for gaining control of our southern border, and its time they start showing some leadership and accountability,” said Senator Tillis. “The situation at our border is undeniably a crisis as the cartels continues their human trafficking and their smuggling of illicit drugs like fentanyl into our country. This legislation will ensure that DHS enacts a plan, using every resource available. I am proud to introduce this legislation with my colleagues because the American people deserve to see this administration finally taking control of this chaos.”“The Biden Administration has facilitated the complete collapse of our southern border and precipitated a crisis beyond measure,” said Senator Hagerty. “My colleagues and I are imploring the Biden Administration to stop burying its head in the sand and do its job by prioritizing the safety and security of the American people and putting an end to the disaster they have created.”“Like so much else, it’s clear the Biden administration’s border policies are doing more harm than good,” said Senator Hyde-Smith. “This legislation would force us to acknowledge what’s needed to regain and maintain control of the southern border.  The status quo of rampant illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and human smuggling cannot continue for the sake of our nation.”“The crisis on our Southern border continues to hurt the most vulnerable and put the safety of Americans at risk as we witness record-high illegal crossings and deadly drugs like fentanyl flowing freely into our streets, schools and communities. As long as this border crisis persists, our communities suffer,” said Representative Kim. “I thank Senators Tillis, Hagerty and Hyde-Smith for introducing this bill in the Senate so we can finally create a comprehensive strategy to gain operational control of our border at every mile and ensure taxpayer dollars are used effectively.”BackgroundSince President Biden took office, Customs and Border Protection has had over 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. In fiscal year 2022 (FY22), CBP apprehended over 8,000 criminal aliens, including 50 with convictions for murder and nearly 250 with convictions for sex crimes. CBP also interdicted over 10,700 pounds of fentanyl in 2021 and so far has interdicted over 5,700 pounds in 2022 – nearly 3.7 billion lethal doses. The crisis at our southern border has only been made worse by President Biden’s failed immigration policies, including rescinding the Remain in Mexico Policy, attempting to dismantle immigration enforcement and seeking to end Title 42."

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, today released the following statement on news that the United
States killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri: “The
world is better off without al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, and I commend
the brave men and women who helped bring about his demise. The fact that he was
killed in Afghanistan, however, reflects the total failure of the Biden
administration’s policy towards that country.  “President
Biden’s decision to unconditionally withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan last
summer removed all pressure on the Taliban, and the Taliban responded by
seizing Kabul and breaking its commitment under the 2020 Doha Agreement to deny
safe haven to al-Qaeda. Since last year, Biden administration officials
have insisted that al-Qaeda’s residual presence in Afghanistan was
insignificant and that al-Qaeda lacks the capability to attack the homeland
anytime soon. But we now know that its top leader was living in Kabul. We’re
also seeing evidence that terrorists in Afghanistan and beyond, including in
Africa, have been emboldened by this administration’s failed policies.“The
good news is, the U.S. government still has the capability to target these
terrorists, though it’s clearly far more difficult under President Biden’s
policies — we’ve made no similar strikes for nearly a year. Since President
Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, our visibility into
Afghanistan remains low, while the Taliban’s willingness to harbor senior
terrorists remains robust. I urge the Biden administration to inform Congress
how it intends to bolster its surveillance of these terrorists so we can stay
ahead of these threats, rather than continuing the policy of hoping that the
Taliban will abide by its commitments when there is nothing compelling it to do
so.”

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) yesterday joined Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Mike Kelly (D-Ariz.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in introducing a resolution to remember the anniversary of an accidental fire on the USS Forrestal (a US Navy carrier stationed off the coast of Vietnam) on July 29, 1967, that killed 134 service members and injured 161 Sailors, including at least one Oklahoman. The deadly fire began with the accidental launch of a rocket.“Today, we remember and honor the USS Forrestal heroes who lost their lives during the Vietnam War due to the tragic fire 55 years ago, while the ship was deployed in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of Vietnam,” Inhofe said. “134 sailors lost their lives and 161 were seriously injured that day, and their families have suffered the loss of these loved ones ever since.”“The memory of the 134 heroes lost on the USS Forrestal and the 161 who were seriously injured is sewn in the fabric of our nation,” said Lankford. “On the 55th anniversary, we honor the sailors and marines who sacrificed their lives to fight the devastating fire and the efforts of those who survived that tragic day. We must continue to remember those we lost on the USS Forrestal and their families who now still see that empty seat at the dinner table. We should continue to learn from that terrible day to prevent another accidental tragedy like this from ever happening again.”BackgroundDuring the Vietnam War, the USS Forrestal was often stationed off the coast of north Vietnam, conducting combat operations. On the morning of July 29, the ship was preparing to attack when a rocket from one of its own F-4 Phantom jet fighters was accidentally launched. The rocket streaked across the deck and hit a parked A-4 Skyhawk jet. The Skyhawk, which was waiting to take off, was piloted by the late Sen. John McCain.Fuel from the Skyhawk spilled out and caught fire. The fire then spread to nearby planes on the ship’s deck and detonated a 1,000-pound bomb, which killed many of the initial firefighters and further spread the fire. A chain reaction of explosions blew holes in the flight deck and had half the large ship on fire at one point. Many pilots were trapped in their planes as the fire spread. It took a full day before the fires could be fully contained.Hundreds of sailors were seriously injured, and 134 lost their lives in the devastating fire. Twenty planes were destroyed. It was the worst loss of a life on a US Navy ship since World War II. Temporary repairs were made to the ship in the Philippines before the USS Forrestal headed back to Norfolk, VA. It was repaired and put back into service the following April but never returned to Vietnam. At least two Oklahomans survived the fire aboard the USS Forrestal and at least one Oklahoma Sailor’s life was lost that day."

Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
questioned the nominees for four key Department of Defense civilian positions. Witnesses included:
Milancy Harris, nominated to be Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence and Security; Dr. Radha Plumb, nominated to be Deputy Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; Brendan Owens, nominated
to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment;
and Dr. Laura Taylor-Kale, nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Industrial Base Policy.   Inhofe: Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Plumb, you spent time
recently working at both Facebook and Google,
and Ms. Harris, you also spent time working
at Facebook and on the oversight board of Facebook. Can you both please
describe your work at these companies and what involvement you had, if any, in
the development of the content moderation policies or in decisions to moderate
content? Let's start with Dr. Plumb.Plumb: Ranking
Member Inhofe, my role, similar to roles throughout my career, at both
companies was focused on applying data and analysis to help identify
problematic issues like, at Facebook, child pornography, ISIS recruiting
content. At Google, my roles focused on applying data and analysis to improve
business operations to address issues like copyright violations and financial
fraud and helping make those business processes more effective and efficient.
Overall, I was focused on the research and analysis pieces rather than on
content moderation policy or content moderation decisions.Inhofe: Ms.
Harris?Harris: Ranking
Member Inhofe, thank you for the question. My role at Facebook was focused on
designing a way to bring outside experts in to look at Facebook's content
decision. I did not work on content moderation actions or the policies. I was
focused on the operations issues to facilitate those outside expert reviews.Inhofe: Alright.
And Mr. Owens, in your advanced policy questions you stated that and this is a
quote, ""in many cases the Department’s installation energy projects should
‘not only bolster resilience but also
enhance conservation, increase energy efficiency, and implement clean, low-carbon energy solutions.’ Now, I believe
that the number-one priority of the Department of Defense is lethality. I'd ask
you if you agree with that. And secondly, do you think that there is a point
where strategic and economic costs outweigh potential environmental benefits?Owens:
Ranking
Member, thank you very much for the question. I absolutely agree that DOD's number-one
priority is to provide military forces to deter war and ensure our nation's
security. A hundred percent. In terms of how I would characterize the joint
benefits that investments in resilience and efficiency can provide, I absolutely
see that those two things need to be considered together. They need to be
balanced. And then they need to make sure that they are doing, everything we
are doing from an efficiency standpoint or from a resilience standpoint is
supporting lethality.Inhofe: So,
you, repeat then the two areas that you feel should be hand in hand.Owens: Efficiency,
well I think it's more of a triad. Efficiency, resiliency and lethality.Inhofe: On
somewhat of an equal basis?Owens: I
think I said them in the exact opposite order of the way that they would be
precedent for DOD.Inhofe: OK.
Lastly, Ms. Harris, you've served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,
Irregular Warfare and Counterterrorism since February of 2021. Can you describe
the role that you played in planning for the withdrawal from Afghanistan last
year?Harris:
Ranking Member Inhofe, thank you for the question. As you correctly state, I
work for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. I'm one of a number
of deputy assistant secretaries of defense with responsibilities related to our
mission in Afghanistan. My role is focused primarily on CT policy and the
employment of special operations forces. So with regards to our withdrawal for
Afghanistan, those were the primary areas in which I was involved.






























Inhofe: Thank
you, Mr. Chairman."

National Intelligence, and Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, Director of Defense
Intelligence Agency, on current global threats posed by China and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Inhofe:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For both of you,
the lack of an independent intelligence community significantly worsened
Putin's decision-making in Ukraine. What do
you think President Xi, in China, is learning about his intelligence
communities? Both of you.Haines:
Thank you. Senator Inhofe, I think it's a really interesting question. I'd
prefer to answer it perhaps in closed session. Would that be alright, sir?Inhofe:
That's fine. Do you have any comments to make in this open session?Berrier:
Senator, I will take the DNI's lead on that.Inhofe:
I suspected that. Thank you.The Biden administration has offered Iran
significant sanctions, relief, and return to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. General Berrier, would you
expect Iran to spend at least some of this sanctions relief on its terrorist proxies and missile programs? Do you agree that if the IRGC [Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps] has additional money that they would increase their
targeting of Americans and our allies. Let's say, could they increase that
targeting?Berrier:
Yes, Senator, they could increase targeting against our partners in the region
as well as U.S. forces if they had increased funding.


















Inhofe:
I appreciate that very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today delivered opening remarks at a SASC hearing on the
rising national security threats amid growing inflation and an insufficient
defense budget request. Witnesses include: Avril Haines, Director
of National Intelligence, and Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, Director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency.Inhofe: Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I join you in welcoming our witnesses.When
our witnesses testified before this committee last year, they provided a dire
assessment of the threats to our national security. It's clear and, I really
can't overstate this, the security situation we face today is significantly
more dangerous and complex than it has ever been, or certainly was a year ago.
The Chinese threat is beyond anything we ever dealt with before. This year, Beijing announced a 7.1 percent defense budget
increase. They've had two decades of real growth with no signs of slowing down
and, as the chairman alluded to, Putin's unprovoked aggression against Ukraine
shows the danger posed by the nuclear-armed Russia to our security, those of
our allies, and international order.Iran's
malign behavior continues throughout the Middle East and terrorist groups like
ISIS and al-Qaeda are growing in strength across Africa. Despite this reality,
President Biden's budget request is inadequate. It doesn't deliver the real
growth the military needs, and that is the 3 to 5 percent increase that we
established some five years ago. And as I've said it before, inflation is the
new sequestration that we consider today, and it's making everything we do more
difficult.
So,
I look forward to hearing from both of you about how our threats have evolved
ever since last year and how the intelligence community is changing to respond
to the national security strategy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today questioned the Honorable Christine Wormuth, Secretary
of the Army, and the Honorable General James McConville, Chief of Staff of the
Army, on how the budget supports the end-strength of the Army and on munitions
preparedness. Inhofe: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I always like to
start off when we have General McConville here, an
update on his three kids. I can remember when they were all three captains, and
now they are all moving up and still very active. What's going on there?McConville: Well, they're very proud to serve.
They're serving around the world in special operations forces and very, very
proud of what they're doing. And I also have a son-in-law that's serving too.Inhofe: We'll count him too, yeah. That's good. I
know how proud you are.Reed: Ask him about
Patton.Inhofe: Oh yeah, and
Patton. Don't forget.McConville: We're very proud
to have our first grandson. His name is Patton James Nanzer. He's six months
old, and we're real proud of him. He's already got a hall named after him at
Fort Myer. Patton Hall.Inhofe: Ok. That's great.
Well, as noted in my opening remarks, the Army unfunded priorities [list]
totals $5.1 billion, and I guess the first question I would ask you would be is
everything on your list executable at this time?McConville: Yes, it is,
Senator. Inhofe: As I highlighted
in my opening statement, it's my understanding that the Army's reduced
end-strength of [473,000], and it was talked about by both of you before, but
it's driven by recruiting challenges and I know that you've already talked
about that a little bit. But, it's something that's more serious than any
recruiting challenge that I've experienced in the years that I've been here.In
2018, General Milley testified before this committee that we're shooting to get
north of 500,000, which was recommended in this document [the National Defense
Strategy Commission Report]. That's in the regular Army. And last year, you
said, and this is a quote from you: ""I think the regular Army should be
somewhere around 540,000-550,000.""And
despite the difficulty we're having right now, the biggest problem I think
we're having is recruiting at this time. And we talked about that a couple days
ago in my office. And this is still, I believe, the most serious problem. In
spite of the difficulty in recruiting the Army is facing right now, that we
discussed just a couple days ago, is it still your best military judgement that
we require an Army greater than 500,000?McConville: Well, Senator, I
think we need a bigger Army. I stand by the comments I made before.Inhofe: I say that
knowing full well the recruiting problem - everything you're trying and the
efforts there, and I understand that. But where does that leave us?McConville: I also think
quality is more important that quality. And what we have to do to get after
this, as the Senator said, right now, 83 percent of the young men and women
that are coming into the Army are coming from military family members and, you
know, it's nice that it's the military family business. We need this to be an
American family business. We need to attract others. We need to expose others
to the benefits of serving their country.Again,
what we're finding right now is 23 percent of Americans are qualified to serve
in the military. So we have to do some work in our high schools and we have to
do some work in preparing young men and women to come ‘cause I don't think
there's any better way to serve and I think we need to have a call to service.Inhofe: And I agree with
that. And, Madam Secretary, I know my time is expiring, but the conflict in
Ukraine has revealed serious munitions production challenges that we have at
this time. And I know that there's another member that's going to ask you about
that, but just as an overview, what should be done to fix what I consider to be
the second most urgent problem we are dealing with right now?Wormuth: Well, Senator, I
think what we need to do is work closely with the defense industry to look at,
you know, how we can help them address some of the supply chain challenges that
they're having, for example.The
money that Congress is providing through the supplemental will help us do that
in terms of accelerating some of those production times. And the Army has actually
invested considerably more in ammunition in its budget in the last couple of
years, recognizing the criticality of the munitions issue.








































Inhofe: Well, you're
going to have an opportunity to expand more on this urgent mission. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-gives-opening-remarks-on-fy23-army-budget-request,"May 05, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today delivered opening remarks at a SASC hearing on the Army’s
fiscal year 2023 budget request. Inhofe: Thank you,
Chairman Reed. I join you in welcoming our witnesses. I had an opportunity, and
have in the past, several times, of getting to know them quite well, and I appreciate the efforts that they'll be — and the challenges
that they are facing right now.For
four years, this committee has used this 2018 National Defense Strategy and
Commission Report as our roadmap. We've gotten our money's worth out of this
thing over the last couple years. Rightly, the Biden administration recently
released a defense strategy to underscore the accelerating threat of the
Chinese Communist Party and its unprecedented military modernization.
Unfortunately, the administration has sent to Congress a budget request that
does not provide the resources necessary to combat that threat or others that
we are facing right now. Not
only does it fail to provide the 3 to 5 percent real growth recommendation
that's in this NDS report that we have been following for a number of years, it
doesn't even keep up with the record-high inflation that we are facing. The
absence of real growth in the request combined with the record-high inflation
would leave our military under-resourced. And this is most evident in the
budget request for the Army.Of
course, those of us old Army guys always observe the Army gets the short end of
this stuff when changes are made. Am I the only one that ever observes this,
Mr. Chairman?Reed: No, sir.Inhofe: OK. Anyway. The
request cuts military construction by 39 percent. It cuts research and
development by 6 percent. It cuts procurement by 7 percent, and, notably, the
procurement cut would substantially slow modernization of armored brigade
combat teams, which are essential to deter further Russian aggression. Given the
inadequate budget request, it's no surprise that the Army's unfunded priorities
list — what
I call the risk list — totals $5.1 billion. I look forward to understanding
from our witnesses the risks associated with this budget request.
















Additionally,
I look forward to hearing what will be done to overcome a significant
recruiting challenge. This is one that I have not seen before, and I think it's
more severe than any challenge that we've had in the past. And that is that
we're now facing, just in this year, some reduction of requested — a shortfall
of 12,000. So, Mr. Chairman, clearly we've got a lot to do to ensure that our
military has the resources they need. Thank you."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-praises-oklahoma-provisions-in-water-resources-development-act-of-2022,"May 04, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, praised the unanimous committee passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022 and announced provisions in the legislation that will benefit Oklahoma.“The EPW Committee has passed the fifth consecutive two-year water resources bill, continuing Congress’ regular consideration and prioritization of America’s water infrastructure needs that I started in 2014 and 2016,” Inhofe said. “This strong bipartisan bill includes a number of important provisions that will benefit Oklahoma and empower economic growth for decades to come.“This includes a provision to secure the future of Bartlesville’s water supply to more than 50,000 people and another to bring major economic development opportunities to the Tulsa Ports and the entire northeastern region of Oklahoma. Additionally, this bill includes provisions to facilitate and speed up the deepening of the MKARNS to a 12-foot channel – increasing freight capacity by 40 percent. Not only that, the bill prioritizes completing the modernization of the Tulsa and West-Tulsa Levees System—a priority of mine for a long time now—and clarifies the Corps’ commitment to the Arkansas River Corridor Project.”Copan and Bartlesville Water Supply ContractsIn 2016, Bartlesville learned purchasing additional water supply from Hulah and Copan lakes could cost over $100 million over 10 years based on the current pricing structure for purchasing water from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ lakes. Sen. Inhofe secured a provision in the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act that would make it affordable for municipalities, like Bartlesville, to contract with the Corps for water supply. This new provision continues to secure the future of Bartlesville’s water supply to the city’s more than 50,000 people in its tri-county area. It would release the City of Copan from approximately 4,700 acre-feet of water and allow the City of Bartlesville to purchase this water supply at a reduced price, saving the city nearly $10 million.Land Transfer at Inola, Okla., for Tulsa PortsIn 2019, Tulsa Ports acquired over 2,200 acres in Rogers County to develop into one of the nation’s largest industrial parks and inland waterway ports. Inhofe’s provision would convey waterfront land owned by the Corps to the Tulsa Ports at the Inola site to enhance fleeting and docking opportunities. This would pave the way for major economic development opportunities for Tulsa Ports and the entire northeastern region of Oklahoma.Prioritizing the Tulsa and West-Tulsa Levees SystemThis provision prioritizes completing the modernization of the Tulsa and West-Tulsa Levees System. This project was authorized in the 2020 Water Infrastructure Act and was fully funded on January 19, 2022. Expected construction completion will be in 2026.Prioritizing the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS)Inland Waterways Dredge Pilot Program—This provision would facilitate the deepening of the MKARNS to a 12-foot channel by establishing a demonstration program to combine construction with operations and maintenance work for dredging projects on the inland waterways. Sen. Inhofe has recently urged the Corps to prioritize and commit funding for MKARNS deepening.Inland Waterways Trust Fund Cost Share Change—This provision would speed up construction of the MKARNS 12-foot deepening by increasing the Federal cost-share for projects on the inland waterways to 75 percent. Doing so would direct more Federal funds to inland waterway navigation projects.Arkansas River Corridor ProjectThis provision would clarify the Corps’ cost-share for participating in the Arkansas River Corridor project, which Inhofe authorized in 2007. This is an ecosystem restoration, recreation and flood damage reduction project which would mitigate extreme flow variability resulting from the operations of Keystone Dam. The project would provide ‘water in the river’ during low flow conditions and between hydropower generation periods when Keystone Dam releases are off.Mitigation Banking PermitsThis provision would authorize the Corps to expedite the permits for a mitigation bank from a non-Federal entities, such as a public port authority, as long as the non-Federal entity uses the revenues for a public purpose.Enhanced Development at Corps Lakes in OklahomaThis provision urges the Corps to consider the economic benefits of development and recreation activities at rural lakes in Oklahoma.A number of stakeholders voiced support for the Water Resources Development Act of 2022:“Oklahoma greatly appreciates Senator Inhofe’s leadership and vision to provide for the future of MKARNS, Oklahoma’s Inland Waterway in WRDA 2022,” said Tim Gatz, Secretary of Transportation for Oklahoma and Executive Director of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. “The Senator’s unwavering and long standing support for Oklahoma’s navigation system and all of our multimodal transportation network continues to bring exciting opportunities for both existing and new businesses and is vital to our continued economic growth.”“Senator Inhofe continues to be a tireless champion of the need for and importance of investment in our nation’s water infrastructure.” said Rich Brierre, Executive Director of INCOG. “The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee sets the framework for project funding and implementation for critical projects in Oklahoma and throughout the nation.  Of particular importance to the Tulsa Region is expediting completion of the Tulsa and West Tulsa Arkansas River Levee System project, increased funding authorization for the Arkansas River Corridor project and provisions to accelerate completion of the deepening of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.   Once again, Senator Inhofe’s leadership, focus and persistence in this effort is to be commended.”“Funding for pre-engineering and design has been fast tracked for the Tulsa and West-Tulsa Levee System to the relief of our region,” said Karen Keith, District 2 Tulsa County Commissioner. “These levees protect industry lining the Arkansas river from Sand Springs to Tulsa as well as hundreds of families. I am excited to begin to rebuild the levee system as soon as possible. Sen. Inhofe and his staff are continually engaged and without their work to secure this funding, none of this would have been possible. I am so grateful.”“Oklahomans and our neighboring states benefit from the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which enables public and private ports in both states to provide low cost and dependable waterborne freight transportation options to our region,” said David Yarbrough, Port Director of the Tulsa Ports. “ Now, more than ever, The Tulsa Port of Catoosa, with its capabilities in moving fertilizer and grain between heartland-located farmers and the world markets, is vital to our Nation’s economy.  The Tulsa Port Authority is grateful for our elected officials who work on behalf of Oklahoma and the MKARNS, especially Senator Inhofe for his leadership on this WRDA legislation that enhances the Oklahoma Maritime industry.” ""On behalf of the City of Bartlesville, I would like to sincerely thank Sen. Inhofe for his tremendous work and leadership in securing language in the  'America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2022' that will help ensure needed and affordable water supply for Bartlesville and its surrounding communities,” said Dale Copeland, Mayor of Bartlesville. “This language is vital to the over 50,000 people in the region who depend on access to reliable water storage in order to keep up with regional growth and to foster economic development."""
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-pays-tribute-to-lifelong-friend-and-former-colleague-orrin-hatch,"May 04, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) spoke on the Senate floor today to pay tribute to his friend and former colleague Sen. Orrin Hatch.As Prepared for Delivery:Mr. President, much has already been said on this floor, as we express our love and admiration for our friend and former colleague Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.Orrin was the best of all of us and the Inhofe household was very sad to hear of his passing.I’ll never forget the time he took to answer calls from an obscure state senator from Oklahoma (that was me, if you hadn’t guessed). And he had this way about him with everyone he met—unwavering kindness and a gentle nature that Kay and I will miss deeply.We were close long before I was even in the House. Orrin was the one who I would go to for wisdom and we had the same love for Jesus and everything we hold dear.I will always remember his humor, but he also gave the best advice. He was not just a friend, but a confidant. Whether he was talking about scripture or history, he had a way of saying things that brought people together. I think back fondly on everything we got done while Orrin was in office. Despite strong opposition at the time, myself and Sens. Hatch, Chambliss and Thune were able to pass an amendment permitting the Air Force to enter into a multi-year procurement for a total of 60 F-22s during the 2007 NDAA. That turned out to be one-third of the total force. The argument against the amendment was, at the time, we did not need such an air-dominance fighter. But we knew we were making an investment in the future of our defense. Orrin had that foresight, as he showed many times throughout his career. Not only that, but together, we worked very closely to ensure the future of our Air Force depots. I remember the CODEL I led with Sens. Hatch and Chambliss which toured each of the Depots as part of our initiative to restore their funding. Now, Orrin was a jokester—most times poking fun at himself. I remember laughing often when he was around. Together, we supported funding for these Air Force Depots that continue to be vital to our home states of Oklahoma, Utah and Georgia, but we had fun while doing it. That was Orrin’s way.For those of you who are not familiar with our nation’s depots, they are state-of-the-art maintenance and repair facilities for the Air Force’s aircraft. Simply put, our nation would not be able to rule the skies without the critical maintenance and repair work performed on our incredibly complex aircraft. To ensure our nation will always have our nation’s depots, there are laws, commonly called “Core” and “50/50” which preserve the depots workload. Throughout my tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I greatly appreciated the legal analysis Senator Hatch provided my staff and I when the Executive Branch would send over suggested changes to these critical laws. There are many times when after reading those proposals Sen. Hatch would raise the alarm and my colleagues on the SASC and I would then battle those proposals back.  After the Obama Administration cancelled NASA’s Project Constellation, which was supposed to replace the Space Shuttle, there was a real question if the civilian solid rocket motor industry, which employs thousands of Utahns, would survive. Using his considerable legislative skills, Senator Hatch was able to insert language in the Fiscal Year 2010 NASA Authorization Act that directed the new heavy-lift Space Launch System (SLS) be built to lift, from inception, 130 tons – an objective which, at the time, could only be accomplished by using solid rocket motors.As a result, a few weeks ago, NASA just rolled the SLS out to the launch pad for testing before it carries our astronauts to the Moon in 2025.  I was also very impressed by how Sen. Hatch used his prominence to promote the use of Hill Air Force Base. Whenever there was an Air Force official within hearing distance, Sen. Hatch would espouse the strengths and capabilities of Hill, Ogden Air Logistics Complex and the Utah Testing and Training Range.In fact, I honestly believe that one of the reasons why Hill was chosen to receive the first three squadrons of F-35s is because he was always advocating for Hill with the Air Force’s senior-most leadership.  One of the things that I loved about him was his placement of obscure words into many of his speeches. You know, words that no one has any idea what they mean, like: bovarism (an exaggerated, especially glamorized, estimate of oneself.); cockalorum (a small man with a big opinion of himself.) or furphy (a false report; rumor). When asked why he insisted on using this vocabulary, Sen. Hatch would beam his boyish grin, chuckle, and respond, “I like confusing the Democrats.”  He had a very particular way of trying to get to know the volunteers who would drive him to events throughout Utah. Without fail, he would always compliment the volunteer about their car and go into great detail about all of the wonderful accessories it contained. I mean the volunteer could have been driving a 50-year-old Yugo, with the floor rusted through, but I can assure you, Sen. Hatch would find something nice to say about the volunteer’s car.  Now, it is my personal opinion is that one of the best ways to know someone is to listen to them pray. When we address our Creator, we reveal who we really are.For those who listen to this or read this record, I want to present the genuine Orrin Hatch to you — the person we all came to know and love.In 2010, Sen. Hatch was chosen to say the main prayer at the 57th National Prayer Breakfast here in D.C. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Sen. Hatch’s prayer for “peace and tranquility” — in front of that crowd of 4,000 people, on that February morning 12 years ago, be included in the record as part of my remarks. This is the man we knew, and loved.Today, I believe, Orrin Hatch fully enjoys the peace and tranquility he prayed for.All that to say, Orrin Hatch will be missed dearly by me. We have lost a true hero and one of my closest friends. Kay and I are praying for Elaine, their family and loved ones as they go through this hard time. Goodbye, my friend, and God Bless you. Inhofe submitted the following prayer from former Sen. Hatch for the record:“Let us pray. As we bow our heads this morning before Thee, we are so grateful for this great nation, and for the nations of the world and especially for the opportunities we have as a nation to bring peace and contentment and tranquility throughout this world. We are grateful for our great leaders and pray Thou will bless them. We pray that Thou will bless our President and our Vice President and their cabinet. And all the leaders throughout the federal government, that they might be inspired to lead us to do the things that are righteous in Thy sight. That we might be able to be good followers and that we might be able to bind together to do what is right. As Moses’ father-in-law told him, let’s share the responsibility and let’s work together in the best interests of our country. Let’s have bipartisanship reborn again in this great nation. We are so grateful for those who serve in the military, who are represented here today and throughout this country. We are grateful for all the sacrifices that they undertake on our behalf. We are grateful for those who are in harm’s way and we pray Thou will pour out Thy special blessing upon them, that they may be blessed and protected. And we pray that we might be a nation that will help bring peace and tranquility throughout the world. We are grateful for all the food, clothing and shelter that Thou hast provided for us. We are grateful for those who serve in governments throughout the states and the respective state legislatures. And last but not least, we are grateful for the Congress of the United States and pray that the Congress might be able to work together, as Democrats and Republicans and Independents, to serve Thee and serve our country and to serve our fellow men and women. And bring peace and content to this great nation and throughout the world. We pray at this time for those who are suffering in Haiti and elsewhere throughout the world and ask you to bless them and help them and help us to do our share in helping throughout this world. We are grateful for leaders from other countries who are here and pray Thy blessing upon them. Once again, we ask you to bless our President and Vice President and the leaders of this country. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.”    "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-pentagon-not-doing-enough-to-address-record-high-inflation,"May 04, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking members
of the Senate and House Armed Services Committee, today released the following
statement after the Department of Defense responded to their March 17, 2022,
letter. The letter requested detailed information on the effects of record
inflation on the Department’s budget. “We appreciate the Department of
Defense response to our March 17, 2022, letter, which sought to give us a
better understanding of how the Department considers the effects of inflation
in its budget process. Even though we’re facing the worst inflation in 40 years
under President Biden, it seems the Department of Defense has done little to
address it.“General Milley had it right when
he told the House Armed Services Committee: the Department’s estimations are
‘obviously incorrect.’ Even using the Office of Management and Budget’s
preferred metric for inflation (GDP chained price index), the fiscal year 2023
estimate is likely way off. The budget request revised 2022 inflation
assumptions from 1.8 to 3.9 percent as measured by the GDP (chained) price
index, but that metric is currently running at 6.4 percent though the first
half of fiscal year 2022. “Overall,
we are concerned that the Department is not taking a proactive stance to
mitigate the harmful effects of inflation. At the very least, they should be
collecting necessary data, establishing a governance framework and conducting
regular touchpoints with all stakeholders. In particular, it doesn’t seem that
the Department has a good grasp on how inflation is hurting our service members
and their families — and how this is in turn impacting recruiting and
retention. Likewise, we are concerned that the Department does not have an
adequate understanding of the challenges facing the industrial base.  “Remember:
At the end of the day, getting the inflation number right is important, but
it’s only part of the story. If we want to protect our country and meet
national security needs, we need 3 to 5 percent real growth above inflation. We
plan to accomplish this goal in this year’s NDAA.”

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-questions-secretary-kendall-on-accelerating-aircraft-acquisition,"May 03, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today questioned Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall on
accelerating the critical production of military aircraft. Inhofe: Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I have a couple questions that are very similar to what the Chairman
has asked, but gives you a chance to go in a little deeper if you want to do
so. I've referred to the hearing that we had a week ago today with two other
experts, and actually gave a quote from one of them. We've heard — on this end
of the table — from contractors, from service members, everyone from aircraft
production to military construction about its [inflation’s] significant,
harmful effects.Late
last night, we just received your response from a letter that Mr. Rogers from
the House, and I sent some time ago. Now, we only got a response late last
night, but I suspect, and I want to make sure that we get this on the record,
that you had your response completed prior to that time, but we had not
received it yet. Is that accurate?Kendall: Senator, we had
worked on that response over a period of time, and it was reviewed multiple
times, I think, as it was finalized. I signed it out yesterday, just before it
was delivered to you, I believe.Inhofe: Yes, but on the
other hand, your part was completed prior to that, I would suspect.Kendall: I don't know that
I can say that, Senator.Inhofe: Alright, that's
fine. That's fine. I also talked about something very similar to what the
Chairman was talking about here. I talked about the AWACs, the E-7, in my
opening statement. Now, this is an issue that's very close to us because AWACs,
some 30, or 27 — I think 27 are in Oklahoma, but the other six are forward
deployed, I understand. But I think all of us agree we need to get the E-7 as
fast as possible for the high-end fight.Now,
that was asked by the Chairman, but I'd like to be a little more specific. What
options are we looking at to accelerate this program? Can we accelerate the
acquisition authorities? And is there a way that you think we can put this together
so that we can actually have the contract done in ‘22 so we don't lose an extra
year? That's the concern that I had in my opening statement. What do you think?Kendall: Senator, we'd
really like to accelerate the program if we could. It's not clear at this time
that there are opportunities to do that. We talked about this just yesterday
with you. I am exploring some options that might be possible, but I can't say
with any certainty that they can be executed yet. And some of them, quite
frankly, are gonna require some changes from some people who we don't
necessarily have control of in terms of their priorities.We
have to get new airplanes, and then we have to modify them, and the supply
chain that supports all that is a big part of what we have to do. That's what
takes so much time. I would like to be able to look at things that can reduce
risk to en sure that we meet that schedule. There may be things we can do to
accelerate planning, but access to the aircraft we would have to modify is
going to be the thing that limits us more than anything else. We are going to
continue to look for options, and we'll cooperate with you on that.






















Inhofe: Well, Mr.
Secretary, I appreciate that. Yes, we talked about that yesterday with all
three of you, and I just wanted to give you an opportunity to get on record
with it, ‘cause I think that is significant. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. "

Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget request for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force,
commenting on the military’s lack of preparedness in the face of growing
threats from inflation and China.   Inhofe: Thank you Mr.
Chairman. We join you in welcoming our three witnesses today.I'll
get right to it. I've reviewed the new 2022 National Defense Strategy, and I've
examined the budget, and I've attended multiple threat briefings. Secretary
Kendall, I was sorry to miss one of yours, but I've made all the rest of them.
That didn't paint a very optimistic picture of what we're faced with, so I
don't understand how this Air Force budget even begins to resource the
strategy.First,
inflation is the new sequestration. It's destroying your buying power and the
salaries of your service members. It's definitely true in 2022 and probably
true in 2023. Second, there's simply not enough in this budget to reverse the
trends we hear about in classified sessions. That's particularly true over the
next five to seven years. This budget divests 1,500 aircraft and buys 500. You
know, the math doesn't work out. Let's take one example: the budget retires
almost 31 — well, there are thirty one total of the AWACs of which — 31 are in
Oklahoma, and I think some are forward deployed, maybe five or six. And that's
one example of where we're at right now. And the replacement won't come online
until 2027. I've always been in favor of divesting aircraft when it makes sense
and we can mitigate the risk, but we're not mitigating the risk unless we move
much, much faster than we are moving today. I appreciate your decision to
pursue a sole source of the E-7 Wedgetail. I look forward to working with you
to use existing authorities to get the critical capabilities as soon as
possible.Another,
this budget only buys 33 F-35As, the lowest since sequestration. These Block 4
aircraft will be the cornerstone of our fleet. New allies and partners are
joining in the program and our commanders and pilots tell us that they love the
aircraft and they love to fly it. We are still buying multiple air munitions at
very low rates. We're buying tankers at very low rates despite concerns about
contested logistics. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.Just
to be clear: I'm not blaming you. The three witnesses today, they're not to be
blamed on this. I don't want that to be misunderstood. This is what's
happening: when you get an arbitrary topline, when the budget just doesn't
match the strategy, it's not strategy-based budgeting.There
are bright spots in the Air Force budget. Nuclear modernization is proceeding
well. The B-1, the next generation in air dominance, are seeing significant
success stories. But most of the bright spots share one thing in common: that
is they're 10 years away. I'm proud of what the Space Force has been able to
achieve with the real budget growth since its stand-up. We find they're moving
in a fleet with the threat in space.Now,
here's something that was significant because — a week ago today, we had a
hearing here in this chamber, and we had David Berteau. I'm gonna use this
quote as often as I can to remind people we can sit around and talk about what
I just did in this opening statement, but when it gets down to it though, we
should be talking about what China is doing and his quote, David Berteau, a
week ago today said, ""It takes us today three years to do what China can
do in three days in terms of deciding, resourcing, and getting started on
something that needs to be done, particularly bringing new technology into
play.” And that's a significant thing here. No matter how far behind we are, we
are getting further behind and I think we discussed why this is happening and
this is the thing we need to be addressing.Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) met with members of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber this week in Washington. They discussed current legislative priorities, including secured funding for Tinker Air Force Base in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and Tinker priorities for this year’s NDAA.“It’s always an engaging visit when the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber comes to Washington and I was glad to welcome them back this week,” said Inhofe. “We talked about a number of topics that are important to them, including the future of the E-7 Wedgetail at Tinker and secured funding in last year’s NDAA that makes certain the KC-46 and the B-21 missions are funded, keeping Tinker at the center of the Air Force’s global mission. Oklahoma City has proven time and again that they are a premier place to bring your business. Not only that, the community understands the importance of supporting Tinker Air Force Base and I am proud of all of the work we’ve gotten done together throughout my years in Congress. We’re not done yet.”“Sen. Inhofe’s leadership throughout the years on behalf of Oklahoma City and Tinker Air Force Base has been a game-changer,” said Roy Williams, President and CEO of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber. “Sen. Inhofe, Oklahoma City, Tinker Air Force Base and our defense industry partners work as a team every day to ensure our Air Force is ready to fly, fight and win. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him and I look forward to continuing that tradition this year.”  "

Preston had to report,” Inhofe said. “Both the MKARNS deepening and the Tulsa-West Tulsa Levees Project are well on their way to being completed and I want to thank Col. Preston and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for their continued dedication on these vital projects.”“In addition to moving the schedule forward on the MKARNS deepening, the Tulsa-West Tulsa Levees Project is moving design forward in order to begin construction early in 2023 with a projected final completion date of 2026,"" Col. Preston said. ""We could not have gotten here without Sen. Inhofe’s work and support throughout the years.”On April 27, 2022, Inhofe led a letter to the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging them to prioritize and commit additional funding to the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS). On January 19, 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided full funding for the Tulsa-West Tulsa Levees Project. The Army Corps released the work plans to fund multiple projects in Oklahoma."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-statement-on-ukraine-supplemental-request,"April 29, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, today released the following statement on the Biden administration’s
supplemental request for Ukraine: “Ukraine
can win this fight if they have the right tools and equipment. I applaud the
Department of Defense’s leadership in fighting for a robust request that
recognizes the critical role the United States plays in supplying military aid
to Ukraine and shoring up NATO’s security posture. This request is much more
substantial than what the administration has done so far, and I hope it means
they have learned we can’t continue to be a day late
and a dollar short.“I
am reviewing this request closely to ensure whatever supplemental Congress puts
together provides adequate funding for military aid to our friends in Ukraine
and our allies and partners in Eastern Europe and around the world doing their
part — just as we did back in March, when Senate Republicans led the charge to
nearly double the President’s request for military aid. I remain concerned this
request still does not fully meet the scope and scale of the challenges the
Armed Forces of Ukraine face over the next several months. We’ve seen that the
fighting in the east is heavy, and the Russians have no plans to let up.“I
will also be looking closely at the backfill portion of the supplemental
request, where we are still moving much too slowly. I am glad that the
Department of Defense is taking real steps to address the shortfalls in our
stocks of various critical munitions and those of our allies and partners. With
the flexible munitions funds, Department of Defense leadership is thinking
creatively, and we will work to ensure that creativity is met in kind. I will
work with my colleagues in considering this request with a mind to move out
immediately to fix these problems while not slowing down our direct aid to
Ukraine—we cannot afford to choose between the present fight and our future
defense.








“Congress
must act immediately to get the right aid to Ukraine, and we may need to do so
again in the future. Once this legislation is enacted, I urge the
administration not to delay in getting this military assistance out the door.
It took them two months to draw down the last package we provided — that’s time
Ukraine just doesn’t have.”"

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, issued the following statement after the committee received a
classified briefing from Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks on the 2022
National Defense Strategy: “I’m
encouraged by what I’ve heard from this administration so far on its new
National Defense Strategy, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss some of
my questions and concerns with Secretary Hicks today. Anyone can see that the
world has only gotten more dangerous since our last National Defense Strategy
was released in 2018 — in particular, China has accelerated its already
unprecedented military modernization, and this strategy document helps us
expand our understanding of this pacing threat. This is a threat beyond
anything we’ve seen before.“I
remain deeply concerned that the White House has given us no timeline for when
we can expect to receive the National Security Strategy, which would allow us
to discuss the unclassified version of the National Defense Strategy. We know
that our budget needs to align with our strategy, and Congress needs all this
information to do our jobs well. In addition, the American people deserve a
robust open debate on these materials. I urge the administration to get these
documents to us as soon as possible.”

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), led a letter to the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging them to prioritize and commit additional funding to the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS).Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Reps.

Inland waterways barge transportation is the safest, most economical, and fuel-efficient way to move our nation's goods for use domestically and for export.”They continued: “Continuing the deepening of the MKARNS would directly benefit the 56,000 jobs for surrounding farmers, manufacturers, and other producers who contribute over $8 billion in sales and nearly $300 million in state and local tax revenue as a result of the system's efficient operation.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Director Young, Assistant Secretary Connor, and LTG Spellmon:We urge the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to prioritize and commit additional funding to theMcClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System (MKARNS), including deepening, and operations andmaintenance of the MKARNS in the allocation of additional funding provided by the Consolidated AppropriationsAct, 2022.The MKARNS, which opened as an official inland waterway system in 1971, originates at the Tulsa Port ofCatoosa and runs 445 miles through Oklahoma and Arkansas to the Mississippi River. Inland waterways bargetransportation is the safest, most economical, and fuel-efficient way to move our nation's goods for usedomestically and for export. On a single gallon of fuel, one barge can move freight more than four times fartherthan trucks. In a typical year, approximately 12 million tons of commerce traverses the MKARNS, valued at morethan $3.5 billion. However, if the MKARNS was deepened from 9-feet to 12-feet, the capacity of each barge couldincrease by nearly 400 tons and increase the value of business sales by over $250 million.Through enactment of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020, Congress provided the Corps withflexibility to continue carrying out construction of the deepening of the MKARNS. Continuing the deepening ofthe MKARNS would directly benefit the 56,000 jobs for surrounding farmers, manufacturers, and other producerswho contribute over $8 billion in sales and nearly $300 million in state and local tax revenue as a result of thesystem's efficient operation. We thank you for allocating $92.6 million to begin construction of MKARNSdeepening, and urge you to commit additional funding this year to ensure the timely completion of this importantproject.The future economic viability of the MKARNS is at risk as there is currently more than a $300 millionbacklog in critical maintenance along the entire 50-year-old system. This includes locks, dams, and other importantequipment that is deteriorating to dangerous conditions. The MKARNS is vital to the economies of Oklahoma andArkansas, as well as Kansas, which sends or receives 49 percent of the tonnage coming through Oklahoma ports.A critical failure on the system could result in it being shut down for months and even a temporary shutdown couldput future use of the system at risk, as businesses would no longer see the MKARNS as reliable and would likelyfind other means to transport their goods. Losing navigation on the entire MKARNS would cost over 6,000 jobsand cause national GDP to decline by $723 million.As the Corps develops the Fiscal Year 2022 Work Plan, we respectfully request your support inproviding additional funding for deepening, and operations and maintenance of the MKARNS. We lookforward to working with you on improving our nation's vital inland waterways infrastructure.Sincerely,  "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/defense-experts-highlight-adverse-effects-of-inflation-underfunding-on-us-military-preparedness,"April 26, 2022Today,
U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), questioned Ellen M. Lord, former Under Secretary of Defense
for Acquisition and Sustainment, about how inflation is hampering U.S. military
preparedness and how the situation in Ukraine has highlighted serious
challenges with our munitions supply chain. Inhofe: Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I think we covered that pretty well. Ms. Lord, in terms of the
inflation and the effect that it has — and a
lot of people don't really understand that —
is there anything after the comments that were made by Mr. Berteau that you'd
want to add on that particular issue?Lord: I would just
quickly say, Senator, that I think we have two huge challenges. One is
embracing risk and the other is moving more quickly. So, there are an enormous
number of authorities that the Congress has given DOD over the past five years
or so to more rapidly acquire to get capability down range into warfighters’ hands.Those
have been translated to both policy and implementation guidance. However, it
takes strong leadership to encourage the department to use those to be able to
move more quickly. So, the tools are there, but I believe the leadership is
required to hold the department accountable for showing how they're using other
transaction authorities, middle tier of acquisition, and these other things.Inhofe: OK, that's good.
One of my major concerns is key munitions. I would ask you, Ms. Lord: What has
the experience of supplying munitions to Ukraine highlighted about our
munitions supply chain? Can you specifically explain the challenges of Stinger
missile production, and what more should be done to shore up this production
line, and what other investments in our munitions industrial base are warranted
to ensure this does not happen again?Lord: Thank you,
Senator. The Stinger, which is a ground-air-launched missile,
shoulder-launched, which we have sent, probably, given public domain
information, a quarter of our stocks to Ukraine on, is an issue where we
cannot, within the next couple of years, produce more because we have a problem
with the government not paying to maintain production capacity.When
that happens, you have test equipment become obsolete and not work. You have
supply chains with links broken in them and especially if we had key elements
to that supply chain supplied by now-adversarial countries, we have to
reconstitute that. We have a challenge in proactively planning to be able to
produce these key weapons. Even with the Javelin, which we do have a hot
production line right now, we are still five years out to probably developing
all the munitions we need. So, I think the real issue here is how do we make
sure that we have a resilient supply chain to be able to produce the munitions
we need as a nation and also for our partners and allies.There
are a couple of answers to that, and one, I would say, is to begin to think
about our releasability and exportability regulations. We have been very, very
conservative with what we allow our closest allies to receive in terms of
technical information and manufacturing capability. We know that we do not have
enough munitions — they end up being the bill payer usually — and we could look
at countries like Australia that have capacity, that have throughput, that have
the budget to develop indigenous capability and work more closely with them to
make sure we have the munitions we need and our allies and partners do as well.Inhofe: Do you think that
we might be criticized for, maybe, holding too much from some of our allies?Lord: Absolutely.
General Hyten — retired General Hyten — and I used to co-chair quite a few
committees, and we would lament this. I think there has to be a demand signal
from Congress to, not only DOD, but State Department, to say that we need to be
a little bit more pragmatic about the three, four levels of technology
innovation behind where we are now that we are still not exporting. Huge
opportunity there to make up some of these shortfalls, leveraging other's
manufacturing capabilities.






















Inhofe: Very good. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-we-need-to-rebuild-our-defense-industrial-base,"April 26, 2022At a hearing today on the health of the defense
industrial base, U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, submitted for the record remarks stressing the challenges facing the
United States’ defense industrial base, including record inflation and slow
munitions production times. Witnesses
at the hearing included: Ellen Lord, former Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment, and David Berteau, President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Professional Services Council.As
Submitted for the Record:Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I join you in welcoming our witnesses. For four years, this
committee has been using the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the
Commission report as our roadmap for the resources and tools we need to meet
the threats we face. Both documents have helped accelerate change at the
Pentagon.Last month, we received
the classified version of the Biden administration’s new 2022 NDS, which we
continue to analyze. But I can tell you this document expands our understanding
of the scope of the threat from the Chinese Communist Party, and what will be
required to maintain deterrence against them.The problem does not
seem to be one of strategy, but rather providing the full budget needed to
implement it. The budget simply doesn’t deliver the real growth our military
needs – especially with the historic inflation we’re experiencing.Which brings me to
today’s hearing. I am hoping to better understand what our defense industrial
base is seeing and dealing with and how we can help them – whether through
legislative authorities or additional funding.In the 20th
century, our defense industrial base represented a unique comparative
advantage. From the arsenal of democracy in World War II to the technological
feats of the Cold War, our ability to harness American ingenuity for deterrence
played a decisive role in world events.Today, the arsenal
of democracy is a husk of its former self. While many companies still use
equipment from the early Cold War, the weapons and equipment they manufacture
have fundamentally changed, as has the workforce.We have far too
many single points of failure. We have brittle supply chains. We have hundreds
of production contracts at minimum sustaining rates. We have persistent funding
shortfalls across the board, but particularly in our workforce development.Over the past
decade, many new burdens have been asked of, demanded, and even mandated on
these companies and their employees. From sequestration to a pandemic, an
increasingly assertive China, Russia’s new invasion of Ukraine, record
inflation, and more.In particular, our
attempts to arm Ukraine have laid bare many of our vulnerabilities, from
insufficient munitions stocks to slow production times and incredible
bureaucratic hurdles, especially when it comes to doing business with allies
and partners.The defense
industrial base is at the core of our national security. I am eager to discuss
with our witnesses these specific challenges and how our defense industrial
base has responded.



























We need to rebuild our defense industrial base. I hope today’s hearing
will help us understand what more Congress can do to help ensure that our
defense industrial base gets all the resources it needs to remain resilient and
able to meet the capability and capacity needs of our men and women in uniform
who go into harm’s way. Thank you, Mr. Chairman"

Funding for a new school at Rivers Elementary and full funding in the FY22 defense bill for the KC-46 Tanker will ensure Altus continues to produce the best airmen and remains the greatest community for their families. I look forward to continuing to fight for the Altus community and the Altus Air Force Base this year.”“Sen. Inhofe continues to be a huge supporter of Mobility's Hometown and we were glad to visit with him in D.C.,” said Dr. Joe Leverett, Chairman of the Altus Military Affairs Committee. “Inhofe fought for Altus in last year’s NDAA, securing funding for procurement that ensures Altus will remain the premier base to train mobility airmen and ensuring Altus appropriately sustains the KC-135 mission while welcoming in the KC-46A.

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, today questioned top defense officials about their recommendations
for the Fiscal Year 2023 defense budget. Witnesses included: Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark
Milley; and Michael McCord, Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). Inhofe: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCord, the chairman
asked a question and led off with, which I was going to do, but currently, now,
the question would be in 2022. You want to expand a little bit on that year?McCord: Yes, Senator. On inflation, in 2022, the GDP
deflator, which is what the department has always used, was — the budget that
you got last year this time was built on 2 percent, we now saw the year ended
at 4, and that's what we caught up on so that that pricing, going forward,
building into our program going forward, would not be behind.The tricky part,
from now, is assessing what's going to happen in ‘23 going forward, given how
hard it is to predict these things and whether oil price spikes are going to
persist or not persist, things like that.Inhofe: Which, I think, they will be persisting. Secretary
Austin, there are some who say that we shouldn't be talking about the topline,
we should be talking about how the budget aligns with strategy, and I think
that we need to talk about both. But we only have a classified defense strategy,
and we have no National Security Strategy.So, how are we
supposed to connect the dots between the strategy and the budget? Is there any
timeline for the White House to release the National Security Strategy so we can
have a debate in public about the strategy?Austin: Well, thanks, Senator. I can't offer you a timeline
on when that's going to be released. I will only say as we constructed the
National Defense Strategy, we used the guidance that was available in the very
detailed National Security Strategy guidance that was published very early on
in this administration, and that was very helpful to us to allow us to map out
the strategy that you now see. And if you look at that strategy, and you look
at that budget, you'll see direct linkages between the budget and the strategy,
because we use the strategy to fabricate the budget.Inhofe: Ok, that's good. Thank you very much. General Milley,
I'm going to ask you one question, and I already know the answer ‘cause I know
you, and I think it need to be stated in this hearing. I'm going to follow up
on Congressman Turner's question from the HASC hearing earlier this week. You
said your position on these sub-launched nuclear missile hadn't changed. I just
wanted to confirm, like Admiral Richard and General Wolters, that your best
military advice is to continue development of this missile for deterrence
purposes.Milley: That's correct, Senator. My position didn't change,
and I think that it's important to have as many options as possible for this
president or any other president. But I do want to state also that we have lots
of options and we have a significant nuclear capability, so I don't want any
foreign adversary to misread what I'm saying. I happen to believe this
president and every president needs lots of options, which we have, but I think
more options are better.Inhofe: Ok. Great. Mr. Chairman.

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, today reiterated the need for defense budget that provides 5 percent
real growth above current levels at a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2023
budget request for the Department of Defense. Witnesses
included: Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff General Mark Milley; and Michael McCord, Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller).As Delivered:Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, and I join you in welcoming the witnesses. For four
years, this committee has been using this 2018 document, the National Defense
Strategy [(NDS0] Commission [Report], and I don't recall ever having one
document hang around for so long with so many — the 12 who got involved with
this to start with did a good job in putting those forward.Last
week, we received the classified version of the Biden administration's new NDS
- that's this. From what I've seen so far, the new strategy document does a
good job expanding our understanding of the scale and the scope of the threat
from the Chinese Communist Party and its military modernization. There are some
things that we'll probably have disagreement about. We have done that in the
past, but we continue to consider the new strategy. For example, there may be
some areas of strategy that the administration is willing to take risk and the
Congress may or may not agree. That is clear, and I really can't stress this
enough: the Chinese threat is beyond anything that we have dealt with before in
our lives.General
Milley, last year you told us that the Chinese and the Russians combined spend
more than us on national defense. This year, Beijing announced an additional 7.1
percent increase in their defense budget. This is a scary thing. This is a big
deal.Mr.
Secretary, I do appreciate that — based on the new NDS — that you went to the
White House to ask for more resources, and I appreciate that very much. But,
even then, the budget just doesn't rise to the moment. It doesn't deliver the
real growth our military needs. And it says very clearly in this document — in
the very beginning of the document — the 3 percent to 5 percent range is where
we need to be, and that real growth recommendation comes from the bipartisan commission.The
budget also doesn't reckon with the record-high inflation we're seeing today in
the realm of 7 to 8 percent. On a bipartisan basis, Congress tried to give our
defense budget real growth in 2022, but the military will end up losing buying
power due to the inflation. This historic inflation is a new — I call it the
new sequestration. We all remember when we went through the sequestration
together.For
me, this isn't just about how much money we spent on defense; this is about how
we spend the money. And we need a higher topline because what's in this budget
right now is not nearly enough to make up for lost time.This
budget shrinks both our naval fleet and our Air Force aircraft fleet. It cuts
end strength, the end strength, which has been very disturbing to all of us.
I'm glad to see the investment in research and development. So, some good
things are out there working, and we're all doing it together.






















And
the reason I took so long in this opening is this is the first budget hearing
of the season. You know, people don't realize that this goes on 12 months a
year. And that's what this is all about, and we're gonna do a good job. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the EPW Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, gave opening remarks today at a hearing to consider nominations to the Tennessee Valley Authority.The nominations are as follows: Beth Geer, Robert Klein, and L. Michelle Moore to be Members of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Ben Wagner to be Inspector General of the Tennessee Valley Authority.As Prepared for Delivery:While my home state of Oklahoma is not part of the TVA region, having been a former chairman of this committee, I have come to know and appreciate the vital role that the TVA plays for the states of Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia.With that in mind, geographic representation at our agencies cannot be overlooked.I share the concern of my colleagues from Kentucky and Mississippi who are disappointed by President Biden’s highly unusual decision not to put forward nominations to the TVA Board from these states.It’s past time that the president put forward nominees from these states.The TVA keeps the lights on for nearly ten million Americans and it does so with an all-of-the-above energy approach to power generation, which include fossil fuels.Today, fossil fuels make up over 40 percent of TVA’s electricity generation portfolio while wind and solar account for just 3 percent.The calls to eliminate fossil fuels from the power sector are foolish and would be devastating for the American people by increasing already sky-high utility bills and creating greater unreliability for the electric grid.Last month, media reports indicated that the TVA intends to invest over $3.5 billion in new natural-gas burning electric plants.This is a smart investment, because when the sun isn’t shining, or the wind isn’t blowing, we require fuels like natural gas that are far more reliable and affordable when compared to intermittent renewable sources.The TVA must not be weaponized to pursue a radical, Green New Deal-inspired agenda that forgoes reliable and affordable fossil fuels for its power supply in the name of climate alarmism.It is my hope that these nominees recognize the need for fossil fuels for the power sector now and into the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Click here to watch Inhofe’s questions.  "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-questions-witness-on-high-energy-prices-for-americans-and-lead-emissions-in-aviation-gasoline,"April 06, 2022Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), senior member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, questioned Michael S. Regan, Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, at a hearing entitled the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Proposed 2023 Budget.Inhofe: The Reagan administration - well first of all, let me thank you for the time you and I have spent together to try to get used to each other and what we're doing and what we're trying to accomplish. One of these issues has been ongoing for decades, at least 60 years that I know because I have been involved in aviation that long, that is removing lead from avgas. I think I speak for all members of this panel that want to see a safe and smart transition and are working toward that. However, I remain concerned that the EPA's impending announcement of the proposed endangerment finding, the transition to an unleaded fuel could be put in jeopardy before it gets started.There are over 200,000 aircraft and 1,800 different engine types in general aviation in the fleet today. A large sector of this fleet needs 100 low-lead fuel to operate. So, let me just start with one question that I think is probably pretty self-evident. That is, will you commit to fostering a safe and smart transition and working with the FAA and industry to help ensure that fuels available today remain available until a solution is fully approved and widely available? In other words - well go ahead.Regan: Senator, absolutely we'd have to do this in a very responsible way. I would like to say that to your point, this issue has been bounced around for a number of years. I think what we've decided to do is responsibly, instead of just talking behind closed doors, take on a process that actually pursues whether or not there is an endangerment finding. So that process will be very public. We're at the beginning of that process, we'll be very transparent with all of our stakeholders, so that there will be no surprises there.Inhofe: Okay, I appreciate that and we have a company in Oklahoma, and I've mentioned this to you once before, called GAMI—General Aviation Modifications Incorporated. They're leading the nation in this new field and they've been so very successful. I think that we're in a position now where we're going to be able to maintain what we have now until such time as we have the security backing behind it. One other question, Mr. Administrator, in January of 2021, on President Trump's last day in office, the price of gas was $2.38. This past month, worsened by I believe the Biden administration's policies, the national average cost-per-gallon surged to $4.33. Now think about that, $2.38 to $4.33 making it the highest average price we've ever had on record. President Biden keeps breaking records and those records are breaking Americans’ budgets.In November, you released a proposal that would impose new, burdensome methane regulations on the oil and gas sector, which could lead to devastating consequences for American jobs and the cost of energy. Democrats in Congress have proposed a methane tax that would increase the average family's electricity and heating bill by 17 percent, which is huge. We're going to keep talking about that because it has to be talked about. Mr. Administrator, would implementing a methane tax on the oil and gas industry have any effect to lower the energy cost for Americans? Is there any spin that could be put on this that somehow this is going to lower the price for fuel in America?Regan: You know, Senator, I think that the methane, what we've done is provided strong, technical assistance to Congress as Congress deliberates on what that methane tax program would look like. What our focus is is ensuring that any program designed would be complementary to the proposed methane rule that we have in place.Inhofe: Here's the problem I have with that answer: If there's some notion out there that somehow a methane tax on oil and gas is going to lower energy costs, then we don't have an argument anymore. You're not saying that surely.Regan: What I'm saying is, for instance, if it builds on the methane regulation that we're proposing, one of the things the industry agrees with us on is that we can create a framework where we are capturing a lot of lost product. Millions of dollars of lost product.Inhofe: That's fine, my time is up but I've got to get an answer. In fact, I don't think there is an answer to this. But you're saying a tax increase on methane, on oil and gas, can somehow be a lower energy cost for America. Is this what you're saying?Regan: I'm saying if properly designed, which is Congress' responsibility, that a methane fee, according to the industry, might create complications.Inhofe: You know every time I hear this ""according to the industry"" it's interesting because my phone starts ringing off the hook saying, ""I didn't say that, I didn't say that."" My time is up but I would ask this question, you can ponder —Carper: I'm going to ask my colleague just to hold, we'll have another round.Inhofe:  Well, we have an Armed Services meeting in the other round so this is the only chance I have to ask this question.Carper: Go ahead. I just ask you keep it brief.Inhofe: I will ask for the question. How would you assure every American that EPA’s proposed regulations will not contribute to the elimination of jobs in the fossil fuel sector or increase gas in other energy prices for consumers? For the record. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Carper: You bet.  "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-questions-witnesses-on-cybersecurity-threats-and-special-operations-readiness,"April 05, 2022Today,
U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), questioned witnesses at a hearing entitled the posture of
United States Special Operations Command and United States Cyber Command in
review of the Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2023 and the Future
Years Defense Program. Witnesses
included: the Honorable Christopher Maier, Assistant Secretary of Defense, United
States Special Operations Command; General Richard Clarke, Commander, United
States Special Operations Command; and General
Paul Nakasone, Commander, United States Cyber Command;
Director, National Security Agency; and
Chief, Central Security Service.Inhofe: General Nakasone,
it's clear the threats posed by our adversaries in cyberspace are growing.
China is using cyber to steal our cutting-edge technologies, and Russia is
using destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine and elsewhere to undermine the
United States and our partners. General Nakasone, in the face of these serious
cyber threats, your stance has been consistent, and has been clear, on the
benefits of the dual-hat arrangement. You know, the dual-hat arrangement, for
some reason, has become controversial. I think you and I both agree on this.
But why is it that that arrangement is in the best national security interest
of the United States? Explain that to us.Nakasone: Senator, thank
you for the question. I begin with just 2018 when I came into the job, both as
commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the Director of the National Security
Agency, and I look at the change in terms of our national security today, in
terms of what our adversaries in cyberspace are trying to do. We weren't
thinking about ransomware in 2018. We weren't necessarily thinking about
near-peers in terms of their capabilities in 2018 — very, very focused on
coming out of the 2016 elections, obviously the midterm elections, in 2018, and
then also being able to address a series of threats with counterterrorism. But
over this past four years, as you've indicated, Senator, the world has changed
considerably, and what we see is a speed, a
sophistication, and a willingness for our adversaries to operate tremendously
impactful within cyberspace. And so, what we have done is to continue to mature
the relationship between U.S. Cyber Command and NSA. How do we bring the best
of what is being done in foreign intelligence and cybersecurity to the work
that is being done on the command to be able to get after our adversaries? This
is what changed. And so one plus one, we don't want it to equal two. We want it
to be a force multiplier of five or ten that can get after our adversaries. And
we're not alone at this, Senator. Our adversaries are doing the same thing.Inhofe: Thank you, that's
a great response. China views Africa as key to its global ambitions, which is
why they built their first overseas military base in Djibouti. And people don't
realize that it's not just that military base in Djibouti — that was the first
[overseas] military base, period, in their history. And so, they want to build
another one in west coast Africa. Now, we witnessed this in Djibouti, and the
bulk of the U.S. forces in Africa are Special Operations troops who worked with
our partners to build our capabilities, collect intelligence, and push back on
China, Russia, and terrorist groups. We should deploy more of these troops to
Africa given the growing threats that I've pointed out several times in Africa.
General Clarke, what's your assessment of what the Chinese military seeks to
accomplish in Africa and what can our special operations forces do to confront
these growing threats?Clarke: Senator, I've
been to Djibouti many times and also see it as a strategic location not just
for Africa but what it gives for a platform for us to conduct counterterrorism
missions into the Middle East with its proximity to Yemen. As a key strategic
hub there, the Chinese clearly see the same thing. For U.S. Special Operations
Command, in support of AFRICOM there, it’s to ensure the violent extremist
elements there are disrupted, so they cannot cause a threat back to the United
States. As far as our ability by being there, really, allows us to get to see
and sense what the Chinese pernicious behavior is inside of Africa, with a
great interest specifically in collecting resources and minerals for the
future. And by being there, it helps us to highlight those for the partners
with whom we work.

Director of the National Security Agency, and Chief of the Central Security
Service.As Prepared for Delivery:Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for welcoming our great witnesses. As I've said many times, we face a more dangerous and complex set of threats than at any time during my life.Just last week, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said ""this is probably the most dangerous security environment"" in her 25 years. Well, it's the same for me, except it's more than 25 years.The Chinese Communist Party announced a 7.1 percent defense budget increase this year, continuing two decades of historic military modernization. Every day they give us more evidence that their goals and interests are fundamentally opposed to ours. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended European security. North Korea is developing more capable ICBMs. Iran has accelerated its aggression, and terrorist groups are reconstituting in Africa and Afghanistan.For our witnesses today, you face challenges across each of these threats. In addition to growing their conventional and military capabilities, our adversaries are expanding their use of irregular warfare and cyber to threaten the United States and our partners.I’m still working through the recently released 2022 National Defense Strategy. I've seen extensive descriptions of the gray zone and expansion and cyber threat posed by each of our adversaries, but I haven't seen much in this budget so far about responding to those threats.General Clarke, you have the daunting challenge of reorienting SOCOM for a high-end fight, even as you'll be stretched thin and shouldering the burden of the fight against terrorism. Like our Afghanistan withdrawal, I'm certain we are taking too much risk there. Mitigating the risk will largely fall on you and your troops.General Nakasone, the pace of Chinese advance in cyber is pretty breathtaking and our other adversaries are also moving fast. We want to make sure that we have the resources and authorities we need to maintain or regain your advantage. I definitely want us to do more in the cyber cooperation with our allies and partners, so we'll have to look at funding for that this year also.I look to our witnesses to describe how the men and women they lead are postured to deal with this array of threats and what this committee can do to ensure they have the tools necessary to be successful. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you."

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sasc-republicans-respond-to-president-bidens-inadequate-defense-budget,"April 04, 2022Republican
members of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) have made it clear — President
Biden’s fiscal year 2023 defense budget is inadequate. Reminder:
Every Republican member of the SASC joined U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking members of the Senate and House Armed
Services Committees, urging President Biden to increase the defense budget by 5 percent above
inflation to meet growing threats to U.S. national security. President Biden’s defense budget provides just 1.5 percent real growth using an inflation estimate Sen.
Inhofe described as “almost certainly low.”Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.):
“President Biden’s defense budget reflects the world he wishes for — but not
the world as it is. You simply can’t look at the world around us now and think
this budget is adequate to confront all the threats we face, let alone to
accelerate our attempts to maintain or restore deterrence and secure U.S.
interests for our children and grandchildren. Most problematic is that this
budget neglects to sufficiently account for historic inflation. I am
particularly concerned about service members losing buying power, just like all
American families… Real growth — 5 percent above inflation — is what we need if we are to meet this
moment. We must do more to change the military balance of power in the next
five years.”Sen. Roger Wicker
(R-Miss.):
“…Our top military brass from all branches are wisely asking for more. More
ships, more planes, more weapons, more satellites, and more training. But
President Biden is instead providing them less to complete their mission. This
is strategically unsound and could increase the risk of future conflicts and
threats to our country. This moment demands decisiveness and strength through a
sustained increase in defense spending. We will ensure that America meets that
moment, even if the Commander-in-Chief has other priorities.”Sen. Deb Fischer
(R-Neb.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces: “For the second year in a row, the
President has proposed a budget that dramatically increases spending on
domestic initiatives, while defense spending fails to even keep pace with
inflation. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine proves our
adversaries are increasingly willing to use force to pursue their hegemonic
ambitions. Meanwhile, China’s expanding military capabilities –
highlighted by its nuclear breakout – demonstrates threats to our interests are
growing at a rapid pace. At a time of unprecedented geopolitical turmoil, the
need for real growth in the defense budget is clear.”Sen.
Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and
Capabilities:
""As America's enemies are on the march and the world has become a much
more dangerous place under his watch, President Biden now wants to flatten our
defense budget. Biden's budget moves us in the wrong direction, reflecting his
doctrine of appeasement that's led to a disaster in Afghanistan and an
emboldened Putin in Russia. We should be bolstering our military right now to
protect America and show our leadership in the world, and his proposal falls
well short.""Sen.
Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and
Management Support: “As I’ve said many times before, we are in a new era of
authoritarian aggression. The President needs to go back to the drawing board
and craft a defense budget that leaves no question as to whether American men
and women in uniform are well-trained, equipped and ready to respond to a
threat wherever it emerges. If he does not, he can expect yet another
broadly-bipartisan rebuke from Congress as we remedy the administration’s
dangerous funding shortfall.”Sen.
Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower:
“President Biden needs to put a serious budget proposal forward to confront the
real threats we face. Russia is just one reason why defense spending needs to
be higher. China and other nations are watching the seriousness and resolve of
freedom-loving nations.”Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.): “As Russia wages
war on Ukraine and threatens the West, North Korea is launching ballistic
missiles and Communist China plans an invasion against Taiwan, President Biden
is choosing weakness over strength. At a time when the United States should be
bolstering our defense spending, Joe Biden’s latest pathetic spending request
does not keep up with the inflation crisis he has caused — effectively cutting
defense spending and leaving our country in a vulnerable position. Biden's
raging inflation crisis is hurting America in every way possible and with
threats around the world growing every day, we cannot afford more weakness.”Sen.
Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): “President Biden’s budget
will force cuts to key nuclear capabilities, at a time when Russia is
threatening nuclear war. Russia, China, North Korea and Iran only understand
peace through strength. We must provide our military the resources they need to
defend and protect our freedom.”Sen.
Josh Hawley (R-Mo.): “President
Biden’s defense budget fails to provide America’s military with the resources
needed to deter an imperial China no less deal with other challenges, many of
them created by this Administration’s incompetence. Now is the time to invest
in our defenses so we can prevent war and keep Americans safe.”




















Sen.
Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.): “President Biden’s budget ignores
reality and shortchanges our men and women in uniform. The president’s budget
proposal, accounting for inflation, cuts our defense budget at a time when real
growth is needed. We cannot ask our military to choose between maintenance and
modernization or investment and deterrence. But that’s exactly what the
president’s budget proposal does.”"

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) released the following statement after receiving the Family Research Council’s “True Blue” Award, an annual recognition for Members of Congress with a perfect voting record on faith, family values and religious freedoms.“My faith and family matter most to me and I am honored to receive the ‘True Blue’ Award from the Family Research Council for voting to support family values, life and religious liberty,” Inhofe said.  “Throughout my time in Congress, it has been a priority of mine to give voice to the voiceless. Even though the Biden Administration is the most pro-abortion administration that this country has ever seen, I will continue the fight to protect the innocent lives of unborn children. Most recently, Republicans in the House and Senate fought hard to ensure that federal tax dollars can't go toward abortion by protecting the Hyde Amendment in the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2022. We have also introduced numerous bills that seek to roll back expansive and radical pro-abortion policies announced by the Biden Administration. And we're not done. Among the many pro-life bills I am supporting, I introduced a bill to prohibit abortion based on a Down syndrome diagnosis.“I am also proud of our joint efforts to preserve our religious liberty, one of our most precious and foundational freedoms. During my time in the Senate, I will continue fighting against the Biden administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates and for the rights of Americans to make health care decisions that align with their religious convictions. Additionally, I was proud to lead the removal of a provision in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act that would have forced our daughters and granddaughters to register for the draft and will continue to fight against this push moving forward. While these efforts against our family values will continue, I believe that America’s best days lie ahead.”Family Research Council Action President Tony Perkins made the following comment:“We thank Sen. Inhofe for defending faith, family, and freedom. He has voted to reject the radical gender ideology that would overhaul our federal civil rights framework to mandate special privileges for sexual orientation and gender identity. He voted to protect women, the military, homeless shelters, and public restrooms from this harmful ideology. He has voted to protect the sanctity of human life for unborn babies, end taxpayer funding of abortion, and prevent additional taxpayer funding of abortion both domestically and overseas. He also voted to expand protections for conscience rights, reject the increasing acceptance of marijuana use, and reject pro-abortion, anti-family, judicial and executive appointments.“Oklahomans should be encouraged to know that they have a champion like Sen. Inhofe in Congress who, despite relentless attacks from the Left and the media, is standing strong for faith, family, and freedom,” concluded Perkins.Read more below about Inhofe’s most recent work for faith, family values and religious freedom:On January 21, 2022, the Inhofe published an op-ed entitled “Every Life Has Value, No Matter How Small.”On April 20, 2021, Inhofe introduced an amendment to a bill to address hate crimes against the unborn committed during the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the case Fulton v. Philadelphia to allow faith-based child welfare providers to operate in accordance with their religious beliefs as they seek to place children into loving homes. The Supreme Court heard this case in November 2020. In the lead up to oral arguments, Senator Inhofe signed onto multiple amicus briefs and is a cosponsor of the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, which protects faith-based child welfare providers from being discriminated against."

I look forward to keeping the tradition alive this year and continuing to work alongside them to fight for Oklahoma’s cattle industry.”“Senator Inhofe is a champion and friend of Oklahoma beef cattle ranchers on so many issues,” said Michael Kelsey, Executive Vice President of the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association. “While chairing the Environment and Public Works Committee, he led the efforts to push back on the overreaching WOTUS rule of the Obama Administration. He successfully included $4 million in the most recent federal appropriations bill for Oklahoma’s Bureau of Narcotics to help them catch and shutdown illegal marijuana grow operations. There are many other issues like trade, military funding, tax policy and more in which Senator Inhofe provides a sound, common sense approach that directly and indirectly benefits Oklahoma cattle ranchers. OCA is proud to call him a friend and our Senator!” Photos from the meeting are available for download here."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) made the following statements after meeting with Judge Jackson, who has been nominated to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States:  “While I enjoyed meeting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and think she is a fine and decent person, I have sincere reservations with her nomination to serve a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land,” Inhofe said. “I went into this meeting with an open mind, but after our meeting, and in consideration of her record and insufficient responses to serious questions posed to her by my fellow senators, I believe she would serve as a rubber-stamp for liberal activists’ agenda which is inconsistent with our laws and the interests of the people of Oklahoma and across the nation. President Biden made clear that he would nominate someone who would vigorously defend the far-left’s radical, unconstitutional agenda and he has fulfilled that commitment. While I have respect for Judge Jackson as a person, I cannot and will not vote to confirm Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court.”“I’ve been clear about my position on Judge Jackson’s judicial philosophy since I opposed her nomination to the DC Circuit Court last year,” said Lankford. “A Supreme Court nomination is a life-time appointment. We should make sure any Justice is committed to limited government, the original interpretation of the Constitution, and a clear dedication to impartial justice. After meeting with Judge Jackson, I cannot state that I see that commitment. I have major concerns about past judicial activism, even cases where Judge Jackson has ignored the clear and explicit law written by Congress. I will oppose her confirmation next week.” Photos and b-roll from the meeting can be found here."

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today questioned witnesses at a SASC hearing to receive
testimony on the posture of United States European Command and United States
Transportation Command. Witnesses
included: General Tod Wolters, Commander, United States European Command/ North
Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and General
Jacqueline Van Ovost, Commander, United States Transportation Command.
Inhofe: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The recent emergency supplemental
provided an additional $3 billion to support Ukraine, backfill our allies and
invest in United States stocks dedicated to this effort. General Wolters, you’ve indicated that EUCOM needs
significant increases to sustain efforts to deter Russia, including through the
European Deterrence Initiative that the Biden Administration cut last year. OK. General Wolters, credible
deterrence only works when you have a strong national defense backing up our
words. President Biden’s warnings to Putin clearly failed to stop his invasion.
Russia’s actions are a wake-up call for this administration and for Europe that
Russia remains a significant threat. As your opening statement attests, this
crisis has prov[en] how much of a game changer the European Deterrence
Initiative (EDI) has been since it enabled the military to stand up the Army
Preposition Stock sites that our troops have now fallen in on. Can you expand
upon how critical those sites have been to enable our troops to surge in Europe
over the past few weeks? Wolters: Sen. Inhofe, to
take Armored Brigade Combat Team and launch it from the continental United
States and put it on European turf and have the tanks that comprise that
Brigade Combat Team to shoot, move and communicate and fire on range in one
week is an amazing accomplishment and that was facilitated by those Army
Preposition Stocks, and it was practiced in previous exercises, which are very
expensive and part of the EDI fund. So I would just say that when we've
demonstrated to the European community and to the NATO community and to the
world how well we can shoot, move and communicate and transition a large force
from CONUS to Europe at that pace is something that demonstrates the great
value of EDI.Inhofe: I think that's
right, and are there any force elements included in the new 20,000 forces that
you have in Europe now that would be extremely useful in your deterrence
efforts in the long run, in the future?Wolters: There are,
Senator, and most of them have to do with critical enablers that you're very
familiar with, and we've been able to benefit from their existence as they've
arrived in Europe.Inhofe: General Van
Ovost, strategic lift refers to the ability to transport personnel, equipment
and stores from the continental United States to operational theaters around
the world. General Van Ovost, as we discussed in my office, would you further
describe the current readiness of the sealift fleet?Van
Ovost:
Thanks, Senator. Look, the sealift fleet is critical to our execution of our
plans. They move 90 percent of the cargo in wartime, and today as we stand,
about 70 percent of our roll-on/roll-off capacity is going to exceed its
service life in 10 years. Our ability to keep those sealift ships in readiness
status is costing more and more every year. So it's been imperative that we
embark upon the sealift recapitalization program for which I'm grateful for the
appropriation and the authorization, which will get us up to four used ships
and then we are going to work with the Navy to get beyond four, up to nine, as
they submit their sealift build plan and hopefully that that will satisfy the
requirements so we can continue to purchase sealifts when the favorable
conditions are occurring right now in the market.Inhofe: That’s good, and
I think they will. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Prepared for Delivery
Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. General Wolters and General Van Ovost, thank you both for
your distinguished service to our country. As I’ve said many times, this
committee’s top priority has been ensuring the effective implementation of the
2018 National Defense Strategy. It told us China is our pacing threat, and that
we need much more effort from our military to take on that threat. The threats have only gotten worse since then. Yesterday, the
administration sent us the classified 2022 National Defense Strategy. I hope
the unclassified version is public soon. I understand this strategy was late in part because the Biden administration
revisited what were likely rosy assumptions about Russia. It’s a good reminder
that we must deal with the world as it exists today, not the world we might
wish for. Our plan to deal with that world must rest on a strong foundation of
military power. And it must focus on actions, not words, for credible
deterrence.Four months ago, Secretary Blinken justified not sanctioning Russia by
saying “The President believes that sanctions are intended to deter.” Last
week, the president himself said that “sanctions never deter.” Nothing about
this makes sense.Deterrence failed in Ukraine. We must ensure it does not fail anywhere
else. The costs of war are far greater than the costs of preventing war. We must ensure that our combatant commands have what they need to
credibly deter our adversaries and address the challenge of strategic
competition. These threats highlight the need for real growth in the defense budget
and a sense of urgency and willingness to take risk both at the Pentagon and
here in Congress. We just received the President’s FY23 budget and it does not request the
real growth we need. We’ll do our due diligence and our constitutional duty, as
we did last year.General Wolters, I look forward to hearing your assessment of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and how the U.S. and our NATO Allies will bolster European
defenses while continuing to support Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. I’m troubled by lackluster funding for the European Deterrence Initiative
in recent years and concerned about the ability of our industrial base to
support re-arming ourselves, our NATO allies, and the Ukrainians.General Van Ovost, I would like to know if you have the resources you
need to support not only General Wolters in Europe but also our INDOPACOM
commander.Additionally, I look forward to hearing your view of our current sealift
readiness and how that impacts your ability to support your combatant command
counterparts. 
Thank you both again for testifying today. Senator Reed."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-press-biden-administration-to-clarify-effects-of-inflation-on-pentagon-budget,"March 29, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), ranking members
of the Senate and House Armed Services Committee, today announced that they
have requested information on the effects of inflation on the Department of Defense
budget from Pentagon leadership and the military services.“For
the second year in a row, President Biden has submitted to Congress an
inadequate defense budget that does not provide the real growth we need to
counter China. As Congress considers this request, it’s clear we need to dig in
further on how inflation is affecting the Department of Defense’s buying power
now and into the future,” Inhofe and Rogers said in a statement.In
letters sent
to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley and the secretary and chief of each service, Inhofe
and Rogers note that current inflation is “effectively a 5 to 8 percent cut to the
Department’s buying power, which could amount to between $20-$30 billion in
unfunded costs in fiscal year 2022 alone, not to mention lost buying power in
fiscal year 2021 and potential lost buying power in fiscal year 2023.” Yet the fiscal
year 2023 budget request, released yesterday, only accounts for inflation in
the 2.3 to 2.6 percent range.“It’s
ignorant to believe these historically high inflation rates aren’t hurting our
service members just like they are every other American family,” Inhofe and Rogers
said in a statement. “Beyond that, inflation is also driving up key military
needs like fuel, as well as the cost of labor and supplies — but this budget
doesn’t appear to address that reality. We need to understand what assumptions
the Department is operating under, how they arrived at their inflation
estimate, and how Congress can help meet the needs of our military as we
develop our own recommendations for the 2023 fiscal year.”Inhofe
and Rogers requested explanations about how the administration estimates
inflation, how inflation has affected key defense activities and funding pots,
and how inflation is affecting the defense industrial base, as well as how
Congress can help mitigate the harmful effects of the current inflation spike —
among other information. The members asked for responses by April 15.Last
week, Inhofe and Rogers led 38 other Republican members of the Senate and House
Armed Services Committee sent President Biden a letter urging him to prioritize 5 percent
growth above inflation for the fiscal year 2023 defense budget.The
full letter can be read here
and below:We write you to request
information from the Department of Defense (DOD) regarding the observed and
anticipated effects on inflation on the Department’s budget, both in the recent
past and the near future. The fiscal year 2021
president’s budget assumed a total DOD inflation rate of 2.1 percent for budget
authority in fiscal year 2021, and the 2022 president’s budget assumed an
inflation rate of 2.3 percent for budget authority in fiscal year 2022, per DOD
Green Book Table 5.1. However, observed inflationary effects by any
measure—consumer price index (CPI), personal consumption expenditures (PCE),
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) price index—were significantly higher. According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, the annualized CPI-U rate for the 12-month period ending
February 2022 was 7.9 percent, the highest rate in 40 years — which directly
damages the purchasing power of every DOD servicemember and civilian. According
to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP price index rates have been not that
far behind, particularly in the latter half of fiscal year 2021 and the first
half of fiscal year 2022. Beyond stressing U.S. personnel, high inflation is
also affecting U.S. operations, training, research and development, and
procurement. As Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Mike McCord said, “The
big concern that we’ve had, that I’ve had, is catching up…The biggest near-term
concern that we have really is the inflation that did occur in ’21 that was
higher than projected, the inflation that occurred in ’22 that was higher than
projected.” Put simply, the inflation
we are experiencing is effectively a 5 to 8 percent cut to the Department’s
buying power, which could amount to between $20-$30 billion in unfunded costs
in fiscal year 2022 alone, not to mention lost buying power in fiscal year 2021
and potential lost buying power in fiscal year 2023.    Had a Future Years
Defense Program (FYDP) been submitted with the fiscal year 2022 request, as
required by law, we understand it would have underestimated inflation at
roughly 2 percent in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2026. Thus, the current
5 to 8 percent inflation spike will compound with the likely higher inflation
in these future years making the FYDP and the plans it supports even further
from being fully funded and even more unrealistic as compared to the current
fiscal year.  We know that inflationary
effects will differ by activity, and that the economic indices commonly used to
measure inflation, such as CPI-U or GDP Price Index, will not translate
perfectly to the composition of the DOD budget. Yet many of the core
components—fuel, cost of labor, cost of supplies—are not fundamentally
different from the non-defense economy. In fact, we understand that historical
inflation in many DOD appropriations accounts has routinely outpaced non-Defense
inflation benchmarks.  The bipartisan 2018
National Defense Strategy Commission called for 3 to 5 percent annual real
growth in the DOD budget. The unprecedented scale, scope, and rapidity of
Chinese military modernization, in concert with a simultaneous worsening of all
other stated national security threats, supports nothing less. Yet the
inflationary effects of the past year has made it even more difficult to measure “real” growth.
We are concerned that the Pentagon may actually be
losing buying power, even as Congress has taken bipartisan action to implement
real growth in the defense budget.    Based on these and
other considerations, we are seeking clarity on DOD observations and planning
related to inflation in the recent past and the near future, and therefore
submit questions as specified in Enclosure A for the Department of
Defense. Please submit the requested information to the Committee on a rolling
basis when ready, but no later than April 15, 2022. Responses may be
supplemented via classified communication where necessary. Thank
you in advance for your responsiveness. Sincerely,Enclosure A 1.      What are the inflation baselines from which DOD is

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-stresses-importance-of-improving-lakes-waterways-and-flood-control-systems-in-oklahoma,"January 14, 2022This week, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), senior member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, questioned witnesses at a hearing on the Water Resource Development Act Oversight: USACE Implementation of Water Infrastructure Projects, Programs and Priorities. Witnesses included: the Honorable Michael Connor, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.Inhofe: First, let me thank Senator Capito for allowing me to take place in this order. I have had occasion to spend some time with both the gentlemen, Spellmon and Michael Connor, and we are in agreement about so many different things; it’s so important for my state of Oklahoma. I have to share with the rest of the people here about how serious of a flood that we had in 2019. The only ammunition we had at that time was the Tulsa Levee and West Tulsa Levee system. Now, this actually was at a time, it was put together, it was actually when I was four years old. It far exceeded its service life. So, we had the levee system. And when our flood came, in 2019, more people – professionals – believed that we were going to be breaking the levee and really having a disastrous situation. It did perform, and I can remember actually being personally down there when the water was coming through, and nobody thought that it was going to be able to hold. We put in emergency things right after that, and now, we are in a situation that certainly Secretary Connor is familiar with as something that is serious, and I know you are aware of the seriousness of this thing. So, we have this levee system, and we are hoping and doing everything we can to ensure that we are going to be able to hold this out in the event of another one. It was a close call, a very close call.The other thing I wanted to make sure I had time to mention is our MKARNS. You know people don’t realize that we are navigable in Oklahoma. We are the most inland navigable system in the country, and it’s something that people don’t realize. We have more miles of fresh-water shoreline than any other of the 50 states. Now, there’s a reason for that. Because ours are all man-made lakes. Man-made lakes give you a lot of shoreline because they have a dam down and they go across a lot of it. People are not aware, but that is something serious. The other thing that is of concern is that we are navigable in terms of having the capability to take care of the things we need. For example, our navigation way coming to the state of Oklahoma is 98 percent 12-foot channel. That means that we have two percent that’s not a 12-foot channel; it’s a 9-foot channel. That’s one of the things that’s been on our list for a long period of time. It’s been authorized, and I just want to make sure that I take this opportunity, Mr. Connor, reminding you of what you and I have talked about before and the seriousness of what we are facing now with these two projects. One being, of course, the levee system; that it would hold up for not another hundred years, but start working immediately with top priority. I believe that it has that along with the deepening of the MKARNS.Would you share your thoughts on those two projects?Connor: Senator Inhofe, thank you for the conversations regarding these projects and the ongoing dialogue. I think they represent two very high priority aspects of the overall Army Corps of Engineers program. That is, obviously, in respect to the levees, our need to maintain, rehabilitate and do any new construction with an eye towards resilience; particularly given the 2019 flooding situations. We know what extreme events can bring, and so that brings a focus to move forward with your project in west Tulsa. The inland waterways issue with the 12-foot navigation channel, I think I remember during my confirmation process, I mentioned that I had done some background in preparation for talking with you. I saw the Port of Tulsa, and I was really was taken aback at the Port of Tulsa. My first trip out of the box here was on the Mississippi River, Illinois River, seeing the dam and locks system and talking with the folks involved in our navigable inland waterways and moving commerce on that system and the need for reliability, the benefits that exist from efficient delivery, arguably, and our need to maintain and improve that system so that it continues to be an important part of our commerce system. Part and parcel, that’s one of our priorities is shoring up the supply chain, and so from that standpoint, I am with you in the importance of those projects, sir.Inhofe: And I appreciate that very much. The last thing I would mention is on our lakes development. I never knew why it was this way, but it always seems that they were concerned with navigation and flood control but not recreation. We have so many great opportunities for recreation, and that is something that we are looking at for the first time. I actually, I was chairman, I guess, of this committee during the ’07 WRDA legislation. We made some advancement at that time and again in 2020, but I would like to say that we have all changed in our priorities on the lake system that we have. We recognize that recreation is a very important opportunity for us in our state of Oklahoma. I would hope that you would agree that that is an area that we need to concentrate on for everyone’s benefit.Connor: Absolutely, Senator. I have a long history at the Interior Department. I was glad to hear when I came over in this position that we have more campgrounds in the Army Corps of Engineers program than the National Parks Service. I understand the importance of that, particularly during the pandemic. We’ve seen how people have gone to recreate in federal facilities outdoors. It’s an important part of the portfolio because it serves those communities in which we exist. Inhofe: Well, I appreciate that and thank you, Senator Capito.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-blasts-senate-democrats-for-failing-to-stand-up-to-russia-with-nord-stream-2-sanctions,"January 13, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement after a
bill imposing critical sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project failed
to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to advance: “The
Senate had another chance to get it right on Nord Stream 2, but Democrats let
this opportunity to stand up to Putin pass us by. For
years, there has been wide bipartisan support to stop this pipeline from
becoming another tool in Putin’s arsenal to further bully his neighbors. This
bill would have imposed the sanctions that President Biden left on the table
last year, which are the only ones capable of stopping the pipeline from
becoming operational. Most importantly, it would have imposed those sanctions
within days—instead of waiting until after Russia further invades Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration is lobbying for separate legislation to
provide political cover to Democrats to justify voting against their own
records on this issue. This other legislation would give Putin yet another pass
on this pipeline. It’s not enough.“As
Putin weaponizes energy across Europe and Russia continues to surround Ukraine
with an invasion force, we have two choices. We can affirm the Biden
administration’s handwringing and appeasement or we can take real action to hit
Putin where it hurts.







“I
am disappointed, but not surprised that Senate Democrats fell in line with the
administration’s do-nothing approach. I’m going to continue pushing for
sanctions and other actions that will push back on Putin’s bullying of our NATO
allies and partners and show adversaries around the globe that the United
States means what we say.”

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-joins-cole-to-introduce-bipartisan-medical-student-education-authorization-act,"January 13, 2022Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) joined Rep. Tom Cole (OK-04) along with Reps. Markwayne Mullin (OK-02) and Dina Titus (NV-01) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) to introduce the bipartisan, bicameral Medical Student Education Authorization Act, to authorize the Medical Student Education (MSE) Program for five years. The MSE Program provides grants to public institutions of higher education to expand or support graduate education for physicians in states with the most severe primary care provider shortages. First created in fiscal year 2019 by Rep. Cole and Sen. Inhofe, the MSE Program is currently subject to annual authorizations, which results in significant uncertainty over funding and long-term planning for funded institutions.“Doctors play a critical role in the health and well-being of Oklahomans and individuals across the nation—as evidenced ten-fold by this pandemic,” said Inhofe. “I have always been an advocate for retaining the talent of the next generation of medical students in our state, which is why I am pleased to introduce the Medical Student Education Authorization Act alongside Rep. Cole. This bill will support medical student training in Tribal, rural and medically underserved communities, helping guarantee sufficient doctors in these areas for years to come and ensuring all Oklahomans can continue to have access to high quality health care.”“When training is offered in medically underserved communities, physicians are much more likely to choose to practice there later in their careers, which directly benefits those living in those areas,” said Cole. “Authorization of the Medical Student Education Program for five years would allow community-based experiential training in tribal, rural and medically underserved communities to continue with long-term certainty. I am proud to join my colleagues across the aisle and across the Capitol in introducing commonsense legislation that is vital to training the next generation of providers and mitigating shortages in vulnerable areas.”“Often times, people in my district have to travel long distances to see their primary care provider at small, rural hospitals or IHS and Tribally-run facilities,” said Mullin. “Between the pandemic and shortages in our workforce, it’s getting harder for these facilities to recruit new physicians. The reauthorization of this program will help states suffering from primary care shortages and support an increase in physicians who are able to offer culturally competent care. Americans who live in rural and underserved communities deserve access to quality health care and that’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bill.”“I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan bill with my colleagues from Oklahoma, Mr. Tom Cole and Mr. Markwayne Mullin. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the University of Nevada, Reno medical schools provide needed care to our communities and these grants will make vital funding available to help them recruit and support physician education,” said Titus. “At a time when health care is paramount, training and retaining doctors in-state will help ensure Nevadans have access to high-quality care in the years ahead.”“Communities across Nevada and our country are in dire need of more health care professionals, and Congress must act to fill these gaps and ensure access to quality medical care,” said Rosen. “This bipartisan legislation would authorize the Medical Student Education program for another five years, and address the physician shortage for states like Nevada that have significant shortages by supporting the next generation of medical professionals.”Upon introduction, the legislation received strong support from relevant individuals and organizations.“The AHA commends Representatives Cole, Mullin and Titus and Senators Inhofe and Rosen for introducing this important bipartisan legislation to help increase the number of physicians across the country, especially in areas with the most severe provider shortages,” said Stacey Hughes, AHA Executive Vice President. “Having a talented, qualified, engaged and diverse workforce is at the heart of America’s health care system but many physicians and other health care professionals are exhausted from two years of being on the front lines battling COVID-19. We look forward to working with Congress to pass this critical legislation that will continue to help build the physician workforce pipeline, especially in medically underserved communities.”“There is an urgent need for more physicians to serve in rural America to help address patient access issues and improve health care outcomes. We commend Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) as well as Reps. Tom Cole (R-OK), Dina Titus (D-NV) and Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) for sponsoring the bipartisan Medical Student Education Authorization Act and look forward to supporting it as it moves through the legislative process,” said American Medical Association President Gerald E. Harmon, M.D. “Rural communities can have high proportions of patients from historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups, with few doctors from those backgrounds to treat them. The AMA is dedicated to addressing the root causes of health inequities for the rural patient population, and this bill would help remove challenges to health equity in tribal, rural, and medically underserved communities.”“National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Cole, Titus, and Mullin and Senators Inhofe and Rosen for introducing the Medical Student Education Authorization Act. Since the Medical Student Education (MSE) Program was first authorized in 2019, it has made a profound impact on training physicians in rural communities. We know that physician’s training experiences in rural communities result in higher practices rates is rural areas. Passing a five year authorization of the MSE Program, as this legislation does, will be helpful for stabilizing the depleting workforce in rural communities. As rural communities rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening the workforce is a top priority for NRHA. Programs like the MSE Program are critical to ensuring rural communities have the workforce they need to provide services for their residents,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.“This legislation would benefit Tribal health programs by increasing the number of Indian health providers and providing training to better serve American Indian and Alaska Native patients.  This bill provides grants to higher education institutions in states with severe health care provider shortages.  The emphasis on partnerships between these institutions and Tribal nations, integrating behavioral health into primary care, and addressing health equities will complement Tribal nations’ efforts to enhance their health care delivery systems.  We call upon Congress to pass this legislation and get it signed into law this year,” said Chairman of the National Indian Health Board, William Smith.“Oklahoma’s physician residency programs are of the utmost importance right now, especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the healthcare workforce. The Medical School Education Authorization Act will help solve the persistent primary care provider shortages in Oklahoma,” said Mary Clarke, MD OSMA President.“Because the vast majority of Oklahoma counties face a shortage of primary care physicians, the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine places a major emphasis on enhancing the primary care experience for our medical students. Through courses in our curriculum and community partnerships across the state, our students learn about and are exposed to the needs of people who live in tribal, rural and medically underserved areas. In addition, our success in recruiting and retaining students from across Oklahoma including underrepresented areas is helping to secure a bright future. We want to thank Congressman Cole, Congresswoman Titus, Congressman Mullin, Senator Inhofe and Senator Rosen for their leadership on helping us continue to grow these educational opportunities. In doing so, we anticipate an increase in primary care physicians practicing throughout the state, ultimately helping to improve the health and quality of life for all Oklahomans,"" said John Zubialde, M.D., Executive Dean, OU College of Medicine.“Our mission at the OSU Center for Health Sciences is focused on providing health care for rural and underserved communities throughout Oklahoma. Expanding our footprint in partnership with the Cherokee Nation to establish the first tribally affiliated medical school in the nation has been instrumental in fulfilling that mission. Support such as the MSE program makes this mission come to life, and ultimately will positively impact the health outcomes for everyday Oklahomans,” said Dr. Johnny Stephens, President, OSU Center for Health Sciences.“The MSE program has been instrumental in our work to expand medical education and clinical training opportunities into rural and tribal communities in Oklahoma.  The new Cherokee Nation campus of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine has allowed for the expansion of OSU’s medical school class size by 50 students per year and created programs that support our recruiting from rural and tribal communities, educating future physicians on tribal land, and the expansion of clinical educational opportunities in these same communities,” said Dr. Natasha Bray, Interim Dean, OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine at the Cherokee Nation.""Many thanks to Congresswoman Titus for her efforts to secure stable funding for the next five years for the Medical Student Education Program. This type of forward thinking will help us train more medical students in the underserved communities of Southern Nevada, including our vast tribal lands. This will also help with recruiting a diverse group of medical students who will help care for our varied urban community,” said Marc J. Kahn, Dean of Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine at UNLV. ""Nevada desperately needs primary care physicians. We rank 48th nationally and 67% of the state’s population reside in a primary care health professional shortage area. This grant program, if expanded, will allow UNR Med to use proven strategies to recruit and retain Nevada medical students to serve the rural and underserved communities in our state,” said Melissa Piasecki, M.D., Acting Dean- UNR Med, Chief Academic Officer- Renown Health.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-urge-biden-administration-to-continue-critical-nuclear-national-defense-programs,"January 13, 2022U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers
(R-Ala.), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, today released
the following statement following reports that the Biden administration is
debating cutting critical nuclear weapons programs approved under the last
administration and again in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act:  “Reports
that the Biden administration is considering abandoning long-overdue and
much-needed improvements to our nation’s nuclear deterrent – when China is
massively expanding its nuclear arsenal, North Korea is flagrantly violating UN
sanctions on its missile program, and Russia is poised to launch the largest
invasion in Europe since World War II – are profoundly concerning, and if true,
would only invite further aggression.“Over
the past year, our committees heard from the nation’s leading defense and
nuclear experts, including from within the current administration. Their stark
warnings on the threats we face were sobering — and their clear advice, from
Secretary Austin on down, was to continue along the path of modernization.
Congress heeded these warnings, and an overwhelming bipartisan majority
supported continuing all aspects of the Department of Defense’s and the
National Nuclear Security Administration’s plan to modernize the U.S. nuclear
deterrent in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which the
President signed into law just two weeks ago. When reports surfaced that the
Biden administration was considering departing from long-standing nuclear policies
that have deterred major wars and the use of nuclear weapons for over seventy
years, U.S. allies across the globe joined a bipartisan chorus in Congress to
urge the administration to take a wiser, more measured path.





“It’s
almost incomprehensible that even now, in spite of mountains of evidence to the
contrary, bipartisan congressional, allied and expert opposition, and a
security environment that seems to get worse by the day, the Biden
administration continues to look for opportunities to weaken the ultimate
guarantee of our nation’s and our allies’ security. Again, we strongly urge the
administration to listen to the combined voices of Congress, U.S. allies, and
our nation’s foremost defense experts and continue the current nuclear
modernization programs and policies.”

Senate Armed Services Committee, today questioned nominees for top Pentagon
policy positions at a committee hearing about the United States’ nuclear
declaratory policy, resources to support national security objectives in
Africa and the crisis at the southwest border. Nominees included: Celeste Wallender to be Assistant
Secretary of Defense for International Affairs, Melissa Dalton to be Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, and John
Plumb to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy.Inhofe:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a
question for each one of the witnesses, and so I'm going to ask for real fast
responses and try to get to all three of them. In fact, we will get three of
them. Dr. Plumb, five of my colleagues and I recently sent a letter to senior
administration officials expressing concern that President Biden might pursue
changes to a long-standing U.S. nuclear declaratory policy, despite
increasingly aggressive moves by China and Russia and clear objections that
we've had from our allies. Deputy Secretary Hicks agreed with our conclusion at
her confirmation hearing, stating, “I don't believe that a no-first-use policy
is in the best interest of the United States.” Do you agree?Plumb:
Senator, thank you. I agree with Deputy
Secretary Hicks. I personally do not believe no first use is a good idea at
this time, and I would say taking the allies into consideration is absolutely
essential. My caveat here, of course, is declaratory policy is the purview of
the President.Inhofe:
Well, yeah because I think it was very
specific when she said, “I don't believe a no-first-use policy is in the best
interest of the United States.” Thank you very much.Dr.
Wallander, China is aggressively modernizing its military and expanding its
presence around the world and particularly true in Africa. I can remember it wasn't
too long ago, we didn't even have an AFRICOM, and the continent was divided
into three different commands. That was not workable. We did correct that, and
so we've gotten a lot more attention. However, China is becoming a lot more
aggressive in Djibouti and other areas there. General Townsend called it the
number-one global power competition concern. This has been a concern of mine
for a long period of time, even at the time that we started its own dedicated
command, but nonetheless, the problem is still there. And we don't — AFRICOM
does not have the capabilities and the resources to actually address this, and
I think that is a problem. Do you agree that it's a problem that we lack
resources and taking care of the needs that we have in our allies in that
continent?Wallander:
Senator, thank you for your focus on the
issue of Chinese and Russian strategic competition. active in Africa. I share
your concern. I, if confirmed, look forward to building on the existing defense
and security partnerships we have with countries in Africa, and I believe it and agree with you that we need to look at the resources, especially as China has
pivoted towards seeking military access and presence.Inhofe:
All the way down through — and that’s true.
I may come back if I have a minute, but regardless, I look forward to visiting
with you with regularity on this subject. Ms. Dalton, the year 2021 witnessed
the surge in illegal southwest border crossings, and the Border Patrol recorded
174,000 encounters with illegal immigrants in November — it was a record for
that month. President Biden and his spokesperson have both referred to this as
a crisis, and I believe that. I agree that it is a crisis. I'd like to ask if
you agree that is a crisis that we're facing right now on our Southwest border.Dalton:
Senator, thank you for highlighting this
challenge, and I agree with you that it is a serious situation on the southwest
border. And if confirmed, I would look forward to working as part of an
interagency effort, both in the homeland context, working closely with the
Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to address the
challenge, and then also working very closely with our Central and South
American partners upstream to address some of the drivers of migration, I
think.Inhofe:
That’s fine. So you agree it's a crisis.Dalton:
Yes, sir.Inhofe:
Thank you.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-speaks-on-senate-in-defense-of-filibuster-urges-democrats-to-drop-pursuit-of-radical-agenda,"January 13, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), spoke on the Senate floor yesterday in defense of the filibuster and urged his Democrat colleagues to drop the pursuit of their radical agenda.As Prepared for Delivery:This week, Democrats are forcing yet another show-vote on so-called “voting rights” legislation. They claim the right to vote is under attack by states – when that couldn’t be further from the truth. Ahead of the 2020 elections, everyone from Vice President Kamala Harris to Eric Holder to Stacey Abrams claimed that we were experiencing a wave of voter suppression. Yet, the facts are clear – and they don’t lie. The Census Bureau reported that the turnout in last year’s election was 66.8 percent, the highest voter turnout of the 21st century. Turnout was higher across all demographics as well, including minorities. More than 90 percent of Americans think it is easy to vote. More than a third think that the rules should be more strict. So once you see that the Democrat’s “big lie” of rampant voter suppression is clearly false—why are they pushing this election takeover bill?  They want to nationalize elections – putting the federal government in charge of something the Constitution has left to the states. Just a few examples of what the bill would do: line the pockets of candidates with taxpayer dollars, restrict common-sense voter ID -supported by over 75 percent of Americans, mandate mail-in ballots, allow ballot trafficking (that’s when unsupervised political operatives collect and submit absentee ballots) and would make Election Day a federal holiday – costing taxpayers a whopping $818 million every year its observed.You don’t have to take my word for how radical this is – Oklahoma’s State Election Board Secretary has called their legislation a “recipe for chaos.”Democrats can feel the American people turning against their agenda so they are desperate to rig elections in their favor and they will do whatever means necessary – even killing rules that make the Senate the Senate.This would poison bipartisanship and compromise in the Senate forever.My Democrat colleagues want you to forget they were for the filibuster before they were against it – just five years ago, 33 Senate Democrats, including then- Senator Harris, penned a letter in defense of the filibuster.But now, they’ve changed their mind which means they either have amnesia or they see an opportunity to force their radical agenda on American families.If Democrats get their way on the filibuster, it won’t stop with taking over our elections-- they will also pass the Green New Deal, abortion-on-demand, amnesty, and pack the Supreme Court with activists to uphold their unconstitutional agenda.I want to close by sharing a comment on the filibuster: “Getting rid of the filibuster has long-term consequences. If there is one thing I have learned in my years here, once you change the rules and surrender the Senate’s institutional power, you never get it back.” Now, I didn’t say that. President Joe Biden said that, and it might be the first time we agree on something. Likewise, Sen. Schumer also said that getting rid of the legislative filibuster would be “a doomsday for democracy.” I happen to agree with him on that too. I’ve served the people of Oklahoma in the Senate longer than anyone, and I feel strongly that the one thing that has protected our democratic republic and ensure bipartisanship more than anything else is the Senate’s protection of the voice of the minority.  I will continue to protect it, and I urge my Democrat colleagues to do the same. "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-opening-remarks-at-armed-services-committee-hearing-for-key-pentagon-policy-nominees,"January 13, 2022U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, today delivered opening remarks at a committee
hearing to consider the nominations of: Celeste Wallender to be Assistant
Secretary of Defense for International Affairs, Melissa Dalton to be Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, and John
Plumb to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy.As Prepared for
Delivery: Thank you, Chairman Reed, and thanks to
our witnesses for being with us and for their willingness to serve the
nation.  In 2021, our nation’s top military and
intelligence leaders told this committee that the world is more dangerous and
complex than at any other point in our lifetimes.  Looking at what’s happening across the
world, I agree with them.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy
provides a roadmap to prioritize our security challenges. That’s why this
Committee’s top priority has been ensuring we effectively implement it. I hope
the 2022 NDS does not stray too far from our existing strategy.?We have quite a few challenges in the
areas you would oversee, if confirmed. China’s military modernization continues
at an alarming pace, and the massive growth in its arsenal of nuclear weapons
and hypersonic missiles clearly shows that we’re watching an unprecedented
strategic breakout.Russia has built up well over 100,000
troops around Ukraine and is ready for yet another invasion if Putin gives the
word. Russia also recently tested an anti-satellite
missile, creating a cloud of lethal debris that made astronauts scramble for
safety. This again shows Putin’s blatant disregard for established norms.Meanwhile, Iran continues to fund global
terrorism and target American personnel and partners.And rampant inflation is eating away at
the defense budget—not only our troops’ pay and benefits, but also funding for
training, maintenance, and weapons acquisition. This administration seems unable or
unwilling to effectively respond to growing dangers. This paralysis damages
U.S. credibility and undermines the trust of our partners and allies. Even now, the administration seems intent
on upending decades-long security guarantees by watering down U.S. nuclear
policies and exposing our allies to even greater threats – despite overwhelming
objections from our allies.



























We need a greater sense of urgency. We
need strong civilian leadership that I hope you will provide, if confirmed, so
I look forward to hearing your views today. Chairman Reed.

Michael McCaul (R-Texas), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released a statement
following talks between NATO and Russia on the situation in Ukraine. “So far, the Biden administration’s strategy for Russia has been nothing more
than a campaign of appeasement — much to the dismay of our allies. The Biden
administration has yet to impose a single meaningful sanction against Russia
and paved the way for the completion of Nord Stream 2, a malign geopolitical
project run by a Putin crony. Meanwhile, Putin has continued to stoke
instability in Eastern Europe by illegally occupying Crimea, providing cover
and supplies to Russia-backed separatists in Donbas, continuing
cyber-attacks against Kyiv, ordering an ongoing assassination campaign
throughout Europe, and weaponizing migration and energy.“The world needs the Biden administration to do what they should have done
months ago: demonstrate that deterrence comes from strength and that to support
Ukraine’s sovereignty you must provide tangible support to its defense and
interests. We should impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 now and immediately
provide additional lethal aid to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-ship
weapon systems, as well as reinforce the Eastern flank of
NATO. Additionally, it would be a mistake by this administration to
incentivize Putin’s bad behavior with front-loaded unilateral capitulations
like a missile deployment moratorium or a reduction in exercises. 
“We urge you, Mr. President, to steel your resolve and back our allies and
partners in Eastern Europe before Russia invades, not after.”

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-statement-on-navy-completion-of-final-weapons-elevator-on-ford-carrier,"December 23, 2021U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement after the U.S. Navy announced it had certified the eleventh and final advanced weapons elevator on the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) aircraft carrier: “For
the last three years I have closely tracked progress on the Advanced Weapons
Elevators on the USS Gerald R Ford, because the Navy
accepted delivery of this ship in 2017 despite none of these elevators
working. “I
recognize the extraordinary effort that it has taken to finish all 11 of these
elevators but this effort should not have been necessary. “Based
on the contract signed by the Navy and shipbuilder in 2008, the Ford should
have been delivered in September 2015 at a cost of $10.5 billion. What actually
happened is ship construction was not completed until yesterday — six years
late and $2.8 billion over budget. “The
burden of this six-year delay has been borne by the other 10 aircraft carriers
in our fleet deploying longer and more often, as well as gaps in carrier
presence when no carrier could deploy, at a time when naval presence and
capability could not be more critical for our national security. “This
situation is unacceptable. The Navy and its shipbuilders must do better,
particularly on lead ships. To this end, recent National Defense Authorization
Acts have included a number of provisions aimed at improving lead ship
performance. 
“I
look forward to the Ford deploying fully capable and mission
ready. The crew has my full support. With the Chinese Navy more than 60 ships
larger and their capability improving every day, there is no time to waste.”

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-speaks-on-the-senate-floor-about-ethiopia,"December 15, 2021U.S. Sen Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) gave remarks today about Ethiopia and the Biden administration’s plan to remove them from participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA):  Watch Video Here.  As prepared for delivery:I’ve spoken several times about the situation in Ethiopia this year. It’s a nation that’s close to my heart for a lot of different reasons.If you’re trying to understand the politics behind what’s happening on the ground, it’s very complicated. But what’s not complicated is that the human suffering happening is heartbreaking. Women, children, and the elderly – many weak and vulnerable people are being caught up in a war. They’re dying. It’s awful.I pray the violence stops very quickly and call all who feel the same to join me. One of my big criticisms of our State Department is that they tend to go around the world telling other countries what they need to do instead of focusing on building lasting friendships and alliances.This pushes countries away from us instead of bringing them toward us, and we can’t afford to do that anymore with a rising Russia and China, who are all too eager to pick up the pieces we leave behind.Unfortunately, this is exactly what the Biden administration is doing in Ethiopia. Because Ethiopia has been unable to resolve its internal challenges quick enough for the administration, they’re punishing Ethiopia.Most recently, this has been in the form of announcing their plan to remove Ethiopia from the African Growth and Opportunity Act.This means that Ethiopia will no longer have preferential trade capabilities with the United States—for both import and export. This is devastating to a nation that’s been such a great partner over the years. Ethiopia has long been one of our greatest trading partners in Africa, in part because its airline has a majority Boeing fleet. Because of that, many planes across the continent are maintained in Ethiopia.This flippant action makes our other partners doubt our commitment and pulls the rug out from under many American businesses that have decided to make investments in Ethiopia instead of countries in other places around the world like Southeast Asia. If we are willing to arbitrarily kick countries out of the agreement, other countries and American companies might not see participation in AGOA as worth the hassle. Every time we do something like this, we leave a vacuum that China is only too eager to fill.Just after the Biden administration announced their plan to punish Ethiopia, the Chinese government announced their own plan to purchase $300 billion worth of goods from Africa over the next three years and to invest nearly $10 billion.The Chinese Foreign Minister promptly visited Addis Ababa to support Prime Minister Abiy and his unified government. He didn’t mention a word about the internal challenges he faces. They were there to support him – the Democratically elected leader of Ethiopia. That’s exactly what we should be doing. But we aren’t – and China is.We know that Russia and China are encroaching throughout Africa. They want nothing more than to create a division between the United States and Ethiopia and in countries across the continent.The good news – if you can call it that – is that there is time before the Biden administration cancels the AGOA benefits for Ethiopia on January 1, but the door is closing.The Biden administration should take real steps to undo the sanctions against the democratically elected government of Ethiopia and roll back the termination of AGOA benefits. I yield the floor.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-bolster-support-for-ukraine,"December 15, 2021U.S.
Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, today joined six of his colleagues to introduce the Guaranteeing
Ukraine’s Autonomy by Reinforcing its Defense Act (GUARD Act),
legislation to provide critical support to Ukraine as it faces the threat of an
invasion from Russia. Inhofe was joined by Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho),
ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Marco Rubio (R-Fla.),
vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), John
Barrasso (R-Wyo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).“We’ve watched
Russia's military buildup around Ukraine for months, seeing clearly that Putin
intends to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty. Despite this, the Biden
administration says they won't take any action until after Putin invades — and
by then, it will be too late for our friends in Ukraine. This bill pushes
President Biden to speed up lethal military aid to Ukraine to deter Russia,
before Russia invades. Lethal aid will remind Putin that any attempt to annex
Kyiv will have real and concrete costs,” said Inhofe.“As
Ukraine faces yet another build-up of Russian troops on its border and the
threat of a mid-January invasion, the United States should be doing everything
it can right now to deter Russia and provide Ukraine the supplies and support
it needs to defend itself,” said Risch. “Since the administration has failed to
act, I have introduced legislation that would provide immediate material
support to Ukraine. We cannot sit back and wait to react to Russian aggression.
Congress must continue its strong support for the Ukrainian people and their
right to sovereignty and self-defense.” “President Biden’s willingness to make
concessions to Putin not only endangers Ukrainians, but also welcomes the
Kremlin’s aggression in the region at large,” said Rubio. “Unfortunately, this
pattern of appeasement isn’t new - it’s the same failed strategy used by the
Obama Administration years ago. It’s time to recognize that the Biden
Administration’s so-called foreign policy experts are intent on repeating the
same mistakes of the past. I’m proud to join Senator Risch in introducing this
legislation, which takes the threat of Putin’s hostility seriously.”“As
evident by Russia’s escalating aggression, the mere threat of sanctions will
not stop Putin from invading Ukraine,” said Toomey. “The administration must
immediately take concrete steps to assist our Ukrainian partners by sanctioning
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, providing lethal assistance, and bolstering our
bilateral defensive cooperation. I’m glad to join my colleagues in introducing
the Guaranteeing Ukraine’s Autonomy by Reinforcing its Defense Act (GUARD Act)
to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and deter Putin’s aggression.”“Putin
is attempting to dominate and control Ukraine. We cannot let this bold and
dangerous behavior go unchecked. The United States and our allies must do more
to deter Russia by increasing the costs of its aggression,” said Barrasso. “Our
bill strengthens sanctions on Russia and establishes clear consequences if they
invade Ukraine. It also makes sure the brave Ukrainian Armed Forces have the
resources they need to fight for their country’s freedom and future.”""The
United States cannot ignore Putin's latest efforts to rob the Ukrainian people
of their sovereignty,” said Cornyn. “While President Biden has so far stood by
and watched this aggression unfold, my colleagues and I are pushing the White
House to take action. This legislation will ensure the Administration moves
quickly to bolster Ukrainian armed forces and reaffirm our commitment to our
European allies, as well as hold Putin accountable for his thuggery.""“The
time to deter conflict is before it starts. Vladimir Putin has become more
aggressive since Joe Biden took office, but the Biden administration hasn’t
taken the necessary steps to prevent another invasion of Ukraine. Our bill will
help mitigate President Biden’s failure by sanctioning Russia’s Nord Stream 2
pipeline and increasing our support for Ukraine’s armed forces,” said Cotton.This
legislation:- Substantially and immediately increases
material support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including funding for
weaponry, training, and military reform.- Authorizes $450 million in Foreign
Military Financing for Ukraine for the year 2022.- Would replenish the presidential drawdown
authority account should the president use all currently available funds to
support Ukraine.- Strengthens sanctions on Nord Stream 2, a
Russian malign influence project designed to undermine Ukraine and threaten
European energy security.- Establishes diplomatic and military
deterrents to counter Russian aggression:o   Designates Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in the event its forces further invade Ukraine.o   Limits security risks related to U.S.-Russian military cooperation.- Reaffirms U.S. policy of unwavering
commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.

https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-urges-senate-support-for-fy22-national-defense-authorization-act,"December 15, 2021U.S. Sen. Jim
Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today spoke
on the Senate floor to urge his colleagues to support the Fiscal
Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act ahead of the Senate vote. As Prepared For
Delivery: I am very pleased
the Senate is finally voting today on the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense
Authorization Act. There’s an old
document that no one reads anymore called the Constitution. It tells us what
we’re supposed to be doing here: national defense.That’s why
Congress has passed a defense authorization bill for 60 years in a row. This
year will be number 61.This bill
continues a long track record of bipartisan support for our troops and our
national security.Every year, we
come together —House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats — and put our
differences aside, build this bill together, and show our service members that
we support them.That’s exactly
what we did this year. It looked a little different this year, because the
Senate didn’t take up our bill until after Veterans Day — one of the latest
starts ever.We can’t let that
happen again. This is the most important bill we do all year, and it shouldn’t
be left to the last minute.That’s especially the case right now. We face threats
like I’ve never seen before in my lifetime. China and Russia are growing and
modernizing their militaries at rates we’ve never seen before. They’re using
their new technology to menace their neighbors.We’re seeing
Russia build up forces on the Ukrainian border, most likely intending to invade
early next year. And now, we’ve seen evidence that China’s testing hypersonic
missiles — technology we don’t have yet — and growing their nuclear arsenal.At the same time,
following a disastrous withdrawal, terrorist organizations are resurging in
Afghanistan. Our allies and partners are questioning our credibility and
commitment because of this debacle.Iran continues to
expand its nuclear program, and North Korea continues its own provocations.In short — we have
no shortages of challenges to our security and military supremacy.The security
situation with both China and Russia has gotten far worse since the Senate
Armed Services Committee first advanced this bill back in July. It’s gotten
worse even over the last few days—not to mention weeks.I can’t think of a
more necessary bill to pass right now than this defense authorization bill.I worked together
with Chairman Reed, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers, and the Armed
Services Committees in both chambers, to build a bill that will help us respond
to all these threats.We listened to all
of our colleagues — both on our committees and off — to ensure we included as
many of your priorities as possible.Our final product
is a responsible, bipartisan path forward that strengthens national security
and gives our troops the resources, training, equipment and benefits they need
and deserve.The first and most
important way we do that is by boosting the defense topline by $25 billion
above the president’s request. Now, I know defense isn’t his top priority, but
we showed it is a bipartisan priority in this Congress.In fact, it was
the 2018 NDS Commission report — authored by six Democrats, and six Republicans
— that said we need to grow our defense budget if we want to meet the threats
we face. A budget cut like the president wanted isn’t going to get us there.In total, this
bill authorizes almost $778 billion for the Department of Defense and for
nuclear programs at the Department of Energy. This increase
supports many of the military’s “unfunded priorities” — things they need that
President Biden’s inadequate budget couldn’t meet—plus things Congress agrees
the department must fund in critical areas.We provided a 35
percent increase above the president’s budget for military construction — the
largest MilCon budget in a decade.We also provide a
$4.7 billion increase for shipbuilding, allowing our military to purchase five
new battle-force ships, which will be key in our priority theater, the
Indo-Pacific.We bolster support
to key allies — like Taiwan and Ukraine.This year’s NDAA
actually increases funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative by
$50 million, giving Ukraine $300 million total to defend itself in the face of
a possible — and really, a likely — Russian invasion.This bill includes
strong bipartisan support for our nuclear deterrent, which is the cornerstone
of our national security. We fully fund nuclear modernization, which is a top
priority for our military, and solidify support for a key leg of the nuclear
triad, the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.The bill works at
every turn to maintain our military supremacy, or to spur us to catch up in the
areas where we’ve fallen behind.One area where we
do that is cybersecurity — this bill creates a whole-of-government,
public-private partnership to detect and disrupt our adversaries’ cyber
operations.We also accelerate
innovation in key, emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence,
hypersonic weapons, quantum computing, and 5G.Our bill takes
numerous steps to harden our industrial base and remove Russia and China from
our national security supply chain.Of course, our top
priority this year — and any year — is our troops, the brave men and women who
volunteer to lay their lives on the line for our country.This year’s bill
gives them a well-deserved pay raise, improves their health care, housing and
leave policy, and supports their families, who sacrifice just as much as they
do.It prevents
service members from being dishonorably discharged for refusing the coronavirus
vaccine — in the nick of time too, since we’re seeing the first discharges this
week.It’s also
important to note that we kept provisions out of this bill provisions that
could have jeopardized passage of this critical bill, when we simply don’t have
time to spare.This is a good bill. It’s not perfect, it’s not the bill I would have written on my own, but
I’m still proud to vote for it today.Before we close,
I’d like to thank the good people whose hard work got this bill to the floor.I couldn’t be
happier to have Chairman Reed by my side through all of this. I’m proud to call
him a friend. He’s fought day in and day out for this bill, and for our troops.I also want to
thank all the members of the committee.Of course, we
wouldn’t be here today without the committee staff.They’ve worked
tirelessly throughout the whole year — including on Thanksgiving — on this
bill.Senator Reed has
thanked the majority staff already, and I associate myself with his remarks.
I’d like to recognize the minority staff nowTo start with: John
Wason, the minority staff director, along with Liz King, the majority staff
director.On the minority
staff for the committee: Rick Berger, Tom Goffus, Scott Richardson, Greg Lilly,
Marta Hernandez, Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Allen Edwards, Katie Magnus, Sean
O’Keefe, Brad Patout, Jason Potter, Brian Slattery, Katie Sutton, Eric Trager, Adam
Trull, T.C. Williams, Robert Winkler, and Annie Caputo.From my staff: Luke
Holland, Dan Hillenbrand, Don Archer, Dan Holder, Sam Trizza, Esther
Salters, Jake Johnson, Jake Hinch, Alexandra Slocum, Victor Sarmiento, Dixon
Yonan, Leacy Burke, Laurie Fitch, and Naomi
Walker.And the
hard-working floor staff: Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Tony Hanagan, Katherine
Foster, Brian Canfield and Max Boyd, and Maddie Sanborn.I’m very grateful
for their service.Don’t forget: This
is only half the battle. After this, we still must find a deal on the
appropriations bills to make sure we give our troops these resources – and to
get there we need adequate defense spending, while maintaining legacy riders
and eliminating poison pills.
But today, I
encourage all of my colleagues to support this year’s National Defense
Authorization Bill. Let’s extend our 60-year track record of getting this bill
done and let’s tell our troops that we love and support them."
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-praises-fy22-ndaa-senate-passage-bill-provides-for-oklahoma,"December 15, 2021Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, praised Senate passage of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. The legislation passed with a bipartisan vote of 89-10.“I am glad that after months of delay, the Senate finally came together and put service members first by passing the FY22 NDAA. I worked to ensure this year’s NDAA guarantees all of our Oklahoma installations and the surrounding communities are fully resourced and addresses real problems faced by military families when relocating to a new base. I also won the battle to strike the provision that drafts our daughters and our granddaughters. While I still don’t agree to every provision in the legislation, there is a reason the National Defense Authorization Act has passed for 60 consecutive years—it stays true to its objective of ensuring service members have the training, resources and equipment they need to complete the mission and return home safely.”Read the Senate Armed Services Committee press release here.Read the full summary of the NDAA here.A summary of the key provisions for Oklahoma are outlined below:Sufficient Defense Spending – a 3 Percent Increase Over the Biden Administration BudgetFor months, Sen. Inhofe has been advocating for a defense budget that is sufficient and allows us to deter Russia and China. The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission report urged Congress to grow military spending by at least three to five percent each year. When questioned by Sen. Inhofe in the Armed Services Committee, Secretary of Defense Austin, Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks and every military and civilian leader he asked agreed with its findings—yet President Biden’s budget cut defense spending by not increasing it enough to keep up with inflation.Inhofe’s amendment, which passed with significant bipartisan support, increases the defense budget for the fiscal year to meet the recommendations of the National Defense Strategy Commission Report. Military On-Base Housing WaitlistsBecause of the inflation caused by President Biden’s runaway spending, many communities are seeing soaring home and rental prices—and military families who are relocating have been seriously impacted. Service members are often unable to find adequate housing within their budgets off-base. Inhofe championed a provision to improve the lives of military families by streamlining the process for securing on-base housing. This provision urges the Department of Defense to allow service members and their families to join on-base housing waitlists for their next location upon being notified of a permanent change of station, instead of the current process which requires waiting on official orders. This change seeks to minimize the number of families that arrive at their new locations without long-term housing, providing more certainty and stability to service members and their families during the stressful experience of a move.  “We appreciate Congressional leadership looking out for our Airmen and their families. Quality of Life issues like this have a direct effect on readiness,” said Col. G. Hall Sebren, Jr., Commander of the 72d Air Base Wing. “We continuously look for avenues to streamline PCS processes that allow Airmen to shift their focus back to the mission.”Tinker Air Force Base and the Oklahoma City CommunityEnsures the KC-46 and the B-21 missions are fully funded and keeps the Air Force’s Sustainment Center at Tinker operational for years to come.Inhofe also championed innovative technologies, including 3D printing capabilities, to ensure Tinker remains a leader in maintenance and readiness for the KC-46, KC-135, B-1, B-2, B-21 and all other platforms at Tinker. These capabilities will allow Tinker to dramatically extend the life of aircraft and platforms across DoD maintained at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC). “Senator Inhofe is overwhelmingly supportive of Tinker Air Force Base and the Oklahoma City community with the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act,” said Patti Ripple, Director of Military Aviation and Aerospace for the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber. “Thanks to Senator Inhofe’s provisions, the airmen and residents of Tinker will continue their sustainment of multiple weapon systems like the KC-46 and B-21. Funding for developing our workforce, air platforms, and technological capabilities at the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex will also foster job growth with our Oklahoma industry partners. Growing the Air Force’s premier depot maintenance base is only possible with incredible advocacy from Senator Inhofe. We are thankful for the Senator’s continued support of our defense community and mission.”Altus Air Force BaseAerial refueling and strategic airlift are critical components of our military operations around the world. Sen. Inhofe is proud that the training for both are located in Altus, Mobility’s Hometown. This NDAA fully funds procurement for the KC-46A Pegasus Tanker for Altus to continue training airmen, as well as ensuring the KC-135 mission continues until the KC-46 is fully operational. The bill also fully funds continued operation of the C-17 schoolhouse.“The Altus community is thankful for Senator Inhofe's staunch support of Mobility's Hometown and the work we do,” said Dr. Joe Leverett, Chairman of the Altus Military Affairs Committee. “In line with the priorities of the Air Force’s Air Education and Training Command and Air Mobility Command, Inhofe included funding for procurement that ensures Altus will remain the premier base to train mobility airmen. As the KC-46A becomes the cornerstone of the air refueling mission, Senator Inhofe has helped Altus welcome in this platform while continuing to ensure Altus appropriately sustains the KC-135 mission. Senator Inhofe’s support for training across the KC-46, KC-135 and C-17 platforms greatly enhances the readiness of the hundreds of airmen trained at Altus every year. Altus AFB and its industry partners thank Senator Inhofe for his steadfast work on the NDAA.”“Sen. Inhofe can always be counted on to provide for Oklahoma’s military installations—including Altus Air Force Base,” said Rusty Appleton, Executive Director of the Oklahoma Defense Industry Association. “By ensuring the essential missions at Altus are fully funded, Sen. Inhofe is investing in the future growth of Altus Air Base and the surrounding community.”Vance Air Force BaseInhofe authored provisions to support training and improve the quality of life for airmen at Vance Air Force Base by prioritizing the repair and/or replacement of the Air Force’s aging dormitories, some of which were constructed over 50 years ago. Inhofe also worked to maximize the number of operational aircraft at Vance and other Air Force Bases by expanding advanced manufacturing techniques to repair aircraft used for training. “Senator Inhofe has been the loudest voice on capital hill for a very long time supporting our country’s National Defense needs. His support of the NDAA helps to ensure that Vance Air Force Base and other military installations have the funds that they need to complete their missions,” said George Pankonin, Mayor of Enid, Okla., home to Vance Air Force Base.” Senator Inhofe continues to pave the way for readiness as well as quality of life for our servicemembers and their families from his position as the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  The language in the NDAA this year supports the need for critical parts needed by maintainers and paves the way for DOD to review dormitories at all installations.  Vance Air Force Base trains hundreds of Airmen every year and providing them with the best housing and logistical support allows them to continue producing the best pilots in the world.  Senator Inhofe’s work on the defense bills and solid support in the Senate Armed Services Committee is greatly appreciated by both the military and the communities surrounding our military installations.”McAlester Army Ammunition PlantThe NDAA makes progress toward energy stability and security for the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant with a provision that seeks to tap into natural resources for on-site energy production. This initiative would ensure this important installation is protected against threats such as power grid outages and cyber attacks.“Senator Inhofe’s language in this year’s NDAA sets the stage for the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (MCAAP) to become energy resilient by tapping into the installation’s natural resources,” said Jessica Gregg, Executive Director of the McAlester Defense Support Association. “The MCAAP houses over one-third of the U.S. military’s conventional munitions, so it is important that our community can become energy resilient so we are always ready to answer the call to serve our nation. We are grateful to have the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee advocating on behalf of crucial installations like MCAAP.” “The McAlester community is incredibly grateful for Sen. Inhofe’s work over the years to ensure the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (MCAAP) is well taken care of,” said Krystal Bess, Executive Director of the McAlester Chamber of Commerce. “As a member of this community, I know first-hand how important the MCAAP is to the people of McAlester and Sen. Inhofe understands its importance as well as we do. I look forward to seeing all the good achieved for McAlester and our nation with the resources being provided from Sen. Inhofe’s language in the FY22 NDAA.”Fort Sill and the Lawton CommunityFort Sill is essential to the Army’s modernization goals because it is home to the Long Range Precision Fires and Air and Missile Defense Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) and leads the entire Department of Defense in counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) capabilities. Inhofe supported the mission at Fort Sill by authoring provisions to develop new artillery weapons that are more precise and more lethal over a longer range. Through collaboration with industry and university partners at the world-class Fires Innovation Science & Technology Accelerator (FISTA) in Lawton, the Department of Defense will be able to leverage best-in-class technologies and practices in countering our adversaries. “It’s an exciting time for the defense community in southwest Oklahoma and we are grateful for Senator Inhofe’s continued advocacy,” said Mike Brown, Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army. “Fort Sill’s work on UAS paves the way for the U.S. armed forces to maintain an advantage over foreign adversaries seeking to use modern UAS technology against our service members. Senator Inhofe has always been a champion of our developments in these areas and continues to do so in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Inhofe is also assisting several teams at Fort Sill to drive innovation in new propulsion technologies for Short Range Air Defense. Developments in automation for air missile systems and radar technology will continue requiring high technology jobs at the Fires Innovation Science & Technology Accelerator (FISTA) and around the Lawton-Fort Sill community. Our community is grateful to the Ranking Member for his great advocacy in Washington.”University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, and The University of TulsaInhofe has always recognized the important role Oklahoma’s universities play in our national defense and has included several research and development provisions in this year’s defense bill. He authored provisions that would allow universities, like the University of Oklahoma, to work with industry partners to use advanced technology in military manufacturing and maintenance—a natural connection with the mission at nearby Tinker Air Force Base. He also authored provisions to support drone research at OSU’s Unmanned Systems Research Institute and funding for the University of Tulsa’s continued leadership in cybersecurity capabilities. “The University of Oklahoma is thankful for Ranking Member Inhofe’s initiatives in this year’s NDAA that support important research and development that keeps our nation’s military ahead of our adversaries,” said Dr. Tomás Diaz de la Rubia, University of Oklahoma’s Vice President for Research and Partnerships. “OU is pleased to continue partnering with the private sector and Tinker Air Force Base to develop advanced materials and integrate AI and big data technologies for cost savings for the Air Force. We also thank the Senator for securing funding that will help OU make advancements in radio frequency sensors in support of the armed forces. OU is proud to continue engaging in partnerships with academic and industry groups to keep our nation’s military strong.”“Senator Inhofe is unwavering in his support for national defense, and we at Oklahoma State University are delighted to contribute expertise and R&D effort toward that noble goal,” said Dr. Kenneth Sewell, Oklahoma State University Vice President of Research and President of OSU’s Research Foundation. “We are honored that Senator Inhofe has leveraged OSU’s capabilities in counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) research as a key part of the national defense agenda. Senator Inhofe’s work on the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act elevates and accelerates the OSU Unmanned Systems Research Institute’s ability to continue developing important C-UAS capabilities that will be integral to protecting U.S. airspace and deterring the air capability of bad actors.” “As cyber technologies continue to present challenges and opportunities for our nation’s military, The University of Tulsa is energized to further engage in research critical to keeping the U.S. military the best defending force on the globe,” said University of Tulsa Chair of the Board of Trustees Dana Weber. “Thanks to provisions in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, TU professors and students can continue developing national defense research that also expands our state’s technical workforce.”Oklahoma National GuardInhofe successfully included provisions in support of the Oklahoma National Guard. The 138th Fighter Wing in Tulsa fly the most advanced version of the F-16, and Inhofe included a provision to support future upgrades to the F-16 defensive system capabilities, ensuring the importance of the mission for years to come. He also added a provision to enhance National Guard training with international military partners, the academic community and private partners specializing in military aviation training.  A full summary of the legislation is available here. "
https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-reed-praise-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2022,"December 15, 2021The United States Senate today
passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 by a vote of
88-11. Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) released the following statement praising
Senate passage of the legislation: “For the 61st year now, Congress has fulfilled our constitutional duty to
provide for the common defense by passing the National Defense Authorization
Act. This bill provides our military with the resources and authorities they
need to defend our country — which is more important now than it’s ever been
before, at least in my lifetime. This bill sends a clear message to our allies
— that the United States remains a reliable, credible partner — and to our
adversaries — that the U.S. military is prepared and fully able to defend our
interests around the world. But most importantly, it sends a strong message of
support and gratitude to our servicemembers and their families, who sacrifice
so much and deserve the best.“I’m grateful to Chairman Reed, who has fought day in and out for this bill and
for our troops. I’m proud to work alongside him to send this bill to the
president’s desk, and I’m just as proud to call him a friend. I thank our
colleagues for their support and look forward to seeing this bill signed into
law as soon as possible.”Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) also commented on the bill:“I am pleased that the Senate has voted in
an overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to pass this year’s defense bill.  Our
nation faces an enormous range of security challenges, and it is more important
than ever that we provide our military men and women with the support they need
to keep Americans safe. “To that end, this bill makes great progress.  It addresses a broad range
of pressing issues, from strategic competition with China and Russia, to
disruptive technologies like hypersonics, AI, and quantum computing, to
modernizing our ships, aircraft, and vehicles.  It provides our forces
with the resources and support they need to defend our nation, makes historic
reforms to help improve the lives of our servicemembers, and takes important
steps to care for their families.“I am grateful to Ranking Member Inhofe for his admirable leadership,
thoughtfulness, and partnership throughout this process.  I am proud to
now send the NDAA to President Biden for his signature.”The National Defense Authorization Act supports a total of $777.7 billion in
fiscal year 2022 funding for national defense.  Within this topline, the
legislation authorizes $740.0 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and
$27.8 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy
(DOE).  Highlights include:- Providing funding
to support a 2.7 percent pay raise for both military servicemembers and the DOD
civilian workforce;- Directing
historic reform to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how the military
investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses, including

Under the Trump administration, we saw significant wage growth that helped Oklahoma families. Democrats continue to derail these efforts and I cannot support their harmful policies. Hardworking Oklahomans should not be saddled with repaying the debt created by Democrats’ constant spending.”"

Res 29, a bipartisan Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of disapproval, which would effectively overturn the Biden administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate on the private sector.“President Biden’s vaccine mandate is hurting real Oklahomans—that’s why I voted to repeal it,” Inhofe said. “Just look at the numbers. 32 percent of Oklahoma’s labor force are at risk of losing their jobs because of a mandate that should be a personal medical decision—that’s absurd. Not only that, but complying with this mandate will cost Oklahoma businesses an estimated $46 million. The Biden administration has gone too far and it’s time for it to stop.”  "

Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC), today questioned President Biden’s nominee to serve as Vice
Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Christopher W. Grady, at a SASC
hearing.  Inhofe: Let me just get a couple things
on the record, and I already know the answer to this, and I think most people
do here also but it’s important that we get it down at the very beginning so
there's no misunderstanding. Our nuclear modernization — this goes back to
General Hyten, a quote that he had. He said, “I look at our nuclear
capabilities, our triad, our modernization program are the minimum essential
capabilities required to defend this nation. We have to defend against the most
existential threat, and Russia and China and their capabilities are [the most
existential threat]. So to me, those are the minimum essential capabilities
that we have to build. And even at the highest rate, it'll still be just
roughly 6% of the overall defense budget. I think we can afford that security.”
So I will ask you the question, just to get you on the record and saying that
we know the answer anyway, and that is…[do you agree with] General Hyten
that..modernizing…each leg of the U.S. nuclear triad and the National Nuclear
Security Administration, NNSA, nuclear weapons complex is a critical national
security priority. Do you agree?Grady: Senator, I do. A modernized and
fully ready nuclear deterrent is one of the number-one priorities of the
department, and if confirmed, I would seek to ensure that.Inhofe:
I know you
will, and — however that has become somewhat controversial in the past. We have
to get — we have to know where we're coming from. And lastly, I would ask the —
is it your intention to continue General Hyten’s efforts to reform the JROC
process to move faster and adopt advanced technologies that help meet
warfighting requirements? I know that you have responded to a discussion of
this with our chairman, but I'd like to get your assurance as to what we would
do with JROC.Grady: Sir, the efficacy of the JROC and
the momentum that it is on now is extremely positive. And if confirmed, it
would be my goal to bend the curve and to go even faster, to focus on the
threat and the risks to close those gaps and to move as quickly as possible to
get the tools to the center of the universe, our warfighters, as fast as
possible.Inhofe: Excellent. And I know that's true.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
