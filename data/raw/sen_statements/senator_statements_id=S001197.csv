Instead of demanding accountability from an underperforming higher education sector that pushes so many young Americans into massive debt, the Administration’s unilateral plan baptizes a broken system. This deeply regressive action — which fails even to acknowledge that most debt is held by folks with graduate degrees — will do nothing to jumpstart the reform higher education desperately needs."" Background: Student loan forgiveness will cost between $300 billion and $980 billion over the next 10 years, with the majority of relief going to the top 60 % of earners. Senator Ben Sasse has long been an advocate for higher education reform and has been outspoken on its need to be overhauled.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/sasse-statement-on-debt-forgiveness-scheme"

This reckless bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes, hundreds of billions of dollars of new spending for Washington’s ongoing inflation bonfire, and then as a cherry on top, gives the IRS an additional $80 billion to audit taxpayers — IRS tax collectors will get more than seven times the FBI. So what’s Chuck Schumer’s brilliant idea? Change the bill’s name. This so-called 'Inflation Reduction Act' won’t solve inflation – it will make it worse. Moms and dads know that we can’t afford this.

http://www.sasse.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=C75184B9-D22E-4B1F-92A0-45B98BE5D1AD,"U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a China hawk and member of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, pressed Federal Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Wray on the threat from the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the fact that the CCP remains America’s top geopolitical threat, the subject was not a front-and-center priority in Director Wray’s prepared testimony, nor was it the subject of much of the Judiciary Committee’s questioning today. Excerpts below: Sasse: Director Wray, who is the most significant geopolitical foe the United States faces in the next decade?Director Wray: That would be the People's Republic of China and specifically the Chinese Communist Party.…Sasse: You've been really clear about that [anti-CCP] work in the Intel Committee. I'm perplexed by your written testimony today. Because you name, I think, five priorities, and you could make the CCP a subset of cyber-attacks, you can make CCP a subset of a few other places. But the priority set here feels different than a lot of the priority set conversations we've had with you in private.Full exchange below: Director Wray: That would be the People's Republic of China and specifically the Chinese Communist Party.SBS: Thank you, sir. We get you more often in the Intel Committee or you and your team in the Intel Committee than we do here in Judiciary, and you've been very clear about that. Is it your view that the United States government has made massive improvement in thwarting economic espionage from the CCP in the last year or two?Director Wray: I think we've, as a country, we've made significant strides in terms of the recognition of the problem. I find that when I deal with business leaders, for example, and even to some extent, university presidents or chancellors, the level of concern that they express, the level of awareness that they reflect about the threat is moving in the right direction in my view, but this is a problem of massive, massive scale. And to some extent, as a country, we're playing catch up on the threat.And so, part of what I've got all our people doing is out there beating the bushes, interacting with the business community, the academic community. I interact with our foreign partners trying to kind of raise awareness of the threat. It's hard to think in some ways that something that significant, could fly that much under the radar for that many people, but I'm, I am hell bent on making sure that it doesn't stay that way. SBS: So, one of the ways that I think about the problem is the numerator is how much public awareness we're raising and how much better we're getting it hardening the targets that are targeted by the CCP to steal the economic assets of American innovation and taxpayers and firms. The numerator is the awareness but the denominator is the CCP’s efforts and the denominator continues to explode. And I've supported your work and complimented you and the work you've done to bring more of the Bureau's resources and mindshare to bear on this. You know that we have a complementary effort that has come from Chairman Warner, chiefly but before him, Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Rubio myself a few of us on the Intel Committee that have tried to work on the same issue set with you. So, I'm perplexed because I've applauded your work there. You've been really clear about that work in the Intel Committee. I'm perplexed by your written testimony today. Because you name, I think, five priorities, and you could make the CCP a subset of cyber-attacks, you can make CCP a subset of a few other places. But the priority set here feels different than a lot of the priority set conversations we've had with you in private. Can you explain to us the history of Main Justice's view on the China Initiative?Director Wray: Well, I guess on the China Initiative, I would largely defer to the department on its description of how it has changed the initiative. The original initiative was a Justice Department initiative. The changes to it were a Justice Department construct. I will tell you that I have been consistent both under the initiative and since with our workforce in my assessment of the threat and that we at the FBI are not taking our foot off the gas. Now we're going to do a right. We're going to follow the facts with proper predication, we are not going to be basing investigations on race, ethnicity, or national origin, and we haven't and if you go back and look at my statements publicly, whenever I'm giving speeches on this topic, I've been taking great pains for years, to make the point that this is not about the Chinese people. It's not about Chinese Americans. It's about the People's Republic of China and specifically the CCP. SBS: You and I are united, I want you to continue, but I just want to foot stop this because Chairman Warner and I and many others say the exact same thing. There are 1.4 billion people in China created in God's image and they're not our opponents. They're only 90 million members 7% of the country that are members of the Chinese Communist Party, and dictator tyrant Xi, who's running, you know, concentration camps in our time with forced organ harvesting, systemic rape of Uyghur women. There is genocide happening in our time, and that's because of a few really bad actors. Our opponents are not the Chinese people. But Chairman Xi and his thugs are our opponents, and we should be clear about it. And the distinction you've drawn, the distinction Mark Warner draws, the distinction I draw, isn't that hard to explain, and yet it feels like Main Justice has said they're killing the China Initiative because of some worries about some rhetorical challenges where you've said many times that China and the CCP are a long-term geopolitical threat. So please continue, but I agree with the point you're making, but nobody has been arguing the counter point.Director Wray: Yeah, I think I mean, I think the way I understand the initiative and again, I would really refer you to the Department to better describe the initiative, or the changes to the initiative, but the way I understand it, it was an attempt to broaden the focus to make sure that we are also focusing on transnational repression and things like that from other nation states and not just on China, which of course, we have been doing but it makes that clear, but there's a second, SBS: But there's only one nation that could defeat the US.Director Wray: Again, I have said, I've probably spoken more on this one topic than maybe any other topics since I've been FBI director. And I think I've been maybe almost painfully consistent all the way through it. One point that goes straight to the heart of what you're driving at that we're seeing a big push on right now that goes along with the economic espionage piece and the cyber piece is the same kind of transit, the same kind of repression that you're describing in China is an export, the People's Republic of China is engaging in and including right here in the United States.And so we have tried to with the department's support, I should say to be more aggressive and calling out that conduct too, and to show how that conduct is designed to stalk harass, surveil or worse, dissidents, pro-democracy, voices, people like that here, right here in the United States, is designed to help facilitate in many ways, the economic espionage because the more they silence people, the easier it is to engage in this campaign of intellectual property theft. We had a case not that long ago, and I'm sometimes baffled that it hasn't gotten more attention in New York, where actors affiliated with the Ministry of State Security sought to derail a congressional candidate. First by trying to see if they could dig up dirt on the candidate, then to see if they could make up dirt on the candidate. And then to see if possibly they could figure out a way to have the candidate befall accident, you know, some form of essentially physical violence, all because this candidate had been a Tiananmen square protester and pro-democracy voice. Now it's one candidate, but this is happening here in the United States, it's not happening back there. They're doing it here. SBS: They’re getting executives fired in the NBA, and they get call center workers for Marriott in Omaha, Nebraska fired for saying stand with Hong Kong. So, I compliment and support your work and encourage you and the important patriotic Americans at the Bureau to keep focusing on that issue set. I know we're at time. So, thank you Director.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/sasse-presses-fbi-director-on-ccp-as-most-significant-geopolitical-foe"

Our politicians now consistently act like jackwagons, they do it for a reason:It’s because they’re primarily performing – for other jackwagons.Echo-chamber politicians drinking their own bathwater isn’t entirely new, of course, …but what is new, and something is new here, it’s the instant feedback of social media. Politicians increasingly addicted to likes and retweets, they act and think – but mostly they feel – like social media is where real life happens. Happily, they’re very wrong.""... ""The time is now: There has arguably never been a better time to make this the majority party than at a moment when so many Americans are hungry for something bigger. They know disruption is on the horizon. And they want something optimistic, frankly they’d probably just settle for something sane.""...""American conservatives don’t traffic in grievance. We don’t believe in whining. Our party must reject politicians who tell the American people that we’re victims. We embrace leaders who tell the American people that we can write our destiny. Americans have never wallowed in self-pity. Our history is filled with men and women who refused to settle, who smashed barriers – men and women who built a better nation for us:The Harriet Tubmans and George Washingtons, Susan B. Anthony and MLK, Neil Armstrong and Rosa Parks, Amelia Earhart and Jackie Robinson – and the cheery Ronald Reagan. We embrace leaders who understand that America makes legends, not victims. American conservatives don’t peddle cheap nostalgia. Our moment requires leaders who look the American people in the eye and tell hard truths – but without sacrificing optimism and idealism and aspiration. Americans have the confidence to innovate our way through challenges. Innovation is this nation’s lifeblood. We invented the assembly line – and the lightbulb. The Wright Brothers captured the world at Kitty Hawk. Americans walked on the moon and American companies built the vaccines that defeated COVID.""The full transcript of the speech can be found below:  We live in an odd time, so let’s start with an odd fact: The vast majority of Americans now say that it feels like we’re in decline. 80% of the Left; more than that of the middle; and breaking 90% of the Right. say they think the country is headed in the wrong direction and they think we might be on permanent decline.It’s not hard to see why: Fatherlessness, the epidemic of opioids and suicide, loss of community, foreign policy humiliations, runaway inflation, the addictive horror of the 24-hour news cycle. It feels like we’re inundated with terrible news. And that feels new, because as Americans we aren’t used to thinking about bad news as the thing that floods over us. We think of ourselves as an optimistic people, or we used to anyway.But in another sense, this angst isn’t entirely new. In self-government, freedom is always fragile, and the stakes always high. Which means that the to-do list before us always feels a bit pressure-filled. The nagging sense that we might be on the verge of decline makes some sense when we remember that each generation has to pass this republic on to the next generation. And passing it on isn’t inevitable, it takes work. It feels a bit daunting—partly because it should feel a bit daunting. But when President Reagan reminded us that freedom is “never more than one generation away from extinction,” he wasn’t saying it with a heavy heart. He was laying out a challenge — a challenge that flows from a blessing. His point was this: it’s up to us. No king is going to it for us. It’s up to you and to me to pass this unbelievable American nation onto the next generation. Yeah, it feels a bit daunting. But it can’t incapacitate us, it can’t render us passive. Every generation has a choice, to get off the couch and build, or to resign as the rich kid who lets the family business fall apart. Because make no mistake, the loss of confidence we’re experiencing has disastrous real-world effects.Let’s look at the case study of how our entitlement, our drifting, our lack of self-confidence over the last decade – how it produced the debacle in Afghanistan.The American people, as President Reagan regularly reminded us, have an uncommon gift for common sense – on those issues they choose to tune in to. Unfortunately, most folks tuned out on Afghanistan, and painful consequences (the scars that will last) followed from decisions made by the weak isolationists in two consecutive Administrations – that chose decline over honor, fantasy over facts. The American people had better ideas. The American people never thought for a minute that the Taliban could be trusted. The American people never endorsed our surrender agreement at Doha. The American people didn’t think that sticking to that foolish agreement (even as the Taliban were brazenly breaking their word) could be spun as “an extraordinary success.”  The American people didn’t like being lied to about what was happening at Karzai Airport, or the absurd decision to abandon Bagram Air Force Base, that had been secured with so much blood.No, the American people over the last year have seen the world as it is, not as flacks told them to pretend-see. The American people looked at desperate Afghans – many interpreters and drivers who’d risked their lives for our troops (and to whom we in turn had given our word) – we saw them fall off of C17 wheel wells, and we felt sick, as we should’ve.We looked at anguished parents handing their babies over barbed wire to strangers, and we wept. We looked at the ass-covering and blame-shifting of the permanent inhabitants of Washington – and regular moms and dads in Nebraska, and regular moms and dads in Southern California, were indignant. The American people don’t like feckless leaders who humiliate the nation, the last two administrations bowed to the Taliban. The American people don’t like defeat. But defeat is exactly where the loud isolationists – long of the left and now of the right – have demanded we go. The catastrophe in Afghanistan is a stark example of how defeat-ism at home produces chaos abroad that can then boomerang back on us.And we’re in for more of it if we submit to the demands of the prophets of doom and dismay that we must retreat even more broadly.  Thorough-going isolationism will neither rationalize our national security priorities, nor drive us to more hard-nosed alliances and partnerships.  These isolationists offer the mirage of fortress-security as they instead what they’re really doing is handing power to global forces seeking to make the world more unstable, more dangerous. The new isolationists present themselves as hardheaded realists, but it’s not true. They’re the ones with stars in their eyes as they ostrich-see only one side of a balance sheet. They pretend that retreat from the world can us focus on “nation-building at home,” and that this can happen pollyannish miracle with no cost at all. But in reality, national security involves actual trade-offs. And the retreat they champion comes at a hard, high price.Here's the reality: The last 75 years, with the US as the globe’s unrivaled superpower, we have seen shocking peace and shockingly prosperity, by every historical measure. Too often, we pit idealism and realism against each other in ivory tower, philosophy-seminar kinda way that don’t really grapple with the world we’ve actually inherited. For in flesh-and-blood lived experience, American idealism about human dignity helped create immense realist, geopolitical stability. And American military, our might, enabled the spread of human rights and broader representation, and private property rights and land reform, and unleashed entrepreneurial innovation on every continent, thereby uplifting millions of families and innumerable communities. That’s the reality of the last 75 years.Stated more brass-tacks: American military and economic engagement wasn’t some charity. After the Second World War, our grandparents literally built the world. We created a global infrastructure of trade organizations and military alliances that became dang-near beautiful, like the pictures of Ellis Island in the President’s office upstairs, Reagan leading us to avert WW3 and win the Cold War, barely having to fire a shot. But this creative process wasn’t born of altruism. Although it was indeed very good for the world, but we did it because it was good for America. There’s a reason that we’re 4% of global population and 24% of global GDP. If “America First” just becomes shorthand for “America Alone,” then it’s a dumb slogan and an even dumber meaning: “America poorer and America less safe.”  Engagement, by which we really mean “leadership”, can't be romantic. It can't be naive, for there is no international law that's handed down by some all-knowing, benevolent, placeless global legislator.The handwringing and happy talk that oozes out of the United Nations (where genocidal regimes can chair the so-called “human rights” commission) is perhaps useful for the occasional sternly-worded letter, but none of those processes do anything to make us safer. There is no abstract “international law.” But what there is a system of rules and norms – like the free navigation of the seas – that we built, and that our parents and grandparents enforced, until recently.The US did this because if we didn’t, someone else would’ve set the rules – and every human on earth would’ve been worse off over the last three quarters of a century.  This system has kept Americans safe. This system has made Americans prosperous. The system won the Cold War. And the result has been that the US, and lots and lots of other nations as well, have become safer and richer than they would have been without U.S. leadership. It's been very positive-sum.Isolationists like to quote John Quincy Adams’s warning about an America going abroad “in search of monsters to destroy.” But we’re not knights-errant, and never have been. What we’ve been doing for the last several decades is establishing, by every means at our disposal, ways to keep the monsters at bay. Because monsters try to come back. Because monsters always threaten. Just ask Zelensky – ask the moms of Mariupol.America has a decisive role to play on the global stage — and that role is more urgent now in a new era of great-power politics. The Pax Americana that prevailed after the Cold War has badly frayed – and on the horizon are new adversaries eager to exploit our decline, to expedite our fall.  It will be mostly our choice whether they succeed.The biggest threat to the American-led order is the Chinese Communist Party — and the technologies they think their centralized system will harness faster and better than our decentralized system.  The rise of this belligerent, confident, expansionistic, indeed imperialist Communist Party is the competitive challenge that will define much of the next half century. Beijing is not only an economic competitor, although they do have a strong hand over global trade and currency flows that subvert markets and the liberty markets make possible. Beijing is not only a military competitor, although their advances in AI-enabled autonomous vehicles threaten many links of American technological superiority. Most fundamentally, 21st century Beijing is now a competitor on the field of ideas – with a different vision of humanity. Beijing proposes a new way of life — an unprecedented digital totalitarianism that would govern and regulate the most intimate details of individual and family and communal life, turning every person and the devices they carry into the eyes and ears of the regime, that’s what we face.We have already felt how the CCP‘s tentacles can reach into daily life on this continent:We’ve seen the OPM hack of more than 20 million Americans confidential information, including sexual histories and infidelities and drug experiences told to FBI security-clearance background investigators. China has all of that data from your SF-86s. We’ve seen TikTok and 23 and Me compile massive location and genetic data on private American citizens. We’ve seen how Chairman Xi can use corporate lust for access to China’s consumer markets as a tool to squeeze cowardly concessions from American businesses and American sports leagues – concessions like firing employees for saying “Stand with Hong Kong,” or the despicable cowardice of C-suites willing to keep silent about the genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang — including the organ-harvesting that has been disclosed publicly in new ways in the last 72 hours.A tightly interconnected world makes it possible for Xi’s thugs to export digital totalitarianism around the world. But technological development isn’t something we can wish away, nor should it be. This must be a reality-based party, and that means admitting that the world, though disorientingly smaller than in the past, is still larger today than it will be a year out and a decade out. The world will become more linked, that is inevitable, and thus smaller still evermore into the future – for good and for ill.  These threats are real and China’s power-hungry leadership is coming for us, whether we reflect sufficiently on this reality or not.  No amount of pretending or ignoring or hiding is going to make it go away. The defining national security question of the next two decades is whether we will have a second “American Century,” or whether it will be a CCP-led order. I know which side I’m on.But if America is going to lead the next century, it’s going to require us getting our act together and do some big, hard things – and soon. This won’t be easy: it’s been a long time since this country did something big and hard together. But we’ve done this before. We come from generations of people called upon to rise and protect this place, and to do the hard work of building. It’s great news what we’ve inherited, but it also means we’re a bunch of kids who’ve been living off our grandparents inheritance from World War II and the Cold War, and that the money is starting to run out unless we do something. That can either be really bad news, or it can be a chance for us to build something big and hopeful again, like they did and like they bequeathed to us. I know what I want.This “American rebuild” agenda depends first and foremost on the American people. We need a revival of American self-confidence. We need leaders who live and breathe that self-confidence so we can inspire a generation of self-confident Americans and American families and American communities and American start-ups. This is a nation-wide challenge, a whole-of-society calling, but here, just for a second, I want to talk just to my own party. We Republicans have a choice to make: We can either continue to drift as a party that exists as a vehicle for the grievances of the angriest, oldest folks, or we can be the future-focused party of 2030 – with policies centered on the future of work and the future of war. We need to give Americans confidence again as they enter a dizzying world where the digital revolution is remaking every segment of the economy and is going to end lifelong work for almost everyone. The American people are second to none; we can outcompete and outperform anyone – but we’re going to need massively reformed institutions – and a wave of new institutions – that champion reward hustle and grit – that help every hungry American develop the skills he and she need to flourish. This is going to require a lot of new educational and job-retraining institutions – obviously for ages 15-25 – but also, because life-long learning will now be required for every domain and every job, we are going to need these new institutions for ages 30 and 35, 40 and 45. And no civilization has ever built a community of lifelong learners before. We’re going to have to, whether we like it or not. That’s just reality and ours must be a reality-based party. So…The new technologies that are disrupting our communities in unprecedented ways are, like so many tech developments over time, they’re pro and con, they’re a mixed bag. They’ve simultaneously made us the richest consumers in human history, but more stuff alone satiates none of our deepest longings. Work and productivity and community – meaningful ways to serve, and to be needed – are so much more important than just more marginal consumption. These enriching technologies also come addictive and isolating and alienating temptations – frightening, soul-deadening risks with these super tools.People don’t always know how to say it, but our neighbors feel it.  Our neighbors feel less stable. They understandably worry about this loss of control; they feel loss of agency. Our domestic policy must be laser-focused on the disruption of work, giving people the tools they need to remain valuable – and valued. This is part of why merely relitigating policy fights from 20 or 30 or 40 years ago, just with more anger added, is so dumb. It does nothing to solve the problems, nothing to comfort those Americans freaked out by the instability of job and neighborhood, economy and culture. We should be tackling these real problems.But somewhat counterintuitively, the biggest riddle in our national security policy is tightly linked to this same domestic policy riddle. And that’s because our primary geopolitical challenge is the coming decade’s technology race with the Chinese Communist Party.  The bad guys keep asserting, and indeed now persuading many of our sometimes-allies, that only central planners can possibly address the destabilization technology is birthing in our time. “More strong men,” Chairman Xi tells our allies. We have to have an answer, a better answer than he has. As Republicans we know that more central planning, and less freedom, can’t possibly be the best human dignity-affirming pathway to political and economic stability. But we need to put up or shut up; we need to demonstrate that a decentralized system of free peoples (and the communities we build) can thrive during this unprecedented, fluid time.So, in a sense, our number one foreign-policy concern remains the same as our number one domestic policy concern – the self-confidence of Americans to navigate this brave new world. But right after that, we must also admit as well that a smart public sector for 2030 will be an America that again sees itself as, and actually acts like, a superpower again. We meet here this week exactly forty years after President Reagan addressed Parliament with a plan to revivify American leadership of the Free World.  And much like your Reagan Institute’s “Westminster 2.0 Working Group” report released earlier this week argues: we should lead a system of alliances that not only fortifies the healthy countries but also inspires the repressed inside the unhealthy countries.We’ve got a lot of work to do. So... Nobody out-thinks, out-hustles, or out-works the American people. We built an American order that saw us through the Cold War. We can build a new American order that will see us through the coming conflict with the Beijing tyrant – that’s seeking to export his dehumanizing surveillance-state autocracy and the related technologies.  Now I know that faster than I can get the words out, a legion of pessimists on the Left and the Right will be lined up to tell us why we can’t do it. Their pessimism is poison. And we have lots of peddlers of it. On the left, and the right, legions of prophets of decline.You know since the earliest days of the Progressive Movement (a hundred years ago), we’ve always had a “Blame America First” crowd that was ready to tell us why America was evil, then why America could not possibly beat the Soviets, why America could never be anything more than the sum of her sins.It’s a long tradition, it inspired Teddy Roosevelt’s beautiful homage to the ""Man in the Arena"" – and his slapdown of the tireless whiny, anti-America critics.The blame-America-first tradition – the Americans-are-too-weak-to-build-or-fix-anything tradition is old.  Here’s what’s new…What’s different now…is that we have so many on the Right who’ve joined the whining. More false prophets of pessimism, just from a different heretical sect. Fundamentally, they have the same message. In the 2016 Presidential campaign, you had two candidates with wildly different solutions, but their fundamental diagnosis was the same: “The system is rigged; you’re getting screwed; you’re a victim; this country is going down the tubes.""You’re victims. The left wants a powerful nameless-but-supposedly-benevolent bureaucracy; the right wants a strong-man daddy figure. But the loudest all agree on one thing: America (the one given to us by the Founders, the one kept for us by our parents and grandparents) doesn’t work anymore – it can’t work anymore.These are not the good faith positions of two big healthy political parties, just with competing visions of leadership.  These are predators circling the carcass of the American body politic, two petty factions ready to fight each other to the death about which of them will get to rule us. We should reject all such warped visions of this glorious inheritance we’ve received. I don’t want a nanny state caring for me from cradle to grave, and I’ve already got a good dad, thank you very much. I want us to be America again. It’s liars who tell us that our Constitution is obsolete; that principled pluralism can’t possibly work anymore, that the very act of believing we can make it work again is quaint.Since persuasion is dead, they tell us, the only thing to do is to use the government to smash the other side – to weaponize the state to go after your domestic opponents – who we’re told we have to regard not as just wrong on a policy here or there, but as evil.  They tell us the other political party is the root of everything that ails us. They’re full of crap. The prophets of doom (right and left) disagree about almost every particular policy, but they almost always sound like twins – because they agree that the solution to domestic squabbles is to give the federal government loads more power.Marjorie Taylor Greene and AOC – it’s choose your own dictatorial adventure.Matt Gaetz and Madison Cawthorn, they might as well be from the far left – because like all prophets of doom, they love ranting to the American people that we’re just victims. The prophets of doom tradition has always told us that our problems are too big, they’re too insurmountable. They tell us we have no agency. We’re powerless.But when people feel powerless, when they identify as the victims in their stories – instead of the children of heroes and the authors of our own destiny – we slip into the lazy, comfortable slouch of decline. You hear it everywhere today: “We’re backsliding as a nation,” “we’re rotten to the core,” “we need to turn inward,” “the country used to be great.” These stories are wrong – but they’re dominant today, and if they long dominate (in self-government), perception can become reality. America is an idea – and ideas depend on stories – shared stories. And therefore the stories that we tell ourselves – they matter.  Being resigned toward decline that’s the wrong story. Finding adreneline rush in endlessly droning on about the worst 2% on the other side – it’s the wrong story.The truth…is that America still has an amazing story to tell.We are the only country that started as an idea – a wild, optimistic, world-shaking, history-changing idea. It’s this: universal human dignity.People are fallen, but we’re also ensouled, and big – and filled with potential – and meant to rule ourselves. The American idea is: universal human dignity and limitless potential safeguarded by limited government. Government matters, politics matter – but they can’t be the center of our community, or of our animosities – they certainly can’t be the center of our loves.This Republic isn’t perfect, of course, but it is this:  It’s better than anything else the world has ever had to offer.  It’s the best form of government, ever.  Each generation has worked to make it better, to build a more perfect union across two and a half centuries. The Americans who we inherited this from they knew where our strength lies. America’s strength isn’t in Wall Street – or Silicon Valley – or the Pentagon – it isn’t some bureaucracy. Our strength is measured by the confidence of the American people in our shared American idea – about the dignity of people, and what people can build.Yes, there are doom scrollers, there are grifters, there are people making money off prophesying decline – some of them literally mocking their own audiences when the cameras are turned off.  Some of these folks are even partly right about what is broken, but they’re wrong about the biggest things.They’re wrong that the American people are weak, that we’re content with decline.  They’re wrong that Americans, some of the grittiest people across history’s pages, are okay with passivity.They’re wrong about our will and resolve.  They’re wrong about our strength – and its wellsprings.For we’re actually strong if we believe that our system works. We are strong if we believe that we can – and indeed we should – make a more perfect union. We are strong if we believe that all are created equal. What makes America great is understanding that it is God (not government), that gives us dignity and rights – regardless of skin pigment, regardless of gender, regardless of place of birth.We are strong if we believe that our ideas about liberty are great – and that our constitution is good and that’s never more relevant than it is tonight.These are basic truths – “self-evident” as our Founders said.  And the American people need to again hear these truths – this honest, optimistic American story. But let’s be clear: If we don’t tell it, the prophets of decline will win, as they help make America lose.I believe that America (still the most powerful nation in the world) still has its best days ahead of it. The story of our forefathers, and the mothers of liberty in our ancestry….their story…is ours…if we can keep the republic.But to keep the republic means reclaiming our politics –from those who want power politics to dominate every national conversation – as so many (left and right) currently want.  This won’t be easy, but few things worth doing ever are. American revival won’t be easy because we’re facing not just dysfunctional government but also endless fuel from rage peddlers who want just this dysfunction, who lust only for performative shouting.Right now, we have a government of the weirdos, by the weirdos, for the weirdos. Most real people are tuning out – regrettably, but understandably – and they’re letting the very-online, very-angry dominate politics. Our politicians now consistently act like jackwagons, they do it for a reason: It’s because they’re primarily performing – for other jackwagons. Echo-chamber politicians drinking their own bathwater isn’t entirely new, of course, but what is new, and something is new here, it’s the instant feedback of social media. Politicians increasingly addicted to likes and retweets, they act and think – but mostly they feel – like social media is where real life happens. Happily, they’re very wrong.  Yes, there is lots of grandstanding going on, but the grandstands are small and mostly empty. Political twitter isn’t real. Only 22% of Americans use it, and more than half of that 1/5 of never follow politics on Twitter. The vast majority of traffic on Twitter is driven by well under 2% of the public. And yet politicians – again, left and right are barely distinguishable – in seeking to cater to this tiny minority and the algorithms that drive addicted-engagement.Political algorithms run on rage. Nobody goes viral for making a good faith argument. Nobody goes viral for admitting there are policy trade-offs. Nobody goes viral for being honest that 280 characters probably won’t allow the space to have an honest debate. It’s dumb to talk about a particular piece of federal legislation as either the arrival of Heaven on earth or the harbinger of Hell by Tuesday.Nonetheless, the loudest politicians and the media demagogues who enable and encourage them still daily go viral just by preaching to their little siloed choirs. They get clicks for divisive headlines and outrageous overstatement, telling their audience that, if you’re not with us entirely and immediately, then you’re the enemy. Cable-television suffers from the same problem. Tucker Carlson had the most watched show on cable this year, checking in at 3 million and 30,000 viewers one night last month. Lawrence O’Donnell clocked in less than half that, and Anderson Cooper on CNN about 800,000. It sorta sounds like a lot, until we remember that this gorgeous continental nation has north of 330 million souls. To review: On a typical day, less than 2% of the nation is watching all the cable news combined. And this 2% is not remotely representative of the country. The median age of an MSNBC viewer is 68. CNN, basically the same. Fox evening programming has an even more geriatric audience. Gen-Xers and Millennials and Zoomers (the generations that make up our entire future) are not listening to any of the fanservice media. Politicians who spend their days shouting in Congress, so they can spend their nights shouting on cable, are peddling crack – mostly to the already addicted, but also with glittery hopes of finding a new angry octogenarian out there.We don’t have time to talk about today’s headlines, but think about our daily supply. Michael Avenatti was convicted or sentenced to multiple years in prison today – for being a liar.  Boy that was a shocker.  And this carnival-barker was a guy that CNN used to have on dozens and dozens of time every single month – at one point deciding to push him as a presidential candidate. Why? because he was good at carnival barking.The circus might be funny if it weren’t so serious. America’s junk food media diet of politi-tainment matters, because self-government depends on an actually informed citizenry. We need shared facts. But politicized newsrooms and clickbait culture don’t just make us dumber; the main thing they do is also exhaust and alienate almost all of America. And so our neighbors check out, allowing the very online with their rage addiction to dominate – again to the exclusion of the overwhelming majority of our citizens.So there are the headwinds; There are naysayers and doom-peddlers content with broken politics and managed decline, so long as they get in a really good “burn” on the other side as America’s republic dies out.But here’s the good news: The American people are much, much better than that. Much more interesting than that. All this disengagement by the big majority, although problematic, really can be the source of some glimmers of hope. Why are these folks disengaging? Because most Americans have no interest in endlessly scrolling on politicized social media or watching the repetitive cable sorta-news that pickles your brain night after night – there’s a reason they don’t want to do this:  They care about other stuff, and lots of it is more important than what they’re turning off. Most Americans much prefer to be raising their families and building things than engaging in sludge. One of the biggest things we need in American politics is pretty mundane; we need a lot more of these normies to show up just a bit more often, and to roll their eyes a lot more often at performative weirdness.   The opportunity is here if we’ll see it: When you ask the American people if they consider themselves more Republican or more Democrat, and you don’t give them the chance to say “none of the above,” “none of the above” still wins overwhelmingly as people object to the framing of the question. About 28% of Americans now see themselves as members of our Republican Party; and about 28% considers themselves Democrats – while well over 40% say, ""To hell with your question, I don’t want anything to do with either of those parties."" I’m convinced that if you ask  the question in this way, and allow people to identify as “mostly disconnected from both political parties,” rather than feeling at home in one of them, well over half of all respondents would answer “Other”. Who is speaking to those Americans? Who is offering them the optimistic, future-focused vision? Who’s reminding them of their glorious civics inheritance? Almost no one. Why not us? Think how long it’s been since the American people have heard a big, optimistic, Reagan-like aspirational message. A 33-year-old American has seen a Republican President win the popular vote only once in her entire lifetime (and that was in the aftermath of 9/11, when the Dems decided to run an heiress-marrying, throwback anti-war candidate from the ‘60s). That is the only time a Republican has won the vote in the lifetime of anyone 33 and under in this country.Shouldn’t the Republican party have something to say to her? We’ve got to do better. We’ve got to be speaking to people who tuned both parties out a decade ago. We’ve got to be speaking to men and women who can’t stand preach-to-the-choir-politics because in the real world they’re the ones getting things done, they don’t want mere performance, they don’t want mere shouting.The time is now: There has arguably never been a better time to make this the majority party than at a moment when so many Americans are hungry for something bigger. They know disruption is on the horizon. And they want something optimistic, frankly they’d probably just settle for something sane. This is our moment if we’ll take it. The other party is increasingly drunk on elite leftism at the national level, woefully disconnected from their historic working-class base in places like Nebraska. There is little room for honest debate inside the Democrats right now, when so many are sprinting from the somewhat-left to the far-left, frantically trying to recast themselves as mini-Bernie Sanders bobbleheads.Their current student loan forgiveness proposal is a massive transfer from median Americans to richer Americans.Our current president won their primary and then he was elected by claiming he’d be responsible and moderate, but then promptly handed the staffing of his White House to far left 20-somethings and a chief of staff who literally lives on Twitter. That is Ron Klain’s constituency.This is a disconnected national party right now and they are trying to choose between “shout your abortion” and “defund the police” – oh, and by the way they have two moderates.  And why is it that Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema get so many vile threats from their own party? Their party has no room for intellectual diversity even though they claim that one of its touchstones is diversity. There isn’t any, and it’s monotonous, predictable, and stale – and really unattractive to the fastest growing demographic in the country (Hispanics) and to the big winnable middle of this country more broadly. I want to be clear, the Democratic Party’s appeal-to-the-farthest-left-10% nonsense it’s not good for the country, I wish there was a more credible Democrat party right now, but it’s reality and it gives us an opening. We shouldn’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Facing this kinda shoot-yourself-in-the-foot stupid tribalism, why the heck would our party want to try to mirror the same thing? Debate sharpens ideas. Debate wins voters – by treating them like adults. The namesake of this building preached that someone who agrees with you on 80 or 90% of issues, or even just on the majority of values, is an almost-all-the-time friend and ally friend, not a slippery-slope tainted enemy.This party should be a big tent. We’ve got fiscal conservatives. We’ve got social conservatives. We’ve got budget hawks and defense hawks. We’ve got populists and constitutionalists. Like some of the best things in life, it’s complicated, and it’s messy –and it’s great. It’s what makes this party strong. And frankly it’s what makes me optimistic about the future. What this party cannot be is a cult of personality and grievance. Those are the hallmarks of anti-conservatism. I’m a Republican because I’m a conservative. And I’m a conservative because I believe in gratitude.Everyone born here is immensely blessed – and the heart of keeping the Republic always starts with gratitude. American conservatives don’t traffic in grievance.  Our party must reject politicians who tell the American people that we’re victims. We embrace leaders who tell the American people that we can write our own destiny. Americans have never wallowed in self-pity. The people who built this country and passed it on us to us sought to make it better and more expansive and more inclusive. They weren’t whining. Our history is dominated with people who refused to settle, people who smashed barriers – men and women built a better nation for us and bequeathed it to us: The Harriet Tubmans and George Washingtons, Susan B. Anthony and MLK, Neil Armstrong and Rosa Parks, Amelia Earhart and Jackie Robinson – and the ever-cheerful Ronald Reagan. We in this country and in this party embrace leaders who understand that America makes legends, not victims.American conservatives don’t peddle cheap nostalgia. Our moment requires leaders who look the American people in the eye and tell them hard truths – but not sacrifice the optimism and idealism and aspiration. Americans have the confidence to innovate our way through challenges. Innovation is this nation’s lifeblood. We invented the assembly line – and the lightbulb. The Wright Brothers captured the world at Kitty Hawk. Americans walked on the moon and American companies just built the vaccines that defeated COVID.We’re in the middle of a digital revolution that is going to upend a lot – it’s gonna jostle society. It’s happening whether we like it or not. Politicians who sell false promises of a return to a 1950s economy are selling opioids and dependency. It’s the leaders who tell the truth about how Americans can go now and build the economy of the 2050s– those are the people who empower our citizens. We embrace leaders who understand that America has innovated, can innovate, and will innovate. Conservatives don’t shrink meekly away from the global stage. We embrace leaders who have the strength to stand up to despots. Americans ended slavery. Americans defeated Nazis. Americans prevailed over communism. Americans must stand for freedom-loving people around the world. Don’t listen to leaders who will make excuses for Xi or Putin. Don’t listen to leaders who cut deals with the Taliban. Don’t listen to leaders who play footsie with genocidal maniacs. We embrace leaders who tell the stories of the freedom-fighters, who defend our allies, who champion human dignity, who celebrate Hong Kongers in the streets, who arm Ukrainians, who sound the alarm for Taiwan, and who refuse to disguise the weakness of isolationism with the cynical false pretense of realism.  This is indeed A Time for Choosing.  This is our moment…to choose to reject decline – and to build better. Americans have never believed that this is as good as it gets, or that our best days are in the rearview mirror – and we’re not about to start now.This is our moment to reject the weirdness-addicted, political-bingers who preach jeremiads of despair to their little choirs. Healthy Americans have always known that politics and politicians should definitely not be the center of American life.This is our moment to engage the world, not cower and shrink away. Americans have always understood that we are strong because we are good.This is our moment to build an American-led future. This is our moment to out-innovate, out-compete, and out-perform the Chinese Communist Party, formidable though it is. Because the totalitarian certainty is that humans are small and weak and tamable.  Well they’re wrong. That is not America’s anthropology. That is not America’s idea of Americans – or of anyone created in God’s image.  Our view is that men and women, though flawed, are glorious. That government, although necessary, isn’t the point of it all.  Lincoln’s judgment at the Lyceum – that “If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher; As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide” – heavy stuff, dire, obviously. But it is also implicitly filled with hope.  Because he’s saying that we’re big. We’re big enough that no outside force alone can beat us, big enough that we can resolve to reform and return and revive and rebuild.  The choice really is ours. This is America’s moment. The American people are ready – they want better; they want more. This ought to be the Republican Party’s moment. The question is whether we – the party of Lincoln and Reagan – will again make that big American choice.I know what I’m betting on.  Let’s call the American people to join us again. Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/sasse-i-m-betting-on-america"

In this body we’re used to debating marginal tax rates and debating spending bills, but this issue is different. This debate cuts to the heart of who we are, what we owe each other, and what kind of society we want to preserve, and what kind of society we want to build. The moral weight of this debate is heavy.Social media, of course, makes it worse, makes it ugly. Makes it stupid. There's too little grace, there's not enough compassion. Honesty and genuine good-faith disagreements are really hard to come by.To talk about abortion, well, we need to actually listen to each other, and we need to try to understand the best arguments of the other side and take those arguments seriously.For Democrats, debating well has to start with recognizing that most Americans believe that unborn lives deserve to be protected at some point during a pregnancy. It is deeply human, and deeply compassionate to recognize the humanity of an unborn life. Scientific advances like ultrasounds give us a glimpse into the lives of the unborn. First in black and white, and now in 3D, and it's going to be clearer and clearer over time what that little baby is. Any honest conversation about abortion must grapple with the fact that every abortion begins with two lives, and destroys one of them. It's deeply wrong to ask Americans to participate in an act that they know takes an innocent life.For Republicans to debate well, we need to be willing to be honest about the fact that for some women, pregnancy can be frightening and painful. Many situations are not ideal situations. Pregnancy changes a woman's life in a way that is absolutely unique in human experience. There is no equivalent to pregnancy. There is no example we can compare it to. That's why the pro-life cause is not, and cannot ever, primarily be about legislation or about policy, as important as those can be. The pro-life cause must start with active compassion for moms and babies, and especially women whose first thought upon learning that they were pregnant was “I can't do this.”To the pro-life movement, I want to recognize your patience and your perseverance over decades. We should commend the ethic of love, persuasion, and prudence that has brought us to the place we're at today.Pro-lifers show up for women, and for babies, every single day. I see it all over Nebraska, and I know that it's true across all 50 states. Pro-lifers and especially pro-life women, support women through pregnancy care centers. They work in local communities to build support networks. They're persuading their neighbors and growing a movement that supports life. We don't have the massive war chests, the army of lawyers, and the fancy PR shops that Planned Parenthood does, but what we do have is truth and love.Thousands of pregnancy care centers provide women and their babies with free help, lots of free help. The volunteers who show up every day to help these women obviously don't do it for money, they do it out of love. Thousands of pro-life families adopt kids every year, and their hearts overflow with love as they welcome a new child into their family. That's the core meaning of the pro-life movement. It's not about legislation first, or about legislation second, or about legislation third.Advocates for abortion on demand are doing a lot of fear mongering. We've heard some bizarre speeches on the floor in the last couple of days that are so disconnected from the reality of the text of the legislation that's before us. So much of what they're pushing is wildly out of touch with the public, and wildly out of touch with modern science. We already know that America's abortion laws are far, far more permissive than Europe's, and that on this subject, our laws have a lot more in common with the human rights abusers China and North Korea, than with anything in French law. The legislation before us today would make our laws even more extreme. Depending on how you count, we have the fourth to seven most extreme pro-abortion laws of any of the 200 nations on earth, and the legislation before the Senate today would make the US position even more extreme. There was a time when the Democratic Party talked about abortion as ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ Safe, legal, and rare. Not anymore. This legislation is not from your mom's Democratic Party.In recent years, we've taken votes on my legislation, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It's a pretty simple, straightforward bill that aims to protect babies who survive botched abortions. There are no restrictions on abortion access in my bill, just a simple requirement that if a baby is born alive in an abortion clinic, she must receive the same level of care she would have received had she been born in the hospital. That's it. Yet Senator Schumer, and the abortion lobby, have filibustered this legislation over and over. It is so weird. So here we are today. The abortion industry's lobbyists have bullied leader Schumer and all but one courageous Democratic senator - my friend Joe Manchin - into an extreme position that doesn't reflect even the majority opinion in the Democratic party today, let alone the majority position among Americans. This bill today is ugly, winner takes all politics. It is full of aggressive, pro-abortion provisions. Let's consider just a few:Where's the tolerance? Where's the compassion? Where's the humanity? Where's the attempt to understand that the majority of Americans want there to be prohibitions on abortions at some point in the pregnancy?Americans don't want the kind of radicalism we see in this bill before us today. In recent polling, 65 percent of Americans say they support banning abortion in the second trimester, and 80 percent of Americans support banning abortion in the third trimester. Why? Well, one of the reasons is because they've seen a lot of images of what a baby looks like in utero in the second and third trimester. So just to reiterate, contrary to the last, I guess, a couple speeches ago, the last speech on this topic on the floor, 80 percent of Americans want to see abortion banned in the third trimester. It's hard to get 80 percent of Americans to agree on anything. And yet, 80 percent agree that third trimester abortions, the kind of thing that this bill wants to make sure is explicitly championed. States could not prevent and prohibit third trimester abortions. That's what this bill is about.This bill is incredibly extreme. There is no moderation in this bill – just brutal indifference hiding behind euphemisms. Fortunately, it won't pass.Unfortunately, our debate about it isn't very honest here. Fortunately, the pro-abortion lobby isn't winning. Majority Leader Schumer will earn kudos from Planned Parenthood for this show-vote today, but he's not going to convince anyone.As we look beyond today's gross vote, as we look to the future, our focus should be on continuing to grow the power of the pro-life coalition in this country. We can and we must build support across the country for an ethic that protects life. I want to lock arms with pro-life Democrats, and work to build a culture of life. If we can pair certain pro-life laws with increased spending on prenatal care, and safety nets for struggling moms, count me in. I'm for that kind of big new coalition. Let's do it.This movement is about hearts and minds. We've got to have difficult conversations in love. And we've got to reject the kind of extremism that Senator Schumer is putting on the floor today, pursuing this bill. We've got to focus our work on our local communities, on changing our neighbors’ minds, on understanding each other and on setting an example by putting moms and babies first.The answer after this bill fails today is to remember that love is stronger than power. And that's why life is going to win. Being pro-life means being pro-science, pro-mom, and pro-baby. It means starting with love, not with legislation. And happily, it definitely doesn't mean starting with the grotesque legislation that will be voted down this afternoon.Thank you, Mr. President. Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sasse-americans-don-t-want-this-kind-of-pro-abortion-radicalism"

Not always, there are many fights that are not like that and we just stupidly talk like it. Debates about marginal tax policy are not good versus evil, heroes versus villains. But sometimes, fights are heroes versus villains.Heroes, are men and women who love their country, and who love their freedom, and who want to pass along freedom to the next generation. But they're also people who believe in freedom more broadly. Heroes are people who believe that we're created in the image of God, and everyone has inalienable rights; the rights to life, liberty, speech, religion, assembly to protest; these are pre-governmental rights. Governments don't give us these rights, we are endowed by these rights by nature and nature's creator. And heroes recognize this not only about themselves and their own countrymen and women, but about everybody. Zelensky is such a hero.The villains are tyrants. There are people who want to oppress others, who want to hold them down. They want to take freedom from their countrymen, but also from their neighbors. There are people who seek power at the expense of the weak. Putin is such a villain.But there's another villain in this drama, a villain that isn't getting nearly enough attention. And that's Chairman Xi, the dictator in China. His Chinese Communist Party has enabled him to do all sorts of oppressive things against men and women in his country. We know what's happening in Xinjiang. There's actually a genocide happening against the Uyghurs in our time.But Xi is doing more than just oppressing people at home. A hundred years from now, when the history of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is written, assuming that it isn't written as Chinese propaganda, I'm confident that the public will have a much clearer understanding of the way that Xi and Putin have worked together, and have worked together closely. We can't talk here about everything we know in the Intelligence Committee, but I'm confident that when the history is written, the American people, and the people of the world, will see Xi and Putin as having worked hand in hand, side by side. Americans should understand this today.Chairman Xi is not indifferent about Ukraine. He is on Putin’s side, and he has supported Putin's unprovoked war. The situation in Ukraine reminds us of a pretty good rule for 21st century foreign policy and it is this: the Chinese Communist Party, is almost always on the wrong side of freedom and human dignity.The CCP and the United States are in the middle of a global conflict of visions. It is important for us in this Chamber not to say the United States and China, as if we mean 330 million Americans and 1.4 billion Chinese, are locked in a battle. But the United States vision, the American idea, is in conflict with the vision of the Chinese Communist Party, and the ways that they want to oppress not just their neighbors, but their own citizens. The CCP and the US are locked in a global conflict of visions, and that's true whether DC politicians want to admit it every day or not. And sometimes it seems convenient for folks not to admit it.But it is the free peoples of the world who are fighting. These are the folks that are terrorizing not just their own people, but their neighbors. This contest is a contest between liberty and tyranny. Not every fight is, but this one is, and you damn well better believe that the tyrants are working together strategically, and intentionally, to undermine freedom.So, let's back up to February 4th: the Winter Olympics have just begun, and Vladimir Putin is in China to visit Chairman Xi. Together, they release what they call a joint statement, and that's like a new partnership with no limits. The Xi-Putin statement said there would be no limits in their partnership against the United States. They promised that they would work together to promote each other's economic and national security interests, even as Putin was amassing forces on the border of Ukraine, and preparing for this invasion. Xi was not unaware of what Putin was planning, when he released and signed the “no limit” statement.But here's why this is strange. Historically, Russia and China have not been friends. For centuries, these two countries have clashed with one another. During the Cold War, not even shared communist ideology, could unite China and Russia for very long. The CCP studied the collapse of the Soviet Union, to learn how to keep a communist regime afloat, and they've been very adept at using new technologies not to enhance human freedom, but to squash human freedom.Now, though, the historic rivals have found something they have in common: both Putin and Xi hate the United States, and hate most fundamentally our ideas of the dignity of every individual created in the image of God. Still a little geography, Russia and China share nearly 3,000 miles of common border. Russia is giant, and has eleven time zones. Think about that, you look at your globe of the world and you spin all the way around, you got 24 time zones. Russia spans eleven. Russia is about 11 percent of the area of land on Earth, there are five other countries that are about six percent China is one, the US is one, Canada's one, India. So, Russia’s 11 percent, five countries are about six percent. No other country has more than about two percent of the landmass of earth. The Russian-Chinese border has historically been complicated, because they haven't gotten along. But, as he prepared to launch an invasion of Ukraine, Putin needed to move troops and material out, all the way from the border with China in the East, back into Europe in the West. And he couldn't do that, he couldn't leave this giant border unguarded, unless Chairman Xi said, “We don't have any problems with this right now”.And that's exactly what happened. Xi agreed that he would be on the same page with Putin, as Putin took all of his troops, and all of his material back from this historically contested border, to use against the free people of Ukraine. From the beginning of this crisis. Chairman Xi has been in lockstep with Putin. The New York Times had some impressive reporting, and Xi even asked Putin to delay the invasion until after the Olympics ended, which Putin ultimately did.One of the biggest ways China has supported Russia through all of this is by amplifying lies and propaganda about the war. Chinese Communist Party propagandists such as Wang Yi, have done everything from blaming the United States and NATO for the war, to playing up Russia’s unrealistic security demands to actual lies about Ukrainian bio-labs. Xi’s henchmen and CCP controlled state media have always been there to amplify falsehoods. Some of the stuff Putin is saying at home is laughably absurd, even to the hosts of state TV that are paid to read these scripts, and yet Xi has been willing to take all of it, translate it into Mandarin, and pump it into China to make sure the people in China have an inaccurate understanding of what's happening between Russia and the Ukraine. The CCP state media had been trying to tell the world repeated untrue stories about Russia, and now cover up the atrocities and horrors that have been committed by Russian troops against Ukrainian civilians.The propagandizing is obviously despicable, but the diplomatic support the CCP is providing Russia is even more dangerous. Through the covid pandemic we saw that China tried to manipulate international organizations like the WHO, to promote their own narrative and to bully other countries. During the invasion of Ukraine they've done the same thing on behalf of Putin.The Chinese foreign ministry has participated in a consistent spreading of lies about the war through others and to other international organizations. At the UN, Chinese diplomats have worked tirelessly to provide cover for Russian crimes, and to enable Putin's invasion. They’ve spurned the pleas of Ukraine and other European countries to try to help restore the peace. And just a couple of weeks ago, China's Vice Minister met with the Russian ambassador to announce that the regime's will quote, “continue to strengthen strategic coordination with Russia” close quote. Statements like these have become a characteristic of the twisted friendship, that has developed between these two aggressive nations, and what they call their “No Limits"" friendship.China has also attempted to bail out Russia, and to save their economy from the crippling sanctions that we and our allies have imposed since the beginning of this invasion. As soon as the sanctions were imposed, Chinese banks were looking for workarounds, so they could keep doing business with Russia. Partly for their own interests, but largely to help stabilize and subsidize Russia. Russian banks issued Chinese UnionPay cards after Visa and MasterCard pulled out of the country, and had ordered Chinese currency savings accounts. China was already in a currency manipulation business, but since February, they've been using their talents not just to prop up their own currency, but also to keep the ruble from flaming out, and while other free countries have begun shunning Russia's energy sector, China’s state-owned energy companies have continued to conduct what they call normal programs in cooperation with Russia, looking for ways to expand, and eat up more of the Russian supply.But China hasn’t only been supporting Putin indirectly. Chairman Xi has also aided Putin's invasion of Ukraine directly. The Times of London reported at the beginning of April, that China launched a massive cyber-attack on Kyiv mere days before Putin invaded. Think about that. The Chinese government, was involved in a cyber-attack against free Ukraine to help Russia.As the Russian army struggled, Putin has asked Xi for direct military assistance, and Xi is reportedly deliberating about how he can do more, hoping the international community won't notice. We should notice. We should amplify what Xi’s doing, he is aiding and abetting Russia's war crimes against civilians.Here's the fact: Putin and Xi are tied at the hip. China regularly claims that it stands to the principles of state sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in domestic affairs. And yet China has supported and provide a diplomatic cover for Russia's illegal, immoral, and unprovoked war against Ukraine every step of the way. And now there's a chance that team Zelensky could win. And so, what has Xi done in response? He's decided to convene meetings to figure out how he can amp up support for Putin.We should be asking ourselves, “Why is Chairman Xi so supportive of this invasion?” Part of the reason is because while Vladimir Putin is running a scout team offense for Chairman Xi's eventual plan invasion of Taiwan. Xi wants to learn everything he can about how democracies and its free peoples will respond and how democracies defend themselves, so that they can try to develop strategies to beat us, and to beat our allies. Xi also wants Putin to win because he thinks this will demoralize Taiwan, and the rest of the free world. He wants to be able to tell a story where the age of America, where the age of freedom, is over. Xi wants to plunge the globe into a new dark age, an age of surveillance state totalitarianism. And step one at this moment is destroying the friends of Ukraine. We shouldn't deceive ourselves. What we're seeing in Ukraine is a contest between freedom and tyranny. It is not in our national interest to see the tyrants triumph.We need to show the world that the forces are made by Putin and Xi cannot defeat the bravery of men and women who want to live free, and who believe in freedom. Zelensky and Ukraine's heroes have a chance to smash the new Russia-China axis, but they need our support.Standing up to Putin and helping Ukraine is important for its own sake, but it's also important because this is the opening skirmish in a larger confrontation between tyranny and liberty. Between Chinese communists and the American idea. Will the US continue to lead the world toward peace and freedom?

On March 6 our government joined our allies in calling for Russia to be suspended from Interpol. Fifty days later Russia remains a fully active member. Now is the time for freedom-loving countries committed to the rule of law to act and ensure Vladimir Putin no longer has a voice, vote, and influence in international law enforcement organizations.Russia’s lawless invasion of Ukraine laid bare Vladimir Putin’s longstanding contempt for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Recent atrocities committed by Russian forces in the occupied areas of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv underscore that these values have no purchase in the Russian government or in its military.  As Attorney General Garland has recognized, such a nation has no place in an international organization like Interpol, whose mission is to promote international law enforcement cooperation consistent with the rule of law and the protection of individual rights. As I explained in my December 2021 letter to you regarding Hu Binchen’s nomination to Interpol’s Executive Committee, authoritarian countries, specifically Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC), have abused Interpol to undermine human rights and the rule of law outside their borders. This includes abusing “red notices,” which inform police about internationally wanted fugitives, to target political opponents and dissidents on foreign soil.Interpol’s decision on March 10 to implement “heightened supervision and monitoring measures” for Russia is a small step in the right direction. But it is not sufficient to protect Interpol against potential abuses by the Russian government or to ensure that Russia does not exploit Interpol’s intelligence sharing function to further harm the people of Ukraine.I wholeheartedly support Attorney General Garland’s March 6 call with counterparts from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to remove Russia from Interpol. Interpol should follow the lead of the UN General Assembly, which voted to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council on April 7. Removing Russia from Interpol should be a top priority. With that in mind, please respond to the following questions within 21 days:Interpol’s constitution does not contain any provision for the suspension or exclusion of a      member country.Interpol’s March 10 announcement related to Russia suggested that calls to exclude Russia from Interpol were “political,” whereas calls to continue providing Russia with access to Interpol information reflected “serious security and safety concerns.”On March 10, Interpol announced that Russia can no longer send “diffusions,” a less formal type of request for cooperation, directly to member countries. Instead, Russia must send them to the General Secretariat to be checked for compliance with Interpol rules.  In a classified setting, if necessary: Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/sasse-remove-russia-from-interpol-now"

Although she explained originalism and textualism in some detail to the committee, Judge Jackson refused to embrace them or any other precise system of limits on the judicial role. ""Instead she seemed to imply, like Justice Elena Kagan, that originalism is just one of the tools judges use – not a genuine constraint on judicial power. Judge Jackson’s record makes it clear she has more tools in her toolbox. ""It’s important to study the McGahn case, one of the few times Judge Jackson was asked to decide a novel constitutional question. Instead of carefully examining the constitutional principles, rooted in the text, that should have governed that case, Judge Jackson created a new, implied constitutional right to sue; discounted separation of powers principles; and, under the guise of abstract “constitutional values,” shoehorned policy views about the presidency into her opinion. This is a pattern. In Make the Road New York and in AFL-CIO v. Trump – which Judge Jackson described as two of her most important cases – higher courts unanimously reversed Judge Jackson for exceeding her authority.""As I made clear in our Tuesday and Wednesday exchanges, it is one thing to explain a judicial philosophy but quite another to agree to judge bound by such a system of restraint. ""Like so much of our public square, the Supreme Court confirmation process is broken and doesn’t build trust in either the Senate or the Supreme Court.

I want to ask you this question because I think so many Americans agree with what you've said and what others have said. Understanding that we have allies we need to work with, understanding we have a tyrant who has threatened World War III and nuclear weapons repeatedly, understanding that we are shipping some weapons in there that obviously we're not announcing, what else beyond what President Biden said yesterday, what else do we need to get in there as quickly as possible? Senator Sasse: Yeah, so we can talk some specific weapon systems but I think the bigger point, where you're actually headed, is the moral question of where this goes over the next three months and three years but at weapon systems, they need S-300s now. You had the Rob Portman clip about specific anti-aircraft stuff that's needed. They need more drones, they need more javelins, they need coastal defense systems, obviously Russia’s navy is trying to get involved in this, we've seen that in some of the bombings in the south. But more fundamentally, and I give the administration credit for certain things, bringing along some of the European central banks was hard work and it was important, because the U.S. doesn't have a lot of trade with Russia, and Europe does. So bringing along those central banks was important. There were all sorts of particular ways where the administration yesterday said a lot of the right things, but just because the pen was in President Biden's hand yesterday, doesn't mean that weapons are in Zelensky’s hands today, and at every point we’re too slow, and it feels like a huge part of the administration's audience is internal lawyers, and they do these offensive and defensive legal hairsplitting arguments. At the end of the day, every weapon we ship to Ukraine is a defensive weapon system because they're the ones being invaded. Ukraine didn't cause this. There's a fight for freedom happening in Ukraine, and every weapon we give Ukraine is defensive, and so the lawyers in the administration need to take a backseat, and the administration needs to tell people what they're for, not what they're against, because mostly what you hear out of the administration is self-deterrence.Joe Scarborough: So you are, you're on the Intel Committee, you know, things obviously that even other members of Congress can't know. We, looking at this from the outside, really we hear about weapons systems going over there, but we can't move it. We can't see the movement. So, David Ignatius talked about going to the border and seeing a tremendous amount of weapons actually cross that border. So how, what can you tell us about what's not getting there, how it needs to get there faster? What are the roadblocks? Senator Sasse: Well, so first of all, at the level of lethal targeting information, which is what we discussed together on your show, I don't know a week, a week and a half ago, the administration regularly starts the conversations by saying, “what might Putin think about this” and “what might he claim by press release would lead us to some terrible new place?” We should, of course, be cautious when you're dealing with a guy who, whether you think he's a madman or not, has a giant nuclear arsenal, and he would like to be perceived as a madman. But you don't start every conversation by saying because he has no moral bounds, and because he has a lot of nuclear weapons, everything we do should be guided by the argument that Putin might get really pissed about this, and therefore he might do what? Bomb women and children? I mean, the theater bombing yesterday that had children written on the roof, we know from some backchannel stuff, I'm not saying anything that crosses any intel lines here, but we know from some backchannel stuff that some encrypted apps that a lot of Russian military were using afterwards, they were cheering the fact that they had killed children. This wasn't some accidental bombing. They want to demoralize the population, and by us having an administration that goes out and almost always leads by saying “it might be dangerous to do this thing that would be perceived as escalatory,” you give Putin the advantage in that he always gets to move first, and he knows the bounds of every single tactical move he might make. We should have Putin worried, what might happen to him and to this war effort of his if he continues to escalate against civilian populations. And right now you don't get any of that moral and strategic high ground on the side of the information, excuse me, the administration, because there's so much legal parsing that happens in public.Joe Scarborough: Well, Senator, there's also obviously concerned about World War III because you have Putin constantly talking about the use of nuclear weapons, people on state television talking about the use of nuclear weapons, diplomats talking about the use of nuclear weapons. I mean, sometimes our intel community gets it right, sometimes we get it wrong. I don't know where you were on the war in Iraq in 2003. I can tell you I was on these airwaves and I supported it. I was wrong about WMDs. The consequences were terrible, 4,500 Americans dead, the consequences of being wrong here, obviously, far more expansive. So, do you, I'm not asking you obviously to do the White House's bidding here, you would never do that, but do you at least understand these stakes are so momentous when we're talking about whether we get it right or get it wrong, could end up in a nuclear war?Senator Sasse: Of course, and that's why I've said I'm not in favor of declaring a no-fly zone, because you don't get to declare a no-fly zone, you have to enforce one and that would mean putting American pilots in the air and getting into a direct shooting war with Russia. I'm not advocating that. But I am saying that you can't let Putin say because he has a nuclear weapon, every other thing he does can cause us to self-deter. There are 44 million Ukrainians, something like six or seven percent of the population has already fled. If Putin moves forward with targeting civilian populations for months or years, if the resistance could last that long, are we saying that at every point, he can escalate to this, he can escalate to death camps, he can escalate to that, and we'll just constantly say “well because Putin has nuclear weapons at no point can we do more.” We can do more. The Ukrainians have demonstrated a will to fight, this is a population of freedom fighters on display, their courage on display for the whole world to see. And if it shoots, if they'll shoot it, we should ship it because they're willing to fight. We don't need to do the fighting, but we should be doing the constant resupply. It should, the burden of proof should be on us about why we wouldn't supply every single weapon that they request. Joe Scarborough: Right. Senator I'm gonna pass around to other people who have questions, right. I just want to step back a bit here and just talk generally about what we've seen over the past three and a half weeks. I would guess that we probably shared a lot of similarities in our, in our worldviews and have over, over our lifetimes. I believe in American exceptionalism. I've always been a strong proponent of NATO. I believe in Western civilization, and the extraordinary things that have come from Western civilization, responsible for feeding and freeing more people than any other civilization known in humankind. Talk about the last three, three and a half weeks, how important it's been to see NATO come together again, Germany's stepping up, liberal democracy, Western democracy, once again, taking its rightful place in the world, and just showing there is a difference between good and evil, and we're on the side of good.Senator Ben Sasse: Yeah, absolutely. So, we have to recognize that Vladimir Putin is not a guy who will be stopped until someone stops him. And for his two decades in power, he's constantly assassinated political opponents, he's targeted civilians, he shot down civilian aircraft in Syria, genocide like behavior and violent chemical weapons attacks, and at no point has he been stopped in the past, and so that brings us to your point about the last three and a half weeks, what we have in the 40 million plus Ukrainians, and it's symbolized in Zelensky. It's not Zelensky alone, but he's been a model of courage on the global stage. And as he's done what he did, he's defied the international community's assumption that every leader facing a big army will just cut in and run. People said, “is he Ghani or is he Churchill?” For months in the intel space running up to this moment, and most people had to bet, they assumed he was going to cut and run, it turns out he didn't do that, he decided that courage requires standing up against the bully sometimes, and the Ukrainians are fighting not just on behalf of their kids and their future, but they're fighting on behalf of the whole free world as you mentioned. And so there's both idealism and realism at play in this moment, and we need to be doing everything we can to help the Ukrainians not simply lose more slowly, but actually have a shot at winning. The world needs the Ukrainians to win, and that means the Ukrainians need to be able to kill Russians, and to kill Russians, they need more weapon systems. They've got a will to fight. We know who Zelensky is, we know who the Ukrainians are. They, what he asked us yesterday is “who are the Americans?” and “who is the Biden administration?” He has the courage of his convictions. Do we have ours? We should, we're a superpower, we should act like it.   Jonathan Lemire: Senator Sasse. Good morning. It's Jonathan Lemire. Just in the last few minutes the White House has announced that tomorrow President Biden will be speaking to Xi Jinping of China and Ukraine is very much on the agenda. I know you have pretty strong feelings about China, so want to get your sense here. What would you say President Biden's message should be tomorrow on that call, and do you harbor any hopes that Xi Jinping who might be one of the few voices that Vladimir Putin might listen to, do you think Xi Jinping will tell him, “knock it off”? Senator Sasse: Chairman Xi is not an honest broker in this, he's the guy who greenlit the invasion. Russia, as you know has 11 time zones, they were able to move essentially all of their troops back from the Far East to stage them in Belarus on the eve of the invasion, because XI was greenlighting this. We know that he didn't want the invasion to disrupt the Olympics, as he lied to the world about the genocide that's happening in Xinjiang of the Uyghurs, but he wanted to make sure the Olympics went off without a hitch, but then once Putin was free to invade, Xi viewed it as a scout run, as a dry run operation to look at how the world's community, how the US in particular, but how the world more broadly might respond to Xi’s ambitions to seize Taiwan. And so ultimately, hopefully, there's lots of conflicting intel on how the inner ring around Chairman Xi are responding to this, but hopefully they're seeing a world in a West that has a little more will than Xi thought when he greenlit Putin to do this. Putin wanted and Xi wanted behind him, to see Europe and the US embarrassed, but Xi also wanted to see that there wouldn't be much financial resolve, in response to an illegal, immoral, just completely indefensible invasion, like this of Ukraine, and he was hoping he would see a world that wouldn't stand up when he plans to invade Taiwan. And so hopefully President Biden leads with reality, and with truth about the fact that Xi is wrong morally, but he was also wrong in his calculus about the world's response.Kathy Kay: Senator it’s Kathy Kay, when you look at the next few weeks, how, how, what's your biggest fear in terms of how this could spill over into the rest of Europe and bring the rest of Europeans this wall? How would that path go?Senator Sasse: Well, three or four things to say first, the, the horrific starting point for every human. We all believe. We're supposed to believe, that all 7.8 billion people on this globe are created with dignity in God's image, and we're seeing women and children and civilian populations targeted, so I don't think we should ever in the real-politik conversation that you're rightly pointing us to lose sight of what's happening to civilians there. But at the real-politik level, I give the Biden administration credit for saying we'll defend every single square inch of NATO territory, the Polish border, and the Romanian border and beyond should be fortified more and more. We should be sending weapon systems not just to the Ukraine, but to the edges of NATO territory as well. Obviously, there are ways where confusion could lead to a direct US and NATO shooting war with Russia. We don't want that to happen. There have been some important prudential conversations about how the mix, for instance, might have been transferred in ways that wouldn't confuse Russian generals on the battlefield to think these were planes being flown in from NATO piloted by NATO as NATO was entering the war. But all of those tactical issues and prudential issues are ultimately soluble. We need to be leading with the moral reality of what Putin is doing is wrong, NATO and the US won't countenance it, and that doesn't require us to actually be in a direct shooting war with Russia. We don't need to be supplying the pilots, but we shouldn't be supplying the planes and munitions. And so, I don't really think this line is that hard, there's all sorts of adult prudence and caution required, but right now we have too much lawyerly hairsplitting.Mika Brzezinski: All right, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska.

One Ukrainian after conversing with some of his colleagues a little bit on a recording that many who may have now heard, decided to turn up the volume and he announced, 'Russian warship, ****.' The Russians decided to open fire on the island, pounding it with heavy ordnance and eventually, troops would storm the beach and capture the garrison. But that one sentence, 'Russian warship, ****.' That is now the rallying cry of the Ukrainian resistance...But it is not just the Ukrainians who are going to be burying their dead. Russians are going to be burying many of their sons as well. Thousands of Russians, many of whom are conscripts, will have died needlessly for Vladimir Putin's lies and his vanity. Putin told Russian parents that their sons were off on training exercise, and that they would be welcomed as heroes at the end of these exercises. He didn't tell them they'd be shot, lit on fire, blown to bits, he didn't say these things because he's a liar...While we applaud the bravery of Ukrainians, we should not overlook the humanity of these Russians who will also die. For the West’s battle, freedom's battle, is not with Russian moms who didn't even know their boys were being deployed, women who would not desire to have the dictator Putin send their sons to ruin. Human beings are made in the image of God and they're dying, and Vladimir Putin alone bears responsibility. His evil ambitions are destroying not just Ukrainian bodies and souls, but also Russian bodies and souls. And this conflict, this chosen war of aggression by Vladimir Putin is disgusting. And if he actually cared for anything bigger than his ego, if he actually cared for his people, if he actually cared for his nation, the generations of Russians who this war is going to impoverish, then he would find an off ramp now. That's what a bigger man would do...But Ukraine's heroes, despite the dark nights that are ahead, their heroes deserve our reverence. While it is ugly in Ukraine, their stories need to be told around the world, by free people who believe in human dignity. For there is a great pantheon of freedom fighters across time, men and women who've died fighting tyrants, and we should tell their story, we must celebrate their cause, and we should arm them with as many javelins, stingers, and rifles as they can possibly use. We should ship them rations and ammo, and we should share actionable intelligence in real time with them so they can try to repel the invading force. For as long as they are fighting tyrants, America stands with them, and America will arm them, and I'm convinced that this Senate will rise to the call to arm these Ukrainian freedom fighters in memory of those boys and Snake Island and all those who are joining in their throng. Glory to Ukraine. Glory to her heroes. America stands with you.Full transcript below.  ""Thank you, Madam President,Madam President, it’s a little after 4am in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and President Zelensky is still fighting. Ukrainians are still fighting and Americans need to know their stories. Ukrainians need us to tell their stories.This story starts, of course, with an unjust, unprovoked invasion. The people of Ukraine posed no threat, they provoked no violence. They lived freely on Russia’s southwest border, with their iconic wheat fields. Many of us have been to Ukraine, many of us have made friends there. We also have Ukrainian-American friends back in our states. Living freely on the Southwest border of Russia was enough to provoke the small man, the tyrant of Russia, to hatred. It's bizarre. They lived in freedom and so Putin decided he was threatened. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s desperate Nebuchadnezzar, thought he could crush Ukraine. He thought he could break their spirit. He thought he could put his boot on their neck. He actually thinks that freedom makes people soft so he thought it would be easy. He was wrong.Over the last week, Ukrainians have shown us their fighting spirit. They have shown the world their fighting spirit. They are standing firm against onslaught after onslaught, including the relentless targeting of civilian populations. Outmanned and outgunned, the Ukrainian army is making Putin pay pints of blood for every inch his army advances.The truth is, Putin didn't expect to encounter much resistance. He looked back on his experience in the Donbas, where he took big swaths of territory with a few dozen bullets and he was convinced that the Ukrainian people would fold in the face of his giant army. He’s been caught off-guard, and his plans have been set back. He didn’t anticipate the bravery. He didn’t anticipate passion. He didn’t anticipate heroism. He didn’t anticipate the Ukrainian people.He didn’t anticipate the way ordinary villagers would stand against occupiers– like the one small woman who approached a group of Russian soldiers and began handing them handfuls of sunflower seeds. Why? She told it was so that flowers, something beautiful, could grow on the places where their bodies rot after they were killed in Ukraine.She spoke for all Ukrainians. She spoke for the Kyiv grandmas arming up with AK-47s. She spoke for the grandpas who were having to reenlist in their late years. She spoke for the students now learning how to make Molotov cocktails. She spoke for the fathers who had to kiss their children goodbye as they head back to the front lines of battle. And she's speaking prophetically in advance for the mothers who are going to bury many of those sons.The truth is that Putin has been embarrassed over the past five or six days by the Ukrainians. Modern tyrants have developed a few strategies to fight truth-telling. The Chinese Communist Party's version is tried to suppress all information, choke it off. Make sure no one ever says anything that is true. Others, like in Russia, decide to blast a billion lies through state-run media, hoping that they can just blot out the truth. Sow so much confusion and nonsense that people can't find the needle in the haystack that is the truth. But in the middle of this crisis, these strategies are failing because people are hungry for stories. People need stories, we need stories. And the best and the most powerful stories, are almost always the true stories. And right now Ukraine is retelling an age old story of good and evil. And the reason their story is so powerful is because they're telling a true story. If we were to stand here tonight, Senator Portman and I and many others. I've been in the SCIF today for many, many hours. I've been there four or five times and most of us have been there the last hour and a half or two hours. And if we were to tell every story of Ukrainian bravery, the Senate wouldn't have time to get anything else done this week. But there's one story that stands out over the course of this last week since Putin began his unjust invasion. And it has given rise for the courageous Ukrainian resistance to find for themselves a new motto, and this is the story of Snake Island.There's this little island in the Black Sea, near the mouth at the bottom of the Danube Delta. It's called Snake Island. And it's really small, but it's both strategically and symbolically important because it marks the boundary of Ukraine's territorial waters. Ukraine has always stationed a small number of border guards on this island to keep watch. In 2019, the current president, Zelensky, went to this tiny little piece of rock and he declared this island, like the rest of our territory, is Ukrainian land and we will defend it with all our might. Nobody in 2019 knew he was speaking prophecy. But right now, over the course of the last week, the world has seen and the world has heard the story, the world has heard the recording of what those 13 Ukrainian heroes did last Thursday as they sought to defend that little piece of rock because it was symbolically important, as all of Ukraine was, and it's not Russia.Shortly after Putin ordered his troops to attack Ukraine, two Russian naval vessels approached Snake Island and their intent was to seize it. The Russian commander ordered the Ukrainian border guards that they must surrender. He thought he could intimidate them, but like their ultimate commander-in-chief, the dictator, the liar Putin, he was wrong. He couldn't intimidate these men. And so he announced that they needed to surrender or they would be fired upon. Well, the Snake Island guards they refuse to give an inch. One Ukrainian after conversing with some of his colleagues a little bit on a recording that many who may have now heard, decided to turn up the volume and he announced, “Russian warship, ****.” The Russians decided to open fire on the island, pounding it with heavy ordnance and eventually, troops would storm the beach and capture the garrison. But that one sentence, “Russian warship, ****.” That is now the rallying cry of the Ukrainian resistance. It was heard this morning, when a Georgian gas station on the sea decided that it wouldn't refuel a Russian ship. And when the Russian ships said, what are you talking about? And they said, no, you're the bad guys, and the Russian said, why can we just put politics aside just let us buy some gas. And these Georgians decided to repeat the new Ukrainian motto back to the gas station and said get the hell out of here. And the gas station pulled away and said Russian warship you guys look strong enough, why don't you row?That sentence sums up the spirit of countless courageous, brave Ukrainians and what they're doing as they stand in the face of the much larger invading forces. Snake Island is incomprehensible to a man like Vladimir Putin. He doesn't understand human dignity. He doesn't understand courage. He doesn't understand principle. He's too small.He doesn't understand why people would fight for freedom. This is a man who spent the last 30 years, 20 of them now as the ruler, fighting to return Russia to tyranny, fighting to take away the freedom of this people, fighting to take away the liberty and freedom of those on Russia's borders. He doesn't want any of his near neighbors to know freedom. He thinks tyranny is the order of things. And again, he's wrong.Unlike Putin though, our people, the reason so many Americans have been rallying to the Ukrainian cause over the course of the last week. Our people fully understand the spirit of Snake Island. We may not know Snake Island geographically, but we understand what is beating in the heart of the people who now want to echo that motto. We breathe freedom. We believe in the ideas of the Declaration of Independence -- we strive to create a more perfect union, where everyone is recognized as having been created equal. We often fail in our execution but it is our aspiration to affirm universal human dignity and the destiny of people to be free. For we believe that every human is created in the image of God. And there's nothing government can do to erase that. We have no love for strong men and tyrants. We understand the men of Snake Island in a way that Vladimir Putin cannot. For we believe in human dignity. We believe in universal rights, we believe in in freedom from oppression. What we love, Vladimir Putin hates.Today, Ukraine is standing against a dictator who rejects each and every one of the principles that we've affirmed in our creedal founding documents. The Defenders of Snake Island, and indeed all the members of the Ukrainian resistance now are looking to add their names to the list of heroes from the warriors at Thermopylae to the activists who brought down the Iron Curtain. This heroism is timeless.Loving freedom didn't make Snake Island’s defenders weak, though they were outgunned. They were strong. The Ukrainians are fighting for a reason; love of country, hatred of oppression, and the aim they have to pass on a free Ukraine to their children for generations to come. This National Resistance expressed so eloquently by these guards of Snake Island has also come to find itself embodied in another one of the great new heroes on the global stage. And that is President Zelensky. Just a few years ago this man was an actor and a comedian. Now though, he's shown such bravery that we see his name listed alongside heroes and great statesmen like Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle.As Russian troops bore down on Kyiv, Zelensky could have chosen to flee his country. You might have read some reports that the US State Department allegedly offered to evacuate him and his family, but instead Zelensky chose that he would stay on the frontlines and lead his people. “The fight is here,” he said, “I need ammunition not a ride.”Putin, meanwhile, is off hiding in a bunker trembling in fear of his own people. People are marching in the streets to oppose his pointless war and his only response is to try to choke off their speech and to imprison them. Zelensky, on the other hand, fights shoulder to shoulder with the men and women who are trying to defend his country, you may have seen him breaking bread with some guys this morning. He's putting his life on the line for his country and he's not backing down and his bravery has changed the world this week. We don't know how things are going to unfold over the course of the next weeks and months, but Zelensky has changed the trajectory this week of Germany, of Finland, of Sweden, of Switzerland, and of kids all over this 7.8 billion person planet. Zelensky is a symbol, and as a courageous man has already changed the world. He's a bigger man than Putin. The whole world knows that. Putin's own army knows that, even Putin's cronies now know that.But it is not just the Ukrainians who are going to be burying their dead. Russians are going to be burying many of their sons as well. Thousands of Russians, many of whom are conscripts, will have died needlessly for Vladimir Putin's lies and his vanity. Putin told Russian parents that their sons were off on training exercise, and that they would be welcomed as heroes at the end of these exercises. He didn't tell them they'd be shot, lit on fire, blown to bits; he didn't say these things because he's a liar.While we applaud the bravery of Ukrainians, we should not overlook the humanity of these Russians who will also die. For the West’s battle, freedom's battle, is not with Russian moms who didn't even know their boys were being deployed, women who would not desire to have the dictator Putin send their sons to ruin. Human beings are made in the image of God and they're dying, and Vladimir Putin alone bears responsibility. His evil ambitions are destroying not just Ukrainian bodies and souls, but also Russian bodies and souls. And this conflict, this chosen war of aggression by Vladimir Putin is disgusting.And if he actually cared for anything bigger than his ego, if he actually cared for his people, if he actually cared for his nation, the generations of Russians who this war is going to impoverish, then he would find an off ramp now. That's what a bigger man would do. Ukraine, on the other hand, is not the aggressor here. We're seeing people fighting for their survival because Putin has given them no other choice, and his thugs will keep on killing innocents until they are expelled from Ukraine's borders.We obviously don't know how history will unfold here, but we do know that truth is on the Ukrainian side. And the truth is this: that the boys of Snake Island, and President Zelensky, and the broader Ukrainian National Resistance are mounting a defense of freedom unlike anything the West has seen since the end of the Cold War. And that's why this story of Snake Island matters. It's why Zelensky’s bravery is so important not just for Ukraine, but for the whole world. And it's why that little woman’s sunflower seeds are so inspiring for ordinary Ukrainians responding to Putin's aggression with extraordinary heroism. We should be in awe of what our friends are accomplishing.Make no mistake, though, war is not an abstraction. Our 21st century jargon about “kinetic action” and “lethal force” tries to paper over a reality as old as Cain and Abel. War is young men and young women, struggling for a last gasp of air while the blood soaks into the mud, war is started by the old but usually waged by the young and no one in their right mind would ever wish for war.For it is ugly, but the cause can be necessary, and in this case, the Ukrainian cause is just. Their war for their country, for their freedom, and for their kids’ futures is just. The Ukrainians are willing to shed their blood for their cause, just as importantly, they are willing to soak the streets with the blood of Russians who've been sent by the comfortable tyrant Putin, who sends his people to die pointlessly far from home, while he consumes the billions that he has stolen from those same people. Let's be steely eyed about the coming days and weeks because things tonight, at 4:30 in the morning in Ukraine, are ugly, and they're going to get much, much worse. But Ukraine's heroes, despite the dark nights that are ahead, their heroes deserve our reverence. While it is ugly in Ukraine, their stories need to be told around the world, by free people who believe in human dignity. For there is a great pantheon of freedom fighters across time; men and women who've died fighting tyrants, and we should tell their story, we must celebrate their cause.And we should arm them with as many Javelins, Stingers, and rifles as they can possibly use. We should ship them rations and ammo, and we should share actionable intelligence in real time with them so they can try to repel the invading force. For as long as they are fighting tyrants, America stands with them, and America will arm them, and I'm convinced that this Senate will rise to the call to arm these Ukrainian freedom fighters in memory of those boys and Snake Island and all those who are joining in their throng. Glory to Ukraine. Glory to her heroes. America stands with you. Thank you, Madam President.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/sasse-tell-ukraine-s-story-arm-these-heroes"

http://www.sasse.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=AEAD0BA4-6453-4432-B114-2365F9A14810,"Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement on the crisis in Ukraine urging the U.S. to aggressively arm Ukraine and enforce economic consequences on Russia.Excerpts of Senator Sasse’s Remarks are below:“A few political voices, though – on both the right and the left – are telling Americans that they should be indifferent to what’s happening in Eastern Europe… Why can’t we just be indifferent to Ukraine? What is our rooting interest against Putin?” Others ask this cynically to try to land cheap political points. Those advocating for indifference want us to believe no vital American interests are at stake in this conflict. They tell us that isolation will free us up to “build back better” at home or “make America great again.” Those voices are wrong. Indifference is not an option. Whether you’re an optimistic idealist or a hardened realist, Americans shouldn’t be indifferent.” “A lot of American isolationists are now saying that China is the primary threat we face so we should be indifferent about Russia aggression. It is true that China is the primary threat we face, which is exactly why we can’t be indifferent about this Russian aggression. Chairman Xi isn't indifferent. Chairman Xi has given Putin his blessing. Russia has eleven time zones, it is a giant country. And right now, practically all of Russia’s military has moved from the east to the western front. There's nothing left on the Chinese border. That doesn’t happen unless Chairman Xi and Vladimir Putin are on the same page. So we should ask ourselves, why is Chairman Xi interested in this? Because Vladimir Putin is running a scout team offense for Chairman Xi’s eventual invasion of Taiwan. Xi wants to know what we will do and what we don’t do. He wants to learn everything he can from this. He wants to create a propaganda victory that demoralizes Taiwan just like President Biden’s shameful exit from Afghanistan sadly did. Xi wants our allies to distrust us and right now it's working.” “The Biden Administration has dropped the ball for months and months and months. Every single step of the way, Washington has limited our options and expanded Putin’s opportunities. Let's be clear: Nobody wants a massive ground war with American and NATO troops in Ukraine. Nobody wants a shooting war with Russia. We should, however, have been arming the Ukrainian people to the teeth for months. Putin’s calculus is pretty straightforward: he’s going to go as far as he can until he feels that his intervention is too costly. It isn't like you can let him take Ukraine and then this all gets simpler. The United States should be making it very costly now – not by putting troops on the frontlines in Ukraine, but by running a massive new Lend-Lease program with Kyiv.” Full Transcript Below: Right now, as I record this, Russian president Vladimir Putin has amassed 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders. If he invades, it will be the largest military offensive in Europe since World War II. That’s seventy-seven years.A few political voices, though – on both the right and the left – are telling Americans that they should be indifferent to what’s happening in Eastern Europe. Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are right to be asking the question, “why should Putin’s actions matter to the United States? Why should we care? Why can’t we just be indifferent to Ukraine? What is our rooting interest against Putin?”Some are asking this in good faith. Others ask this cynically to try to land cheap political points. Those advocating for indifference want us to believe no vital American interests are at stake in this conflict. They tell us that isolation will free us up to “build back better” at home or “make America great again.” Those voices are wrong. Indifference is not an option. Whether you’re an optimistic idealist or a hardened realist, Americans shouldn’t be indifferent. Here’s why:First, the idealist case: The American Founding is the promise of universal human dignity. It’s who we are today. It’s in the American DNA to feel solidarity with people fighting for freedom against tyranny.The Ukrainians are such a people today, and Vladimir Putin is such a tyrant. For his entire reign, Putin has asserted the lie that Ukraine isn’t a real country. He believes that Russia and Ukraine are one nation, and he is more than willing to use brutal force to maintain that lie. More than 13,000 Ukrainians have already been killed since Putin first invaded their country, and annexed Crimea in 2014. The death toll will climb higher.Putin wants to snuff out Ukraine’s democracy to preserve his despotism. He is nothing more than the leader of a band of thugs, plundering the Russian people. He silences, disappears, and brazenly murders his political opponents. He rigs elections and rewrites the Russian constitution to extend his hold on power. He can’t afford a free Ukraine on his Western border offering a better example.But you might think that’s all pie-in-the-sky idealism, so here’s the realist case: Ideals like liberty, equality, and sovereignty are only real if they are backed by actual power. That’s why American leadership is so crucial right now. Not only are we the freest nation on Earth, we’re the most powerful. The top dog writes the rules, and after World War II we wrote the rules. We created an international system that has kept the peace, that promoted prosperity, and kept rules that benefited Americans. It also benefitted our allies, but it benefitted us. The world played by our rules and everyone was better for it. Realism and idealism.Russia may have previously signed international agreements committing to respect Ukrainian independence and sovereignty like any other “real nation,” but those pieces of paper don’t matter to Putin if no one, particularly Ukrainians, can stop him from just taking what he decides is rightfully his. American inaction has emboldened Putin over the years: Each time the West has let Putin get away with these acts of aggression and each time, not surprisingly, he just got bolder.None of this is happening in a vacuum. A lot of American isolationists are now saying that China is the primary threat we face so we should be indifferent about Russia aggression. It is true that China is the primary threat we face, which is exactly why we can’t be indifferent about this Russian aggression. Chairman Xi isn't indifferent. Chairman Xi has given Putin his blessing. Russia has eleven time zones, it is a giant country. And right now, practically all of Russia’s military has moved from the east to the western front. There's nothing left on the Chinese border. That doesn’t happen unless Chairman Xi and Vladimir Putin are on the same page.So we should ask ourselves, why is Chairman Xi interested in this? Because Vladimir Putin is running a scout team offense for Chairman Xi’s eventual invasion of Taiwan. Xi wants to know what we will do and what we don’t do. He wants to learn everything he can from this. He wants to create a propaganda victory that demoralizes Taiwan just like President Biden’s shameful exit from Afghanistan sadly did. Xi wants our allies to distrust us and right now it's working.Here’s a general rule in 21st century foreign policy: if you’re on the same side as the Chinese Communist Party, you’ve probably messed up. China wants us to be indifferent. We shouldn’t be. Freedom-loving Americans – whether we’re idealists or realists, or both – should be taking the other side. Strategy is about more than just setting the right priorities; it is also about execution and about drawing connections between theaters of interest. Putin and Xi can’t be deterred on the cheap. And that’s exactly why we need strong allies.The unfortunate reality is that our allies are neither sufficiently unified nor equipped for this crisis. Germany, for instance, has sent squat to Kyiv. In fact, they’re preventing other NATO allies from arming the Ukrainians. The fact of the matter is, the US military is providing far too much of the brick and mortar of NATO’s deterrent force.There aren’t a lot of great options left. The Biden Administration has dropped the ball for months and months and months. Every single step of the way, Washington has limited our options and expanded Putin’s opportunities.Let's be clear: Nobody wants a massive ground war with American and NATO troops in Ukraine. Nobody wants a shooting war with Russia.We should, however, have been arming the Ukrainian people to the teeth for months. Putin’s calculus is pretty straightforward: he’s going to go as far as he can until he feels that his intervention is too costly. It isn't like you can let him take Ukraine and then this all gets simpler. The United States should be making it very costly now – not by putting troops on the frontlines in Ukraine, but by running a massive new Lend-Lease program with Kyiv.Surging material aid to our Ukrainian friends is an obvious step, but we're late. They need all the anti-armor, anti-ship, defense capabilities we can get them. We should be providing intel support, too. The goal is to facilitate Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression for as long as possible. The Biden administration ought to be rolling out an aggressive suite of sanctions on Russia now with the promise of escalation following an invasion. Hit Putin’s wealth, hit his cronies, and hit his precious NordStream2 pipeline to demonstrate seriousness now. Continue to tighten the screws threatening Russian banks, SWIFT, debt transactions and major Russian energy exports.Let’s be honest: Real economic consequences for Russia come with a risk of economic pain for us and our allies as well. But we can endure those consequences. Russia’s GDP per capita is smaller than Mississippi’s. We can afford to alienate this glorified gas station. But to do that, the President needs to unite Americans. He needs to do it now.Americans need to understand that we have a serious rooting interest here. The President can’t just shrug off so-called “minor incursions” into Ukraine. Indifference is signaling weakness. The sharks in the Chinese Communist Party smell weakness like blood in the water. In five years if Vladimir Putin is stronger and Chairman Xi is emboldened, no American is going to look back on this moment and think that President Biden handled this crisis correctly. We need strength and clarity not naive indifference.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/sasse-on-ukraine-indifference-is-not-an-option"

The President and Vice President should have to disclose their tax returns and their families shouldn’t gladhand for foreign cash under the cover of foundations and libraries.  And foreigners shouldn’t be able to dump cash into ballot initiatives. This is going to hack off a whole bunch of Republicans and Democrats but, frankly, doing it in one fell swoop is the only way to do it – it’s time to get everyone’s goat.""Background:After a series of stories revealed controversies in congressional trading there has been bipartisan support to ban lawmakers from personal trading.In November of 2021, the FEC affirmed that foreign nationals can legally pour money into ballot initiatives in states that don’t otherwise forbid it.Senator Sasse’s legislation: Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/sasse-reintroduces-ethics-overhaul"

I want to commend the senior Senator from Arizona for an extraordinary stand of courage and just a great speech on the floor a few minutes ago. Mr. President, I rise today to defend the filibuster again from the latest round of attacks. I did this repeatedly in the last administration, earning the ire and frustration of the president of my own party over and over again as I defended the Senate's purpose, and the supermajority requirements that forge a consensus in a big, broad, diverse continental nation. Today, I rise to defend the filibuster again when it's the president of the other party who's decided to go full demagogue. For his entire career in the Senate, basically, Joe Biden served in this body as long as I've been alive, plus or minus a few years. Joe Biden was a stalwart defender of the filibuster. He said that weakening the filibuster would, ""eviscerate the Senate."" But earlier this week, the President was pushed around by a bunch of rage-addicted 20-somethings on his staff and agreed to go down to Georgia and just read whatever nonsense they loaded into his teleprompter. It was shameful. It was sad. The President of the United States called half of the country a bunch of racist bigots. Think about that. Half the country, a bunch of racist bigots. He doesn't believe that. This was a senile comment of a man who read whatever was loaded into his teleprompter. His speechwriters puppet-mastered him into saying that anyone who disagrees with him is George Wallace. Bull Connor. Jefferson Davis. You disagree with Joe Biden and you're Jefferson Davis. Pretty breathtaking. Equating millions of Americans to some of the ugliest racists in all of American history. That isn't just overheated rhetoric, it's a disgusting smear. Does President Biden really believe this in his heart of hearts? Based on the conversations I've had with him over the years, I don't think he believes this at all. So let's go back to last year. Candidate Joe Biden ran for office promising that he would unify the country. That's why the man was elected because he said that the crap we went through the last four years was wrong. He said he was going to try to unify the country. But now he's decided to surrender to a tiny, little far-left group in the mistaken belief that the loudest voices on Twitter actually represent America. It would be useful for us to pause and recognize the overwhelming majority of all political tweets in America come from less than one and a half percent of Americans. Let's just say that again because there are a bunch of morons around this building who decided to take their Twitter feed as reality. It is not reality. What the President said in Georgia was nonsense and Joe Biden of decades in the U.S. Senate knows that. The president will be coming to Capitol Hill in the next hour. If President Biden really believes that Jim Crow is the same thing as a lot of states who have decided to reconsider some of their Covid expansion policies around voting, Jim Crow and redeliberating about Covid expansions are the same thing, he needs to make that argument in person. If Joe Manchin is really as big a racist as Joe Biden apparently thinks, if Kyrsten Sinema is really a racist, if that’s what animates Kyrsten Sinema in the eyes of Joe Biden, he should have the courage to say that to their faces. He's not going to say that to their faces because he doesn't believe it.Ron Klain has an army of Twitter trolls that he has decided are reality and he has decided to have President Biden become something completely different than the person who ran for office last year or who served for decades in the United States Senate.In fact, if Joe Biden really believes that Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are bigots, why hasn't he called for them to be kicked out of his party. If they're as racist as Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis, why does Joe Biden want them in his party? The stuff he said in Georgia is nonsense and you wouldn't say it to regular Americans in New Jersey or West Virginia or Arizona or Nebraska because it's not true. In fact, if Joe Biden really believes that Lisa Murkowski is George Wallace, if Tim Scott is Bull Connor, if Susan Collins and I are Jefferson Davis, I hope he’d have the guts to come and say it to our faces. But he's not, because this is performative politics, it was nonsense and everybody knows that it goes away after this weekend but Chuck Schumer might have a primary from AOC. So, it's really useful to shift the blame from his disastrous leadership of the Senate over the last 13 months from himself to Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin. That's really what's happening right now.President Biden ought to have the courage to stand up to his own staff and he ought to be enough of a man to apologize to the Senate and to the American people for the nonsense he said in Georgia. The vast majority of what he said violating the Ninth Commandment disparaging people was not would he really believes and he wouldn't say it to me face-to-face.This fiasco is ugly and it was entirely unnecessary. It makes no sense to federalize our elections right now. By the way, you can differ with me about that. You can believe that federalizing all elections is a good idea. It is in our constitutional system. But to demonize people as racist bigots because they're not in favor of federalizing elections, that’s a pretty bizarre leap. But let’s just review a little bit of history. Last year we had a president who disgraced his office by trying to steal an election. What stopped that? Our decentralized state-based systems of elections are what stopped last year's attempt to steal an election. It makes absolutely no sense to try to go into nuclear partisanship now when we should actually be talking about how you prevent another January 6 by doing the hard and actual bipartisan work, not the grandstanding for Twitter, but the hard and bipartisan work of reforming the Electoral Count Act, which is 130 years old and obviously doesn't work that well. We should reform the Electoral Reform Act. This is about subversion of an election, not suppression. There are real problems in our electoral system, and we could be doing work to actually fix that and try to stop the institutional arsonists in Congress who want to build political brands on the wreckage of American institutions.We could do real work. The President decided to do something completely different this week. But here's the silver lining. President Biden, Leader Schumer, and everybody in this body knows that the charade we've been going through the last three days is great for the one and a half percent of people addicted to rage on Twitter. I get it. One and a half percent of people get their jollies out of this. It's bad for America. It's just as undermining of public trust in elections as what Donald Trump did last year, but here's the thing. Everybody going through this charade knows that it dies this weekend. Why? Because members of the Democrats' own conference know that there is no exception to the way the Senate rules work. Every single Senator knows that the filibuster is not going to die this weekend. And every Senator knows that if it would, the nonsense rhetoric about one exception -- it's 'like lose your virginity just once' -- every Senator knows that's not really how it works.Once the filibuster goes for x, it goes for y, and it goes for z. Today it's election centralization. Tomorrow it's gun politics. The next day it's climate debates. Every red-hot issue in American culture and American politics would be in the same exception because every issue would be just as urgent next week, next month, and next year. Fortunately, Senator Manchin knows this. Senator Sinema knows this. And by the way, a whole bunch more colleagues of mine in the Democratic Party also know this. They don't just have as much courage to say it in public as those two. A whole bunch of my colleagues -- I tried to count this morning. It's between 15 and 18 of my colleagues in the Democratic Party have privately told me they regret following Harry Reid over the tribalist cliff in the summer of 2013 for just the one exception of judicial confirmations to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I think 15 to 18 Democrats have privately told me they regret this. Why? Because that one-time exception is now how the entire executive calendar works. And everybody knew when Harry Reid set this place on fire in 2013 that that's what it was going to produce. And the same exact thing would have on the legislative calendar with the supposed one time carve-out from the legislative filibuster. Let's remember what this institution is for. What the Senate is supposed to be about is we're supposed to be the one part of Congress and the one part of the American government that thinks beyond a 24-month window. It is the job of the people who serve in this body, only a hundred people right now and only I think it's 2,100 people across 230-some years of U.S. history. Only 2,000 people have had the honor of serving our states in this body. It's supposed to be our job to take the long-term view. Not just 24 hours of Twitter but we're supposed to think beyond the 24 months of the next election. That's what our job is supposed to be. There are a lot of people around this place who apparently can't think beyond 24 hours right now. That's their right. But they shouldn't be Senators. Because the purpose of this place is supposed to be to take a long-term view. Some of my colleagues are convinced that Americans are polarized because Congress doesn't act more or faster, and they think that the solution is supposedly to eliminate the filibuster. They're kidding themselves. That would not extinguish the fires of red-hot tribalism in this country. It would throw gasoline on them. Addressing the real tribal disease in America requires a Senate that becomes less tribal, not more tribal. Senator Sinema's speech should be commended to every member of this body to go back and read. She said there are two fundamental questions before us today. One is where does the dissent into tribalism in this institution ultimately land? And what can each of us do to stop that? Those are the two big questions that she said should be before us today. Getting rid of the filibuster means this.  It means that you turn one razor-thin majority imposing its will on the American people and on legislation into a pendulum swinging another razor-thin majority, 24 months later, that sweeps all of that aside and jerks the American people around to the opposite legislation of what was just passed. 50-50, 51-50 in today's Senate. And all of it flips 11 months from now and the legislation all gets undone and new legislation gets put in place. Do you really think regular folks in New Jersey and Nebraska want that? Hardly any of them want that. Imagine what the current situation would look like if you have that federally imposed whiplash on our most sensitive issues inside of every 24 months. We think tribalism is bad now? I guarantee you can make it worse and eliminating the filibuster accelerates that dissent into tribalism. There's a place of course where simple majorities rule. It's right down that hallway. We have a House of Representatives already. Does anybody want to make the argument that that place is healthier than we are because it is a simple majoritarian body? No. It is plain to see in an age of hyper-partisanship and social media grandstanding that the House is being more and more ruled by demagogues and dolts. That's not what the Senate is called to do. The Senate is supposed to be a different place. The Senate is supposed to be the place where passions are tempered and refined by people who are responsible for thinking beyond our next election, which is why every election cycle in America only has one-third of senators even up for reelection. That's the whole reason we have six-year terms. If I had my will, I could be king for a day and write some constitutional amendments and pass them, I would have a single 12-year Senate term and everybody would be out of here. A little bit longer than six years, but one term, no reelection, and get back to life, go back to serving in your community. If you get rid of the filibuster, you will turn the Senate into the House and you will ensure that this body, too, ends up consumed by demagogues, conspiracists, and clowns. That's what will happen in this body. The American people don't have time for that crap. Nobody wants that. Americans don't want one-party rule, by the Democrats or by the Republicans. Both of these parties are really crappy. The American people are not fans of these political parties. Getting rid of the filibuster means you don't have to try to talk to people on the other side of the aisle and get to a 60-vote threshold for legislation or a 67-vote threshold for rules changes. It means that one of these two terrible parties gets to do a lot more stuff a lot faster that will inevitably be incredibly unpopular with the American people. American people do not want revolution. They do not want fundamental change. What they want is competence. What they want is more honesty. What they want is less performative grandstanding. Institutions like the Senate provide frameworks and processes for competent, responsible self-government, for more honesty. We're not living up to it right now, but we could live down to something worse, and ending the filibuster would accelerate that. It would accelerate tribalism, it would accelerate people following Senators into bathrooms screaming at them, trying to bully them. It will not lead to more productive compromise legislation that tries to bring along a larger share of the American public. The rules and the norms of this place have been built up over a very long time, and they exist to discourage demagoguery. Putting cameras in every room we're in around here tries to undermine so much of what the Senate is about. I'm for lots of transparency. I'm for pen-and-pad reporters everywhere, but the cameras we have put in this place have encouraged so much demagoguery. That's so much of the problem why we tribalism here and tribalism more broadly in the country and if you eliminate the filibuster, you accelerate all those most destructive short-term performative trends. You encourage more rank partisanship and you discourage consensus, compromise, and collaboration.Friends, please do not, like the President did in Georgia this week, surrender to the angriest voices on social media and the mistaken belief that they reflect the majority of America. They don't. They reflect the majority of Twitter. Political Twitter is like the 9th most popular topic on Twitter. K-pop music is exponentially more popular on Twitter than politics. The share of Americans paying attention to political Twitter bounces around between one-tenth and one-sixth and something like 80 percent of all political tweets come from under 2 percent of the public. We should remind ourselves of that again and again and again because there are people who regularly mistake Twitter with reality and with the American public. We're called to serve the American public. We're not called to serve rage-addicted people on social media.Now, perhaps more than ever, it is our job to stop giving ear to political arsonists who would burn down our institutions and intensify our divisions. Now is the time for us to think together over the long term how we renew those institutions. The filibuster is a part of what can lead us to broader consensus, and eliminating the filibuster will accelerate the political arson around this place and across our land. Senate, we can do better. Thank you, Mr. President.'Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/sasse-defends-filibuster-don-t-surrender-to-the-angriest-voices"

That is who Chairman Xi is. He doesn't believe in the dignity of people. He doesn't believe that they're image-bearers of God. He doesn't believe they have the rights of free speech, religion, press, assembly, and protest. He believes that you must intimidate college students for telling the truth. If they're saying something to a small group of people 6,000 miles away, Chairman Xi is intimidated and he is scared. That student told the truth. We should celebrate that student. Mitch Daniels and Purdue University stood up to that kind of intimidation, we should celebrate that.""Background:  On December 15, President Mitch Daniels sent a letter to the Purdue community condemning the harassment and censorship campaign the Chinese secret police waged against a Purdue graduate student for speaking out.CCP agents intimidated the student’s family and suspended his WeChat account. Then, other Chinese students at Purdue began harassing the student himself and threatened to report him to the Chinese embassy for dissenting from CCP lies about history.Full transcript is available below.  According to ProPublica Reporting, a Purdue student from China, Zhihao Kong, who goes by the nickname Moody, wrote an open letter condemning the Chinese Communist Party for killing dissidents in Tiananmen Square in 1989. We all know the famous image of the man who stood courageously not in front of one tank, most of the images that ran in US newspapers were of one guy in front of a tank, and if you just look at that image you can assume that the tank commander is some nut job, who decided he was going to torment this kid, but if you actually look at the image as you can through US photo archives, and you pan back out, that first tank is one tank in a long, long, long line of tanks, coming, that this man stands courageously in front of. It’s not one tank commander that this guy stands in front of in Tiananmen Square, it is an autocratic government that’s scared to death of the courage of free people. And that man stood courageously as the Chinese Communist Party was murdering students in Tiananmen Square.The Purdue graduate student Moody, decided to write an open letter about that, reminding students in America and around the world of what happened in Tiananmen Square. Well guess what happened next. After Moody published that letter, the Chinese secret police decided to go visit his family and intimidate them, so that they might put pressure on him, asking him, commanding him, coercing him, twisting the arms of his parents and loved ones, to stop talking about the truth about what happened in Tiananmen Square in June of 1989. Well Mr. Kong refused to back down, other Chinese students at Purdue, not Chinese students in Beijing, Chinese students in Purdue, decided that it was their obligation to harass Mr. Kong. They pursued him around campus, and they threatened to report him to the Chinese Embassy. Think about that for a second, what do we think about embassies as for, 200 countries around the face of the earth and when you’re traveling and you have a lost passport, or you suffer some petty crime, or you have a family member who has a medical emergency back home, you call up your embassy for help, because you think that these are people who love you, you’re in a foreign place and you maybe don’t speak the language, and then embassy is there to help you navigate a world where you might not know the language, the laws, or the customs. Well, what happened in the United States, a freedom loving place, is that these Chinese students, Chinese nationals here in school at Purdue, thought that it might be their job to contact the Chinese embassy, to tattle on Mr. Kong, because the man had the courage to tell the truth. He had spoken online, he’d written online, he’d been involved in dissident events. So what happened then, besides his parents being harassed by the Chinese secret police, and besides graduate students following him around to intimidate him and threaten to report him to the embassy, WeChat decided that they need to block and suspend his account to cut off his communications with the outside world. A few days before he was scheduled to speak at a Zoom commemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre, the secret police went to visit his parents again, reminding them that they needed to make sure he put an end to his activism, re truth-telling.It’s convenient for Americans to look the other way and stay silent in the face of this. We’ve seen many American professional sports leagues, we’ve seen Hollywood companies lusting after Chinese middle class markets, we’ve seen the Marriott hotel chain agreeing to intimidate their employees, so that their employees didn’t acknowledge what’s happened in Hong Kong and the threats currently against Taiwan, we’ve seen this censorship using economic statecraft from Beijing to intimidate Americans, and American companies, and American institutions to do their bidding to suppress people who might tell the truth.It's convenient to stay silent. And many of our institutions have pathetically agreed with Beijing that they would self-censor at Beijing and Chairman Xi's bidding. Well, guess who didn't do that. Purdue University decided they were not going to do that. So, there's a lot of bad stuff happening in the world because of the expansionistic desires of the CCP, and we have a lot of Americans and American institutions who are willing to be complicit in the CCP's desired expansionism. But Purdue didn't, and we should pause today just for a minute and celebrate that good news. We should celebrate that courage. Mitch Daniels, former governor of Indiana, current president of Purdue, decided that this was not okay, and it was important to tell the truth about this fact, what had happened, and that this wasn't okay. I'd like to read into the Congressional Record today President Daniel's letter to the Purdue campus 36 hours ago, because we need a hell of a lot more truth-telling like this in American life. Here's Mitch Daniels and the Purdue leadership on behalf of not just Purdue, but American values. ""Dear Purdue students, staff and faculty, Purdue learned from a national news account last week that one of our students, after speaking out on behalf of freedom and others martyred for advocating it, was harassed and threatened by other students from his own home country.  Worse still, his family back home, in this case China, was visited and threatened by agents of that nation’s secret police. We regret that we were unaware at the time of these events and had to learn of them from national sources. That reflects the atmosphere of intimidation that we have discovered surrounds this specific sort of speech. Any such intimidation is unacceptable and unwelcome on our campus.  Purdue has punished less personal, direct and threatening conduct.  Anyone taking exception to the speech in question had their own right to express their disagreement, but not to engage in the actions of harassment which occurred here.  If those students who issued the threats can be identified, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.  Likewise, any student found to have reported another student to any foreign entity for exercising their freedom of speech or belief will be subject to significant sanction. International students are nothing new at Purdue University, which welcomed its first Asian admittees well over a century ago.  We are proud that several hundred international students, nearly 200 of them Chinese, enrolled again this fall.   But joining the Purdue community requires acceptance of its rules and values, and no value is more central to our institution or to higher education generally than the freedom of inquiry and expression.  Those seeking to deny those rights to others, let alone to collude with foreign governments in repressing them, will need to pursue their education elsewhere. Sincerely, Mitch""Mr. President, Chairman Xi is a coward, and he sends his goons to intimidate people for telling the truth. That is who Chairman Xi is. He doesn't believe in the dignity of people. He doesn't believe that they're image-bearers of God. He doesn't believe they have the rights of free speech, religion, press, assembly, and protest. He believes that you must intimidate college students for telling the truth. If they're saying something to a small group of people 6,000 miles away, Chairman Xi is intimidated and he is scared. That student told the truth. We should celebrate that student. Mitch Daniels and Purdue University stood up to that kind of intimidation, we should celebrate that. Because that's what American courage looks like, and we need a whole Hell of a lot more of it. We need a lot more people to look like the Women's Tennis Association, not to look like the NBA. Thank you, Mr. President.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/sasse-praises-mitch-daniels-purdue-for-standing-up-to-the-ccp"

China exports the surveillance technology that undergirds its techno-totalitarian model of governance. The CCP harasses and surveilles dissidents and other human rights activists outside of China. In some cases, the government has punished these activists’ families in China for their criticism of Xi Jinping and the CCP.” “The election of a PRC security official to Interpol’s Executive Committee would present a grave threat to the organization’s integrity and threaten to turn legitimate inter-governmental law enforcement cooperation into another tool of CCP transnational repression.” “As one of Interpol’s largest contributors, is the U.S. government considering withholding or reducing U.S. voluntary contributions to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not inadvertently funding transnational repression and to more effectively communicate that the United States will not accept Interpol’s endorsement and facilitation of CCP harassment and surveillance of dissidents in the U.S. and across the globe?  If not, why not?” The full letter can be found here. Full text of the letter below: Dear Secretary Blinken and Attorney General Garland:With the 89th International Criminal Police Organization General Assembly scheduled to open November 23, I write to raise my profound concern over the potential election of Hu Binchen, a senior official in the People’s Republic of China Ministry of Public Security, to Interpol’s Executive Committee.Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the Chinese Communist Party has adopted increasingly ruthless tactics to silence dissidents, human rights lawyers, religious leaders, and most recently, prominent athletes, who protest and expose the rot at the CCP’s core.  PRC security officials are cracking down on democracy activists in Hong Kong, repressing Tibetans, and committing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.  The PRC’s repressive tactics extend beyond its borders.  China exports the surveillance technology that undergirds its techno-totalitarian model of governance.  The CCP harasses and surveils dissidents and other human rights activists outside of China.  In some cases, the government has punished these activists’ families in China for their criticism of Xi Jinping and the CCP.The election of a PRC security official to Interpol’s Executive Committee would present a grave threat to the organization’s integrity and threaten to turn legitimate inter-governmental law enforcement cooperation into another tool of CCP transnational repression.The PRC has a history of abusing its influence with Interpol by using “red notice” alerts – alerts to police about internationally wanted fugitives – to target political opponents.  In 1997, Interpol issued a red notice for the arrest of World Uyghur Congress President Dolkun Isa, which it only rescinded in 2018.  In 2017, Interpol issued a red notice for the arrest of Idris Hasan, a Uyghur man living in Turkey, which it rescinded following Hasan’s arrest in Morocco earlier this year.  In both cases, Interpol only withdrew the red notices following international public pressure.Hu’s potential election to the Interpol Executive Committee threatens to yet again draw Interpol into the CCP’s domestic politics.  After he was elected President of Interpol in 2016, then-PRC Vice Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei disappeared in 2018 on a trip to China, depriving the organization of its senior leadership.  While he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 13 years in prison, his wife (Grace Meng) has dismissed the accusations as a “political disagreement being turned into a criminal affair.”  Regardless of the truth of these allegations, Interpol, like most international organizations, would be better served by minimizing the effect that the CCP’s internal politics could have on its leadership and operations.Given China’s increasingly authoritarian policies at home, transnational repression abroad, and the potential for Xi Jinping’s murky and opaque domestic politics to affect the organization’s integrity, I hope that Interpol member countries see the wisdom in looking elsewhere for leadership.  In the event that they do not, I have several questions:Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/11/sasse-warns-biden-administration-of-china-s-threat-to-interpol"

Today’s action taken by the Senators guarantees a vote on the Senate floor. The rule was transmitted to the Senate on November 16th, setting up a floor vote as soon as early December.“President Biden’s vaccine mandate is constitutional slop – unelected bureaucrats at OSHA don’t have the power to do this,"" said Senator Sasse. ""I’m pro-vaccine but these mandates aren’t going to beat the pandemic – they’re going to grow government and erode trust in these near-miracle drugs. Nebraskans deserve better.”Background:On September 8, President Joe Biden announced vaccine mandates that extend to 80 million private sector workers and additional mandates on millions of federal workers and contractors.To implement this mandate, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS). Employers that fail to comply will be fined $13, 653 for each offense and willful violations will result in a $136,532 penalty. This rule places unrealistic compliance burdens on employers—especially during a time where business and supply chains are already under duress. For example, 30 days after publication, all requirements other than testing for employees must be in place. In addition, 60 days after publication, all testing requirements must be in place.The Congressional Review Act (CRA) can be used by Congress to overturn certain federal agency regulations and actions through a joint resolution of disapproval. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential veto, the rule at issue is invalidated.Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/11/sasse-joins-republican-senators-to-challenge-biden-s-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses"

Democrats used to talk about ‘safe, legal, and rare' but now — in a move that’s wildly out of touch with public opinion — they’re endorsing virtually-limitless, on-demand abortion through all nine months of pregnancy and they’re overruling any state-level restrictions to the contrary. Speaker Pelosi isn’t protecting Roe, she’s dramatically expanding Roe to help the abortion industry’s bottom line. These scorched-earth tactics are dead on arrival in the Senate.” Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/9/sasse-statement-on-pro-abortion-extremism"

But I want to make it clear that I'm not here to talk about this because I'm obsessed about the marginal tax rates for the top 1% of Americans – I’m not. It's not why I ran for office, but I am here today to talk about this because as a China hawk, I am obsessed with the fact that the American people, the American government, American technology companies and lots of companies that aren't today thought of as technology companies but will increasingly be technology companies operating in different vertices. I am obsessed with the fact that our firms and our people are going to need to be able to compete with the Chinese Communist Party. The future of everything from technology, to trade, to global security and defense issues is going to go one of two ways. It's either going to be led by the Chinese Communist Party or it's going to be led by the United States and our allies and western values. The future of not just global economics but global security policy over the next three, and five, and seven, and ten years is going to be radically shaped by which direction we go. Failure isn’t an option. This next century is going to be defined either by oppression, censorship, and brutality - the sort of things that we're seeing in Xinjiang right now as the Uyghurs are brutally oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party - or we're going to see a world that's led by western values and beliefs in trade, and human rights, and open navigation of the seaways, and transparent contracts, and the rule of law. That’s the proper context in which we should be considering this taxing and spending debate and it would be helpful for the American people if we would discuss President Biden’s tax and spending spree in the context of that global technology and diplomatic competition with the CCP. Because these dangerous policies in this $3.5 trillion - or whatever price tag it's going to end up at - this piece of omnibus legislation, it's going to hurt our ability to compete against Beijing.Spending is out of control. The American people last November - just ten months ago - elected an evenly divided Senate and yet somehow progressives believe they have a mandate to radically remake America. You actually hear a lot of them use language about radically transforming American as if an American public that voted for a 50-50 Senate was voting for some sort of radical re-making of American policy as a newer, new, bigger, big New Deal. They’ve spent trillions of dollars that we don’t have already this year and now they’re looking at add another $3.5 trillion to expand cradle-to-grave government propositions about how government should interfere and interact with the average American's life. But, what is government? What a government is supposed to be is a compact for the common defense. The first and most fundamental principle the government exists to do is make sure that everyone is free from violence and chaos and tyranny so that they can organize their lives in local communities. That's the first thing government is supposed to be and yet we also believe that government has some social safety net responsibilities. Stated in a summary fashion, you might say the government is supposed to be the army and we also have some social safety net insurance programs attached to them. It seems like, when you listen to Senator Sanders speak, he thinks of it exactly the opposite. The government is a giant insurance company that just happens to own a navy. And sometimes it sounds like he doesn't even really care if we own a navy, he just conceives of the government as a giant insurance program where everything is compulsory and government decides what programs people need to have and what services they want. The vast majority of the American people don't want that and they didn't vote for that and a 50-50 Senate shouldn't be trying to deliver that. This year the President and my Democratic colleagues have increased spending in every area: social, environmental, and economic policy related. If there’s an opportunity to spend over the course of the last eight and a half months, they’ve taken it. A couple trillion here, a couple trillion there and pretty soon you're talking about real money.Now it’s the time to pay the piper and my colleagues are talking about raising taxes. But this is not just any tax hike we're talking about  - when you look at the corporate rate that we're looking at, we would be talking about the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world - these are just the new taxes - and yet even that doesn't pay for all of the new spending. So, we're talking about new legislation that would radically raise taxes to the highest corporate tax rates in the industrial earth and yet still not pay for all of the new spending they're talking about. So, while deficits grow forever, opportunities shrink. We have a member of the House of Representatives who in her super telegenic way figured out how to get attention last week by wearing a dress that said ""tax the rich"" on the back of it. What the dress should really read is ""tax the young"" because history tells us very clearly when you deficit spend at the level that they're talking about doing here, this is a tax of current, older, and wealthier people against younger people. That's how inflation works, that's how debt and deficit work. The dress should have read ""tax the young.""These are tax hikes that make Communist China a much better business environment than the United States. Under the President’s plan, Americans would have a 32% combined rate compared to a much smaller Chinese tax rate. At their baseline, nominal level but it's important to recognize that the Chinese tax code currently incentivizes high-tech businesses with an even lower 15% rate, so we’re talking about north of a 30% rate against the Chinese Communist party trying to make sure they attract investment by taxing their investment and digital companies at a 15% rate. This is the definition of shooting yourself in the foot. My friends on the other side of the aisle are a lot of smart folks, and they know that tax rates actually matter for international investment and for competitiveness. And one of the ways you know they know is because for months, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been out seeking a global minimum tax arrangement, she is admitting the obvious truth that a new tax increase will saddle American companies with a burden that other companies across the globe don't have. The CCP is not going to bail us out as we would potentially raise taxes to the highest rates in the world by also raising their tax rates to bail out President Biden’s domestic agenda. Beijing looks at our endless debt, our entitlement crisis, and our tax hikes, at our disunity, and they see a strategic advantage. These China-friendly tax hikes would raise the cost of doing business in America. These China-friendly tax hikes would drive innovation overseas. These China-friendly tax hikes would lead to more corporate inversions. These China-friendly tax hikes would hurt American R&D. If you want the 21st Century to be defined by global Chinese Communist Party leadership, you would tax and spend just like this legislation seeks to do. Reckless spending doesn’t steward a great nation. Super tax hikes do not promote innovation. Competition with the Chinese Communist Party is the defining national-security issue of our time – whether my colleagues in this body want to admit it on a regular basis or not. While the Chinese Communist Party plunders American intellectual property, steals American ingenuity, and pours investments into their state-run technologies, Washington is debating whether or not we should punish innovative firms and innovative Americans. This isn’t strong. This isn’t smart. The American people know better.  Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/9/sasse-china-friendly-tax-hikes-hurt-americans"

His platitudes about women's rights don’t protect the Taliban’s rape victims. His throwaway lines about ‘relentless diplomacy’ don't comfort the hundreds of American citizens and thousands of American green card holders he left behind. His empty promise to ‘stand up for our allies’ doesn’t stop a single beheading. The President’s happy talk remains disconnected from reality.”Permalink: https://www.sasse.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/9/sasse-biden-administration-s-foreign-policy-is-bumper-sticker-garbage"
