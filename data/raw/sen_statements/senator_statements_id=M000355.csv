https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/mcconnell-statement-on-government-funding,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issue the following statement this afternoon regarding government funding:“As I have said for weeks, there has been a clear and simple path to fund the government: A clean continuing resolution negotiated by Senators Shelby and Leahy, without any extraneous partisan language jammed in. I am glad that Leader Schumer and Senator Manchin abandoned their attempt to jam in a phony, partisan fig leaf on ‘permitting reform’ and I look forward to a bipartisan funding bill coming to the floor.“Republicans strongly support real permitting reform. We are leading the charge against the liberal overreach and red tape that make it much too hard to build things, create jobs, and unleash American energy. That is why we support the strong reform bill championed by Senator Capito.“Democrats’ phony fig leaf was not even close to real permitting reform. The bill was carefully written to avoid making any of the meaningful changes that liberal special interests oppose. A number of provisions would have made existing problems even worse. The weak language was meant to create the illusion of doing something while draining political will for the actual reform our country needs. But the Senate saw through the political game.“Halfhearted Democratic support for this phony fig leaf was a stunningly low price for a Senator to approve yet another massive reckless taxing and spending spree in the middle of an economic crisis for American families.”###"

The pain gets worse every single time they have to fill a shopping cart or pay their credit card bill.“One mother of young sons in my hometown of Louisville put it this way, ‘My grocery bill has went up a lot. It’s terrible right now. I have to be really strategic on how I plan out the whole month to make sure we have enough money.’“Of course Kentuckians aren’t the only ones in this predicament.“In Nevada, an office worker recently told reporters, ‘I’ve not been buying a lot of things because I can’t afford it. I’m like, ‘The kids don’t need juice for school anymore. We’ll just do water.’’“In Arizona, so many families are having to make tough choices at the grocery store, many are accepting charity to keep food on the table. According to an employee of one food bank in Phoenix, ‘The impact we are seeing day in and day out continues to go up. The families are stressed.’“And who can blame them, Madam President? Food inflation in America is at a more than four-decade high!“Bread is 16.2% more expensive than it was a year ago. Milk is up 17%. Flour is up 23.3%. And eggs are going for nearly 40% more.“Week after week, feeding a family has become a stressful proposition for millions of Americans. And every extra dollar spent on groceries is one fewer to spare for soaring electricity bills.“In the suburbs of Las Vegas, residents have commiserated over the astronomical cost of keeping their homes cool this summer. One neighborhood message board reads like this: ‘My bill for this month will be $574… it’s insane.’ ‘Yes, ours was $800 for June.’“In Arizona, a restaurant worker didn’t mince words about scraping together enough to keep the lights and AC on. ‘If I didn’t have roommates, I wouldn’t be able to make it on the salary that I have.’“Overall inflation in Phoenix and Atlanta is way, way higher than even the sky-high national average. The country as a whole is still grappling with inflation over 8%, but Phoenix has seen a staggering 13% inflation in just the last year, and Atlanta has seen nearly 12%.“Of course, for working Americans in some other states, the most acute emergency is not the cost of summer cooling, but rather the cost of winter heating.“In places like New Hampshire and Vermont where many homes burn heating oil, this important price is up more than 91% since President Biden took office.“And in every corner of the country, one of the biggest collective headaches facing working families with young kids is the rising cost of the back-to-school shopping list.“According to one working mother in Pennsylvania, she had to take items like a backpack for her pre-schooler out of her shopping cart in the checkout line. ‘It’s been at least 20 years since I have had to pull back to this extent. This is a new and humbling experience for me as an adult.’“Madam President, American families are facing math problems that just don’t add up.“Meanwhile, the same Washington Democrats who got them into this mess spent Tuesday celebrating having rammed through a party-line bill that does nothing to help them solve it.“Hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending, just as working families are having the hardest time in decades making ends meet at home.“Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars that wouldn’t even accomplish Democrats’ own underlying radical climate goals, let alone the false claims of ‘Inflation Reduction’ on the cover.“So our economy continues to hand working families a raw deal. But the same day this latest awful inflation report was published, Washington Democrats went to a concert at the White House and celebrated their economic policies!“How much more out-of-touch does it get?“The Democrats’ giant inflationary spiral is costing the average American household $460 extra every single month just to buy the same things they bought last year. President Biden and his government have imposed a silent Democrat Inflation Tax of $460 every single month!“In Kentucky, the average household has to pay $608 more a month — well over $7,000 a year — just to stay where they were when President Biden was sworn in.“Americans’ real wages — their purchasing power — has plummeted since this all-Democrat government was sworn in.“And the Democrats’ response? Print and spend hundreds of billions more; make Americans without bachelor’s degrees pay off the graduate school debt of doctors and lawyers; and throw themselves a party on the White House Lawn.“Our colleagues across the aisle created this human catastrophe.“This runaway inflation was a policy choice by Democrats.“And they aren’t even trying to stop it.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/democrats-ignoring-americans-top-concern"
http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/newsletters?ContentRecord_id=7E7FA33A-2ADB-4554-8420-2926028E5F2C,"This August, I traveled our state to meet with Kentuckians and discuss the most pressing issues facing our Commonwealth. In conversations with families, workers, and business owners, one concern overrode all others: inflation.Across our country, Americans are saying that runaway costs are their top worry. The most recent CPI report shows inflation remains stubbornly high. But amazingly, as Congress returns to Washington this September, the Democrats who run the House, Senate, and White House have no plans to tamp down our forty-year high inflation rate.Instead, they’ve spent the first two years of President Biden’s term pushing through hundreds of billions of dollars of wasteful spending. Most recently, they passed the absurdly named Inflation Reduction Act, which economists have lambasted for having no significant effect on inflation whatsoever.Rather, the bill is a handout to Washington Democrats’ preferred special interest groups: $80 billion to supersize the IRS and audit more taxpayers, billions of dollars in slush funds for “environmental justice” groups, huge tax credits for the few Americans who can afford expensive electric vehicles, and massive subsidies to expand Obamacare coverage to six-figure earners. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, its impact on inflation over the next few years will be “negligible.”To cap off his summer of reckless spending, President Biden transferred the student loan debt held by doctors, lawyers, and other high-earners to working families, costing taxpayers as much as $1 trillion in the process. This huge giveaway is a slap in the face to everyone who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid what they owed, and every American who chose a certain career path or served in our Armed Forces to avoid taking on debt. It will also almost certainly add to inflation.Clearly, Washington Democrats have decided it’s politically advantageous to simply ignore inflation, hoping the problem goes away while they use their narrow congressional majorities to reward tax dollars to political allies. Kentuckians don’t have the luxury of avoiding the issue. Since President Biden took office, prices in the Commonwealth have spiked 13%.For the average Kentucky household, that price increase translates to $608 in additional spending every month, or $7,297 every year. Higher prices are drowning out any wage increases Kentuckians might see.Washington Democrats are grasping at straws to defend their economic leadership, pointing to our tight labor market and slightly moderating gas prices to claim our country is “stronger economically than we have been in history.” That assertion is detached from reality. In addition to facing record inflation, Kentucky still has 19,000 fewer workers than before the pandemic, and our drivers are paying well over a dollar more per gallon of gas than before President Biden took office.Kentuckians want real solutions, not more political spin. During my visits to our state, I heard directly from constituents harmed by Washington Democrats’ economic failures.I talked to business leaders like those at the Kentucky Association of Manufacturers who, under different conditions, would be powering our recovery. Instead, many are struggling to find enough workers just to meet consumer demand.I heard from farmers in Hopkinsville who have seen the price of energy skyrocket, raising the cost of everything from fuel to fertilizer. Now, Americans everywhere are paying higher prices at the grocery store.I spoke to folks in Eastern Kentucky who are still reeling from this summer’s floods. They would like to begin rebuilding damaged homes as quickly as possible, but supply chain issues and increased material costs are hamstringing the recovery process.These are the people Washington Democrats are ignoring when they return to Congress without legislation to fight inflation. Republicans know how to solve our problem: stop the reckless spending fueling price increases, end irresponsible subsidies for liberal special interest groups, and unleash American energy producers to make our country energy independent again. But the Democrats who run our government refuse to do any of that for fear of angering their political base.In Kentucky and across the country, Americans are communicating loudly and clearly that they want cheaper groceries, lower gas prices, and affordable electricity. With the plans they’ve set for the rest of this Congress, Democrats are communicating that they simply do not care.###Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is the Senate Republican Leader.Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/the-democrats-who-run-washington-have-no-plans-to-fight-inflation"

While the Dow Jones plummeted over a thousand points, while the S&P 500 lost more than 4% of its value in one day, while American families can’t afford gas, groceries, or electricity, Washington Democrats partied on the White House lawn to celebrate their policies.“This is what Democrats do while our economy crumbles.

Just last weekend, my home state of Kentucky experienced a spate of murders and attempted murders that rattled residents and overwhelmed police.“Lexington saw four separate shooting incidents on Saturday night alone, leaving nine hurt, some with life-threatening injuries.“A Lexington Police Department veteran described it as ‘a pretty much unprecedented night in my 20 years.’“Officers were so tied up that they were unable to respond to other crimes and disorder.“Louisville also saw a flurry of violence: the second-highest number of homicides in one weekend this year. Six people murdered in just three days.“Both cities documented record homicide numbers last year and Lexington is on track to do so again. For Louisville, this is the third consecutive year of triple-digit killings.“Of course, this crisis isn’t just hitting Kentucky. These trends are nationwide.“For years, the far left has impugned the motives and honor of police officers and taken aim at their funding.“For years, top liberal donors have poured money into the campaigns of radical district attorneys in big cities whose whole stated agenda is to not prosecute crimes.“For years, Democratic elites have pushed for letting violent criminals out of prison. Democrats just nominated and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice who argued as a D.C. District Judge that “COVID justified letting every single prisoner in Washington D.C. custody out of jail and back onto the streets.“This has been an intentional, strategic campaign from the far left.“And now Americans are being robbed, carjacked, assaulted, and murdered. Their families are being poisoned with illegal drugs.“Just a few weeks ago, Senator Rubio gave the Senate a vote to increase funding for fighting crime and keeping dangerous criminals locked up.“Every Senate Republican obviously supported this. But every Democrat joined on party lines to block it.“Later today, our colleagues from Tennessee will hold a press conference to discuss the horrifying case of Eliza Fletcher, a 34-year-old mom and teacher in Memphis whom a career criminal forced into an S.U.V. and murdered while she was out for her morning run.“The suspect had multiple violent crimes on his rap sheet dating back to age 14 and had just been let out of prison early for a prior kidnapping.“There are far too many tragic stories like Eliza Fletcher’s being written every day and every week across this country.“Entire neighborhoods have become unwalkable. In many places public transit has become nearly unusable.“A few months ago the Washington Post profiled one day in the life of a female immigrant bus driver in Denver who gets screamed at and threatened by lunatics on a daily basis.“Just yesterday a 49-year-old was stabbed in the back while riding the subway in New York City after he asked another passenger to quiet down.“Our Democratic friends like to talk about fairness and compassion.“There is nothing fair or compassionate about letting cities descend into violence and chaos. There is nothing fair or compassionate about legislating like career criminals deserve fifth and sixth chances more than young mothers deserve the right to go out for a morning jog and come home alive.“Stable prices, reliable energy, secure borders, and basic public safety are four of the most basic duties that any government in a civilized country owes its citizens.“These things are the absolute minimum that American families ought to be able to count on. The bare minimum.“And the Democrats’ one-party government cannot deliver it.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/violent-crime-sweeps-kentucky-and-america-on-democrats-watch"

But western countries can help by stepping up the pace of our collective assistance.“Ukraine’s hard-won successes on the battlefield could have come even earlier if the Biden Administration — and European allies that take their cues from Washington — had been quicker and more proactive to deliver the capabilities Ukraine needed.“Ukrainian forces are working wonders with Western equipment. They’ve quickly integrated cutting-edge systems like HIMARS and Javelin and Stinger missiles.“The West’s hesitance to put these capabilities in the right hands has cost lives. Horrors could have been avoided if the Biden Administration and our European partners hadn’t been self-deterred from providing these tools sooner.“The Ukrainians need more of the weapons we’ve been giving them, they need to start getting them faster, and they also need new capabilities like longer-range ATACMS, larger drones, and tanks.“Not all of these weapons need to come from America. But make no mistake: our allies are looking to us for signals.“President Biden should be clear with western Europe about the need for them to make meaningful, specific contributions to Ukraine — and fast.“He should also be clear with our allies that our defense holiday is over. It is time for all of us to rebuild our militaries and defense industrial bases.“This will take urgent investments, regulatory reform, and prioritization to expand our capacity to produce critical munitions and systems.“These short- and long-term steps alike are in Europe’s vital interests, America’s vital interests, and the entire free world’s.“Beijing, Tehran, and other authoritarian regimes cannot think for one minute that trampling free peoples’ sovereignty will go unpunished.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/mcconnell-on-ukraine-s-progress-and-needed-next-steps"

As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator McConnell has worked with Congressman Rogers to help direct more than $76 million to Kentucky’s Appalachian communities through this ARC fund. As Eastern Kentucky recovers from flooding over the summer, these resources will help the region secure clean and reliable drinking water.The grants announced today include:“I worked with Congressman Rogers to establish and fund a program within the Appalachian Regional Commission to promote water resource development in Eastern Kentucky because I know how important it is for our Appalachian communities to have fresh water,” said Senator McConnell. “As Eastern Kentucky recovers from devastating floods, residents need reliable drinking water now more than ever. These four grants will connect new homes and businesses to clean water resources and help Kentucky’s Appalachian communities get back on their feet after this summer’s disaster.” “This funding couldn’t come at a better time. As our communities prepare to clean up and rebuild from severe flooding, we must secure safe and reliable drinking water in our communities. Our aging water systems need significant upgrades across Eastern Kentucky, and these grants will go a long way to shore up water resources in Leslie and Knott Counties,” said Congressman Hal Rogers, Dean of the U.S. House of Representatives. “Senator McConnell and I have worked diligently to protect ARC funding over the years to help support our communities most-in-need.” “This summer’s flooding pummeled Hazard and revealed the longstanding infrastructure issues facing our community, especially related to our water system. As our city recovers from this natural disaster, the grant we received thanks to Senator McConnell and Congressman Rogers’s work will help us overhaul our water treatment capabilities and prepare better for the future. This will help us bounce back more quickly and attract the business development we need going forward,” said Hazard Mayor Donald “Happy” Mobelini. “Senator McConnell and Congressman Rogers have done a great service for Leslie County, helping us receive significant federal investment to improve our water services. Our current water treatment infrastructure is unable to provide for everyone in our community. With the grant announced today, we will be able to increase our water system’s efficiency and extend much-needed services to new households and businesses,” said Leslie County Judge-Executive William Lewis. “Today’s grant announcement is great news for Knott County and adds to the significant investment Senator McConnell and Congressman Rogers have already helped secure to improve our water infrastructure.

The topline inflation rate was expected to fall. Instead, yet again, the opposite happened. Overall inflation was up even higher.“Prices this past August were still 8.3% higher than they were in August 2021. Just a catastrophically high inflation rate.“Food prices went up another 0.8% just this past month alone.“Overall food prices just logged their biggest one-year increase since the late 1970s.“Groceries in particular are now 13.5% more expensive than they were at this time last year. Democrats’ policies are sucker-punching American families every time they set foot in a checkout line.“Eggs are up 40%. Butter is up 25%. Baby food is up 13%. Chicken, dairy, bread, cereal, and canned fruits and vegetables are all up around 16% each. Coffee is up even more than that.“Housing and shelter costs were up. Medical costs were up. Furniture was up. New cars were up.“Electricity costs were way, way up — a 15.8% increase since last year. Let me say that again. Inflation on Americans’ electric bills alone is 15.8% in just the last 12 months. That is the largest one-year increase in electricity prices since 1981 — when the statistic was looking back into the final months of Jimmy Carter.“Even if you take out energy and food prices, two areas where the Administration likes to pass the buck and pretend they are powerless, inflation skyrocketed 0.6% in just the month of August alone. “8.3% inflation, Mr. President. Just an astonishing number. And remember, this figure only looks back 12 months, but we are now more than 12 months into the Democrats’ inflation spiral.“Prices are 8.3% higher today than in August 2021, but remember, in August 2021, the baseline, we were already talking about runaway inflation!“Prices were already way up compared to the year before that.“So the 12-month number dramatically understates the total damage that Democrats have caused.“Here’s the comparison that matters most to American families, especially with an election in less than two months: How are things today compared to January 2021, when this all-Democrat government was sworn in?“Here’s the answer. Food prices are up a total of 13.9% since President Biden was sworn in. Gas prices are up 58.5%. Electricity costs are up 21.6%. And the overall, across-the-board inflation rate since President Biden took office is a catastrophic 12.5%.“This very day, President Biden and Democrats are having a big celebration for their latest reckless spending bill, which they pretended would reduce inflation, but which nonpartisan experts say will actually make it worse.“They could not look more out of touch if they tried.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/democrats-inflation-keeps-pummeling-families-with-worse-than-expected-report"

They’re up more than 200% in just the latest month on record.“These are not the signs of a secure border. And the American people know it. An outright majority of the country disapproves of how President Biden’s been handling this issue. The Vice President’s claims aren’t fooling anyone.“For years now, this crisis has stretched border communities to the breaking point and caused ripples throughout the entire country. All the while, Democrats have claimed it would be cruel or uncompassionate to have a functioning southern border or enforce our laws.“Now, in recent weeks, the country has been treated to one of the more striking displays of irony we’ve seen in a long time.“For many years, while the citizens and local governments on the border have cried out for help and law enforcement, various Democrat-run cities and states that aren’t on our border decided to set themselves up as virtue-signaling ‘sanctuary cities’ where immigration law supposedly did not apply.“For years, much of the political left has suggested there are no legitimate practical reasons why a country would want secure borders or to enforce its immigration laws. Only racism or xenophobia could explain it.“Well, for several weeks now, some of these overwhelmed states have decided to try taking some of these Democrat-run jurisdictions at their word.“Governor Abbott in Texas and Governor Ducey in Arizona have put a very small proportion of the illegal immigrants pouring into their states onto buses bound for the self-advertised ‘sanctuary cities’ of New York City and Washington D.C.“And you know what? Just this very small taste of the chaos, this tiny sliver of what many places in America have been dealing with for years, have these cities’ Democratic Party leaders outraged, anxious, and scrambling.“Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, has only had to receive in five weeks roughly the number of people that CBP encounters in seven or eight hours.“New York has had over a month to handle a fraction of one day’s share of border crossings.“And yet the Mayor says having to deal with this is, ‘horrific.’ New York City officials complain that they are overwhelmed.“Here in Washington D.C., the destination for fewer than eight thousand illegal immigrants, the Democratic Mayor has declared a public health emergency. She begged the Pentagon to send in the National Guard for help; the Defense Department turned her down.“It’s incredible, Mr. President, just how quickly Democrats change their tune when they have to stomach one single spoonful of the policies they’ve been force-feeding the rest of our country.“Oh, it’s challenging to have waves of illegal immigrants pouring into your community? This creates challenges for housing and medical care and resource allocation and law enforcement? Who knew?“As one former mayor from the front lines of this crisis put it recently, quote: ‘The city of McAllen was able to deal with thousands of immigrants a day. I think they can handle a few hundred.’“Maybe this will be the wakeup call the Democrats need to finally understand that functional nations need functional borders.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/as-illegal-immigration-and-fentanyl-break-records-vice-president-harris-calls-border-secure"

Sometimes, I wish I could give them more.’ But the back-to-school rush isn’t the only headache facing working families.“Since President Biden and this all-Democrat government took office, prices on grocery store essentials — from meat to produce — have seen double digit percentage increases.“Some household items like furniture are over 20% more expensive than they were on Inauguration Day. The diesel fuel that moves practically everything through the supply chain and onto store shelves is up nearly 80% since President Biden put his hand on that Bible.“Households’ electric bills are up an average of 20% since January 2021. Commuting and running errands costs more with gasoline up nearly 70%. And as fall and winter approach, homes that burn fuel oil are set to be more than 75% more expensive to keep warm.“The American people know who created this mess. They remember quite well how Washington Democrats spent the spring of 2021 dining out on left-wing spending and leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab. And poll after poll has shown they’re overwhelmingly dissatisfied with what President Biden and his party have done about it since.“One survey has found five consecutive times that more than 70% of Americans say our country is headed in the wrong direction.“But that hasn’t stopped Washington Democrats from calling the same disastrous play over and over again. For months, our colleagues’ primary focus was on repeating the mistake they made in 2021.“And in August, on a party-line vote, they did just that. In the teeth of the worst inflation in over 40 years, every single Democrat in Congress voted to ram through hundreds of billions of dollars more in liberal spending.“The American people’s top concern is runaway costs.“And the supply chain crisis could get even worse, much worse, in the next few days — if Democrats let their far-left Big Labor allies engage in massive railway worker strikes that would hammer the economy even further.“But Washington Democrats’ top concerns appear to be quite different.“They prioritized waging war on affordable American energy in a bill that will have no meaningful impact on global temperatures.“They prioritized inflating the IRS with $80 billion to audit more American citizens, without a word of accountability for when tax collectors allow confidential information to become a political weapon.“Madam President, even the supposed reason for the spending package, ‘inflation reduction,’ is utter nonsense. Nonpartisan experts have concluded that what Washington Democrats did last month will not meaningfully reduce inflation at all, and will actually make it worse in the near term.“This is what Democrats decided to put first for the better part of a year. And it’s what they’re now trying to peddle to the American people as a victory.“But the American people don’t want tens of billions of dollars in wish fulfillment for climate activists. They want affordable gas and electricity.“The American people don’t want a bloated IRS. They want stronger support for law enforcement at the southern border and in their communities.“Washington Democrats have consistently misunderstood what the American people have asked them to do. They’ve repeatedly ignored the basic challenges they created for working families.“When the American people’s priorities and Washington Democrats’ priorities have diverged, this government has put the people last at every turn.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/democrats-ignore-economic-challenges-they-created-for-americans"

Senator McConnell helped secure $3.2 billion for the INFRA program in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed Congress last year with the Senator’s support, and which the President signed into law last November. Senator McConnell also wrote to Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg in support of the Green River Area Development District’s grant application.The current Rockport Bridge is over one hundred years old and serves as the Paducah & Louisville Railway’s main rail line in Ohio County, servicing more than 110,000 freight carloads annually. It forms a critical link in the supply chains that deliver military equipment to Fort Knox, coal to Louisville Gas & Electric, and raw materials to manufacturers all along the railroad’s 260-mile span.The Green River Area Development District will use the grant announced today to rehabilitate the Rockport Railroad Bridge by replacing its deck, improving the approaches to the bridge, and upgrading the electrical and mechanical components that allow the bridge to rise and accommodate river traffic.“We are thrilled with today’s announcement and thank Senator McConnell for his support of our grant application and the bipartisan infrastructure bill that funded the critical INFRA grant program. The Rockport Railroad Bridge has been a longstanding issue in our area, impacting Kentucky’s entire freight transportation network. We are excited to see this bridge project move forward and bring future economic development to our region,” said Joanna Shake, Green River Area Development District Executive Director.Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/mcconnell-secures-more-than-17-3-million-to-rehabilitate-the-green-river-s-rockport-railroad-bridge"

His own experts made it clear that a hasty retreat from counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan would lead to the collapse of the Afghan government.“Those warnings fell on deaf ears. 13 American servicemembers died fulfilling the Biden Administration’s rushed evacuation.“The Taliban now rules again in Kabul, as it did before U.S. forces arrived.“Now, one year on from last August’s disaster, the devastating scale of the fallout from President Biden’s decision has come into sharper focus.“Afghanistan has become a global pariah. Its economy has shrunk by nearly a third. Half of its population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity.“Afghan women and girls have had their rights to work, attend school, and live independently torn away under Taliban rule.“And just as we feared, just as was predicted, Afghanistan is again becoming a serious haven for terrorists.“The recent American strike that took out al-Qaeda’s leader, al-Zawahiri, is a credit to decades of work by the professionals of our intelligence community.“But the fact that a terrorist kingpin felt comfortable in Kabul just months after America’s withdrawal is a damning condemnation of the Biden Administration’s unjustified confidence that the Taliban could be trusted not to lay out the welcome mat for our most consequential terrorist enemies. “The strike was a success, but the underlying fact that President Biden’s policies led this top terrorist to set up shop with impunity right in downtown Kabul is a colossal failure.“In fact, just weeks before the strike that killed Zawahiri, when the Administration already knew full well that the Taliban government and senior Haqqani terrorists were harboring him, the Administration still released another hardened terrorist from Guantanamo and returned him into the Taliban’s waiting arms.“Al-Qaeda is rebuilding under the patronage of the Taliban and the Haqqanis. There is no question that so-called ‘over-the-horizon’ counterterrorism operations are becoming much more difficult. Senior Administration officials have acknowledged that our intelligence about the growing threat is drying up. So is our ability to combat it.“And the damage, the fallout, isn’t limited just to Afghanistan itself. “America’s reckless abandonment has done lasting damage to the coalition partnerships that had made our operations there so successful.“President Biden showed America’s allies we couldn’t be trusted or reasoned with. And he showed our adversaries the weakness of our resolve.“There is no question in my mind that Russian, Chinese, and Iranian leaders watched us retreat in Afghanistan and were emboldened. “I advised three consecutive Presidents not to withdraw from Afghanistan. I believed a small residual presence was sustainable and would help us keep pressure on the terrorists and protect our homeland. General Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM Commander during the withdrawal, has said repeatedly that he voiced the same view to President Biden.“But even now, a year after the President’s orders were carried out, the Biden Administration continues to shirk accountability and responsibility.“The fact their haphazard scramble required an unprecedented airlift was not a success. It was a failure.“The fact that over a year later, the Administration still cannot really account for who they brought into our country, while both Americans and vulnerable Afghan partners still remain in Afghanistan as we speak, is not a success.“It is a failure.“President Biden has rejected practically every part of his predecessor’s agenda, foreign and domestic, but he pretends he was somehow powerless to alter the previous Administration’s Doha Agreement to pull out of Afghanistan.“Of course, the truth is that President Biden wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan. He campaigned on it. According to public reports he spent the entire Obama Administration pushing back against the generals’ advice not to cut and run. And once in office himself, he pushed ahead.“Senate Republicans will continue to press for accountability. We’ll continue to pursue answers to tough questions about why the Biden Administration ran head-first into this national embarrassment.“And just as importantly, we’ll also keep pushing to rebuild America’s military – both to meet major threats from China and Russia, and to defeat the terrorist challenges President Biden has left to fester.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/the-biden-administration-s-continuing-failures-in-afghanistan"

By swapping affordable and reliable domestic power for half-baked fads, our friends have placed themselves at the mercy of Vladimir Putin to meet demand ahead of another cold winter.“Working families and small businesses are taking this trade-off on the chin. I saw one shop owner in Ireland explain she’s just had to pay almost as much for two months of electricity as she did throughout all of last year.“Unfortunately, millions of Americans can already sympathize. An estimated 20 million U.S. households are already behind on their energy bills thanks to the Democrats’ runaway inflation.“And in California, state and local Democrats have wasted no time taking things even farther in the wrong direction.“Democrats have made California’s electrical grid into a giant experiment to try out all their misunderstandings about energy policy. It’s not going well. With hot-weather demand surging, California authorities are sweating potential shortfalls of up to 5,000 megawatts.“California’s love affair with fickle, unreliable green energy could force its residents to put up with rolling blackouts just to conform to wealthy liberals’ preferences.“The government had to send out an emergency message begging citizens to ration power. Ironically, just weeks after announcing a future ban on gas-powered automobiles, the state is now begging folks not to charge their expensive electric cars to avoid crashing the grid.“So California Democrats don’t want you putting gas in your car, and they don’t want you to plug in your car either. That’s exactly where their war on energy would leave the American people: Going nowhere fast.“President Biden’s Secretary of Energy, Secretary Granholm, literally said less than a week ago that, ‘California is in the lead and can show the rest of the nation how it is done’!“So Mr. President, at home and abroad, our Democratic colleagues have been given sobering warnings of what not to do on energy. They’ve seen what happens when you wage war on abundant fossil fuels, abandon nuclear power, and go all-in on the least reliable energy sources.“But this all-Democrat government has spent two straight years running head-on toward these bright red flashing warning signs. They’ve frozen new domestic energy leasing, cancelled new pipelines, and reinstated a maze of red tape designed to strangle entire domestic industries.“As gas prices skyrocketed on President Biden’s watch, his Administration approved less new oil drilling than any since Harry Truman was in office.“Our Democratic colleagues have doubled and tripled down. Last month, while they rammed through their reckless taxing and spending spree, they voted in lockstep multiple times against Republican amendments that would have helped shore up American energy and rebuild our independence.“Europe in thrall to Putin’s gas supply.

So liberals’ nationwide anti-police P.R. campaign has literally cost people their lives.“When liberals do let police arrest criminals, a growing cabal of far-left prosecutors often simply decline to charge them.“One liberal billionaire has donated more than a million dollars each to the campaigns of soft-on-crime district attorneys in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Chicago.“That Los Angeles D.A. has presided over a 69% increase in shootings and a 40% spike in car thefts.“Chicago’s liberal D.A., ‘appeared to be simply dropping nearly 30% of all felony cases, including alleged murders.’“Philadelphia’s liberal D.A. has presided over an 85% spike in shootings and a huge increase in murders since he took over.“In the name of equity or compassion, these people are announcing they will not prosecute entire categories of crimes.“No wonder American cities are becoming more dangerous by the day.“A couple years back, a former D.A. from outside Boston published a list of crimes she wouldn’t prosecute: Shoplifting, breaking and entering, resisting arrest, and — even in the middle of the opioid crisis — possession with intent to distribute.“As a reward, Washington Democrats made Rachel Rollins the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts.“Just last month, Senator Rubio put forward an amendment to increase funding for cops and keeping violent convicts behind bars. Democrats blocked it.“Every Senate Democrat has also voted multiple times to strip Customs and Border Protection of the only remaining emergency authorities to contend with the historic surge in illegal immigration unfolding on their watch.“Of course, the open-border policies our colleagues support in office are rooted in open-border rhetoric they’ve embraced for years. On the campaign trail, then-Candidate Biden himself said, ‘You want to flee… you should come.’“So, on President Biden’s watch, illegal immigrants flocked to the border — some carrying his campaign’s flags and t-shirts.“There’s an outright security crisis at our southern border.“We are in the middle of the most illegal immigrant arrests in more than two decades.“This year, just from January to August, CBP says they have already run into nearly double the number of known criminals this fiscal year as they saw in the entire year before President Biden took office. And huge upticks in seizures of deadly drugs like fentanyl.“But Democrats aren’t just ignoring a security crisis. It’s a humanitarian crisis, too. Waves of unaccompanied children have stretched CBP’s facilities to the limit.“And under incompetent leadership, the Department of Health and Human Services has had to scramble to help ensure the safety of children in its custody.“There is nothing compassionate about tolerating or even encouraging anarchy at the border, violence in our streets, and a steady erosion of public safety.

At the same time, we still have 19,000 fewer workers than before the pandemic.“During a meeting with the Kentucky Association of Manufacturers in Louisville, I heard directly from employers who would, under different conditions, be powering our recovery. Instead, many are struggling to find enough workers to meet consumer demand.“In Hopkinsville, I spoke to farmers who have watched the price of energy skyrocket, raising the cost of everything from fuel to fertilizer. As a result, all Americans are paying higher prices at the grocery store.“And while Eastern Kentucky struggles to recover from devastating floods, supply chain issues and the increased cost of building materials are hamstringing the repair process and making it even harder to rebuild.“I’m sure my Democratic colleagues heard similar stories during their own August travel. Kentuckians aren’t the only Americans feeling pinched.“The official inflation numbers confirmed that yet again just after the Senate adjourned last month. A fifth straight month of inflation above 8%.“Inflated gas prices. Inflated utility bills. The worst explosion in grocery costs since 1979. These are the painful effects of Democrats’ reckless spending.“Americans keep communicating, over and over, that runaway costs are their top concern — and they didn’t like what President Biden and his party are doing about it.“But amazingly, just a few days before that latest inflation report, Democrats had just pushed through hundreds of billions of dollars more in liberal waste on a party-line basis.“Democrats packed their bill with an environmentalist wish list that won’t even affect the climate. They sold it as an ‘Inflation Reduction Act,’ even though experts found it would do nothing meaningful to reduce inflation.“They did find room for massive, job-killing tax hikes that will hit manufacturing especially hard and kill jobs on the brink of a possible recession.“It’s not getting any easier to put food on the table, pay rent, or keep the lights on.“But here we are again, starting another Senate work period, with not one word from the Democratic Leader about plans to bring bills to the floor to cut inflation, fight the crime wave, or secure the border.“The American people have communicated loud and clear what their priorities are.

And they are very clearly telling anybody who will listen to them what our priorities ought to be.“Americans’ number-one concern, by a mile, is the crushing inflation that Democrats spent us into. The share of Americans who name inflation as our most urgent problem is almost triple the next-closest issue.“Democrats’ policies have working people paying a ‘Democrat Inflation Tax’ of more than 13% on top of their grocery bills. 15% extra on their electric bills. And on and on — down the list of everything that families need to stay afloat.“As a result, Democrats have presided over plummeting real wages for American workers. The average American worker has gotten a raise on paper, but their bigger paycheck buys them less than their smaller paycheck bought them last year.“This wasn’t inevitable. Inflation did not have to be nearly this bad.“Democrats chose to spend so recklessly. Democrats chose to wage this economic warfare against the middle class. Against their savings. Against their financial stability. Against the purchasing power and the lifestyles that workers and parents sacrificed for years to build up.“Americans are also deeply concerned about the erosion of law and order on our streets, in our cities, on our borders, and across our country.“When you combine together crime and immigration, the issue of law and order ranks as the American people’s clear number-two concern, second only to inflation.“Last year, the national murder rate reached its highest level in 25 years.“Cities across the country are contending with an historic surge in carjackings. My hometown of Louisville is now averaging an auto theft every two-and-a-half hours. President Biden’s failed border policies have Customs and Border Protection encountering 200% more fentanyl and apprehending the most illegal immigrants they’ve seen in more than 20 years.“So there’s no mystery about the crises facing our country.“The American people know what needs to be addressed. Republicans know what needs to be addressed. But unfortunately, the Democrats who control the Senate, the House, and the White House are still refusing to get with the program.“Democrats’ top priority for the entire year was the multi-hundred-billion-dollar reckless taxing and spending spree they rammed through in August.“Americans may want their leaders to cut inflation, fight crime and drugs, and secure the border, but Democrats just spent hundreds of billions of dollars of the people’s money doing precisely none of that.“Instead our big-spending colleagues treated themselves to 87,000 new IRS agents, job-killing tax hikes, and the same kinds of liberal energy policies that now have California officials warning about rolling blackouts and begging people not to charge up their electric cars.“Oh, and our Democratic colleagues have given no indication that cutting inflation, fighting crime, or securing the border will be on the Senate’s agenda for September either.“When our people are hurting this badly and speaking this clearly, it takes a willful choice for Democrats to ignore them.“Stable prices, safe streets, reliable energy, and a secure border.“Four of the most basic duties that any government owes its people.“Four things Democrats have proven they cannot deliver.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/americans-top-priorities-are-democrats-biggest-failures"

Only a few months after tornadoes had caused widespread damage in the western part of our state, catastrophe struck our Commonwealth yet again.“I traveled back to Eastern Kentucky multiple times during the August state work period to survey damage, meet with survivors, and lend any help I could.“What I saw were scenes of absolute destruction. Water-logged houses. Swollen creeks. Washed-out roads.“I heard directly from survivors who have shouldered impossible burdens over the past month, struggling to salvage belongings and rebuild their lives.“Agencies report that thousands of homes were destroyed and damaged in the flooding. Many of those affected lack flood insurance.“I will say that, as devastating as this flooding was, stories of heroism and generosity still shine through.“The local officials I met with reserved special praise for Kentucky’s National Guard. Our Guardsmen mobilized at the outset of this crisis to perform daring rescues and distribute critical supplies to stranded residents.“Regular citizens also came to the aid of their neighbors and friends in any way they could, sometimes in trucks, sometimes on horseback or jet skis.“Help has poured in from around our state and beyond, both from private charities and trained emergency responders.“But of course there is still a tremendous need for help.“Eastern Kentucky has notoriously rugged terrain. It also had preexisting communications issues before these floods. These factors have made rescue and rebuilding uniquely challenging already, and this is only the start.“Though FEMA is playing a critical role in Eastern Kentucky’s recovery, Kentuckians have grave concerns about shortcomings in the federal response. The agency’s convoluted application processes have left far too many flood victims without the timely aid they need, often due to simple clerical errors.“I heard about these issues firsthand from countless Kentuckians I met during my visits.“Of course I quickly called FEMA Administrator Criswell to say her agency needs to step up. I visited the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center to review the joint state and federal response firsthand. And I convened leaders from our hardest-hit counties, state legislature, and federal response agencies so we have clearer lines of communication moving forward.“I hope and expect aid will begin to flow more smoothly to Eastern Kentucky soon, and I’ll continue working around the clock here in Washington to make it happen.“And I promise to keep standing strong by Eastern Kentucky’s side as our immediate efforts evolve into longer-term rebuilding.“A long road to recovery lies before us. But Eastern Kentucky will come back stronger than ever.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/eastern-kentucky-continues-to-recover-after-devastating-floods"

Apparently violent pariahs flock together. The free world can expect to see more of the same if the leaders of last year’s coup are not brought to heel.“If Burma’s neighbors and ASEAN are not willing to come to the aid of the innocent people who are suffering under the junta’s brutal and illegitimate rule, the Administration must use the authorities Congress has already given it to turn up the heat on the Tatmadaw and its sources of financial support. This should include sanctions on Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.“The people of Burma have suffered and waited for friends of democracy to come to their aid. Secretary Blinken must put the full weight of the Administration’s authorities squarely in their corner. It is time for less talk and more action.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/kentucky-and-us-face-deadly-consequences-of-democrats-border-crisis,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor regarding law and order:“Yesterday, I met with members of the Kentucky Narcotics Officers Association to discuss the ongoing substance abuse crisis in my home state.“These front-line professionals have watched Kentucky pass some grim milestones in recent years. This is one of the most horrifying consequences of the ongoing breakdown of law and order in our country.“In 2020, overdose deaths in the Commonwealth increased nearly 50% from the year prior, reaching an all-time high of 1,964.“Then last year, we broke that record again, recording 2,250 overdose deaths – 14.5% higher than in 2020.“Remember, as of this past January, two years into the pandemic, fentanyl alone had killed more Americans aged 18 to 45 than the coronavirus.“That’s not even all overdoses, that’s just fentanyl alone.“The Kentucky law enforcement officers with whom I got to visit work every day to try and reverse these heart-wrenching trends.“They’ve had some success. Earlier this month, in Louisville, law enforcement seized a full kilogram of fentanyl in Louisville. The experts say that’s enough of the drug to kill half a million people.“But they are struggling to stem the cascade of narcotics pouring onto our streets. The reason for this, they told me, is clear: our unsecured borders.“Already this year, our overwhelmed Customs and Border Patrol agents encountered more than 1.6 million illegal crossers at our border. That’s close to the total number of encounters for all of last year.“Some of those individuals were promptly detained and deported. But many of them were booked briefly and then released into the American heartland. Presumably, we’ll never hear from most of them again.“These are just the known encounters, to say nothing of the 900,000 ‘got-aways’ that DHS officials think have taken place since the beginning of the last fiscal year.“Put another way, a group of people larger than the entire population of Louisville broke into our country without interacting with border agents at all.“Alongside this human tide is an ever-increasing flood of illicit drugs, most notably fentanyl. That drug played a role in 72% of overdoses in Kentucky last year.“CBP officials have seized 5,722 pounds of the stuff this year alone. Imagine how much slipped through their fingers and onto our streets.“Are Democrats admitting this is an emergency? Are they working overtime to put a tourniquet on this crisis?“Just the opposite. Secretary Mayorkas jetted to a summit in Aspen, Colorado earlier this month and pronounced, ‘the border is secure.’“Maybe that kind of talk plays well at a ritzy ski resort packed with liberals. It doesn’t play well with law enforcement and first responders in states like Kentucky who have to deal with crime and fatal drug overdoses every single day.“The far left throws our borders open for ideological reasons, and it’s the most vulnerable communities that pay the deadly price.“The President of the National Border Patrol Council has directly contradicted the Biden Administration’s insistence that our southern border is in great shape.“He said, ‘the cartels use illegal border crossers to facilitate their higher value contraband, including… fentanyl.’ In other words, more illegal immigration means more of this illegal poison.“But President Biden and Washington Democrats won’t admit it.“Their response to the border crisis has been to issue new internal guidance encouraging border personnel to use more politically correct language when referring to criminal aliens.“They’d rather police language than police our border.“Remember, the Biden Administration spent taxpayer dollars going to court arguing they have the right to end the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy and throw our borders open even wider.“President Biden tried to cut funding for ICE in his most recent budget.“Washington liberals say it’s the compassionate policy to lure desperate people into inhumane conditions, let the drug cartels have open season, and let Americans die as a result.“That isn’t compassion. It’s cruelty. An abdication of duty with deadly consequences for the American people.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-mcconnell-on-kudlow-,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined Larry Kudlow this afternoon on Fox Business’ ‘Kudlow’. Click here to watch the full interview or see below for highlights:On the Supreme Court and the Administrative State: “I did choose not to fill the vacancy when Justice Scalia passed away before the 2016 election. I was the majority leader at the time, setting the agenda. I thought it would be a good idea to see what the American people wanted to do in their next president. It turned out very well. President Trump had good advice and he picked good people — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanagh, Amy Coney Barrett — and it is changing America. “The most important case is probably the West Virginia case because, what it was was a decision by the Supreme Court that Congress could no longer simply give a generalized punt to the administration and they could go out and do anything they wanted to. “Basically what the Court said was, if you want to give the EPA, in this particular instance, the opportunity to rearrange the entire American economy, say so in the legislation. I think this is going to have a huge impact on the administrative state, the overreach of executive branch, in coming years.”On Reshaping the Judiciary:“Single biggest accomplishment of the previous administration, no question about it. The fact we had a Republican majority in the Senate to confirm those nominees. As you know, Larry, we did 54 circuit judges as well. Men and women who believe in the quaint notion that judges ought to actually follow the law. It shouldn't be that controversial…“[T]he majority leader gets to decide what you're going to do, the agenda, the order of doing things. What I always did was to put the judges first.On Washington Democrats’ Prescription Drug Socialism: “You and I worked on the 2017 tax bill, the single most important accomplishment of the previous four years in terms of the domestic economy. I think it's secure but they’re still going to do damage. They’re going to go after the pharmaceutical industry, put socialist price controls in charge, and that inevitably drives down the number of cures, the number of lives saved… More importantly than whether or not anybody gets punished, this is going to reduce the number of life-saving cures dramatically and that is not in the best interest of the American people.“This is a huge mistake but I’m thinking they're probably going to get all their ducks in a row, which would mean all 50 of the Democrats would have to agree to this. We’re going to fight it as much as we can.” On Washington Democrats’ Failed Agenda:  “We don't get to set the agenda that is what the majority gets to do. We are fighting them tooth and nail. They’re doing nothing about the things that really concern the American people: inflation, crime, and open borders. That’s shaping up the fall election as a referendum on the performance of this entirely democratic government - Democrat president, House and Senate. How do you like it? And I think the atmosphere could not be better.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/mcconnell-freedoms-of-speech-and-association-are-bedrock-american-liberties,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) submitted the following remarks for the record at today’s Senate Rules Committee hearing on the DISCLOSE Act:“Today, with our country facing an inflation crisis, a violent crime crisis, and a functionally open southern border, our Democratic colleagues are choosing to focus on chilling Americans’ First Amendment rights and enabling more harassment of citizens for their private views.“Back in 1958, the NAACP fought Alabama’s Attorney General, a segregationist Democrat, all the way to the Supreme Court to defend the bedrock American liberty of associational privacy.“Here’s what Justice Harlan said for the majority back then. ‘Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.’“As the majority opinion put it, this was, ‘hardly a novel perception,’ even back in 1958. And yet, for most of my career, I have had to push back against Democrats’ repeated attempts to unlearn this fundamental Constitutional lesson. I have repeatedly defended Americans’ right to join together and voice opinions.“Prior to McCain-Feingold, almost all money in politics ran through candidates and party committees. I warned that placing unconstitutional restrictions on speech in that bill was like putting a rock on Jell-O – it wouldn’t quash political speech, it would just displace it. And the Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed that point, in case after case upholding free speech.“Our Democratic colleagues’ obsession with regulating political speech is what created the environment they now disapprove of. It’s what drove support for McCain-Feingold. And it’s what spawned this perennial bill in 2010.“Democrats want to pass a law that put discourse in the hands of the mob. But, needless to say, they haven’t always been very concerned with compelling disclosure using laws on the books.“Existing law already requires disclosure of donations to PACs and other outside groups with the intention of influencing federal elections.“But even as our colleagues have introduced successive versions of this DISCLOSE Act, enterprising activist liberals have taken it upon themselves to ‘name and shame’ conservatives by ‘outing’ their private contributions illegally. It was practically Administration policy under the Obama-Biden IRS!“And for those keeping score, Washington Democrats never seem as eager to publicize the donor rolls of groups whose political views they share.“Somehow, donor privacy for organizations pursuing liberal causes is sacrosanct, but donor privacy for groups with conservative beliefs is a threat to democracy.“Somehow, working for outside groups is practically a prerequisite for a West Wing job under a Democratic president, but association with groups Democrats don’t like is a one-way ticket to picketing and harassment.“64 years ago, the Supreme Court said the link between the freedom of association and the freedom of speech was ‘beyond debate’. But today’s Democratic Party wants to make sure the threat to associational privacy is every bit as real as it was back in 1958.“The stakes are so clear, even liberal groups like the ACLU have joined the NAACP and Senate Republicans in continuing to sound the alarm. They have been working together to fight state-level public disclosure laws all the way to the Supreme Court.“Last year, the Court sided with these advocates to strike down predatory disclosure practices in California. Earlier this month, the Ninth Circuit did the same to an unconstitutionally vague disclosure law in Montana.“Meanwhile, the federal judiciary itself is contending with particularly outrageous threats from the radical left to the privacy and security of judges and their families.“The same liberal groups stoking mob intimidation outside the homes of Supreme Court justices are the ones most eager to ‘out’ private citizens’ political speech records.“The same Democrats who refused to condemn naked threats against public officials earlier this summer once again want to expand the federal government’s power to threaten private citizens.“That’s not a trade the American people or their Constitution can afford to make.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-mcconnell-on-the-story_,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined Martha MacCallum this afternoon on Fox News’ ‘The Story With Martha MacCallum’. Click here to watch the full interview or see below for highlights:On Democrats’ Runaway Inflation: “One clear reason we're suffering from 40-year high inflation: the $1.9 trillion so-called rescue package passed last year in March without a single Republican vote, which Bill Clinton’s Secretary of the Treasury, Larry Summers said at the time- was going to create record inflation. Jason Furman, President Obama’s top economist, said it was going to create record inflation, and it has. You saw the numbers the other day. They continue to go up…“This inflationary spiral is entirely the responsibility of this all-Democratic government. And as you suggested, now they want to make it worse by having another spending bill, which they argue is some version of BBB, which Senator Manchin shot down a year ago. They’re discussing raising taxes, which, coupled with the interest rates that the Fed is going to have to take up, likely leads to a recession. So they want to tax us into a recession after spending us into inflation.”On Democrats’ Reckless Taxing and Spending: “[Senate Democrats are] flirting around with adding another trillion dollars, much of it in taxes, on businesses that are not incorporated. By the way, most American businesses are not incorporated. So what they want to do is tax the businesses that are not incorporated in a big spending bill. And then they have us, apparently, trying to pass yet another spending bill, parts of which I think are arguably justified – that is the chip problem that we have in this country. Add it all up and you have more spending right in the middle of this record inflation created by what they did last year.“So yes, I’ve been reluctant to say it's a great idea to add two more spending bills on top of what they have already done, which creates the number 1 issue in the country: this record inflation, which is the principal reason the president's poll numbers are in the dumps.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/mcconnell-another-dangerous-attack-on-the-supreme-court,"LOUISVILLE, KY- Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement following President Biden’s attack on the Supreme Court: “Attacking a core American institution like the Supreme Court from the world stage is below the dignity of the President. Beyond that, President Biden’s attacks on the Court are unmerited and dangerous. He’s upset that the Court said the people, through their elected representatives, will have a say on abortion policy. That does not destabilize democracy – it affirms it. By contrast, it is behavior like the President’s that undermines equal justice and the rule of law.“The President launched this inappropriate attack when he was asked about whether or not we are on the right track as a country. The President needs to take a look in the mirror. The Supreme Court isn’t responsible for inflation, high gas prices, crime in the streets or chaos at the border. He is. No amount of blame shifting on the global stage will change that.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/supreme-court-decision-gives-power-back-to-the-people,"LOUISVILLE, KY – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency:“Today, the Supreme Court gave power back to the people. In siding with the state of West Virginia, the Court has undone illegal regulations issued by the EPA without any clear congressional authorization and confirmed that only the people’s representatives in Congress – not unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats – may write our nation’s laws.“This ruling will have a significant impact on the Commonwealth. Even as energy prices spiral out of control and experts warn of electricity blackouts, the Biden Administration has continued the Left’s war on affordable domestic energy and proposed to saddle the electric power sector with expensive regulatory requirements. Working families and businesses are bearing the costs every day. Today’s decision frees Kentucky’s power producers to provide their customers with cheaper, more reliable electricity.“The ruling also pushes back against the overbearing administrative state, which Democrats have expanded dramatically in recent years. The Constitution states clearly that the lawmaking process lies with the people and their elected representatives, not with opaque federal agencies. I am glad the Supreme Court affirmed this fact and hope other overeager bureaucrats take notice.”###"
https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/the-supreme-courts-landmark-ruling-is-courageous-and-correct,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement this morning regarding the Supreme Court:“The Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Dobbs is courageous and correct. This is an historic victory for the Constitution and for the most vulnerable in our society.“For 50 years, states have been unable to enact even modest protections for unborn children. More than 90% of Europe restricts abortion on demand after 15 weeks, but every state in America has been forced to allow it more than a month past that, after a baby can feel pain, yawn, stretch, and suck his or her thumb. Judicial activists declared that every state had to handle abortion like China and North Korea and no state could handle it like France or Germany.“Not anymore. Now the American people get their voice back.“The Court has corrected a terrible legal and moral error, like when Brown v. Board overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. The Justices applied the Constitution. They carefully weighed the complex factors regarding precedent. The Court overturned mistaken rulings that even liberals have long admitted were incoherent, restoring the separation of powers. I commend the Court for its impartiality in the face of attempted intimidation.“Democrats’ disgraceful attacks on the Court have echoed Democrats’ outrage at Brown v. Board in 1954. Today’s Democrats are jaw-droppingly extreme on abortion. 97% of Washington Democrats support legislation that would effectively require nine months of abortion on demand until the moment of birth. Only 19% of Americans share this radical view but 97% of Democrats in Congress embrace it. They would rather attack our institutions than let the American people enact the reasonable protections they want.“Millions of Americans have spent half a century praying, marching, and working toward today’s historic victories for the rule of law and for innocent life. I have been proud to stand with them throughout our long journey and I share their joy today.”###"

New York’s unconstitutional restrictions on concealed carry were struck down and law-abiding Americans’ basic right to self-defense outside the home was strengthened.“This is not just a long-sought triumph for lawful gun owners across America. It is a victory for all citizens and our constitutional order itself. Every American deserves a federal judiciary that understands and respects that the Constitution simply means what it says. These kinds of courageous, correct, constitutional decisions are precisely why Senate Republicans spent four years confirming brilliant federal judges who understand that the judiciary’s job is to follow the law.“Second, just hours later, the Senate passed major bipartisan legislation addressing school safety and mental health.“Bipartisan talks had started up after horrifying mass murder incidents in the past, but collapsed when Senate Democrats insisted on attacking the Second Amendment. This time was different because Democrats finally moved our way and accepted the reality that Americans do not have to choose between their constitutional rights and safer communities. They can have both.“The legislation that Senator Cornyn and our colleagues assembled protects the Second Amendment. There are no new bans, mandates, or waiting periods for law-abiding citizens of any age. What the bill does contain are commonsense solutions that are overwhelmingly popular with lawful gun owners, such as adding juvenile criminal records and mental health issues into the background check system. It also provides significant new funding for mental health in schools.“I am proud of these two complementary victories that will make our country freer and safer at the same time. Law-abiding Americans will go to bed tonight with significantly stronger Second Amendment rights than they had this morning, while new commonsense guardrails around convicted criminals and mental illness are now on their way to becoming law.""###"

For years, the far left falsely claimed that Congress could only address the terrible issue of mass murders by trampling on law-abiding Americans’ constitutional rights. This bill proves that false.

Click here to watch the full interview or see below for highlights:On Confronting Authoritarian Aggression: “The single biggest thing we can do to press back against President Xi and other authoritarian regimes in the region is to beat the Russians in Ukraine. Both the Taiwanese and the Japanese prime minister and the Japanese defense minister have said the best protection for Taiwan is to beat the Russians in Ukraine. President Xi is watching how this unfolds. He has watched all the democratic world work together to help the Ukrainians beat the Russians. We’re doing the right thing and I think the president’s visit to Asia is probably well timed.”On the Republican Senators’ Trip to Ukraine: “The purpose of my trip, since it was all Republican group who went, was to reassure the Europeans, the Ukrainians, and others that we were completely together on this policy of helping the Ukrainians beat the Russians and that we were going to send them a package that gives them the kind of military equipment they need to recapture their country. President Zelensky's definition of victory is to get the Russians out of Ukraine.”On Sweden and Finland Joining NATO: “One of the many things that's gone poorly for Putin is whatever Russian sympathizers there were in Ukraine are all gone. They have seen how the Russians behave. They have seen the atrocities. It’s unified the Ukrainians. President Zelensky's incredible leadership, you've heard he has been called Winston Churchill in a T-shirt, has not only inspired the Ukrainians but all the rest of us as well and led to the expansion of NATO…“The significance of that cannot be lost on anyone. Finland has 830-mile border with Russia. Sweden has never been in a military alliance in 200 years. Putin changed public opinion in both Finland and Sweden. They are value added to NATO which, as the president pointed out, is a defensive alliance.”On the Baby Formula Shortage: “Almost total incompetence [from the Biden Administration]. They misjudged this from the beginning. It’s not a matter of money. The FDA has a $6 billion budget. They could certainly take care of the so-called appropriation in the House that they just passed at 28 million. [It’s] bureaucratic incompetence. The administration was behind the curve. FDA needs to step up their game and hopefully we'll solve this problem very quickly.”###"

Both countries have massive geographic importance, professional and well-equipped armed forces, strong military industrial bases, and significant interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces. Both nations’ robust commitments to defense funding mean that their accession would directly address longstanding concerns about burden-sharing and the financial contributions of our allies. Finland and Sweden would bring tremendous value as new NATO members and would strengthen the alliance significantly.“I gave both the Swedish and Finnish leaders my personal assurance that I would fully support their NATO accession.

We saw firsthand the courage, unity, and resolve of the Ukrainian people. The Ukrainians are fighting bravely against a deranged invader and have already succeeded beyond skeptics’ wildest dreams. They are willing and determined to keep fighting to victory. Ukraine is not asking anybody else to fight their fight. They only ask for the tools they need for self-defense.“Our delegation reaffirmed to President Zelenskyy that the United States stands squarely behind Ukraine and will sustain our support until Ukraine wins this war. It is also essential that America not stand alone. Our allies and partners must continue to step up and do their part. For his part, President Zelenskyy asked us to relay Ukraine’s gratitude to the American people for our support in this dark hour.“America’s support for Ukraine’s self-defense is not mere philanthropy.

Democrats have hammered working families with the worst food inflation and grocery inflation since 1979.

https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-mcconnell-on-the-guy-benson-show-and-special-report,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) joined Guy Benson this afternoon on Fox News Radio’s ‘The Guy Benson Show’ and Bret Baier on Fox News’ ‘Special Report’ this afternoon. See below for highlights or click here and here for the full interviews.On Democrats’ Reckless Taxing and Spending Spree:“Joe Manchin went back on everything he had been saying publicaly about what he would not do. [The Democrats] stuck this phony label on this Manchin deal, calling it an Inflation Bill. It has zero impact on inflation long-term and actually increases inflation over the next two years. He insisted that it reduce the deficit and we just got a CBO score saying it actually increases the deficit over the next five years. The key to getting their act together was to get Manchin back on board and he ended up signing off on a bill that basically goes against almost everything he had said both publically and to us on the floor of the Senate. $300 billion new taxes on American jobs, particularly falling hard on American manufactures, catalog tax hikes and green boondoggles that Democrats have wanted for years, they just stuck a new name on it. 80,000 new IRS agents to go after middle class families and small business…“He’s saying no to tax rate increases, but what they have done is shift the burden to people who actually pay the taxes by eliminating some of the legitimate preferences, particularly that manufactures have. So the question is, where does the tax burden go? It’s playing with language. The fact of the matter is, [this] will add $300 billion of new tax burdens, in other words, people who actually pay it, on American jobs.“Joe, in the end, got there on the $1.9 trillion so called rescue package last year that created 40 year inflation. And now that we are, by definition, in the middle of a recession they want to raise taxes. That’s the one thing you don’t do in the middle of a recession.”   On Speaker Pelosi’s Trip to Taiwan: “I think she did the right thing. Not something I would routinely be saying about the Speaker, but I think she did the right thing. I don’t think the Chinese ought to be able to dictate who visits Taiwan. I’m glad she went, I think it was important for her to do it. That’s another way we push back against Xi. The other way is to beat the Russians in Ukraine because the Prime Minister of Japan said, if you want to send Xi a message, beat Putin in Ukraine.”On the Ongoing Kentucky Floods: “It’s the worst we’ve ever had. It’s been a tough year in Kentucky. We had tornadoes in Western Kentucky back in December and now this. There are four or five counties in the heart of Appalachia where we have upwards of 30 or more people killed. We’re still finding bodies. It’s been an unmitigated disaster…We’ll get past this but it’s been a horrendous problem.”On Today’s Overwhelming Vote in Support for NATO:“The NATO alliance is the most successful military alliance in world history. The way to prevent Americans from having to actively get involved in combat is to prevent it in the first place. That is what NATO is about. It won the Cold War without firing a single shot. Putin has succeeded not only in expanding NATO, but making it even more effective as a deterrent. Remember Reagan said, ‘peace through strength’, and that's what NATO is all about and that's why Finland and Sweden add a lot to NATO.”### "

Everywhere except the IRS, that is, where this bill would fund the hiring of 86 thousand new tax collectors plus new cars and new computers.“Jacking up Americans’ electricity bills and gas prices in order to subsidize rich people buying luxury cars and new appliances will not make one dent in the future trajectory of global temperatures.“Democrats will choke off the development of new life-saving medicines if they pretend that making things cheaper is as simple as passing a law saying they ought to be cheaper.“Survey after survey, poll after poll, has proven that none of this nonsense is what American people want Democrats focused on.“The American people don’t want hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Deal waste. They want less inflation, not more.“American families don’t want tens of thousands more IRS agents. What they’d like are some more Border Patrol and ICE agents.“American families don’t want Democrats policing what kinds of stoves and clothes dryers they can put in their homes. What they want is for Democrats to start actually policing our city streets.“Democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a second economic disaster.

More than 80 percent of the country says our economy is in bad shape. President Biden’s approval on the economy is down to 30 percent and falling. By the traditional rule of thumb, our country is now in a recession — and a supermajority of Americans know it.“American families are crying out for relief. But Democrats have decided to spend hundreds of billions of dollars of the people’s money on a bill that laughs at the people’s priorities.“Americans say their number-one concern is inflation and the cost of living. Here’s what Democrats’ taxing and spending spree would accomplish there: It would make inflation even worse over the next two years and then do nothing to cut inflation in the long run.“Even the Democrats’ favorite estimates say their bill would take nine years to subtract the amount of inflation we’ve been adding every single week.“After inflation in particular, another huge group of Americans say their biggest issue is the overall state of the economy in general. And here’s what Democrats want to accomplish there: They want to ram through giant new tax hikes in the middle of a recession.“New multi-hundred-billion-dollar tax hikes on American jobs that specifically target the manufacturing sector — leaving Americans with fewer jobs and lower wages.“New tax hikes on American natural gas and crude oil, plus higher fees for producing energy on federal land — leaving Americans with higher electric bills, higher utility bills, higher gas prices, and more dependence on foreign countries that don’t like us.“In a time of inflation, Democrats also want to spend $80 billion dollars to roughly double the size of the IRS so they can shake more money out of the American people through harassment and audits. Using taxpayer money to make taxpayers’ lives worse.“So what do Democrats want to do with all the money they want to drain out of Americans’ pockets in the midst of a recession?“They want to lavish hundreds of billions of dollars on an issue that exactly three percent of the country says is our biggest problem: Far-left environmental and climate spending.“American families have been hemorrhaging financially for a year and a half. Working people can barely tread water. And the Democrats’ focus is Green New Deal nonsense that only three percent of the country wants prioritized.“Big subsidies to help rich people to buy luxury cars and new stoves. Taxpayer funding for environmental protestors. A huge catalog of nonsense that would not put a dent in global emissions while countries like China continue to emit more and more.“I dare any of our Democratic colleagues to walk up to a working-class American on the street and ask them what the government ought to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on.“Well first off, in a time of inflation, they’d probably tell them not to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the first place.“But I doubt a single American worker or middle-class parent would say: You know what? My top priorities are doubling the size of the IRS and giving my boss a government kickback if he buys an $80,000 electric car.“Do you know a single normal American family that is clamoring for this nonsense?“Americans want lower prices. They want border security. They want more police and public safety.“Americans don’t want tens of thousands more IRS agents; they want more Border Patrol and ICE agents.“Americans don’t want Democrats to regulate us into an even deeper recession, they want liberals to let police officers bring law and order back to our streets.“Democrats want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a 3% issue while they completely neglect crime and border security, and make inflation and the recession even worse.“Democrats are catastrophically out of touch with what American families actually care about.

We took big bites out of the bloated permitting process.“And just last year, Republicans ensured that bipartisan infrastructure legislation included clear limits designed to speed up federal permitting reviews.“But earlier this year, the President fired off a far-left executive action that directly contradicted some of that bipartisan headway. Catering to radical environmentalists, the new Biden rule reinstates sweeping jurisdiction for federal bureaucrats to slow down all sorts of critical infrastructure.“This Democrat action is taking a process that’s already known for years-long waiting periods and multi-hundred-page federal reports and making it even worse.“Every single Senate Republican is proud to cosponsor Senator Sullivan’s resolution.

The working class and the middle class would shoulder huge new burdens.“And all these tax hikes would buy American families no relief whatsoever from inflation. Nonpartisan experts say Democrats’ bill would make inflation even worse until 2024 and then do basically nothing to inflation thereafter. In the teeth of this inflation crisis, Democrats’ bill would make inflation even worse over the next two years.“Even the most optimistic estimate, the best figures for Democrats, say it would take their legislation nine years to unwind as much inflation as the country added every week in the month of June.“Nine years of runaway taxing and spending in order to subtract one week’s worth of inflation. And that’s the optimistic projection.“Obviously, the point of this bill is not to reduce inflation. Clearly this taxing and spending spree has a different purpose. And when you look at the legislation, the real purpose is clear:“This bill is a massive goodie bag for far-left environmental activists at the expense of working families.“Democrats want to use their own inflation as a pretext to dump hundreds of billions of dollars into Green New Deal nonsense. This bill declares war on American energy independence and affordability. It will push working families’ bills higher in order to send cash kickbacks to rich elites if they buy fancy cars and redo their kitchens.“Democrats literally want to increase working families’ gas bill, electricity bill, and heating bill so they can send rebates to rich people who buy $80,000 luxury electric cars.“I’m not making this up. I wish I were.“They’ve come up with a huge new tax on American natural gas, which millions of Americans use to heat their homes, cook their food, and dry their clothes. On top of that, natural gas is the nation’s largest source of electricity. So Democrats want to add new taxes on top of two of the major bills that millions of working families pay each month.“There’s also a new per-barrel tax on American oil. And new royalties and fees to drive up the cost of oil and gas production on federal lands.“With all the money they collect from shaking down American families, Democrats want to finance new credits for people who can afford to buy fancy new cars, stoves, and clothes dryers.“Because that’s really ‘green,’ Mr. President — subsidizing retail therapy for liberal elites to rip out working appliances, throw them away, and replace them with the latest fashions.“We’ve got the worst inflation in 40 years. Working families can barely afford gas and groceries. And Democrats’ answer is to offer them a mail-in rebate if they buy an $80,000 car or remodel their kitchen?!“A specific subsidy for electric car buyers that the senior Senator for West Virginia once called ‘ludicrous’ is in this bill which he’s now embraced.“Oh, and the bill also tries to skirt a Supreme Court victory that West Virginia just won to stop Democrats’ illegal regulations from crushing the state’s economy. The legislation intentionally flouts the victory the people of West Virginia just won at the Supreme Court.“There’s billions of dollars for ‘environmental and climate justice block grants’ to directly enrich far-left nonprofits, including explicit language that would send taxpayer funding to political activism.“Democrats literally want to raise your electric bill in order to pay off their own protestors! I guess the people who stand in the middle of highways during rush hour to make some protest gesture now want to receive taxpayer money for their trouble.“Oh, and their bill would send billions of dollars to the Secretary of Transportation to tear up highways instead of building more.“And here’s the kicker. All of this expensive nonsense adds up to no meaningful climate impact whatsoever.“All of these hundreds of billions of dollars to bankroll new appliances for rich people will not put so much as a dent in worldwide emissions or temperatures.“The Washington Post admitted on Monday this legislation, ‘can scarcely be expected to have an immediate, measurable impact on the warming planet.’“Huge developing countries like China and India are dramatically increasing their emissions every year.“Even according to liberals’ own modeling, this bill — that is supposedly worth looting the American people — would have basically no measurable impact on global warming whatsoever.“Liberal waste, subsidies for the rich, and — according to their own models — no meaningful impact on the climate.“I guess Democrats think their 30% approval rating on the economy is still too high.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/democrats-tax-working-families-gas-and-electricity-to-subsidize-luxury-shopping-for-the-wealthy"

Over nine years?!“That is one twenty-eighth of the inflation Democrats have caused in the past 12 months.“For goodness’ sake, Democrats added four times that much inflation just in the month of June alone!“So the friendliest estimate for Democrats says their taxing and spending spree would take nine years to unwind literally one week’s worth of our recent inflation.“Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes, hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending, and it would take nine years to remove one week’s worth of the Democrats’ inflation.“And I’ll repeat one more time: This is the most generous estimate for Democrats. Neutral experts like the University of Pennsylvania say even this is too optimistic, and their bill would actively make inflation even worse in the coming months.“This isn’t an ‘Inflation Reduction Act.’ Not even close.

http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=7937A7A4-A300-40D5-AC48-941BFC564E8A,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor regarding the economy:“When it comes to our economy, American families do not trust this Democratic Party government one bit.“Nearly 90% of Americans are feeling anxious about inflation. 28% approve of how President Biden is handling it. Only 22% think things will get any better after another year on his watch.“Americans’ distrust of Democrats stands to reason. Because a year and a half ago, every single Senate Democrat provided the deciding vote for a $1.9-trillion reckless spending spree that’s caused the worst inflation in 40 years.“The Democratic Leader, Senator Schumer, said back then ‘I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the near term, are very real.’ He led every Senate Democrat to cast the deciding vote for the party-line spending spree that has destroyed families’ purchasing power through inflation.“Now the very same people want to deal our economy another body blow on a party line vote.“The same Democrats who said that a $1.9 trillion spending spree would not cause inflation are now saying it’s a good idea to raise taxes, kill jobs, attack American energy, and hammer American manufacturing. All in the middle of the apparent recession which they created.“Everyone knows that raising taxes in a recession kills jobs. But that’s precisely what Democrats are desperate to do.“They’re proposing a huge new tax hike on American jobs, more than $300 billion.“The Joint Committee on Taxation says a whopping 50% of that burden would fall directly on our nation’s manufacturing sector. In the middle of a supply chain crisis, Democrats want huge, job-killing tax hikes that will disproportionately crush American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs.“Democrats also want a huge new tax hike on American natural gas.“Natural gas is the single largest source of electricity generation in our entire country. A plurality of all the power in America comes from natural gas. It’s also how countless families heat their homes. And it’s a lynchpin of our domestic energy independence and our ability to export to allies like Europe. But the Green New Deal Democrats are coming straight after American natural gas with huge new tax hikes.“The result would be higher electricity bills, higher heating costs, less exporting to our European allies just as Putin is trying to cut them off, and 90,000 workers in the oil and gas industry out of a job.“Democrats’ tax hikes on American energy don’t stop there. With gas prices still sky-high, our colleagues are also proposing to resurrect a defunct tax that would take direct aim at American oil refining — and they want it pegged to inflation, so the tax hike will automatically climb up and up exactly when the country can least afford it.“On top of all this, Democrats also want to pour new funding into the IRS so they can more easily come after more small businesses. IRS agents get new cars and new computers; small businesses get more audits.“Add it all up, these tax hikes and others, and Democrats want to drop an anvil on our economy at the worst possible time.“The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has demonstrated the Democrats’ plan would shatter President Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000.“Households making less than half that amount — less than $200,000 — would see a $16.7 billion tax hike in the year 2023 alone. Amazingly the very lowest-earning Americans who make less than $10,000 per year would see the largest percentage tax hike of any group in the entire bill.“Democrats are labeling all these tax hikes the, ‘Inflation Reduction Act.’ But nonpartisan experts have already proven that is flat-out false. The budget experts at Penn-Wharton show this bill would slightly increase inflation in the near term and do nothing to meaningfully reduce it in the long term.“When you raise taxes on something, Madam President, you get less of it.“In the middle of a recession, Democrats want to raise taxes on American jobs.“In the middle of an energy crisis, Democrats want to raise taxes on American energy.“In the middle of a middle-class inflation crisis, Democrats want to raise taxes on households way below the President’s $400,000 threshold.“All of this economic genius is brought to you by the same people who called a $1.9 trillion inflation time bomb the, ‘American Rescue Plan’ and promised it wouldn’t cause inflation right before it did.“We know what it looks like when Democrats say they’ll help the economy. And American families can’t take much more of it.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/democrats-want-job-killing-middle-class-tax-hikes-in-a-recession"

The area is still experiencing rainfall today. This horrible, tragic crisis is far from over.“In Jackson, waters reached 43-and-a-half feet high, breaking an 83-year record. Drone footage shows whole towns submerged. Roadways have turned into rivers. Rising waters have reached rooftops.“Across more than a dozen counties, severe rainstorms have created crisis conditions. Water rose too quickly for many to react, with tragic consequences.“The Governor has confirmed that 35 Kentuckians lost their lives amid the flash floods, including children. Sadly, I’m told that number will rise in the coming days.“Even the families who were lucky enough to get out unscathed have lost homes, businesses, and heirlooms. In many communities, the waterlogged destruction is absolute.“Eastern Kentucky is well known for its steep hilltops, rolling forests, and deep hollers. Those features, which make the region one of the most unique in the country, also create complications for emergency personnel.“Our heroic first responders, including the National Guard from Kentucky and surrounding states, are working overtime to find and recover stranded residents. They’ve rescued more than 1,400 individuals since floodwaters hit, nearly half by air.“Late last week, I joined with every member of Kentucky’s congressional delegation to support the Governor’s request to the President for a Major Disaster declaration to give our first responders federal help.“President Biden issued that declaration promptly and resources are already flowing into the Commonwealth to assist local emergency personnel.“I’ve spoken to the President and FEMA Director Criswell to thank them for their speedy action.“Director Criswell traveled to Kentucky last week and has been on the ground assisting with recovery efforts directly.“My staff in Southeastern Kentucky are in close touch with local officials in that area, providing all the help we can. I will visit the affected communities myself in the coming days to meet with constituents and offer support. “Unthinkably painful stories continue to come to us out of Eastern Kentucky. However, we’ve also heard moving reminders of Kentuckians’ selflessness.“Last December, the city of Mayfield in Western Kentucky was devastated by tornadoes. The town lost its fire station in the storm.“But despite their own challenges, last week the Mayfield Fire Department filled an ambulance with equipment and rushed to Eastern Kentucky to aid relief efforts. They didn’t have to think twice before helping fellow Kentuckians.“We saw generosity all across the affected region. Residents with boats, jet skis, and kayaks put their own lives at risk to rescue their neighbors.“Schools, churches, parks, and businesses opened their doors to displaced families.“As one resident put it over the weekend, no matter what, Eastern Kentuckians ‘help each other.’“I’m monitoring this situation closely and doing all I can to assist. Kentucky leaders on both sides of the political aisle are working together to coordinate further federal aid.“I’m thankful to everyone who sprang into action to help with the rescue efforts, whether they were professional first responders or just good Samaritans.“And I’m thankful for the help our state has already received from FEMA. Their continued assistance will be vital for rebuilding in the months ahead.“Eastern Kentucky has been devastated by these floods. Our recovery process will take months and, in some places, years.“But I know we will bounce back. Kentucky has faced challenges before. And we always overcome.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/mcconnell-on-ongoing-kentucky-floods"

We became close during my first run for statewide office and remained friends as he helped transform his corner of the Commonwealth into a conservative bastion. Robert epitomized the type of grassroots organizer that I have found so important during my career, helping recruit and train many others to follow in his footsteps. I offer my deepest sympathy to the entire Hatcher family and join all of Robert’s friends and colleagues in grieving his loss.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/mcconnell-comments-on-the-passing-of-robert-hatcher"
http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=F73BD967-70AA-4049-8AC7-DF467069478B,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced he secured several priorities to benefit Kentucky in the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA 2022) that the Senate passed today. This legislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to carry out projects across the country that invest in ports, harbors, and inland waterways, build resilient infrastructure, and help preserve the natural environment. A House/Senate conference committee must now approve the bill before it goes to the President for his signature. “Kentucky sits at the heart of America’s inland waterways, serving as a national hub for transportation and commerce. Because of this, I’ve worked hard to advance the Commonwealth’s priorities in this year’s water infrastructure legislation to protect our natural heritage, foster development and growth, and help our waterside communities. I’m grateful my Senate colleagues approved these investments in Kentucky’s future,” said Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell secured the following provisions to benefit Kentucky: Kentucky Lock and Dam Language instructing the USACE to expedite the completion of the Kentucky Lock addition project in Livingston County, Kentucky. The bill also includes language pausing Appropriations limits on projects, which will allow construction to continue even with possible cost increases. “For years, I have used my leadership role in the United States Senate to advocate for the completion of the long-awaited Kentucky Lock and Dam project. I have helped secure more than $1 billion for this project, including over $465 million last year through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The language in this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill will help that project stay on track, even if it is hit by cost overruns driven by inflation. Once finished, the new Kentucky Lock and Dam will allow the Commonwealth to take full advantage of our prime location at the heart of America’s inland waterways system,” said Senator McConnell. ""Each year roughly 25 million tons of product pass through Kentucky Lock, supporting jobs and commerce across the Commonwealth and neighboring states. Completion of the current Kentucky Lock expansion project is paramount to optimizing this critical transportation corridor, and the language in the Senate Water Resources Development Act of 2022 is a much-needed step in the right direction. Senator McConnell is leading the effort to expedite completion of this important project, and I applaud his unwavering commitment and steadfast leadership toward improving the inland waterways system and Kentucky Lock and Dam,” said Crounse Corporation President and CEO Matt Ricketts. Newport Waterfront Festival Park USACE authorization to study the construction of the Waterfront Festival Park in Campbell County, Kentucky. The City of Newport seeks to create a new community space along their Ohio River waterfront. This authorization will enable USACE to map out the project, which involves flood management, ecosystem restoration, and recreation. “Kentucky boasts many waterfront developments that serve as the gathering place of their communities. With the passage of this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill, the City of Newport will be able to coordinate with USACE to build a new waterfront community space of its own. Around the Commonwealth, these projects have fostered development, encouraged recreation, and promoted local pride. I’m proud to help Newport pursue this project to reap all these benefits too,” said Senator McConnell. “The City of Newport is thrilled to receive authorization for the Corps to study the effects and benefits of planned improvements to our Festival Park area,"" said Newport City Manager Tom Fromme. ""Being a critical part of Riverfront Commons, the park is a very important asset to Newport and to the entire region. We are extremely grateful for the efforts of Senator McConnell for his work and advocacy on behalf of our City and residents.” “This is a long-awaited milestone for the Newport Festival Park project, and we applaud Sen. McConnell’s continued commitment to enhancing Northern Kentucky’s riverfront,” said Southbank President and CEO Will Weber. “The WRDA authorization for funding will enable the USACE to study the area for future recreational opportunities and continues the tremendous momentum of riverfront development through both public and private investment. “ Columbus Belmont State Park USACE authorization to study and examine bluff stabilization at the Columbus Belmont State Park in Hickman County, Kentucky. The Park sits atop a steep bluff overlooking the Mississippi River and welcomes many visitors from the community and surrounding region. The Park faces significant erosion, so bluff stabilization efforts will help prevent future property loss. “Columbus Belmont State Park is one of the crown jewel attractions of the Jackson Purchase but has become threatened recently by shifts in the path of the Mississippi River. I am proud to assist this Kentucky landmark in determining the best way to stabilize its bluff and prevent future erosion. These efforts will help ensure the park will be around for generations to come,” said Senator McConnell. “We are grateful to Senator McConnell for securing authorization for a feasibility study on the Columbus Belmont State Park bluff project currently under the watch of the Corps of Engineers. Columbus Belmont State Park is one of the most picturesque parks in our great country. In the past few years, severe sloughing of the bluff has led to a dangerous situation affecting Columbus Belmont. We want to thank Senator McConnell and his staff for their tireless work in trying to save our park. It is much appreciated,” said Hickman County Judge-Executive Kenny Wilson. Three Forks of Beargrass Creek Funding authorization up to $121 million for the restoration of three major branches of the Beargrass Creek in Jefferson County, Kentucky. This waterway flows through Louisville, Kentucky, into the Ohio River and currently has a stressed aquatic ecosystem. The project will restore the stream’s flow and wetland habitat, improving the environmental quality of the watershed while increasing nearby communities’ access to green space and recreational opportunities. “My hometown of Louisville is where Kentucky’s urban and natural worlds collide. In addition to promoting jobs and development in our city, I’ve also worked hard to preserve our natural beauty. Just like the Ohio River, Beargrass Creek is an integral part of Louisville and Jefferson County, and I’m glad this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill will help restore its environmental quality,” said Senator McConnell. “This important restoration of Beargrass Creek will significantly help our community’s endeavor to enhance this highly urbanized stream by reestablishing natural features and crafting a sustainable environment. We look forward to partnering with other local agencies to bring this to fruition. We appreciate the work of Leader McConnell to move this forward in the Senate,” said Tony Parrott, Louisville MSD Executive Director. Elkhorn Lake Improvement Project Authorization for repairs to critical infrastructure at the Elkhorn Lake and Elkhorn Creek impoundment dam in Letcher County, Kentucky. The City of Jenkins lies below the Elkhorn Creek impoundment dam – which was built over a century ago and has not received significant improvements since then – and is threatened by the dam’s deteriorating state. These repairs will improve safety at the dam by replacing outdated infrastructure and investigating possible safety risks. “Kentucky communities have benefitted immensely from the Commonwealth’s extensive system of dams, but these projects must be well-maintained to ensure nearby residents’ safety. I’ve made it a priority to upgrade Kentucky’s lock and dam infrastructure, and I’m glad this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill helps us improve the Elkhorn Creek impoundment dam and protect Letcher County against flooding,” said Senator McConnell. “For years, residents of my town have worried that their homes and businesses could be threatened by deterioration at the Elkhorn Creek impoundment dam, which protects much of the City of Jenkins from flooding. This authorization will give the go-ahead for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate the necessary repairs to the dam, safeguarding our town. We deeply appreciate Senator McConnell’s work to address this critical problem and support Jenkins’ future development and growth,” said Jenkins Mayor Todd DePriest. Asian Carp Language that expands the effort to control and prevent the spread of Asian Carp. “Invasive Asian Carp have already wreaked havoc on Kentucky’s inland waterways and disrupted the recreation and tourism industries that rely on them. I’ve made this issue a priority in the Senate and helped mobilize the federal government to eradicate this destructive fish. I was proud to include language in this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill to keep this endeavor at the top of USACE’s priorities and prevent the future spread of Asian Carp,” said Senator McConnell. “The spread of Asian Carp is a large problem in my community. I’m glad Senator McConnell recognizes the severity of this issue and secured federal assistance for our eradication efforts. The recreation and tourism industries form a large part of Lyon County’s economy and are directly threatened by this invasive species, so we are grateful for his help,” said Lyon County Judge-Executive Wade White. In addition to these priorities, Senator McConnell also supported the following provisions to benefit Kentucky: 75/25 Cost-Share Adjustment for Major Inland Waterways Projects A provision adjusting the cost-share for major inland waterways projects to 75 percent from the General Fund of the Treasury and 25 percent from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The cost-share was previously set at 65 percent from the General Fund of the Treasury and 35 percent from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund receives revenue from an inland waterway user fee paid by commercial barges operating on federally designated waterways. This adjustment will allow the USACE to stretch the Inland Waterways Trust Fund further, injecting more federal dollars into construction projects in Kentucky and around the country. “Kentucky has some of the best access to our nation’s inland waterways in the country, so I always look for ways to increase federal investment in infrastructure programs with a specific focus on improving inland water transportation. This cost-share adjustment will allow more federal resources to flow into these types of projects, benefitting states like Kentucky with extensive inland waterway networks,” said Senator McConnell. Cumberland River Dredging Study Language instructing USACE to conduct a feasibility study to assess the deepening of a portion of the Cumberland River near Paducah, Kentucky, to increase the fill weight and the number of barges that can travel the river. “Paducah prides itself on its riverfront access and has long taken advantage of its prime location to foster trade, transportation, and recreation. With the study authorized in this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill, Paducah will be able to benefit even more from its neighboring waterways by expanding the navigability of the Cumberland River,” said Senator McConnell. Eddyville Riverport Authorization for the sale of a USACE-owned parcel of land to the adjacent Eddyville Riverport facilities on Lake Barkley, allowing the riverport to expand its capabilities. “Eddyville Riverport is part of Kentucky’s large and growing network of inland waterways facilities and requires new land to expand their capabilities. In this year’s Senate water infrastructure bill, I helped the Eddyville Riverport team cut through red tape and expedite the process required to acquire land from USACE. This will help the riverport expand and bring new economic opportunity to surrounding communities,” said Senator McConnell. ""We appreciate the work of Senator McConnell to assist in our expansion at the Eddyville Riverport and his dedication to the Commonwealth. The Riverport is an economic driver of our area and a vital piece in our transportation network. This expansion will allow us to grow port operations, facilitate business expansion, and attract new jobs and investments into Eddyville Kentucky,” said Eddyville Riverport Chairman Billy Ray Coursey. Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/senate-approves-mcconnell-provisions-to-strengthen-kentucky-s-water-infrastructure"
http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=A7910E0A-33BE-4088-9AD5-CF4CFCCB1927,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor regarding tax hikes and inflation:“Minutes ago, new data confirmed what a supermajority of Americans already knew: Democrats have plunged America into a recession.“According to official statistics, the U.S. economy just shrank for the second consecutive quarter. Democrats inherited an economy that was primed for an historic comeback and promptly ran it straight into the ground.“Of course, working families didn’t need any experts or statistics to tell them today’s Democratic Party is a walking, talking economic disaster. Democrats’ failures are causing working families deep personal pain on a daily basis.“Americans know Democrats can’t be trusted. They know it every time they fill their gas tank. Every time they check out at the supermarket. Every time parents stay up late at their kitchen table trying to figure out which bills they can afford to pay this month.“Because Democrats spent us into inflation, 90 million American households say they’re having a hard time meeting expenses.“The average household in this country is having to pay an extra $5,300 and climbing every year just to tread water. Democrats’ inflation is stealing more than $5,000 from the average family per year. And like a supermajority of Americans already knew before this morning, it has driven our country into recession.“A few years back, our colleague the senior Senator for West Virginia said, ‘I don’t think [that] during a time of recession, you mess with any of the taxes, or increase any taxes.’“But yesterday, Washington Democrats announced they plan to do exactly that.“The Democrats who’ve robbed American families once with inflation now want to rob the country a second time through gigantic job-killing tax hikes.“Apparently our Democratic colleagues do not want to be responsible for just skyrocketing prices alone. They want Americans to be faced with skyrocketing prices and higher taxes and fewer jobs, all at the same time.“Democrats have outlined a giant package of huge new job-killing tax hikes, Green New Deal craziness that will kill American energy, and prescription drug socialism that will leave us with fewer new life-saving medicines.“A reckless taxing and spending spree that will delight the far left and hammer working families even harder.“Democrats are going all in on a multi-hundred-billion-dollar tax hike on American jobs that experts called the single most economically damaging part of their entire BBB plan from last year. Years of research show the burden would be overwhelmingly passed down to workers. This one tax hike alone would kill tens of thousands of American jobs.“Democrats aren’t sticking it to the fat cats. They’re sticking it to the same middle-class families they’ve already crushed with inflation.“So Democrats want to respond to their inflation crisis by killing jobs. They also want to respond to a global energy crisis by attacking American natural gas. This reckless taxing and spending spree includes a massive new tax on American natural gas, our country’s single largest source of electricity.“When you tax something, you get less of it, and Democrats want new taxes on American natural gas wells, new taxes on American pipelines, and new taxes on American LNG exporting.“Higher electricity bills in the summer; higher heating bills in the winter; less reliable energy for our country; and less American energy exported to our allies abroad. Doubling down on inflation.“I’ve only scratched the surface of all the ways Democrats want to pick Americans’ pockets. They want to pour new funding into IRS agents so Americans end up with more audits. IRS agents get new computers and smartphones so that American small businesses get more audits.“Democrats also want to drain money out of medical innovation and leave terminally ill Americans with fewer new treatments and cures as a result. The experts say this big government money-grab will literally cost Americans their lives.“Remember, Democrats say all these historic tax hikes are their answer to the inflation they themselves caused.“Did you hear that, America? Democrats’ answer to hurting you once is to hurt you again. Democrats say the response to Democrat inflation is Democrat tax hikes.“It wasn’t enough that Democrats have already destroyed your family’s purchasing power. Now they want to kill your job and tax your electricity, too.***“The natural next question is: What do Democrats want to do with all this money?“What spending spree that Democrats want so badly that they’ll raise taxes in the midst of a recession?“Here’s the answer: Green New Deal nonsense and goodies for rich coastal elites.“They want these job-killing tax hikes so they can spend tens of billions of dollars on slush funds for ‘green banks’ and ‘environmental justice.’“They want job-killing tax hikes so they can finance new handouts for wealthy households earning up to $300,000 a year to buy an $80,000 electric car.“Democrats want to subsidize rich people buying electric cars that cost more than the median American household earns in an entire year.“Democrats want to tax American natural gas, they want to tax your electricity, so they can spend billions making solar and wind power look artificially ready for prime time when they are not.“Billions of dollars so Democrats can meddle in what kind of car you drive, what kind of stove, hot water heater, or clothes dryer you can afford, and how you’re allowed to heat your house.“This is the nonsense that Democrats are focused on. Not helping you put gas in your car. Not helping you afford your groceries. They want to use the middle-class economic crisis they created as an excuse to raise your taxes and ram through their Green New Deal nonsense.“All of this liberal waste — with no proof that any of it would lead to a meaningful reduction in global emissions, much less global temperatures. America has already been reducing our emissions considerably over the last 15 to 20 years.“Countries like China have just kept on emitting more and more, totally washing out our reductions and then some. Democrats want to forcibly reengineer our entire economy out from under working Americans’ feet while China just keeps on emitting more and more.“Democrats are seeing American families the worst inflation in 40 years… and raising them job-killing tax hikes and a war on American electricity.“Our colleagues across the aisle have already completely lost Americans’ trust on the economy, before this reckless taxing and spending spree. Apparently they want to see how much farther they can fall.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-who-created-inflation-and-recession-want-giant-job-killing-tax-hikes"

It could also allow Democrats to effectively spend the same money twice and enable hundreds of billions in new, unrelated spending on the discretionary side of the federal budget.“There is no excuse why the Democratic Leader should continue to block Senator Toomey’s commonsense amendment.

You almost have to laugh.“Contrast the Democrats’ spin with how working Americans are describing our economy.“From a grocery store manager in Tennessee, ‘It’s just not a good situation.’“From a grandmother in Georgia: ‘The food, the gas, the bills, and the mortgage, everything… It’s a lot on a family.’“Overall, a majority of Americans are concerned their paycheck can’t cover the essentials amidst inflation. And a majority disapprove of what President Biden’s doing about it.“Clearly, something isn’t adding up. But that isn’t a new feature of Washington Democrats’ one-party control of government. In fact, missing the mark on economic policy has been a hallmark of the Biden Administration.“Last spring, they misread what it needed after a once-in-a-century pandemic and flooded the engine with trillions in liberal spending.“Then, they missed the warning signs of the runaway inflation their mistakes brought on.“Now, they’re mounting a panicked campaign to redefine the word ‘recession’ before the next quarterly GDP numbers are published tomorrow.“Washington Democrats seem to think the real-world effects of their policies – the pain Americans are feeling as they try to balance household budgets – can just be spun away with talking points.“Well, I can tell you there are millions of working families who wish it were in fact that simple, but who know full well that it is not.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-spin-isn-t-helping-americans-inflation-pain"

This is one of the most horrifying consequences of the ongoing breakdown of law and order in our country.“In 2020, overdose deaths in the Commonwealth increased nearly 50% from the year prior, reaching an all-time high of 1,964.“Then last year, we broke that record again, recording 2,250 overdose deaths – 14.5% higher than in 2020.“Remember, as of this past January, two years into the pandemic, fentanyl alone had killed more Americans aged 18 to 45 than the coronavirus.“That’s not even all overdoses, that’s just fentanyl alone.“The Kentucky law enforcement officers with whom I got to visit work every day to try and reverse these heart-wrenching trends.“They’ve had some success. Earlier this month, in Louisville, law enforcement seized a full kilogram of fentanyl in Louisville. The experts say that’s enough of the drug to kill half a million people.“But they are struggling to stem the cascade of narcotics pouring onto our streets. The reason for this, they told me, is clear: our unsecured borders.“Already this year, our overwhelmed Customs and Border Patrol agents encountered more than 1.6 million illegal crossers at our border. That’s close to the total number of encounters for all of last year.“Some of those individuals were promptly detained and deported. But many of them were booked briefly and then released into the American heartland. Presumably, we’ll never hear from most of them again.“These are just the known encounters, to say nothing of the 900,000 ‘got-aways’ that DHS officials think have taken place since the beginning of the last fiscal year.“Put another way, a group of people larger than the entire population of Louisville broke into our country without interacting with border agents at all.“Alongside this human tide is an ever-increasing flood of illicit drugs, most notably fentanyl. That drug played a role in 72% of overdoses in Kentucky last year.“CBP officials have seized 5,722 pounds of the stuff this year alone. Imagine how much slipped through their fingers and onto our streets.“Are Democrats admitting this is an emergency? Are they working overtime to put a tourniquet on this crisis?“Just the opposite. Secretary Mayorkas jetted to a summit in Aspen, Colorado earlier this month and pronounced, ‘the border is secure.’“Maybe that kind of talk plays well at a ritzy ski resort packed with liberals. It doesn’t play well with law enforcement and first responders in states like Kentucky who have to deal with crime and fatal drug overdoses every single day.“The far left throws our borders open for ideological reasons, and it’s the most vulnerable communities that pay the deadly price.“The President of the National Border Patrol Council has directly contradicted the Biden Administration’s insistence that our southern border is in great shape.“He said, ‘the cartels use illegal border crossers to facilitate their higher value contraband, including… fentanyl.’ In other words, more illegal immigration means more of this illegal poison.“But President Biden and Washington Democrats won’t admit it.“Their response to the border crisis has been to issue new internal guidance encouraging border personnel to use more politically correct language when referring to criminal aliens.“They’d rather police language than police our border.“Remember, the Biden Administration spent taxpayer dollars going to court arguing they have the right to end the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy and throw our borders open even wider.“President Biden tried to cut funding for ICE in his most recent budget.“Washington liberals say it’s the compassionate policy to lure desperate people into inhumane conditions, let the drug cartels have open season, and let Americans die as a result.“That isn’t compassion. It’s cruelty. An abdication of duty with deadly consequences for the American people.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/kentucky-and-u-s-face-deadly-consequences-of-democrats-border-crisis"

Russia’s Black Sea blockade and destruction of Ukraine’s crops have left vulnerable regions of the world on the verge of crisis.“But Vladimir Putin only managed to resist the urge to commit senseless violence for about 24 hours.“Now, the fact that Putin was even compelled to negotiate was thanks to the introduction of HIMARS long-range rockets and HARPOON anti-ship missiles into Ukraine’s arsenal.“If Ukraine had had weapons like these earlier, the blockade of Odessa could have been prevented in the first place.“The Biden Administration says its decision-making throughout this process has been deliberate and nuanced.“History will likely judge otherwise. The months before Putin’s escalation clearly called for boldness and resolve. To say nothing of the months since. But too often, the Administration’s first instincts have been to plod along slowly and vacillate.“The Ukrainians have fought bravely to stop Russia’s advance despite being undermanned and outgunned. Just think what they could have accomplished if the West had acted boldly to support Ukraine as storm clouds were first gathering, or right away when the storm broke.***“By now, no one should need a reminder of the far-reaching impacts of war in Ukraine.“Our Eastern Flank allies certainly don’t. They’ve been preparing to defend themselves for generations. And from the beginning of Russia’s latest offensive, they’ve reached deep into their own inventories to help equip Ukraine.“Elsewhere in Europe, treaty allies have finally taken an important lesson about investing in deterrence and self-defense to heart.“Countries like Germany have made historic commitments to increase military spending. The Germans, Swedes, and others have also broken historic precedent to share their stockpiles with Ukraine.“And of course, Russia’s war has led other major European states to announce their intention to join the ranks of the strongest alliance in world history.“Last week, our colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee advanced the necessary protocols to ratify Sweden’s and Finland’s accession to NATO.“There is now nothing preventing the Democratic Leader from calling these measures up for immediate consideration and passage by the full Senate. The legislatures of other NATO allies like Canada, Norway, Poland, and Germany have already ratified them.“The United States would be fortunate to have two new treaty allies as impressive and capable as Finland and Sweden. Both countries’ high-tech economies and extensive American-made systems will improve the alliance’s interoperability and instantly improve the state of burden-sharing the day they come in.“American leadership in the world has made possible the peace and security our country enjoys today. That leadership is helping encourage our allies to make sufficient investments in their own capabilities to face down shared threats.“But American leadership is only as strong as our willingness to make robust investments in our own capabilities.“President Biden has submitted defense budget requests that fail to keep pace with growing threats and fail to keep pace with the Democrats’ own inflation. And Senate Democrats are giving short shrift to the need for a strong, bipartisan defense authorization bill.“Russian aggression isn’t the only threat to American interests today. Rogue states like Iran and North Korea continue to march toward devastating weapons. China’s provocative behavior in the Indo-Pacific continues to raise the stakes for long-term competition.“So there is no time to waste on either of these measures – neither the Sweden and Finland protocols nor a strong, bipartisan NDAA.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/senate-must-act-quickly-on-sweden-finland-nato-accession-and-bipartisan-ndaa"

And 100% of the American people live in a country where things did not have to be this bad, but for Democrats’ deliberate policy choices.“Don’t take it from me. Listen to Larry Summers, Treasury Secretary to President Clinton and NEC Director to President Obama.“This is Larry Summers. I’ll quote him at length: ‘There wouldn't have been nearly the same kinds of supply chain problems… if we weren't giving people who were laid off unemployment insurance that was far more than the salaries they had been earning… if we weren't mailing checks willy-nilly… there would have been less spending, that would have meant less bottlenecks.’“He went on: ‘Printing money and distributing it well ahead of the supply of goods is a prescription for inflation — and that's what we did. We injected enough money into the economy to make total spending grow at an 11.6 percent rate last year. When you have 11.6% growth rate in spending, then on any reasonable theory of how much capacity there is, you're going to have a lot of inflation. And that's what we did.’“This is a top Democrat talking, Mr. President. But he is intellectually honest. He tried to advise Washington Democrats not to dump nearly $2 trillion onto the economy, but they didn’t listen. And now working families are stuck with skyrocketing costs and bills as a consequence.“You would think the worst inflation in 40 years would be enough to convince Democrats to stop running these painful experiments on American families. But, if you can believe it, almost every House and Senate Democrat would like to follow up this historic inflation with massive new tax hikes.“The same people who spent us into inflation want to tax us all the way into recession.“Let’s hope the small handful of Democrats who see the insanity of this approach continue to stand strong for our country.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-want-to-follow-up-historic-inflation-with-massive-tax-hikes"

Yet more innocent blood shed for the crime of dissenting against the junta’s illegitimate rule.“This is yet another atrocity in a long list of horrors committed by a junta with no legitimacy, no regard for the sanctity of human life, and no respect for its fellow citizens.“It provides even further evidence the junta does not fear any consequences for its actions — not from internal chaos, not from civil war, not from its neighbors, not from the so-called international community.“The United States has led efforts to support Burma’s people, and to impose costs and consequences on the junta. Clearly it is time for Burma’s neighbors to shoulder a larger burden as well. It is time for ASEAN states to step up, individually and collectively.“As the junta plunges Burma deeper into chaos and civil war, the turmoil will affect the entire region.  “It is Burma’s neighbors who have the most economic influence over the junta, and it is Burma’s neighbors who have the most at stake.“Do they want a failed state wracked by civil war like Syria on their borders? “Do they want a Russian or Chinese-backed client state in their midst? “If they will not step up and impose meaningful costs on the junta, the Biden Administration should use authorities already given to it by the Congress to sanction Burma’s energy sector, including Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, notwithstanding the concerns of those neighbors.“The people of Burma are risking their lives, and in some cases losing their lives, to defend their freedom. The Biden Administration claims to prioritize democracy and human rights in its foreign policy. Here is an opportunity to demonstrate that it means what it says. “So in sum: it is time for Burma’s neighbors to act.“If they do not, the Biden Administration should sanction Burma’s energy sector and other major sources of revenue for the junta.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/mcconnell-condemns-burma-executions-and-calls-for-action"

For example, the same Democrats who spent our country into inflation are now angling to regulate our medical cures industry into fewer new cures and fewer life-saving treatments.“American researchers and manufacturers are the driving force behind cutting-edge treatments that the entire world relies on. American innovators are leading the races to cure terminal illnesses like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.“The entire world benefits from our genius, but in particular, the American people get first and fastest access to the latest new treatments, cures, and medical marvels.“But the Democrats’ pursuit of prescription drug socialism could put all of it at risk.“Arbitrary, top-down government price controls would dry out the wells of American innovation to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in lost research and development.“And American patients would feel the pain. The cost of breakthrough cures is measured in dollars, but the cost of neglecting them would be measured in lost years of American life.“One academic analysis pegged that true cost at a cumulative 331.5 million years. Let me say that again. One expert says the negative effects of Democrats’ proposal on medical research would cost a collective total of 331.5 million cumulative years of life.“In other words, their proposal would eventually destroy as many years of Americans’ lives as there are Americans to live them.“Madam President, just two years ago, Democrats were lining up with Republicans and the rest of the country to cheer the American researchers and innovators who were driving the race for a COVID-19 vaccine… a race they finished in record time.“The American people know what it looks like when life-saving advances happen right here at home.

Here was the Democratic Leader in March of 2021: ‘I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the near term, are very real.’ And here was President Biden: ‘The biggest risk is not going too big… it’s if we go too small.’“Obviously, they were wrong. Their reckless spending fueled the worst inflation in 40 years. As Ms. Alvarado, a teacher and mother of three explained to a reporter, ‘When I say, ‘OK, we cannot buy anything this week or else we’ll go into overdraft,’ [my husband] says, ‘No, what are you talking about? We’re both working. That shouldn’t happen.’“No, Madam President, it shouldn’t have happened, but it’s exactly what Democrats’ policies have inflicted on working families in this country.“‘Every time I fill up our van I’m flabbergasted,’ Ms. Alvarado explains, ‘I’m always worrying... I can postpone the mortgage by two weeks, but then it becomes two more weeks, and then all of a sudden they’re calling you.’“After Democrats’ policies did cause inflation, they moved on to their next wrong prediction. President Biden admitted inflation did exist, but said it was, ‘expected to be temporary.’ That one didn’t work out, either. That was over a year ago.“Then, seven months ago, in early December, President Biden promised inflation had peaked. Wrong again. It didn’t peak in December, it’s just kept getting worse. Inflation set a fresh new 40-year high just last month.“Well, now, these same folks are preparing for yet another battle against reality. In advance of the GDP numbers coming out later this week, the Biden Administration has begun their latest project —a frantic effort to re-define the word ‘recession.’“The White House published a whole explanation insisting that even if the new data suggest that our country is in recession, we actually won’t be.“It’s almost beyond satire, Madam President. The White House isn’t focusing their energies on correcting their mistakes and making the economy better for working families who are hurting. Instead their priority is telling everybody things aren’t as bad as they look or feel. They want working Americans like Ms. Alvarado to believe Democrats’ spin instead of their own lying eyes.“I guess the whopping 42% of Americans who say they’re struggling to stay where they are financially are supposed to read the White House’s press release and cheer up.“The same people who said inflation wouldn’t happen… and then said it would be transitory… and then said it had peaked last year… are now insisting we aren’t headed into a recession.

Senator McConnell and Congressman Comer introduced this legislation in April. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.This legislation includes a number of provisions to help the Land Between the Lakes (LBL) secure more federal resources to address its maintenance needs and expand recreation opportunities. That includes additional authorized funding each fiscal year from the U.S. Forest Service, changes to the LBL Advisory Board makeup, regulations ensuring user fees collected at LBL are used to improve LBL, and provisions to bolster law enforcement capacity in LBL and surrounding counties. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator McConnell will work with the U.S. Forest Service during the congressional appropriations process to ensure robust funding for LBL. The bill also better defines the special status of the families who once resided in LBL and guarantees their direct descendants’ access to cemeteries within the territory.“Today’s Committee vote on the Land Between the Lakes Recreation and Heritage Act is a resounding victory for the LBL community stakeholders who have worked for decades to protect this important landmark,” said Senator McConnell. “Congressman Comer and I coordinated closely with these local leaders to ensure the improved funding and oversight in this legislation will help solve the long list of issues facing LBL today. I look forward to the full Senate passing this bill and safeguarding one of Kentucky’s finest natural treasures for future generations.”“Land Between the Lakes is one of Kentucky’s crown jewels – an extraordinary legacy to be taken care of and shared with generations to come,” said Congressman Comer. “I was thrilled when the House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the Land Between the Lakes Recreation and Heritage Act and was pleased to see the Senate Natural Resources Committee also advance the bill. I will continue to work with local stakeholders, former residents, and Senator McConnell to advance this important legislation and preserve this treasured area.” LBL is a United States national recreation area in Kentucky and Tennessee covering 171,280 acres between Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake. For the two Kentucky counties encompassing LBL, Lyon and Trigg, the recreation area provides a site for activities like fishing, boating, camping, and hiking, and attracts millions of tourists each year. Senator McConnell has worked for decades to streamline and preserve funding for LBL. Congress passed the Senator’s Land Between the Lakes Protection Act into law in 1998 to put LBL under the stable administration of the U.S. Forest Service and provide significant federal resources to support its maintenance.Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/key-senate-committee-approves-mcconnell-and-comer-bill-to-protect-land-between-the-lakes"

Russia’s invasion has already reminded the West that revisionist aggressors cannot be appeased. And Ukraine’s brave resistance, equipped with the arsenal of the free world, is a further reminder that this is a fight they intend to win.“The Senate should be proud of our work over the past several months to get more lethal capabilities into Ukrainian hands. But at every step of the way the Biden Administration has been slow to green-light the game-changing weapons Ukraine’s frontline defenders need.“I urged the President for more than a year to take specific actions to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine before it escalated.“Last June, I urged him to deliver lethal capabilities to Ukraine and other states in Vladimir Putin’s crosshairs. Instead, the Administration slow-walked security assistance for months.“In December, I called for U.S. military reinforcements along NATO’s eastern flank. But the President waited until February to deploy forces – too late to deter Putin’s aggression.“And even after Russia had launched its unlawful invasion, the President has repeatedly deterred himself from providing Ukraine the capabilities it needs. “With nearly every weapons system requested by Ukraine, the cycle in Washington plays out like this:“First, hesitation and concern. Then, excuses that Ukraine couldn’t effectively use the proposed weapons. Or objections that providing them would escalate the conflict. Then, grudging willingness to transfer the weapons.“And finally, with weapons in Ukrainian hands, self-congratulations from the Biden Administration that they’re having a positive impact on the battlefield.“It is exhausting to watch this decision-making cycle repeat itself from Kentucky.  It must be exasperating to watch it from Kyiv.“Madam President, the need for advanced, longer-range weapons to turn back Russia’s aggression is painfully obvious.“Air defense capabilities to combat Russia’s continuing long-range strikes against civilian populations across Ukraine…“Anti-ship weapons to combat the Russia’s Black Sea blockade, and the humanitarian food crisis it’s causing worldwide…“And more capable, longer-range artillery to pound Russian positions in occupied Ukraine from relative safety. This will help offset any numerical advantage Russia has achieved by pumping so much combat power into its invasion force.“Putin cannot be allowed to believe he can just wait for the West to get complacent. “It would do a moral disservice to the brave Ukrainians fighting every day for their country. But this is not just about Ukraine’s security. If Russia achieves its objectives in Ukraine, it will imperil our own security.“And if we waver on Ukraine, it would certainly send an unmistakable signal of weakness to Beijing, which is watching the conflict in Ukraine closely.  “For their part, so are our friends and allies in China’s backyard. As Japan’s Prime Minister put it back in May, ‘Ukraine might be east Asia tomorrow.’“Madam President, Russia’s brutal war has cost the people of Ukraine their homes, their safety, and their lives. But it’s also reawakened the West to the reality of long-term deterrence and competition.“It’s led modern partners like Sweden and Finland to cast their lot with the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it’s prompted current treaty allies to shake off years of neglect for their own defensive capabilities. All of this will result in greater burden-sharing, interoperability, military capability, and collective security for the NATO alliance. “The United States cannot afford to neglect this lesson, ourselves. As the leader of the free world and the number one target of revisionist adversaries like China and Russia, we have to take seriously our obligation to maintain America’s military superiority.“We need to act quickly and pass a defense authorization bill that restores our readiness, grows our stockpiles of critical munitions, reinforces our position along NATO’s Eastern Flank, and lays the foundations for a new era of credible deterrence in Asia by modernizing and equipping our military for real competition with China.“I hope the Democratic Leader will let the Senate take action on this critical legislation without further delay.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/senate-must-act-swiftly-to-support-american-military-superiority-deter-aggressors"

Of course, consumer spending has only gone up because the price of nearly everything has increased.“A recent economic analysis shows the American people do spend more on gas, groceries, furniture, and clothes than we used to. But ‘adjusted for inflation, they are actually consuming less.’“Parents of school-age kids are some of the hardest hit. Four in ten say they won’t go back-to-school shopping before this upcoming school year. One young mother in Nevada says she’ll ‘pick out one or two shirts,’ for her daughter, ‘and that’s it.’ Inflation has made everything else too expensive.“In Arizona, inflation forces the average household to spend over $9,600 more a year compared to when President Biden took office. Many families simply don’t have that much wiggle room in their budget and are resorting to desperate measures to stay afloat.“One Phoenix-area food bank has seen a 78% increase in visitors compared with last year. 78% more families who simply can’t afford to live in this Democrat-run economy.“A woman in line at the food bank said she’d never needed to visit one before. But, ‘the prices are way too high’ right now to support four children on her husband’s salary.“Colorado families are facing the highest inflation costs in the nation: nearly $10,900 in extra spending per year compared to the beginning of the Biden Administration.“Not surprisingly, Coloradans are falling behind on paying for daily necessities. One pawn shop owner in the state has noticed a marked increase in loan seekers at his business. For most of them, they just need ‘30 bucks, 40 bucks,’ to ‘pay small bills, get gas, put groceries on the table.’“This is all happening in my home state of Kentucky, too. People are taking out loans, cutting back spending, and relying on charity just to cope with ever-increasing prices. But that hasn’t stopped Washington Democrats from proposing new ways to wreck our economy.“As we speak, they’re batting around a new suite of tax hikes aimed squarely at the middle class. If Democrat-driven inflation hasn’t pushed struggling families off the edge just yet, a Democrat-driven recession certainly will.“What’s on the menu? New taxes on small businesses already struggling with inflation. New fees and regulations on American energy producers that will send prices even higher at the pump. New socialist price control schemes to stifle healthcare innovation.“Apparently, record inflation isn’t enough to make Democrats realize their reckless economic agenda is a failure.

Gasoline is nearly 60% more expensive than it was last summer. Natural gas is up nearly 40% in that same time.“Washington Democrats have surveyed this scene and decided it’s the perfect time to hike taxes on American energy.“Reviving a failed tax from the 1980s on American oil refiners and exporters and increasing it by nearly 60%.“New, sky-high fees on America’s natural gas producers.“And more pain at the pump for working families.“It’s an insane proposition.“But there does appear to be an exception:“If you’re not among the 75% of Americans who say inflation has caused you financial hardship, and you happen to have a spare $80,000 laying around, Washington Democrats want to give you a ‘green energy tax credit’ if you buy an electric vehicle made with Chinese supply chains.“This is what Washington Democrats are trying to do with their one-party control of government. And they’re hoping President Biden will declare a national emergency to help them do it faster.“Well, unfortunately for the far left, the President is occupied with a climate conundrum of his own.“On the campaign trail, Candidate Biden left no room for doubt that he had bought his party’s new radical climate dogma, whole-hog.“‘I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel.’ Sure enough, his first year in office was an all-out assault on American energy, just like green activists drew it up.“Day One bans on new energy exploration.“Cancelling a safe, efficient, pipeline that was set to create American jobs.“And ghoulish, reanimated regulations from the War on Coal.“But unlike the radical base that’s frustrated their ideas aren’t moving faster, the Biden Administration now appears to be concerned that their assault on American energy has worked too quickly.“Americans have seen gas prices double on this President’s watch.

And big majorities of Americans don’t like what Democrats are doing about it.“But rather than call off the onslaught and clear the way for a return to domestic energy dominance, the Biden Administration has dispatched officials to beg other countries to take over America’s share of the market for reliable energy that the President has purposefully abandoned.“They’ve literally chosen places like Venezuela over states like Pennsylvania… or Texas… or Alaska.“Then, on a trip last week to oil-rich Saudi Arabia, President Biden announced:“‘I’m doing all I can to increase the [oil] supply for the United States of America.’“The President who promised he’d, ‘end fossil fuels’ thinks that finding more energy for American families means flying to the Middle East and asking politely instead of unleashing our own production here at home.“And for the record, U.S. producers extract oil and gas in a far more environmentally friendly manner than many of their competitors overseas. So if the priority is reducing our environmental impact, outsourcing seems more than a little short-sighted.“Mr. President, if the Biden Administration really is serious about helping American consumers, then they’ll stop waging war on American producers.“If they’re serious, they’ll call off Democrats’ plans to tax reliable American energy into extinction.“For the sake of working families who are struggling to fill their tanks and keep the lights on, I hope they get serious sometime soon.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-war-on-domestic-energy-hurts-american-producers-and-families"

It will make America more secure.“I hope the Democratic Leader will waste no time in bringing these protocols before the full Senate.“I’ve been a strong advocate for American global leadership and our transatlantic partnerships my entire career. They’ve made possible the unprecedented era of peace and prosperity Americans have experienced in my lifetime.“NATO is at its best when allies share the burden of our collective security. When we all have skin in the game. NATO allies recognized in 2014, after prodding by American presidents from both parties, that they needed to invest more in capabilities to keep pace with growing threats.“During the previous Administration, current member states made progress towards this 2% pledge. Finland, for its part, already spends 2% of its GDP on defense. And Sweden has the same target in its sights.“For years, both countries have participated actively in NATO exercises. They’ve cultivated professional fighting forces, invested in cutting-edge interoperable technologies, and built robust military-industrial bases with strong connections to our own.“I know from my conversations with the leaders of Finland and Sweden that they are sober about the threats we face, committed to building their own defense capabilities, and serious about their responsibilities to contribute to our collective security.“Together, they’ve set an example that many current treaty allies would do well to follow. And with Finland and Sweden at the table, I look forward to important deliberations about the capabilities we need as an alliance and the steps we must urgently take to defend ourselves against growing threats from Russia, China, and other adversaries.“Mr. President, I know from my visits with our Swedish and Finnish friends that they hope for rapid accession to NATO. They’re ready to get to work alongside us as allies. With war raging on the European continent, I share their sense of urgency, and I urge the Democratic Leader to call up the necessary Senate votes without delay.“But that can’t be the Senate’s last word on how America and our allies face down a dangerous world. We need to take urgent action on the National Defense Authorization Act.“Russia is laying siege to a sovereign neighbor. China is flexing a rapidly modernizing military.

And yet, for most of my career, I have had to push back against Democrats’ repeated attempts to unlearn this fundamental Constitutional lesson. I have repeatedly defended Americans’ right to join together and voice opinions.“Prior to McCain-Feingold, almost all money in politics ran through candidates and party committees. I warned that placing unconstitutional restrictions on speech in that bill was like putting a rock on Jell-O – it wouldn’t quash political speech, it would just displace it. And the Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed that point, in case after case upholding free speech.“Our Democratic colleagues’ obsession with regulating political speech is what created the environment they now disapprove of. It’s what drove support for McCain-Feingold. And it’s what spawned this perennial bill in 2010.“Democrats want to pass a law that put discourse in the hands of the mob. But, needless to say, they haven’t always been very concerned with compelling disclosure using laws on the books.“Existing law already requires disclosure of donations to PACs and other outside groups with the intention of influencing federal elections.“But even as our colleagues have introduced successive versions of this DISCLOSE Act, enterprising activist liberals have taken it upon themselves to ‘name and shame’ conservatives by ‘outing’ their private contributions illegally. It was practically Administration policy under the Obama-Biden IRS!“And for those keeping score, Washington Democrats never seem as eager to publicize the donor rolls of groups whose political views they share.“Somehow, donor privacy for organizations pursuing liberal causes is sacrosanct, but donor privacy for groups with conservative beliefs is a threat to democracy.“Somehow, working for outside groups is practically a prerequisite for a West Wing job under a Democratic president, but association with groups Democrats don’t like is a one-way ticket to picketing and harassment.“64 years ago, the Supreme Court said the link between the freedom of association and the freedom of speech was ‘beyond debate’. But today’s Democratic Party wants to make sure the threat to associational privacy is every bit as real as it was back in 1958.“The stakes are so clear, even liberal groups like the ACLU have joined the NAACP and Senate Republicans in continuing to sound the alarm. They have been working together to fight state-level public disclosure laws all the way to the Supreme Court.“Last year, the Court sided with these advocates to strike down predatory disclosure practices in California. Earlier this month, the Ninth Circuit did the same to an unconstitutionally vague disclosure law in Montana.“Meanwhile, the federal judiciary itself is contending with particularly outrageous threats from the radical left to the privacy and security of judges and their families.“The same liberal groups stoking mob intimidation outside the homes of Supreme Court justices are the ones most eager to ‘out’ private citizens’ political speech records.“The same Democrats who refused to condemn naked threats against public officials earlier this summer once again want to expand the federal government’s power to threaten private citizens.“That’s not a trade the American people or their Constitution can afford to make.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/mcconnell-freedoms-of-speech-and-association-are-bedrock-american-liberties"

The average American worker got a full 1% pay cut just last month alone due to inflation.“The Biden Administration has tried to claim that we’re, ‘stronger economically than we have been in history.’ That’s what the White House Press Secretary told reporters earlier this month.“But Kentuckians know that’s absurd. They know the opposite is true.“In my home state, the average household now spends over $600 more every month compared to the day President Biden took his oath of office. That comes out to more than $7,300 a year.“Inflation is pushing Kentucky families to the brink. As a result, food bank demand is rising and shelves are running low.“A soup kitchen in Campbell County put out an urgent call for volunteers as surging visitors threaten to overwhelm its limited staff.“As the Executive Director said in an interview, with ‘inflation and milk [at] $4 a gallon,’ they see people who’ve ‘never needed help before.’“I’ve received messages from constituents all over the Commonwealth facing the same crisis: prices are rising while real wages fall.“A 59-year-old from Louisville tells me she’s worked two jobs since she graduated college in 1987 to save for retirement. Now, she’s afraid she’ll ‘lose [her] hard-earned money… due to this inflation.’“Another constituent in Hopkins County tells me he worked sixty hours a week for years to afford the home he bought recently.“Now, with rising prices, he ‘can’t even support [his] family anymore’ and might lose his new house.“A couple in Lexington in their late seventies spends almost all of their fixed income on rent, utilities, and medical bills. They’re struggling to find enough left over for food. ‘What are we suppose[d] to do?’ they ask.“Families across Kentucky are asking themselves the same question every day. “The answer from Washington Democrats is alarming, but not surprising.

This DISCLOSE Act is just one more example of a troubling tendency on today’s political left: Quit trying to play by the rules and demanding a change in the rules instead.“The DISCLOSE Act was a key pillar of the sweeping election takeover Democrats have been trying to pass since they lost an election in 2016. For years, they’ve failed to convince majorities in Congress – or among the American people – that the future of our democracy requires the playing field to be tilted toward their side.“But failing to overhaul the system hasn’t stopped liberals from sabotaging the guardrails that protect political speech from the inside.“Remember, the naming and shaming of conservatives for ‘wrong think’ was practically an official policy back in the Obama-Biden IRS.“More recently, leaked confidential taxpayer information from the IRS wound up in the hands of liberal publications just in time for tax debates on the Hill.“Now Washington Democrats want to grease the skids for more.“Needless to say, whether or not disclosure was legal hasn’t been a primary concern for the liberals behind these leaks in recent years.“But to the extent our Democratic colleagues want to have a conversation about laws on the books, donations to political action committees are already disclosed to the FEC. So are donations to 501c4 organizations aimed at influencing federal elections.“In other words, existing law has already thought of this.“What our colleagues want to do is newly expand the definition of political speech and stretch disclosure requirements.“They want Americans who oppose them politically to have to either abandon their privacy or abandon the public square.“They want conservatives to choose between their livelihoods or their political beliefs. The chilling effect on Americans’ speech is by design, not by coincidence.“The same liberal groups that urged radical mobs to intimidate Supreme Court Justices outside their private family homes… and the same elected Democratic officials who refused to condemn that illegal intimidation… now want to systematically ‘out’ ordinary private citizens’ private donations and political speech.“The pro-intimidation, anti-privacy modern left wants less privacy surrounding the First Amendment. It doesn’t take much connecting the dots to see why.“Even the liberal ACLU warned years ago that what liberals want here, ‘unconstitutionally infringes on freedom of speech and the right to associational privacy’.“More recently, the NAACP and the ACLU teamed up in fighting state-level public disclosure laws at the Supreme Court – on the same side as myself and several other Republican Senators. They reiterated the landmark ruling in NAACP v. Alabama that ‘Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.’“But today’s Democrats disagree.“Over the years, Washington Democrats have cycled through a litany of reasons for passing their sweeping takeover of American elections. But while the rationales change constantly, the goal never changes an inch.“More power for elected Democrats to rewrite the rules of their own elections… and more power for the political left to harass and intimidate citizens who don’t think like them.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-threaten-americans-privacy-and-political-speech"

And as things stand right now, it appears our colleagues intend to work from a familiar left-wing playbook in the coming weeks.“Washington Democrats are working right now to find ways to put more bureaucracy between American patients and the treatments they’ll rely on. They want to put socialist price controls between American innovators and new cures for debilitating diseases.  “With one-party, Democrat control of government, they might get away with it. But our colleagues need to think again. Even just the medicine-related parts of their partisan plans would have hugely negative consequences for our country.“The American people know that government can’t magically make things cost less by passing laws saying things should cost less.“There’s no Washington magic wand – trust me – or else we’d have every American driving $1 pickup trucks and eating $1 steaks, just by passing a law setting those prices at one dollar!“There’s no such thing as a free lunch, Madam President. The bill for made-up price controls always comes due.“In this case, the invoice will be delivered to the American people who are living with actual health challenges.“The price of bigger government will be fewer lifesaving cures. Less innovation in the future.“Let’s face it. Prescription treatments are expensive to produce. Long-term investments in cutting-edge research and development require certainty.“What Washington Democrats want to do right now would bleed hundreds of billions of dollars in potential R&D out of American industry.“Shrinking the pipeline for new therapeutics for patients with chronic conditions.“Pouring cold water on the next breakthroughs in the fight against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.“Prescription drug socialism would have devastating and compounding effects. By one analysis, price controls like the ones Washington Democrats want to ram through could cost more than 330 million cumulative years of life expectancy. That’s enough to shorten every American’s life by a full year.“Two years ago, in 2020, America’s medical innovators were busy blowing away expectations and responding to a once-in-a-century pandemic with lifesaving therapeutics and vaccines in record time.“Two years later, in 2022, Democrats have decided that what these same innovators need is heavy-handed Washington micromanagement from the same politicians who couldn’t even keep baby formula on store shelves.“Our country is contending with historic inflation.

The painful fallout of Washington Democrats’ 2021 spending binge continues to spread.“A loaf of bread costs the American consumer 10% more than it did a year ago.“A dozen eggs will run you 33% more.“The price of a gallon of gas, of course, rose more than 100% on Democrats’ watch.“Across the board, the American people’s hard-earned dollars are not going nearly as far as before Democrats’ inflation. Even as nominal wages rise, millions of families have seen their real income decrease.“A net pay cut for workers, courtesy of Washington Democrats’ runaway spending.“No wonder 3 out of 4 Americans say inflation is causing them financial hardship. 75% of the country is in a tough spot.“Of course, it’s not affecting everyone equally. The lowest-earning Americans consistently spend larger portions of their incomes on the sort of essentials that are most expensive right now, from housing to fuel to groceries.“And workers in blue-collar industries are among those having the hardest time keeping up.“U.S. manufacturing workers are seeing their lowest average earnings – adjusted for inflation – since 2014, while the overall private-sector workforce is seeing wages at 2019 levels.“Unfortunately, these hardships show little sign of slowing anytime soon. Last month’s core inflation, when compared to just a few months earlier, is actually accelerating.“So we’ve got the worst inflation since 1981. The vast majority of Americans are saying it has them in a bind financially. And it’s low- and middle-income families who are bearing the brunt of it.“This is the landscape as Washington Democrats keep trying to force even more party-line liberal bills with even more new Washington spending and – for a bonus – massive new tax hikes.“For the better part of a year, our colleagues have been trying to cook up legislation that would make life harder for small businesses, attack affordable American energy, and hike income taxes on families in every single tax bracket.“Apparently for most Washington Democrats, spending the country into inflation wasn’t enough.

Ferguson with Brown v. Board in 1954.“It was the best Supreme Court term in generations.“The Court corrected one of the worst moral and legal mistakes of the 20th century and returned power to the American people to implement popular and commonsense protections for unborn life and bring America back inside the global mainstream.“The Court handed down two historic wins for religious liberty, rolling back decades of infringement on the rights of Americans to worship and raise families as they choose.“The Court strengthened the rights of law-abiding Americans to defend themselves outside the home in a resounding reaffirmation of the Second Amendment.“And the Court took a huge bite out of the unconstitutional ‘administrative state’ and rolled back a big part of the Obama-Biden Administration’s totally illegal ‘Clean Power Plan.’“With electricity prices skyrocketing on Democrats’ watch, experts warning about impending summer blackouts, and more pain at the gas pump, the last thing Americans need is a holy war on fossil fuels that Congress never authorized.“The Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA was a victory for working Americans, and a reminder that the power to make law rests with their elected representatives, not unelected bureaucrats.“But today I want to talk about something that runs even deeper than these historic rulings.“As in any high-profile term, last month, the Court arrived at rulings that some politicians and some citizens like more than others.“Goodness knows that I have been disappointed in my share of Supreme Court rulings over the years, including some extremely consequential cases.“Going back decades, there have been countless times when the federal judiciary has left conservative citizens feeling every bit as disappointed in a particular outcome as far-left activists seem to feel now.“After all, the courts don’t exist to enforce any one political ideology or policy agenda. The Justices’ sacred job is to follow the written text of our laws and Constitution wherever it leads them and let the chips fall where they may.“But there’s something funny, Madam President.“I can’t recall any time when our side of the aisle engaged in prolonged mob protests outside judges’ private family homes.“The attacks on the judiciary, on this fundamental institution of our society, seem to only run in one direction.“A few weeks ago, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Democratic Leader teamed up to issue a frankly unhinged statement. Most of the top Democrats in the country followed suit.“Their reckless statements did not stop, indeed barely even took a pause, when a disturbed left-wing person very nearly tried to assassinate a sitting Justice.“Frankly, the inflammatory tone of all these attacks echoed the furious attacks on the Court from the Democrats of the day after Brown overturned Plessy in 1954.“We are hearing absurd calls from the far left to have Congress politically persecute individual Justices because of their view of the law. They want to take off Lady Justice’s blindfold and scare the Court into becoming politically partial.“And this didn’t start now. Sadly, it’s been years in the making.“Along the path to this moment, the far left has been stoked by reckless rhetoric from Democrats in elected office.“Like the amicus brief from several Senators that declared the Court ‘unwell’ and warned it to ‘heal itself before the public demands it be ‘restructured’.’“Or the named threats – from the Democratic Leader, himself – that sitting Justices would ‘pay the price’ for ruling in ways he didn’t like.“Madam President, we’ve spent a year and a half now hearing Democrats say over and over again that a core principle of democracy is accepting the legitimacy of an outcome when you don’t like it.“Our colleagues need to practice what they wish to preach.”###Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-attacks-on-the-supreme-court-are-reckless-and-dangerous"

And the signs are inescapable. Price hikes on everything from food to fuel to housing are setting new multi-decade highs.“A shopper in Oregon told a reporter recently she doesn’t buy beef anymore. ‘We kind of try to eat what we have while we have it.’ Yesterday, we learned exactly what she and millions of Americans are up against: the fastest-rising grocery prices since 1979.“In Nevada, the owner of a local diner says, ‘My concerns are that my food costs have escalated dramatically. I used to gut wrench about (raising menu prices) 2 or 3 percent. Now, it’s way more than that just to keep my doors open.’“Yesterday’s report says he’s not alone – nationwide prices on food outside the home haven’t risen this fast since 1981.“And this new reality is especially frustrating for those working to help. As the head of one South Dakota food bank put it, ‘The donation load has seemed to lighten up… When we give out food boxes, they’re not as full as they used to be.’“Right as working families are struggling the most, so are the organizations trying to help. Just one more cruel twist of Washington Democrats’ runaway inflation.“One of the first and most painful consequences of the Biden Administration’s failed policies has been the soaring costs of energy.“Remember, on their party’s watch, the cost of heating a home rose by double-digit percentages last winter. Electricity prices climbed at their fastest rate since 2006. And prices at the gas pump have doubled since President Biden took office.“One Pennsylvania woman said that ever since her heating bill skyrocketed last winter, she’s had to scale back her spending big-time. ‘I need to hide under my bed and save every dollar I can.’“And in Maryland, one retiree reports that ‘skyrocketing gas prices mean that visits to the local library – about 5 miles round trip – no longer feel free.’“From Day One, the Biden Administration has worked overtime to make it harder to produce the most affordable and reliable forms of energy Americans rely on right here at home. Now, as their radical climate agenda takes its toll on domestic production, millions of Americans are facing the possibility of summer blackouts.“The heartland, the West, and the Southwest face the highest risks. The people of Arizona and Nevada, for example, are already at what the experts call ‘elevated risk’ for this summer.“Are Arizonans and Nevadans clamoring for a new tax hike on natural gas electricity on top of everything else? I don’t think so.“Are they desperate to double down on the very unreliable green sources that set us up for these blackouts in the first place? I don’t think so.“Our electric grid is overburdened already, but Democrats apparently want to strain it even more by eliminating the most reliable sources of energy we have. All the while spending hundreds billions on schemes that depend on Chinese minerals, components and supply chains.“Trading American energy independence for less reliable sources that depend on forced child labor and foreign producers with questionable environmental standards.“Is this what our colleagues think will usher in a big transition to their green daydreams? Washington Democrats are the only ones who would define higher energy costs and lower reliability as a victory.“Real-life Americans know that higher costs and rolling blackouts are just two more symptoms of a failed government with failed leadership pushing failed policies.“Working families are still reeling from the time Democrats decided to spend us into inflation.

One leading economist recently said the so-called American Rescue Plan was ‘arguably the biggest fiscal policy mistake in several decades.’“Our core inflation here in America is more than two percentage points higher than in Europe. Inflation is uniquely bad here because our all-Democrat government has made uniquely bad choices. And now American families are dealing with the fallout every day.“It’s no secret how much the American people disapprove of the course Washington Democrats have put us on. They say so in poll after poll. So you might think by now that our colleagues would be ready to try a different approach.“Guess again. President Biden and his party, fresh off of spending America into inflation, now want to tax-hike us into recession.“They’re behind closed doors, playing around with what may amount to the single largest tax increase in American history.“Tucked inside are exactly the sort of radical ideas that working families can least afford right now.“They want a giant tax hike on pass-through small businesses, a category that encompasses 95% of all businesses in the country. Take it from a constituent of mine in Mount Sterling Kentucky who put it this way: ‘Small business is already [in] a struggle to survive with all the taxes and regulations we have to deal with. Adding another tax is only making things worse.’“Democrats also want a so-called ‘methane fee’ that amounts to a big new tax hike on domestic natural gas. While their inflation has pushed families’ natural gas prices and electricity costs through the roof already.“If following reckless spending and runaway inflation with gigantic, painful tax hikes sounds like a bad idea to you, you aren’t alone. Even some House Democrats are lighting their hair on fire over what a terrible idea these discussions are.“One House Democrat from New Jersey is telling reporters that she is, ‘not for any type of legislation that raises taxes… especially right now, as my constituents are facing inflation, cost of living [increases], … housing prices.’“Well, Madam President, let me put it this way: When House Democrats from the Northeast start trying to sound like Ronald Reagan running against Jimmy Carter, you know they’ve gotten themselves into a fix.“Too bad every single House Democrat except one, and every single Senate Democrat, voted for the $2 trillion mistake that brought us here. The Democrats complaining about inflation today voted in lockstep for the bill that brought us here.“And now their answer to picking families’ pockets once… is to now pick families’ pockets a second time?!“The same Democrats who spent us into inflation now want to tax us right into recession.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/democrats-runaway-inflation-hits-another-40-year-high"

A sort of crime spree against the Constitution. “For example, when Democrats could not get harmful and unpopular environmental restrictions through Congress — because the people’s duly elected representatives did not support them — the bureaucrats at the Obama EPA decided to pretend that some obscure lines in an old law actually gave them enormous sweeping regulatory powers to manage our economy which nobody had ever noticed before.“The EPA effectively wrote and passed a giant piece of legislation, the so-called ‘Clean Power Plan,’ as one branch of government acting alone. They tried to make law without involving the actual lawmakers.“The Obama EPA just up and decided they could start giving orders and issuing edicts and remake our country’s electricity grid by brute force.“Of course, that pretext was simply false.“As Justice Scalia once wrote, ‘Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.’“When the legislative branch actually intends to hand over giant chunks of our power to unelected bureaucrats, we make it pretty darn clear. The Obama-Biden EPA had no lawful authority to grab control of electricity generation across America.“And that is exactly what the Supreme Court affirmed last month.“The ruling was a huge win for American ratepayers and anybody who wants affordable and reliable energy. But it was also a landmark legal victory for our very system of government.“The Supreme Court applied the plain text of the law and reaffirmed that the unelected administrative state is not allowed to reach way beyond the powers that Congress has actually given it.“With any luck, this will be part of a sea change that’s been a long a time coming.“Remember, a few months ago, a young district judge in Florida applied the plain, straightforward text of a statute and overturned the Administration’s illegal and unilateral mask mandate for public transportation.“That was the Centers for Disease Control stepping way over its boundaries.“And this past January, the Supreme Court put the brakes on President Biden’s blatantly illegal attempt to have the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, force 84 million American workers to get the COVID vaccine whether they wanted it or not.“As Justice Gorsuch wrote in concurrence back then: ‘The central question we face today is: Who decides?’ ‘The only question is whether an administrative agency in Washington… charged with overseeing workplace safety may mandate the vaccination or regular testing of 84 million people…“‘Or whether… that work belongs to state and local governments across the country and the people’s elected representatives in Congress.’“On issue after issue, our courts are beginning to answer that question the way the Constitution commands. Who decides? The people decide. And the members of Congress they elect.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/courts-slap-down-democrats-lawless-power-grabs"
http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=6D770103-5CC8-446C-8E99-EBBD562AE2E2,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor regarding the economy:“We all know inflation and the economy are the biggest problems facing Americans today.“The New York Times released a poll yesterday showing a full 93% of working-age Americans are dissatisfied with the state of our economy.“We are a big and diverse country. 93% of Americans hardly ever agree on anything. But Democrats are unifying the country in unhappiness at the dark path down which they’ve taken our economy.“Monmouth University released some data explaining why Americans are feeling so sour.“42% of Americans are struggling to stay afloat financially. That’s the highest rate ever in this poll’s history, even higher than the darkest days of the COVID pandemic.“63% of Americans name economic issues as their chief concern. And they know who to blame for their misfortune: President Biden and congressional Democrats, who plowed $2 trillion into our economy last year and created the highest inflation in four decades.“I’m sure many of my colleagues heard heart-wrenching stories from constituents struggling with inflation during the past two weeks’ state work period.“I certainly did in Kentucky, where the average household now spends more than $500 more a month than they did before President Biden took office.“At a meeting with homebuilders in Northern Kentucky, local employers told me their business is poised to slow down dramatically.“For two years, they struggled as Washington Democrats exacerbated supply chain hiccups and worker shortages with freewheeling spending policies.“Now, as the Fed tries to rein in inflation by hiking interest rates, homebuyers have to contend with the most expensive borrowing environment in over a decade. Home builders foresee their industry stalling out.“In Paducah, I sat down with some of Western Kentucky’s barge operators. Like the home builders, they are concerned with ongoing worker shortages, inflation, and spiraling fuel costs.“They’re also rightly worried that power outages could hit the Commonwealth in the coming months.“Washington Democrats pursued environmental goals crafted by activists with no sense of how the real economy functions. They sidelined power plants that use cheap, reliable energy sources without acknowledging that shortages would occur when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.“Independent electricity reliability experts have been sounding the alarm that two thirds of the United States could endure electricity blackouts this summer. “Then, Kentucky’s ongoing labor shortage hit home during a meeting with bourbon distillers in our famous Bluegrass region.“As the distillers explained to me, the programs implemented by Washington Democrats in their $2 trillion spending package last year encouraged workers to exit the workforce and stay on the sidelines. The Commonwealth still has 20,000 fewer workers than we did before the pandemic.“Hamstrung by a lack of employees, these Kentucky business owners are watching apprehensively as Washington Democrats debate another big dose of bad policies. This time, our colleagues are reportedly cooking up a trillion dollars in massive tax hikes on things like small businesses and domestic energy.“When you tax something, Mr. President, you get less of it. I don’t know many Kentuckians who think America needs fewer small business jobs or less American energy. I’m not certain about the good people of West Virginia, either.“One estimate has found that almost half of all the jobs in all of West Virginia are tied to small businesses, the vast majority of which are pass-throughs. Half of all the jobs in the entire state.“I can’t imagine the people Pennsylvania, or Ohio, or a number of other states are especially keen to have fewer small business jobs, higher prices passed along to consumers, or less American energy, either. Yet each of those states and many others have a Senator apparently keen to champion these bad ideas.“The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has proven that the policies that Democrats are floating would completely break President Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on the middle class below $400,000.“The JCT says their bad ideas would create a tax hike for more than a quarter of all Americans who earn between $75,000 and $100,000, and more than half of people earning between $100,000 and $200,000.“They are taking President Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on anybody below $400,000 and putting it through the shredder.“This all-Democrat government has already spent America into runaway inflation, and now they want to tax us into recession.”Permalink: https://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/as-inflation-hammers-small-businesses-democrats-float-huge-small-business-tax-hike"
