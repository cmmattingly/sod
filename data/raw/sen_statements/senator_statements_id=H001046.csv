https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-new-mexico-supreme-court-upholds-public-stream-access-in-final-ruling,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, welcomed the New Mexico Supreme Court's final ruling to uphold public stream access.“Today our state Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional rights of all New Mexicans to their public waters. This is a an enormous victory for people who care about our history, our culture, and our natural resources. Public waters will remain public,” said Heinrich. “Many New Mexicans worked hard to make this happen, but I want to extend a special thank you to former New Mexico Game & Fish Commissioners Jeremy Vesbach and Joanna Prukop for their principled leadership.”Senator Heinrich is a long-time advocate for preserving New Mexico surface waters for recreational, wildlife, and environmental uses. In April 2020, Senator Heinrich and former U.S. Senator Tom Udall filed an amicus, or “friend of the court,” brief before the New Mexico Supreme Court to defend New Mexicans’ right under the state constitution to access public surface waters.The New Mexico Constitution expressly provides that rivers, streams, and lakes in New Mexico “belong to the public.” For 75 years, the New Mexico Supreme Court has recognized the public’s right to recreate, fish, and use these waters, including waters that flow through private lands. However, in 2017, in the last days of the Martinez administration, the State Game Commission passed a rule allowing landowners to prohibit public access to waters flowing on their lands if the waters are “non-navigable.” Not only is the rule contrary to the state constitution, it impacts the vast majority of New Mexico’s streams which – whether they flow all the time, intermittently, or just in response to rain events – are not “navigable.”"

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-democratic-colleagues-urge-cdc-hhs-to-monitor-and-address-racial-disparities-in-monkeypox-virus-response,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) joined 11 colleagues led by U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track and address racial disparities in the nation’s public health response to the monkeypox virus (MPV).“Similar to the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is disproportionately affecting Black and Latino Americans,” wrote the senators in a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited data/reporting on cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and tests disaggregated by race or ethnicity made it difficult to assess its implications across communities….Over time, federal, state and local data showed that the majority of COVID-19 cases and fatalities affected people of color, with most illnesses and deaths occurring in regions with higher percentages of Black and Latino populations.”“The devastating racial and ethnic disparities during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the underlying social, economic, and health inequality that has long existed within our health care system due to racial and discriminatory systemic and structural barriers, and the disparities began to narrow with targeted education, outreach, and resource distribution,” continued the senators.The senators highlighted that existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care continue to be seen with the spread of MPV across the country. As of the end of July, Black and Latino people accounted for 26% and 32% of MPV cases with known race and ethnicity information, respectively. Public health experts have expressed concern over the fact that white men appear to be receiving a disproportionately higher share of the MPV vaccine nationally which is undermining efforts to safeguard communities that are more susceptible and have less access to medical resources. “Lack of racially and ethnically disaggregated data on both diagnosis and treatment of MPV will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” highlighted the senators.The senators noted that “Limited state data that is available shows that we are headed towards a concerning trend.” A report issued by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows that although 70% of MPV cases are in Black men, Black North Carolinians have received less than a quarter of the vaccinations so far. Similar trends are cited in the letter for New Jersey, Atlanta metro area, and Chicago.“Vaccine access must be equitable, even in the face of high demand,” urged the senators. “Any federal targeted response and aid must not inadvertently stigmatize the ongoing public health crisis, but there should be intentional outreach to get resources to impacted communities. The implementation of a rapid and efficient vaccination program is essential to containing and eradicating MPV in communities across the United States. Collecting quality data is crucial to direct our vaccination and testing in the proper directions.”The letter was cosigned by U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Dr. Rev. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).Full text of the letter can be found here."

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-democratic-colleagues-urge-cdc-hhs-to-prevent-spread-of-monkeypox-by-improving-public-provider-awareness,"WASHINGTON — As more monkeypox virus (MPV) cases spring up across the country, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is leading a group of Democratic senators in a letter urging the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell to improve MPV awareness and education among the general public and health care providers.In the letter to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and HHS Assistant Secretary Dawn O'Connell, the senators write “Our response to COVID-19 highlighted the importance of clear and early communication from public health experts. It’s imperative that we apply this lesson to improve MPV awareness and education among the general public and health care providers.”According to the CDC, there are 8,934 cases confirmed in the United States, with more cases likely to be identified as testing increases. It is critical that providers receive the additional resources they may need to care for patients, and that general public has accurate and up-to-date information about how to stop the spread of MPV.Many providers currently lack familiarity in identifying and treating MPV infections, resulting in some patients seeing multiple health care professionals in order to be tested. This may lead to an increased infection risk for patients and increased spread within their families and providers.The senators are also calling on the CDS and HHS to ensure that the general public understands that MPV can spread among any population through direct contact with lesions, use of shared objects, and respiratory secretions in extended periods of close contact.The letter was signed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.).Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Assistant Secretary O’Connell and Director Walensky,We write to express concerns about the increasing number of monkeypox virus (MPV) cases in the United States and across the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are 2,323 cases confirmed in the United States, with more cases expected as testing increases. Our response to COVID-19 highlighted the importance of clear and early communication from public health experts. It’s imperative that we apply this lesson to improve MPV awareness and education among the general public and health care providers.Many health care providers lack familiarity in identifying, testing for, and treating MPV infections. In some cases, this lack of familiarity has resulted in patients seeing multiple health care professionals in order to be tested, even when they have had known exposures to MPV. Additionally, we have heard from patients who have never been formally diagnosed with MPV, but have had lesions removed. The lack of proper diagnosis and improper treatment has led to an increased infection risk for those patients and increased spread of MPV within their families and providers. This is extremely disturbing, and highlights that providers may need additional educational resources in order to effectively care for patients.We must ensure that the general public also has the most accurate and up to date information about how to stop the spread of MPV. Overemphasis on spread of MPV within a single population group can dangerously stigmatize that group, and simultaneously reduce the accurate diagnosis and treatment of MPV outside of that group. The reality is that MPV can spread among any population. Primarily spread through direct contact with lesions, it can also spread through shared objects, such as sheets, towels, soiled clothing, and bathmats, and transmitted through respiratory secretions in extended periods of close contact. It is crucial that the general public has accurate, clear, and accessible information about stopping the spread of MPV in order to protect their health and the health of their loved ones.In order to better understand the agencies’ efforts to stop the spread of MPV in the United States, we request responses to the following questions and a briefing with you and your staff to better understand your efforts to educate the health care providers and the public about MPV:Thank you for your continued commitment to the health and safety of all Americans. We look forward to your response and working with you to ensure we are providing the best possible resources for providers and the general public to fight MPV."

They can create major health benefits by replacing dirty fossil furnaces and gas stoves that are burning dangerous compounds into the indoor air in our homes. That means less children with asthma and less seniors with breathing problems that many of us don’t even realize are being caused by the appliances in our homes.“Because these electric technologies are more efficient and less expensive to operate, they will also help families across the country realize significant savings on their energy bills. This is particularly important at a time when so many Americans have been experiencing the pinch from inflation at the gas pump and in their gas and utility bills. We have moved mountains in the last year, and we are on the verge of getting something very deeply meaningful to the President’s desk.”Background:"

This legislation will be good for the economy, creating over 1.4 million jobs by building out domestic supply chains and manufacturing. It will also be good for our health, lower air pollution caused by fossil fuels will save lives, estimates are somewhere between 3,700 and 3,900 premature deaths will be averted. The Inflation Reduction Act makes the upfront transition to clean, electric appliances for example more within reach and cost effective for folks who don’t have thousands of dollars sitting around in their savings account. This bill will make it possible for folks to make the clean energy transition. With more clean power we don’t need to worry as much about the geopolitics that have caused so much of the recent rapid inflation in fossil fuels. We have to get it done now, and I look forward to celebrating once we have got this over the finish line,”said Smith.The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new rebate program that mirrors Senator Heinrich’s Zero-Emission Homes Act to provide upfront, point-of-sale rebates for the purchase and installation of electric appliances and equipment in single-family homes and multifamily buildings, with additional support for low- and moderate- income households.The latest research from Rewiring America indicates electrification provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act will enable one million low- and moderate-income households to go electric. Combined with electrification provisions offering tax rebates for American households, the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce U.S. carbon pollution 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.“Upon its passage, the Inflation Reduction Act represents the future of American energy independence. Where our current system is controlled by petro-state dictators and big oil, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act represents an alternate path forward. Key electrification provisions of the IRA offer savings to American households, through direct rebates, including relief to low-and moderate income families, and making electric appliances and vehicles more accessible and affordable. By passing this historic investment in electrification, leaders in Washington can provide Americans immediate relief from soaring energy costs and runaway inflation, as well as cut our never-ending reliance on fossil fuels,” said Ari Matusiak, Rewiring America CEO. “We are on the verge of an absolutely transformative bill. This is the bill we have been waiting in many ways for decades for Congress to actually pass. Efficiency is electrification. If we want to save energy in our society, we need to electrify everything. It turns out when we burn fossil fuels we lose about half of the energy, every step along the way. The Inflation Reduction Act will put us on a pathway to clean electricity, and electrification. That pathway is going to allow us to tackle the climate crisis by solving 75% of our current carbon pollution. We are going to save Americans across the country $1,800 per year on their energy bills if they get access to these clean technologies such as an electric vehicle, heat pump, heat pump hot water heater, induction stove and even solar panels. These clean energy investments are going to change the game. We are going to see clean electricity at a pace and scale we have never seen before. We are going to see clean and electric machines rolled out all across this country, and that’s absolutely critical. Our entire mission at Rewiring America is to electrify a billion machines in this country, so we cannot wait. We have got to get off the fossil fuel pathway, and into the clean energy future, creating American jobs in this country. This is a transformative bill, we are talking about creating the industries in the United States, and that is going to make it easier for us to get the next clean energy investment through Congress,” said Dr. Leah Stokes, Senior Policy Counsel for Rewiring America.Senator Heinrich’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:Hi everyone.Thank you so much for joining us.Rewiring America has been a tremendous partner in our effort to advance the vision of widespread electrification in the U.S.And we have a growing and highly motivated coalition of support all across this country.It is also an honor to be joined today by my colleague, and my fellow Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Electrification Caucus, Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota.I am so grateful for Senator Smith’s steady and determined leadership over these past months—and year really—to make sure we found a path forward on clean energy and electrification investments. I’m not sure anyone would ever describe the United States Senate as the most efficient machine.  But the clean energy and electrification investments that we ultimately secured in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 represent—by far—the most significant steps that Congress has ever taken to spur the widespread deployment of highly efficient, fully-electric, and climate pollution-free technologies.These electric technologies—from air-source heat pumps for home heating and water systems to induction stovetops and electric clothes dryers—have already leapfrogged their fossil fuel-powered alternatives in terms of both efficiency and performance. They can create major health benefits by replacing dirty fossil furnaces and gas stoves that are burning dangerous compounds into the indoor air in our homes.That means less children with asthma and less seniors with breathing problems that many of us don’t even realize are being caused by the appliances in our homes.When you pair them with clean and carbon pollution-free power generation—something the Inflation Reduction Act also invests in substantially through the revamped investment and production tax credits—these electric technologies are the tools that will allow us to solve the climate crisis.Because they are also much more efficient and less expensive to operate, they will also help families all across our country realize significant savings on their energy bills.This is particularly important at a time when so many Americans have been experiencing the pinch from inflation at the gas pump and in their gas and utility bills.These cost savings are one of the major reasons why many of the nation’s top economists have endorsed the Inflation Reduction Act.Let me quote from a letter sent to congressional leadership and signed by 126 leading economists—including former Treasury secretaries, a former Congressional Budget Office director, Nobel Prize winners, and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairs: “This legislation represents the single biggest step to date in tackling the climate crisis. It makes key investments to incentivize the transition to cleaner energy sources and greater efficiency. It also invests in the current energy distribution system to make it more resilient, lowers energy costs for families, and helps protect U.S. family budgets against future shocks.”That is exactly right.And that’s exactly why we need to move quickly to pass the Inflation Reduction Act into law.Before I finish, I want to go into a little more into detail on the specific piece of the bill that I spent so much time working on.That’s the $4.5 billion for new point-of-sale consumer rebates for electric household appliances.These rebates mirror the legislation that I introduced last year called the Zero-Emission Homes Act.This new funding will be distributed to both State and Tribal Energy agencies as grants so they can implement high-efficiency electric home rebate programs that can run through 2031. And the rebates will be allowed to go up to a maximum of $14,000 per household.That includes:These rebates will help to levelize the upfront costs of installing these appliances, and help many more Americans access the health, climate, and cost benefits of electrification.The Inflation Reduction Act also includes new tax credits to help more families purchase new and used electric vehicles.It includes major investments to supercharge our manufacturing base for clean and electric technologies—from heat pumps and wind turbines to batteries, solar components, and EVs—right here in America. And those revamped investment and production tax credits that I touched on earlier are not solely for wind and solar generation.I’m really excited that we are standing up my proposal for an Investment Tax Credit for energy storage, which is essential to shoring up reliability and resilience in the grid.This will be a 30% ITC for standalone storage projects.We have seen how these types of credits have spurred investment in wind projects over the last decade.And I'm very confident they can do the same for storage.There’s a lot to unpack in this bill.And I am excited to hear from my colleague about what she is most excited about in this.Thank you."

Secretary Vilsack was the witness. Recently, President Joe Biden announced a major disaster declaration for New Mexico. Senator Heinrich, along with the entire New Mexico Congressional Delegation, called for the administration to waive the federal cost-share for FEMA assistance. During the hearing, Senator Heinrich asked Secretary Vilsack if he would also work with him on reducing cost-share requirements for limited-resource communities seeking USDA disaster program assistance. Secretary Vilsack responded that he and the department would be “happy to work with [Senator Heinrich]” on what he referred to as an “appropriate request.”Secretary Vilsack also committed to strengthening resources and increasing staffing at Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) state offices, which help local communities access the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. Senator Heinrich noted the importance of EWP conducting assessments and implementation of recovery projects ahead of the monsoon season. He flagged that the Village of Ruidoso, which was subject to a wildfire that caused several fatalities and destroyed over 200 homes, has already requested EWP assistance, and many other communities in northern New Mexico will do so soon.Senator Heinrich also expressed that other disaster programs within the Farm Service Agency (FSA) will be crucial to help farmers and ranchers in New Mexico recover from wildfire losses. Senator Heinrich asked Secretary Vilsack to “look closely at FSA and really meet people in these communities [so that they] understand what they need to do to access [FSA programs].” Secretary Vilsack committed to putting surge teams in place at New Mexico FSA offices, if staffing is not adequate, to help communities access FSA programs, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, and be on the ground for community engagement.Full witness testimony and an archived video of today’s hearing can be found here."

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-va-secretary-agree-that-air-commission-data-on-veteran-health-care-needs-to-be-reassessed,"Current recommendations could impact the delivery of health care services at the community-based outpatient clinics, threaten health care services for rural New Mexico veteransWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), emphasized the importance of VA Secretary Denis McDonough providing reassessed data that will drive proposed changes to the delivery of VA health care services.In March, Senator Heinrich objected to recommendations that the VA provided for the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, which could impact the delivery of health care services at the community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in Gallup, Las Vegas, Española, and Raton.Senator Heinrich has pointed out that the AIR Commission relied on faulty and limited assessments based on data compiled from December 2018 to November 2020. This data does not accurately account for the severe health care shortages in New Mexico and the exacerbating impacts of COVID-19 on the health care market. Senator Heinrich brought up the data concerns during a Wednesday hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2023 Budget and Fiscal Year 2024 Advance Appropriations Requests for the VA. Secretary McDonough said that this is a “principal concern” of his, acknowledged that the data is dated, and expressed that the AIR Commission should update its recommendations once a separate assessment is completed.Senator Heinrich has invited the VA Secretary to join him at CBOCs in New Mexico for him to be able to see the on-the-ground impacts of the recommendations. During the hearing, Secretary McDonough voiced that he “hopes to spend time in New Mexico with [Senator Heinrich]” to assess veteran care infrastructure.New Mexico has the 9th largest percentage of veterans by state population that is not concentrated in an urban area. Nearly half of these veterans are over the age of 65, and due to illness and service-related disabilities, find it difficult to travel long distances for medical care.AIR Commission recommendations are the first step in a multi-year process—they can include remodeling, building new facilities, moving, closing facilities and changing services offered. The President recently nominated 8 individuals for the AIR Commission, all of whom will require Senate confirmation. Under the law, all VA proposals are required to be reviewed by the Commission, the President, and Congress.Background:"

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/chair-heinrich-opens-milcon-va-appropriations-subcommittee-hearing-to-review-fy23-budget-fy24-advance-budget-request-for-va,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies opened a hearing to review the Fiscal Year 2023 Budget and Fiscal Year 2024 Advance Appropriations Requests for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).VIDEO: Chair Heinrich Opens MilCon, VA Appropriations Subcommittee HearingU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis R. McDonough is the witness.Testimony and an archived video of the full hearing will be available here. Senator Heinrich’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below.Good afternoon. This hearing of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee is now called to order.I’d like to begin by welcoming Denis McDonough, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.We appreciate the efforts of VA’s dedicated staff to provide care and support to veterans, their families and communities every day, and especially their efforts during the pandemic.It greatly expanded its telehealth capacity, and adapted its essential services including housing, education and training to better serve veterans, including those experiencing homelessness.Today we will discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs’ fiscal years 2023 budget and 2024 advance appropriations requests.Veterans deserve the quality care and benefits they earned.This budget strives to do that and requests a mandatory appropriation of $161 billion and a discretionary appropriation of $135 billion, which reflects a higher reliance on VA care and greater utilization of benefits and services than prior years. It also requests a $155 billion mandatory advance appropriation, as well as a $128 billion discretionary advance appropriation to support its medical programs in FY 2024.The cost of medical care across private and public sectors continues to rise.Although the pandemic is a factor, these requests continue a trend of large increases in VA medical care that reflects growing demand for both in-house and community care.Veterans are relying on VA for more care today than ever before, which highlights the improvements in VA’s medical care system.This year’s budget request displays VA medical care as a separate and unique category from other non-defense discretionary spending – in VA and across the Government.Each year, the Appropriations Committees must balance VA medical care with non-defense priorities across the Government.This display reflects that there has been significant growth in VA medical care accounts over time, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, and that these costs, which are supported across the political spectrum, should not come at the expense of other critical programs.We hope to discuss the decision to change the Budget display, as well as many other issues today.There are a few areas of the budget I would like to highlight.The health effects of military environmental exposures can take years, if not decades, to manifest.The Budget proposes to increase efforts in this area, including provision of healthcare, research efforts, reviewing benefit claims, and implementing new presumptions of exposure and service connection for certain chronic conditions. The Department has published new regulations expanding presumptive eligibility for 9 new diseases, but as the Senate considers new legislation to further support veterans who experienced military environmental exposures, there will be more to do. The budget before us did not anticipate enactment of this legislation, which will require significant resources.I look forward to fully understanding your estimates for this legislation.In March, you released your recommendations to alter VA’s medical care infrastructure to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission for review.Although they include many opportunities to modernize care, recommendations to close facilities will take away much needed resources from already underserved communities.We have already spoken about the impact of those proposals on New Mexico’s veterans, and I hope to discuss that a bit more today.Beyond the Asset and Infrastructure Review, the Budget reflects VA’s need to invest in physical infrastructure.Veterans deserve to be treated in facilities that are up to date, modernized, and have the most cutting edge technology.In addition to proposed increased investments in all construction and maintenance accounts, the Budget included a legislative proposal to allow VA to move forward on 31 pending leases, as well as simplify the process for entering into future leases. These efforts will not only improve existing physical infrastructure, but expand much needed capacity to serve veterans.I fully support authorizing action on this effort.The budget continues robust funding for its telehealth program, with an estimated $4.8 billion for fiscal year 2023.However, even with expanded hiring and telehealth capacity, veterans in rural areas often struggle to access health care, including due to challenges with transportation and lack of internet access.As more than one-third of veterans enrolled in VA healthcare live in rural or highly rural areas, I continue to encourage VA to do more to close these access gaps.During the pandemic, VA used base and supplemental funding to undertake tremendous investments to protect veterans who were homeless or in danger of becoming homeless.This included strategies including temporary housing, rental assistance, improved access to care, and employment services.Based on the most recent PIT [Point-in-time] Count numbers, these efforts seem to have been quite successful.The budget requests $2.7 billion to continue and build upon these efforts.Last year, you undertook a strategic review of the Electronic Health Record Modernization program.Following that review, a new leadership team took over and VA deployed to its second site in March.VA also expects the independent life cycle cost assessment to be completed in the coming months.We look forward to working with the Department – and with Cerner, as this must be a joint effort – to make sure this investment stays on track going forward, and that the full costs of the initiative are understood.It is clear that much is expected from the Department – providing healthcare requires facilities,

In Lincoln County, a wildfire near Ruidoso caused two fatalities and destroyed over 200 homes. The combined fire of Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon – the third-largest fire in New Mexico history – continues to spread and could risk 15,000 more homes. Additionally, fire officials have warned that high wind events could create ‘extreme fire behavior’ further jeopardizing lives, residential homes, agricultural land, and public land. Federal assistance is of utmost urgency.”A Major Disaster Declaration would open up access to Public Assistance and Individual Assistance funds from FEMA. Public Assistance supports the restoration and reconstruction of public infrastructure and lands. Individual Assistance supports families from losses suffered due to the fires.The State is requesting Public Assistance, Category A and B, including Direct Federal Assistance for Colfax, Lincoln, Mora, Valencia, and San Miguel counties, as well as Individual Assistance, including Small Business Agency Disaster Loan Assistance, for Colfax, Lincoln, Mora, Valencia, and San Miguel counties.The lawmakers added, “Due to the life and death nature of this crisis, we urge [President Biden] to act without delay and approve the State of New Mexico’s request for a major disaster declaration.” The U.S. Department of Homeland’s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has already approved Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) to support firefighting efforts. Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear President Biden,We respectfully request that you take immediate action on the recent request for a major disaster declaration from the State of New Mexico in response to the ongoing wildfires burning since April 5, 2022.

Senator Heinrich’s legislation would preserve traditional uses and provide sanctuary to a wide range of wildlife species, while maintaining current access routes. Find a map of the proposed wilderness here. The legislation now heads to the Senate Floor for full consideration. Senator Heinrich’s bipartisan Simplifying Outdoor Access for Recreation (SOAR) Act is also gaining significant momentum. The bill language is included in ENR Chair Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) and U.S. Senator John Barrasso’s (R-Wyo.) bipartisan Outdoor Recreation Act that was also passed out of committee today. Senator Heinrich’s legislation would improve the permitting process for outfitters, educational organizations, and community groups to access public lands.As a former outdoor guide who has direct experience with the permitting process, Senator Heinrich noted that his is “glad to see this committee advancing this important legislation today that supports families, schools, and community groups get outside and enjoy our great public lands.”Senator Heinrich’s Pecos Watershed Protection Act was also considered during the hearing. This legislation would withdraw all federally-managed minerals in the watershed and would prevent leasing, patent, or sale of all publicly-owned minerals, including oil and gas as well as gold, silver, copper, and other hard rock minerals. Read the full text of the Pecos Watershed Protection Act by clicking here. During the hearing, Senator Heinrich expressed that “This legislation was requested by my constituents in San Miguel County to protect […] irreplaceable water supply and resources. […] There are many places that are appropriate for mining, and places that just aren’t—and this is one that just isn’t.”The Pecos Watershed Protection Act is supported by the San Miguel County Commission, the Pecos Business Association, the New Mexico Acequia Association, the Pueblo of Jemez, local farmers, landowners, and residents. The legislation now awaits Senate Floor action. Senator Heinrich also supported committee-passage of U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow’s (D-Mich.) legislation to incorporate all future and existing National Heritage Areas (NHA), including the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area (NRGNHA), into a National Heritage Area System. Senator Stabenow’s legislation compliments Senator Heinrich’s legislation to reauthorize the NRGNHA that passed out of committee in November 2021. This bill would continue the preservation of local cultural and historic resources through 2036."

Jackson Women’s Health Organization: “The Supreme Court’s draft opinion is a direct threat to a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and a dangerous step toward dismantling every American’s right to privacy. “A woman has a right to make her own health care decisions without the government getting between her and her medical providers. That right shouldn’t depend on what state she lives in or how far she can afford to drive. But right now, that all hangs in the balance.“The Court’s decision to take this case and the draft majority opinion make two things clear. The Senate must urgently pass the Women’s Health Protection Act to codify reproductive rights. And the radical-conservative majority of the United States Supreme Court has chosen politics over our constitutional rights, and that cannot stand.”Background:"

The solar industry employs over 230,000 American workers. According to a new report issued by the Solar Energy Industries Association, 70% of U.S. companies say at least half of their solar workforce is at risk as a result of this investigation. “Initiation of this investigation is already causing massive disruption in the solar industry, and it will severely harm American solar businesses and workers and increase costs for American families as long as it continues,” wrote the senators. “We strongly urge your administration to swiftly review the case and make an expedited preliminary determination. Such a determination should carefully consider the significant policy ramifications and reject the petitioner’s request for retroactivity.” “Already, as a result of Commerce’s decision to initiate this investigation, industry surveys indicate that 83% of U.S. solar companies report being notified of canceled or delayed panel supply. Without a reliable and cost-effective source of panels, existing and proposed solar projects could come to a halt,” the senators’ letter continued. “Left unaddressed, cutting off this supply of panels and cells also could cause the loss of more than 100,000 American jobs, including approximately 18,000 manufacturing jobs.”The bipartisan letter, led by U.S. Senators Rosen, Heinrich, and Sinema, was also signed by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mazie K.

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-backed-legislation-to-boost-outdoor-recreation-signed-into-law,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is celebrating that bipartisan legislation he cosponsored to digitize public land mapping records to increase outdoor recreation and improve hunting and fishing access for sportsmen and women has been signed into law by President Joe Biden.The Modernizing Access to our Public Land (MAPLand) Act will enhance access to the nation’s outdoor recreational opportunities by digitizing and standardizing mapping information like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands.“With our expansive skies and remote open spaces in New Mexico, modernizing access to our public lands will help people better navigate the great outdoors and play a key role in growing our state’s recreation economy,” said Heinrich. This new law will enable New Mexico’s public lands to be mapped in a standardized, digitized format across all four public lands agencies in a significant degree of detail. New Mexico’s burgeoning outdoor recreation economy depends in large part upon citizens’ access to reliable, comprehensive information about public land areas, access points, and permitted activities.According to the Outdoor Industry Association, New Mexico outdoor recreation generates $9.9 billion in consumer spending annually, supports almost 100,000 jobs, creates $2.8 billion in wages and salaries, and brings in about $623 million in state and local tax revenue.Senator Heinrich has a long-standing history of improving access to public lands. In 2019, Senator Heinrich played a leading role in the passage of a landmark bipartisan public lands legislative package, the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. That law included Senator Heinrich’s bipartisan provisions of the Sportsmen’s Act sponsored by Heinrich to extend key conservation programs and the HUNT Act, a bill Heinrich authored to require federal land management agencies to identify opportunities to open up new outdoor recreation opportunities on public lands for hunting and fishing.The MAPLand Act, led by U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Angus King (I-Maine), is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Susan Collins (R-Maine). The MAPLand Act is supported by many in the conservation and sportsmen community, including the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and Trout Unlimited."

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-cosponsors-legislation-to-improve-federal-wildfire-response,"WASHINGTON – As areas of New Mexico continue dealing with wildfire mitigation and devastation, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cosponsored legislation to strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) wildfire preparedness and response efforts.“In recent weeks, hundreds of New Mexicans have been forced to flee their homes as wildfires have ripped through their communities. I’ve met with residents, local elected officials, volunteers, as well as the crews that have been working on the frontlines of these fires. I cannot thank them enough for the resilience they have shown, and I want them to know I’m looking for additional resources to combat elevating wildfire risks at the federal level. That’s why I’m cosponsoring the FIRE Act to better prepare FEMA’s capabilities to prepare for and respond to wildfires in New Mexico,” said Heinrich. Senator Heinrich recently met with the Southwest Are Type 1 Incident Management Team 2 for a fire briefing and tour of key impacts areas of the McBride and Nogal Fires. That same day he also met with Lincoln County and Village of Ruidoso Emergency Managers to discuss recovery efforts and tour the temporary evacuation center set up at the Ruidoso Convention Center.The FIRE Act would update the Stafford Act that governs FEMA—which was written when the agency primarily focused on hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods—to improve FEMA’s response to wildfires, including by accounting for melted infrastructure and burned trees as well as allowing FEMA to pre-deploy assets during times of highest wildfire risk and red flag warnings.The bill would also ensure cultural competency for FEMA’s counseling and case management services, help to ensure relocation assistance is accessible to public infrastructure in fire prone areas, prioritize survivors’ housing needs after disasters, ensure equity of assistance for Tribal communities and Tribal governments, and examine ways to speed up the federal assistance process and improve the availability of fire insurance.The legislation, introduced by U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), advanced out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) in February of this year and now awaits consideration on the Senate Floor. A one-pager of the FIRE Act can be found here, and a section-by-section can be found here."

Senator Heinrich plays a leading role in clean energy policy, serving on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees military construction funding. His expertise makes him uniquely suited to comment on how clean energy could make nations safer in an uncertain time.WATCH: Clean energy in a time of global conflict, Canary MediaSenator Heinrich, the founder and co-chair of the Electrification Caucus, has been a vocal advocate for the adoption of clean energy alternatives to secure American energy independence. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed just how susceptible energy markets are to disruption from global conflict. But unlike in past wars, clean energy technologies can now offer protection from volatility in oil and gas supplies.Senator Heinrich recently authored an op-ed in The Hill with Rewiring America’s CEO Ari Matusiak calling on the U.S. to lead the widespread electrification of the appliances in our homes. The piece outlined a three-part market transformation plan that bolsters American manufacturing and labor capacity to help Europe reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas and support lasting energy independence in the United States.Last month, Senator Heinrich sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to employ his existing executive authorities to advance the development and widespread adoption of clean energy and energy-efficient electric technologies, such as heat pumps, in order to reduce demand for Russian fossil fuels, cut emissions, and save money for consumers in both the United States and allied countries."

This grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan Indigenous Communities program.“I visited the Pueblo of Jemez recently and was greatly impressed with the way the Pueblo is putting the resources from the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Law to work addressing long-term infrastructure needs and embracing new economic opportunities. Building more renewable energy generation projects offers one of the surest paths for the Pueblo to achieve energy sovereignty and create good-paying jobs and major economic benefits in the process,” said Heinrich. “In New Mexico and across the country, Tribes and Pueblos have had a long history of being great stewards of our lands,” said Luján. “I’m pleased this funding from the American Rescue Plan will allow the Pueblo of Jemez to research opportunities for energy independence and economic development.”“This funding will help the Pueblo of Jemez explore innovative ways to become carbon neutral and energy independent, which contribute to tribal sovereignty,” said Leger Fernández. “As Chair of the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States, I am glad that we were able to secure this important American Rescue Plan investment to develop renewable energy technologies at Tribes, invest in Tribal workforces, and create good-paying jobs at Jemez and in indigenous communities across the country.”This project will outline Tribal strategies for economic development and job creation, including an analysis of renewable energy generation capacity and workforce development so the Pueblo can identify ways in which it can acquire or build the energy infrastructure necessary to become carbon neutral.This project is funded under EDA’s American Rescue Plan Indigenous Communities program, which allocates $100 million in American Rescue Plan funding specifically to support the needs of Tribal Governments and Indigenous communities. The program supports these partners to develop and execute economic development projects they need to recover from the pandemic and build economies for the future.

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-introduces-legislation-to-modernize-antiquated-mining-law,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act, legislation to modernize the nation’s severely antiquated hardrock mining law.“Unlike other 19th century western settlement laws, which have long since been reformed or replaced, the Mining Act of 1872 is still on the books. This law drew thousands of people to the West to earn a living, including my father and my grandfather who worked in hardrock mining. But shortsighted policy also left behind a scarred legacy on our lands and water,” said Heinrich. “The Mining Act of 1872 has been on the books for 40 years longer than New Mexico has been a state. This antiquated law has become a driving force behind centuries of legacy mining pollution that is leaking toxic heavy metals and acid mine drainage into streams and rivers all across the West. Unlike the way we manage other publicly-owned natural resources like coal and oil, we don't collect any royalties on hardrock minerals to return fair value to taxpayers. We also don't have a reclamation fee to help with cleanup work, and we lack a clear process to protect the types of places that simply aren’t appropriate for mineral development. It's long past time to change that.”Regulation of hardrock mineral extraction in the United States has remained virtually unchanged for 150 years, when President Ulysses S. Grant signed the General Mining Act of 1872 into law. This antiquated system has allowed mining companies to extract more than $300 billion worth of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals from U.S. public lands without paying a cent in federal royalties to the American people. These same companies have left the public with billions of dollars in cleanup costs for abandoned hardrock mines, which have polluted 40% of the headwaters of western watersheds. Many Indigenous communities’ sacred sites and lands are continuously at-risk of being permanently destroyed by mining. With a growing demand for the critical minerals necessary for a clean energy transition, the need to reform the existing mining law is particularly salient. Modernizing our leasing system would address major environmental justice concerns, protect our public lands, and ensure a fair return for American taxpayers.The Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act would amend the 1872 General Mining Law to eliminate patenting of federal lands, impose a federal minerals royalty, establish a Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund for the cleanup of abandoned mines, and require a review of certain lands within three years to determine if they should be available for future mining. Specifically, the bill would:Original cosponsors of Senator Heinrich’s Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act include U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). U.S. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Original cosponsors include Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee Chair Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.) and U.S. Representatives Don Beyer (D-Va.), Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Talib (D-Mich.). “Minerals like copper and lithium are essential for our clean energy future, but that doesn’t mean we should sacrifice our environment, health, and sacred or special places just to get them,” said Grijalva. “Our current mining law was put in place before we even knew what a car was, much less an electric one. By keeping this outdated system going, we’re telling mining companies it’s okay to wreak total havoc on our environment and then leave American taxpayers to foot the cleanup bill. Modernizing this relic of a law isn’t extreme or anti-industry—it’s just common sense.”Seventy environmental, conservation, and Tribal rights’ organizations sent a letter supporting the mining reform legislation. The letter is available here. Trout Unlimited, National Wildlife Federation, and Backcountry Hunters and Anglers also support the bill.“We thank Senator Heinrich for recognizing the need to reform America’s outdated 150-year-old mining law. It makes no sense to accelerate domestic critical minerals production before repairing the rotten foundation of the Mining Law,” said Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited. “It has long been clear: Land managers need to have the authority to say “no” to a mine that is proposed in the wrong place, and we need funding to clean up abandoned mines polluting thousands of rivers and streams across the West.”“It’s time we took our mining laws out of the 19th century and into the 21st century. Our public lands, waters, wildlife, and way of life depend on it,” said David Willms, senior director of Western wildlife and conservation at the National Wildlife Federation. “We applaud Sen. Heinrich for this common-sense legislation to reform the antiquated 1872 mining law and invest in our public lands, while also ensuring that the public receives fair compensation for the use of our public lands.”“For decades, mining companies have capitalized on our public lands without paying royalties and left behind toxic pollution, thanks in large part to outdated mining laws from 150 years ago,” said Athan Manuel, Director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program. “As we make the transition to clean energy, we cannot continue these extractive, unsustainable processes that put profits over people. It's time to pass the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act to bring our mining laws out of the 19th century, put an end to subsidizing mining operations, and protect our communities and treasured places.”“For over 150 years, mining operations have been governed by an antiquated and racist law that contains no environmental or community protections” said League of Conservation Voters Conservation Program Director Alex Taurel.“As we increase our focus on mining the raw materials needed to secure a clean energy future independent of petro-state autocrats, we must root our efforts in justice for the communities that have long been disproportionately harmed by colonization and resource extraction, particularly Indigenous communities. This bill will give land managers the ability to defend our public lands from irresponsible mining, provide taxpayers with a fair return, and allocate funds to address the long-standing hazards of abandoned mines to drinking water and fish and wildlife habitat. We thank Chair Grijalva and Sen. Heinrich for their leadership and urge Congress to act so that we may begin to fix the mining industry’s toxic legacy.” “For 150 years mining companies have extracted our country’s mineral resources, failed to adequately compensate taxpayers, left behind toxic sites that poisoned local communities, and destroyed sacred Indigenous lands and environmental treasures without consequence,” said Earthjustice Senior Legislative Representative Blaine Miller-McFeeley.“While we understand that mining is an important component in transitioning us to a clean energy future, it must proceed in the most sustainable way possible with strong environmental protections, robust community engagement, and meaningful tribal consultation. Thank you Chair Grijalva and Senator Heinrich for recognizing the need to update our mining laws to the twenty-first century and protect the people and special places that need it the most.” “Hunters and anglers have long-advocated for legislation to modernize the General Mining Act of 1872” said John Gale, Conservation Director of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. “The world has changed a lot in the last 150 years and hardrock mining's image of the one-man operation with a mule and a pick ax is a far cry from the multinational corporations systematically extracting minerals from our lands and waters today. We also acknowledge that establishing parity with other extractive industries that pay royalties and have greater regulatory safeguards in place for protecting natural resources is central to the conversation and important as taxpayers look to congressional leaders for establishing new revenue streams to support better management of our public lands and waters. It well past time for us to do more for our water resources and improve habitat for fish and wildlife while generating new jobs and establishing higher standards for the stewardship of our natural resources.”""For far too long, antiquated and racist hardrock mining law has governed mining operations in the United States. In the past 150 years, frontline communities endured discrimination, injustice, and prejudice to receive basic needs like clean drinking water, all for mining operations to produce high yields."" said Mark Magana Founding CEO of GreenLatinos. ""It's time we address this issue and use our public lands in a way that acknowledges the histories and traditions of those historically and deliberately overlooked communities. By giving land managers the ability to balance mining with other uses of public lands, The Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act of 2022 is a bill that would defend local communities and wild places from irresponsible mining.""“This is important legislation that would protect public lands and end government handouts to mining companies,” said Hans Cole, head of Environmental Activism at Patagonia. “Pollution from mining endangers air, water and wildlife habitats, and this bill would prioritize the health of people and the planet.”“Outdoor Alliance applauds Congressman Grijalva and Senator Heinrich for introducing the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act of 2022. By updating America’s antiquated 150-year-old mining law, this bill would make needed reforms to prevent toxic pollution and finally put hard rock mining on an equal playing field with other uses of public lands including outdoor recreation. As our nation transitions to renewable energy sources, this bill would ensure that future mining projects are planned, permitted, and reclaimed appropriately, while providing a fairer return for taxpayers,” said Adam Cramer, CEO, Outdoor Alliance.The full text of Senator Heinrich’s Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act is available here.

As the father of two teenage sons, I know just how attuned our kids and young Americans are to how their future will be impacted by the actions—or inactions—we take today to invest in clean energy and climate resilience.“The climate crisis that is already contributing to more destructive wildfire behavior in New Mexico’s forests, dangerously low water levels in our rivers and reservoirs, and the disappearance of snowpack on our mountains, is the direct result of the hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and fossil gas that you and I are burning into the atmosphere from our homes, offices, and vehicles. As we have seen all too clearly over the last month, our current reliance on those same hydrocarbons is also propping up Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked aggression and horrific war crimes in Ukraine and leading to more costly gas prices and more expensive monthly utility bills.“I am dedicated to growing New Mexico’s clean energy economy, helping families lower their energy costs by purchasing electric home appliances and electric vehicles, investing in on-the-ground conservation work to repair our forests and watersheds, and supporting the long-term health of fish and wildlife habitat all across America.“This remains our best opportunity to make a real difference in the type of planet that we will pass on to our children and future generations.

We urge you to take next steps as expeditiously as possible to upgrade and expand our electric grid to enable power sharing across regions and the connection of more affordable and abundant renewable energy to power our homes, businesses, and vehicles at lower costs.”The letter urges FERC to consider policies that include:“As the ongoing European energy crisis demonstrates, there is no time to wait. We urgently need to shore up American energy independence and security by upgrading and expanding the electric grid. Doing so will place us on a firmer foundation to tackle the climate crisis, which grows increasingly dire with each year of delay.

Developers need to forecast expenses one to two years in advance, but are now unable to accurately project the cost of major projects.Last year, imports from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia accounted for more than 80% of all crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) solar panels and cell imports and nearly 60% of total U.S. panel supply. New tariffs on solar products from these four countries would stall many ongoing and planned U.S. solar projects, negatively impacting every segment of the U.S. solar industry and resulting in significant job losses. In particular, the tariffs would have direct impact on the almost 90% of solar jobs in the United States that are not in the manufacturing sector.Senator Heinrich has expressed that these proposed tariffs risk harming hundreds of locally-owned companies, jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs, and stifling billions of dollars in investment in communities in New Mexico and across the country. Senator Heinrich recently joined U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-N.V.) to lead a bipartisan group of senators in a letter to the Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urging the Department to carefully assess the validity of the petition.

Eliminating these services would eliminate VA’s critical ability to deliver care in a way that recognizes the unique experiences of veterans and from providers attuned to their specific needs.In the letter to the VA Secretary, Heinrich, Luján, and Leger Fernández request the following:Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here. Dear Secretary McDonough,We write to express our opposition to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, as prescribed in the VA Mission Act of 2018. We strongly believe that the VA’s recommendations of closure of the four Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOCs) in northern New Mexico do not fulfill our promise to our veterans. It is imperative that you and the AIR Commission panel hear firsthand from New Mexicans how integral these clinics are to veterans living in rural and Tribal communities in the state.We have specific concerns regarding the data and analysis utilized to support the assumption that local health care providers would be able to accommodate the increased need in the impacted communities. Going forward, we request that the VA consider the impact CBOC closures would have on local providers in New Mexico, the wait times for access to care for both Veterans and local patient populations, and the ongoing health workforce shortages experienced across New Mexico. As it currently stands, the VA’s data did not reflect the impact of the pandemic on health care markets in New Mexico, nor did it provide a full understanding of the availability of community care in rural, Tribal, and predominately Hispanic areas. It is important the Commission has the most complete information possible, especially around the supply of health care, and what’s available in our communities as they review and revise the recommendations.Since the release of the recommendations on March 14th, we have heard from veterans across New Mexico, who have shared their concerns about the proposed closures. They told us about the VA’s critical ability to deliver care in a way that recognizes the unique experiences of veterans and from providers attuned to their specific needs. They also described the difficulties of traveling further distances to receive care. To this end, we also request an update on how transportation costs were considered and if any deliberation was given to expanding the areas that qualify for Highly Rural Transportation Grants. Inadequate transportation, especially for older veterans, coupled with long distance travel and its associated costs in time and money would act as a barrier to care and would make health care services untenable for many veterans.Finally, we request that the VA consider the unreliability and lack of broadband that would prevent telemedicine as a substitute for in-person visits in many of our communities. While innovations in telehealth helped bring medical expertise directly into veterans’ homes, this is only possible with an infrastructure that supports this form of health care delivery. Without access to fixed broadband, affordable Internet service, and a focus on improving digital literacy, there are concerns about the VA’s ability to provide equitable care to all veterans through telehealth services. Any final recommendations must take this into consideration.It is our nation’s solemn obligation to provide veteran’s health care and other necessary services regardless of where they live. We look forward to further engagement and collaborating on how we can maintain the highest quality of care for the veterans living in New Mexico. "
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-bicameral-group-of-lawmakers-urge-usps-ig-to-provide-additional-analysis-on-fleet-electrification-cost-of-carbon,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is leading a group of 20 lawmakers who are calling on the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to accurately assess the cost of reliance on fossil fuels, which impacts national security and the climate crisis, as the agency prepares to update its vehicle fleet.The request comes in response to a recent report from the USPS Office of the Inspector General that identified the benefits of fleet electrification, but stopped short of analyzing the social costs of fossil fuel reliance.In a letter to USPS Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb, the lawmakers write, “Thank you for your recent investigation into electrifying the postal service’s vehicle fleet. At a time when we are seeing high prices at the pump, increasing fossil energy security issues, and the tangible impacts of climate change, we need analyses and insights like those provided by your office. As you continue your investigation into USPS’s NEPA compliance, we request that you also update your analyses to include the social cost of carbon.”Joining Senator Heinrich on the letter are fellow Electrification Caucus Co-Chairs Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.). Also signing the letter are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Angus King (I-Maine), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). “In the past month, we have seen the vulnerabilities wrought by a dependence on fossil fuels and how that reliance can prop up petrostate dictators. Meanwhile, a 70 degree temperature spike in Antarctica caused an ice shelf larger than New York City to break off the continent for the first time on record.

At a time when we are seeing high prices at the pump, increasing fossil energy security issues, and the tangible impacts of climate change, we need analyses and insights like those provided by your office. As you continue your investigation into USPS’s NEPA compliance, we request that you also update your analyses to include the social cost of carbon.USPS manages a fleet of 217,000 vehicles - almost the number of vehicles registered in Washington, D.C. Electrifying this fleet could reduce emissions three-fold, and your analysis highlights many other benefits; electric vehicles are cheaper to fuel and maintain, they insulate from volatile fossil fuel prices, and their range is suitable for 98.5% of postal routes. The outcome of this analysis is not surprising. Electric engines have 40% higher efficiency than gasoline engines, with fewer moving parts and no oil to change. You also note uncertainty in the cost of charging infrastructure. This is a one-time investment which will still be useful when the fleet turns over again 20 years from now. Prior generations made similar investments in railroad tracks and airport runways to keep mail delivery evolving with the times – investments which we still benefit from daily. Scaling up charging infrastructure now will set the stage for additional technologies which we are only beginning to envision for the future. What is not highlighted in your analysis is also notable: the cost of reliance on fossil fuels to our national security and our climate. In the past month, we have seen the vulnerabilities wrought by a dependence on fossil fuels and how that reliance can prop up petrostate dictators. Meanwhile, a 70 degree temperature spike in Antarctica caused an ice shelf larger than New York City to break off the continent for the first time on record. These costs are real, and we ask that you update your economic analysis to incorporate the social cost of carbon, to capture at least some of these impacts, when comparing the cost of electric and fossil fuel vehicles. Despite not accounting for these factors, you still found electric vehicles had a similar cost of ownership as fossil fuel vehicles for the average USPS route.  The establishment and oversight of the postal service are explicitly listed in the Constitution under the powers of Congress. Thank you for continuing to provide the full picture to us as we exercise this oversight, and we look forward to your additional analysis. "

Nearly half of veterans in New Mexico are over the age of 65, and due to illness and service-related disabilities, many find it difficult to travel long distances for medical care. Senators Heinrich and Luján are urging the VA to consult with Veterans Service Organizations (VSO), medical providers, and communities in northern New Mexico to fully understand the impact of these recommended changes. Read the full letter below or by clicking here. Dear President Biden:We write to you today expressing our extreme concern with the VA’s recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, as prescribed in Subtitle A of Title II of the VA MISSION Act. The recommendations are overly focused on quantitative data that does not do enough to consider the impact the proposed changes would have on our Veterans, particularly elderly Veterans. We request that when you receive the final recommendations from the AIR Commission you consult our offices on a state-by-state basis for our feedback before you decide to approve or deny them.For many elderly Veterans, VA facilities are the only place they seek care. The reasons Veterans often cite are that they are better understood, respected, and cared for at their local VA Medical Center (VAMC). VA facilities often serve as the crux for elderly Veterans’ community. Time and time again, we have been told by elderly Veterans that they enjoy visiting their VAMCs. They build networks of friends and VA staff that serve as support groups and keep them connected with their service. In an increasingly digital world, we cannot discount the importance of the human interaction and connection our Veterans find at VA facilities, particularly with in-person services.We have been disappointed and concerned by the VA’s lack of assessment of qualitative data and how its recommendations will specifically impact elderly Veterans. Receiving feedback from Congress, local VA staff, and most importantly local Veteran communities must be a crucial step in your assessment of the AIR Commission’s final recommendations. Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return. That’s the promise we made to these brave men and women when they took their oath to serve, and that’s the promise we intend to keep.We look forward to collaborating with you further on how we can maintain quality care for Veterans across the nation without cutting services or access in our states."

The legislation now heads to the Senate Floor for consideration. The House legislation advanced out of the House Natural Resources Committee in January.Senators Heinrich and Blunt held a conference call for reporters to discuss the progress. A recording of their remarks can be found here.“The outdoors have once again proven to be a real uniting force. I’m so proud of the bipartisan leadership and widespread support that is moving the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act forward. Senator Blunt has been a great partner and EPW Chairman Tom Carper and Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito helped us advance this landmark conservation legislation. I am confident that if we can keep up our momentum, we will pass this bill through the full Senate with broad, bipartisan support,” said Heinrich, member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “Without enough resources, state, and Tribal wildlife agencies have been forced to pick and choose which species are worth saving. Instead of doing the proactive work that is necessary to maintain healthy wildlife populations on the front end, they have been forced into using reactive measures to rescue species after they are listed as threatened or endangered. We urgently need to change this paradigm and save thousands of species with a solution that matches the magnitude of the challenge. The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act offers us a constructive path forward. Passing RAWA into law will mean our grandchildren will be able to experience the same rich and abundant American wildlife—from bumblebees to bison—that we have been so lucky to grow up with.”“Protecting habitats and wildlife is not only important to states like Missouri – with some of the best hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation in the country – it’s important to communities all across the nation,” said Blunt. “By encouraging states, territories, and Tribes to make significant contributions to voluntary conservation efforts, we can preserve our nation’s wildlife for future generations. I would like to thank the Environment and Public Works Committee for advancing RAWA, and I will continue working with my friend Senator Heinrich to get this landmark legislation to the president’s desk.”“Today, our committee took a step forward in advancing impactful, bipartisan conservation legislation,” said EPW Chairman Carper. “The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act seeks to address the pervasive and growing threat of biodiversity loss, which scientists warn could dramatically worsen in the years ahead without action. I appreciate the strong leadership that Senators Heinrich, Blunt, and Capito demonstrated as our committee contemplated this legislation, and I look forward to working with them, and other proponents, to find a way to pay for this important investment and to take additional action to stem our biodiversity loss crisis. Much like successful species conservation, legislating is a shared responsibility.”“An integral part of West Virginia is our natural landscape and native wildlife,” said EPW Ranking Member Capito. “I was proud to support the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, which will provide a historic investment to help states with their species recovery efforts. I thank my colleagues, Senators Blunt and Heinrich, for leading this legislation to provide our state fish and wildlife agencies with more resources to conserve at-risk species.”Senators Heinrich and Blunt’s legislation invests in proactive, on-the-ground conservation work led by states, territories, and Tribal nations to support the long-term health of fish and wildlife and their habitat all across America. These locally-driven, science-based strategies would restore populations of species with the greatest conservation need.Since introduction in July 2021, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act has gained significant momentum with 32 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and is backed by over 60 Tribes and 1,500 organizations representing state fish and wildlife agencies, sportsmen and women, conservation groups, and industry associations and businesses.Additional Resources:"

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/nm-congressional-democrats-announce-735-million-in-infrastructure-investments-to-modernize-expand-public-transit,"WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representatives Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) announced $73,508,702 in investments from the Infrastructure Law to enable transit agencies to modernize and expand services for New Mexicans in communities large and small. The funding will be administered through the Federal Transit Agency (FTA). The total for New Mexico includes $40,373,018 for Albuquerque as part of FTA’s Urban, Rural, Bus and Enhanced Mobility Formula program. “Whether you’re heading out to a doctor's visit, to school, or your next shift, public transit can serve as an affordable option for New Mexicans to reach more parts of their community. Increasing access to reliable public transportation also means fewer cars on the road and less carbon emissions,” said Heinrich, member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. “The historic investments we secured in the Infrastructure Law are making it easier for New Mexicans to live their lives. I look forward to the jobs this funding will create as we improve our state’s transit systems.” “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making incredible investments to address the critical infrastructure needs that New Mexicans face every day,” said Senator Lujan, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. “In New Mexico and across the country, too many drivers are burdened with increased commute times and costly damages from driving on roads and bridges in need of repair. That’s why I was proud to work with Senator Heinrich to secure a transformational investment of more than $73 billion to shorten commute times, develop safer roads, connect rural communities, and repair bridges to improve the lives and safety of all New Mexicans traveling throughout the state.” “Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already delivering for New Mexico—with the largest investment in public transit in our history—and over $40 million in funding to New Mexico’s First Congressional District just this year,” said Stansbury. “This funding will modernize transportation across New Mexico to connect our communities, create good-paying jobs, and build our clean energy future. We are working hard with our Governor, Mayors, and local leaders to get this funding out the door to our communities.” “We continue to see the impacts of the life-changing provisions from the Infrastructure Law for our gente. These investments in New Mexico's public transit system will provide good-paying jobs and repairs to our decaying infrastructure,"" said Leger Fernández. ""This funding will solve decades-long problems and modernize our transportation system to reduce commute times and improve the safety of our communities."" Full-year funding is available following Congressional passage of an FY 2022 appropriations bill in March. The new tables released today reflect funding increases authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, allowing thousands of transit agencies to buy new no or low emission buses, railcars, address their repair backlogs, electrify their fleets, and transition to new technologies to address the climate crisis. These upgrades will support the expansion of U.S. manufacturing due to Buy America requirements that apply to steel, iron and other materials used in public transportation projects that receive federal assistance.

We are home to an ideal climate, leading public and private space innovators, and an exceptional training pipeline for the growing science and engineering workforce. Kirtland Air Force Base has also built an exceptional track record of supporting training missions and testing and evaluation of important space capabilities. I have full confidence that Space Force leadership will determine that this is the ideal location for these STARCOM missions,” said Heinrich, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees Military Construction funding.""I welcome the news that Kirtland is under consideration for two Space Force field units focused on test and evaluation,"" said Luján. ""Kirtland Air Force Base carries a long history of space technology expertise that our military needs to stay ahead of emerging threats.""“We’re excited that the U.S. Space Force has recognized Kirtland Air Force Base as a leading candidate for the STARCOM Delta,” said Stansbury. “New Mexico is at the forefront of science, research, technology, and security and Albuquerque’s endless skies, access to the outdoors, and amazing communities offer a welcoming home to STARCOM, which would bring additional economic development to a community well-positioned to further support the Space Force’s work. I look forward to supporting Kirtland Air Force Base as the Space Force continues the selection process.”STARCOM’s organizational structure includes five space deltas to execute its mission. Kirtland AFB is a candidate location for the following locations due to its existing range infrastructure that supports test, training, and exercise activities within close distance to range and aggressor stakeholders:Delta 11 – Range and Aggressor – delivers realistic, threat-informed test and training environments through the provision of live, virtual, and constructive range and combat replication capability.Delta 12 – Test and Evaluation – will prepare USSF forces to prevail in a contested, degraded, and operationally-limited environment through the independent test and evaluation of USSF capabilities and delivery of timely, accurate, and expert information in support of weapon system acquisition, operational acceptance, and readiness decisions.STARCOM, one of three U.S. Space Force field commands, is responsible for the deliberate development, education and training of space professionals; development of space warfighting doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures; and the operational test and evaluation of USSF systems."

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-addresses-new-mexico-mayors-during-infrastructure-summit,"Senator Heinrich highlights $3.7 billion in formula funding for New Mexico, plus the opportunity to apply for large amounts of competitive fundingWASHINGTON (Jan. 14, 2022) – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) highlighted how the historic Infrastructure Law is delivering major investments to infrastructure projects and priorities across New Mexico during a virtual Summit on City Infrastructure hosted by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.“This infrastructure law will deliver far more than we’ve had to work with in our state since the construction of the federal highway system in the 1950s or the New Deal in the 1930s,” said Heinrich during his remarks. “There’s over $3.7 billion—with a ‘B’—in just the formula funding coming directly to New Mexico over the next five years.”The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in November 2021, is increasing access to affordable high-speed internet, reliable public transit, and clean drinking water. As a former city councilman, Senator Heinrich expressed his trust in local and state officials to pick up the mantle and work to distribute the funding in a forward-looking, equitable manner, “It’s up to you—and I have great trust and admiration for all the mayors on this call—to make sure that these infrastructure projects build us a bridge to our future, and not a statue to our past.”Senator Heinrich is confident that smart investments from the Infrastructure Law “will rewrite the economic landscape in [New Mexico]” as new jobs are created and local economic activity is boosted throughout the state.Senator Heinrich’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below.Good morning, everyone.Thank you, Governor, for inviting the federal delegation to join today’s summit.And thank you to all of the mayors and local officials for taking on the work ahead.For many months last year, we negotiated the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Congress.Most people – and definitely the news - doubted that we could get it done.And I’ll be honest, it was hard.We disagreed on a lot and took on more than we usually do in a single bill.But with equal parts vision and compromise, we got it done in the end.And now I’m excited to pass that baton on to you.It’s now your leadership and collaboration that will turn all the words – and dollars - of this law into a brighter future for our great state.I know that’s a tall order.As a former city councilor, I remember the disagreements over what to invest in and how.But I also know what a difference new infrastructure projects make in people’s lives.They can make roads, sidewalks, and water safer.There is about $2.5 billion alone in the bill coming to New Mexico just for roads and bridges.That’s a pretty incredible investment.Infrastructure can create spaces for communities to come together.It can connect people to jobs with expanded and improved transit systems.And these projects can literally create jobs.In this case, we have enough funding to do all of that, and more.This infrastructure law will deliver far more than we’ve had to work with in our state since the construction of the federal highway system in the 1950s or the New Deal in the 1930s.There’s over $3.7 billion—with a “B”—in just the formula funding coming directly to New Mexico over the next five years.This will give us what we need to fix a lot of what’s broken and also deliver on what’s possible.I’ve certainly heard from so many of you about how much you could do if you just had the resources to modernize and expand your local airports.Well, now you will have over $90 million to do just that.Many of you are also leading the way on electrifying city buildings, installing solar power, and converting transportation fleets to electric vehicles.Now you’ll have the resources to more-than-double those efforts.And here’s something else to be really excited about: Our days without consistent, high-speed internet access, especially in rural areas in New Mexico, are numbered.We have $100 million coming to our state to help us get New Mexicans online and build out a diversified economy.I think there’s going to be a real temptation to use these funds to cement the status quo, the way things have always been.It’s up to you—and I have great trust and admiration for all the mayors on this call—to make sure that these infrastructure projects build us a bridge to our future, and not a statue to our past. This is our shot to make transformational investments in our energy grid and energy infrastructure.These investments will help us create a solid electric vehicle charging network and help us build more of the high-voltage transmission that allows us to bring in billions in private investments to rural communities in our state. And if we really seize this opportunity, then we have much more coming to us than just that formula funding.The infrastructure bill also includes an enormous amount of competitive funding opportunities.That means we can do even more on things like EV charging, high-speed internet, water infrastructure, which I’ve heard over and over again on this call, and public transportation in the years to come. I want to help you put forward competitive applications for projects in every corner of our state.Because when New Mexico competes, we do win.And if you call on my office—and I know that many of our smaller communities don’t have an economic development team—I have an entire team ready to make sure that the $3.7 billion I mentioned before is the beginning, not the end of the funding coming to New Mexico.I know that each community has its own unique needs.This really is our opportunity to tailor make those solutions.And when we do, we will rewrite the economic landscape in our state, do right by our children, and we are literally going to have an impact that is felt in decades.Let’s get to work! And I look forward to being a partner with all of you.### "

The money can be invested in runways, taxiways, safety and sustainability projects, as well as terminal, airport-transit connections, and roadway projects.Heinrich, Luján, Stansbury, and Leger Fernández fought for these historic airport investments in the recent infrastructure package, as well as monumental relief funding in the American Rescue Plan that have allowed New Mexico airports to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.“Local airports connect communities all across New Mexico to tourism, business opportunities, and commercial aviation,”said Heinrich. “Democrats in the New Mexico delegation fought hard for these historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that will modernize our airports and allow them to better serve travelers, health care providers, and businesses all across our state.” “New Mexico’s 46 airports are key economic drivers for our state,” said Luján. “That’s why I was honored to help shape the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to ensure our state’s airports received the necessary funding to make these long overdue upgrades. As tourism and travel continue to grow, I’m honored to join my colleagues in announcing this first round of funding that will serve New Mexicans well.”“Communities from Albuquerque to Moriarty rely on airport infrastructure to sustain local economies and keep our state humming, which is why I was proud to vote for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This grant will deliver new good-paying jobs for New Mexicans while making needed renovations to the Sunport and airports across the state,” said Stansbury.“By modernizing our airports and making them more sustainable, the infrastructure law supports New Mexico’s tourism industries and facilitates smoother and safer travels.”“Our airports connect communities across the state, especially those in rural areas. We fought and voted for this historic investment in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because we knew the impact of this funding for New Mexico,” said Leger Fernández. “This $18 million will improve runways, taxiways, and other projects to revitalize New Mexico airports, grow our economy, and create good-paying jobs.”The airports receiving funding include:"

New Mexico will continue reaping the benefits of the infrastructure package as we expand access to high-quality broadband, build out new pipelines for clean drinking water, look for new ways to charge up our public transit systems, and so much more.”“This infrastructure law is a victory for all New Mexicans,” said Luján. “The investments in New Mexico’s infrastructure – including significant funding for broadband buildout, bridges, and roads – will connect New Mexicans and benefit our state for generations to come. This law will tackle ongoing challenges to lower costs and improve the lives and safety of all New Mexicans, while putting folks to work in good-paying jobs to rebuild our bridges, highway, and roads.”""New Mexico families and small businesses rely on our bridges to deliver crucial goods and get us where we need to go, but over 200 of our state's bridges are in urgent need of repair,"" said Stansbury. ""I am proud that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is delivering the first wave of $45 million to New Mexico today as part of a record $225 million to repair our bridges and improve climate resilience. As we get this funding and future broadband, water, and transit funding out the door, I’ll be working with local and Tribal leaders to make sure these dollars make a difference for our communities.”“Our bridges connect la gente to the services they need. They are the connections that drive our economy forward and create jobs. We have hundreds of bridges that need repair in New Mexico, including a bridge near Jemez Springs that cannot even hold a firetruck and a bridge near Gallup that can’t hold a school bus. This jeopardizes public safety and access to education in our communities.” said Leger Fernández. “These investments will solve problems we’ve known about but never had the funds to fix and sow the seeds of a more prosperous future for our communities.”Nationwide, the Federal Highway Administration’s Bridge Formula Program is expected to help repair approximately 15,00 bridges. In addition to providing funds to states to replace, rehabilitate, preserve, protect, and construct highway bridges, the Bridge Formula Program has dedicated funding for Tribal transportation facility bridges as well as “off-system” bridges, locally owned facilities which are those not on the federal-aid highway system. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes an incentive for states to direct the new Bridge Formula Program funds to off-system bridges owned by a county, city, town or other local agency. While states normally must match federal funding with up to 20 percent state or local funding, the guidance issued today notes that federal funds can be used for 100 percent of the cost of repairing or rehabilitating such locally owned off-system bridges. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness in the world, create good jobs, and make our transportation system more sustainable and equitable. Specific to the FHWA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides more than $350 billion over five fiscal years for surface transportation programs.###"

That’s why I’m proud this funding is heading to UNM so that the proper care and training can be implemented to support our local health workforce who continue to have our community’s back.”“Throughout the pandemic, we’ve referred to health care workers as heroes,” said Luján.“This grant funding provides the appropriate resources to support the health and wellbeing of our local American heroes. The pandemic has been taxing on us all, but especially on health care professionals. As the UNM Health Sciences Center has supported our communities in these tumultuous times, it’s critical that we secure the necessary services to support them.” “Our health care workers are real-life heroes, working on the front lines of this pandemic and caring for our communities. We must take care of our health care workers and ensure they have the resources they need to be well,” said Stansbury. “UNM Hospital workers and health care professionals across the state have worked tirelessly over the last two years. We must do everything we can to support their resilience and ensure that all of us are doing our part in fighting the pandemic by getting vaccinated, masking up, testing, and staying safe.”The purpose of this program is to plan, develop, operate or participate in health professions and nursing training activities using evidence-based or evidence-informed strategies, to reduce and address burnout, suicide, mental health conditions and substance use disorders and promote resiliency among health care students, residents, professionals, paraprofessionals, trainees, public safety officers, and employers of such individuals, collectively known as the “Health Workforce,” in rural and underserved communities.### "

The program allows law enforcement officers to redirect low-level offenders engaged in drug or prostitution activity to community-based services, instead of jail and prosecution. By diverting eligible individuals to services, LEAD is committed to improving public safety and public order, and reducing the criminal behavior of people who participate in the program. “Violent crime in our communities must be taken seriously so that we can keep people and communities safe. This funding helps our law enforcement and prosecutors up their focus on violent crime,” said Heinrich. “It does that by expanding this successful diversion program for nonviolent and low-level offenders – especially young people – providing the rehabilitation that will create a safer and healthier community for us all.” “The rehabilitation focus of this program directs nonviolent offenders toward community-based services. This will allow law enforcement to prioritize violent crime prevention,”said Luján. “It is critical that we empower law enforcement to keep our communities safe, while also showing compassion to low-level offenders – often young people who deserve a second chance. This funding is a commitment to public safety and to building up our young people.” ""This important investment improves public safety and provides non-violent, low-level offenders with opportunities to learn new skills and give back to their communities,” said Leger Fernández. “The LEAD diversion program reduces recidivism, changes lives, and ensures law enforcement has the resources to address violent criminal activity. We must prioritize crime prevention so that we can create safe, healthy communities.” This funding will result in enhanced coverage during peak off-business hours, late nights, and during the weekends, in addition to establishing an expanded intake network in order to maximize the number of beneficiaries of the program. This project will result in 80 individuals that are referred by law enforcement for pre-arrest diversion to treatment, and will provide transitional housing assistance for at least four of these individuals.### "

In contrast, states' and large municipalities' public health authorities have ready, direct access to the SNS. “There’s no reason that Tribal communities should lack access to essential medical equipment and supplies in any scenario – especially a global pandemic,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud to join Senator Warren and my colleagues to introduce this legislation that guarantees IHS facilities, Tribal health departments, and urban Indian organizations have access to the Strategic National Stockpile. This will make a world of difference in successfully obtaining life-saving resources for Tribal communities when they most need it.” In the Senate, the Tribal Medical Supplies Stockpile Access Act is led by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and cosponsored by U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.).

I see it in my home state, in a Rio Grande that is under stress like I’ve never seen before. I see dying Cottonwoods even when there’s water because of the heat stress. I see winter temperatures that are just not what we’re used to. And then you see the extreme fire behavior as we saw in Colorado. And we can’t accept this. This cannot be the status quo that we’re going to pass on to our kids and grandkids. They deserve better. And the start of how we win this fight is to pass Build Back Better.”The Build Back Better Act includes provisions that Senator Heinrich has championed to make home electrification more affordable, launch a new Civilian Climate Corps, and deliver powerful incentives to build new clean energy projects, high-voltage transmission lines, and infrastructure for electric vehicles.In November 2021, Senator Heinrich, alongside Senator Smith, Rep. Castor, and U.S. Representative Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), announced the first-ever, bicameral Electrification Caucus to advance policies that accelerate widespread electrification.Senator Heinrich has spent decades working to build a clean energy economy. He is fighting for investments in the Build Back Better Act to help communities confront the climate crisis head on, move the clean energy transition forward, and power New Mexico’s economic recovery.Senator Heinrich is focused on creating jobs of the future, confronting the climate crisis, modernizing America’s electric grid, and preparing New Mexico for the energy transition. As a national leader in energy policy, Senator Heinrich has championed the development of renewable energy projects on public and Tribal lands, the siting of transformative high-voltage transmission lines, and the research and adoption of innovative energy storage, clean hydrogen, and microgrid technologies. ###"

We can only have a democracy if we can all agree to live by the results of our elections, and we accept the math. The Big Lie that Donald Trump created was all about him trying to hold power for himself. But what is even more dangerous is that it created this incredible and widespread distrust of fact and truth.""Even after the attack on January 6th, the insurrection didn’t really end. It just shifted to an effort in state after state to make it harder for people to cast their ballots. It shifted from an overt and violent insurrection to overturn the last election to a very concerted effort in Republican-led State Legislatures all across the country to disenfranchise legitimate voters.""It’s clear that we must protect the rights of all lawful Americans to vote. States like New Mexico have shown that making it easier to vote and increasing election security can go hand in hand. I’m proud that elections officials in our state have stepped up to make voting safer, more secure, and at the same time much more accessible for every New Mexican.""We need to set national elections standards that treat all citizens with the right to vote equally, that invest in more secure elections infrastructure, and bring more transparency and auditing to provide an extra level of faith in our voting systems. We also need to end the practice of anonymous dark money flooding into our politics, which has had a caustic impact on our ability to govern and work across the aisle. That’s what the Freedom to Vote Act would accomplish. ""We cannot give up on passing this critical legislation for our democracy—and we should never allow the Senate filibuster rules to stand in the way of protecting our most fundamental American right.""### "

New Mexico would receive an estimated $29.4 million annually, with nearly $16.5 million in state formula grants and $12.9 million distributed among the counties.“The opioid epidemic has left too many New Mexicans with the heavy burden of seeking treatment and recovery resources – many that are too often underfunded,” said Heinrich, a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. “I’m proud to support the Comprehensive Addiction Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which will support our state, Tribal, and local governments to address the substance use disorder crisis, including the opioid epidemic.” Last year, approximately 275 Americans died each day from a drug overdose while the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated our nation’s mental health and substance use disorder crises. According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is estimated that more than 100,000 people died of drug overdoses between May 2020 and May 2021, an increase of more than 20 percent over the previous year. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that 40.3 million people reported suffering from substance use disorder in the past year. Despite the critical need for substance use disorder services, only about 6.5% of those in need of specialty treatment for substance use disorders were able to access it in 2020.The CARE Act would provide $125 billion over ten years to fight this crisis, including:Of the total funding, the CARE Act would invest nearly $1 billion a year provided directly to Tribal governments and organizations, including:The substance use disorder crisis is devastating communities across the nation — but it has a particularly severe impact on Native people. CDC data show that drug overdose death rates for American Indians and Alaska Natives living in nonmetropolitan areas increased by 500% between 1999 and 2015, with American Indians and Alaska Natives suffering a greater increase in deaths over those years compared to any other demographic. And in 2019, American Indians and Alaska Natives had a higher drug overdose death rate than any other demographic (30 per 100,000). Yet, it is known that overdose deaths of Native people are under-reported.In spite of the harm that the opioid crisis brings to American Indian and Alaska Native communities, Tribal governments — which are often required to work with state governments in order to obtain federal funds — have struggled to access the resources they need to combat the epidemic. The CARE Act would provide nearly $1 billion per year directly to Tribal governments and organizations to address this crisis.The legislation is led by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and cosponsored by U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), Edward J.

Yet, the Department continues to detain individuals at Torrance, which failed an [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]-contracted inspection less than four months ago,” wrote the lawmakers. “In the year leading up to the failed inspection, Torrance received 43 grievances from individuals detained at the facility regarding safety concerns, medical care, and food violations. The fact that Torrance had advance notice of the inspection, and still failed it, underscores the deeply rooted structural problems at the facility.”In the letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ICE Acting Director Tae Johnson, and President and CEO of CoreCivic, the lawmakers explain that approximately two months after the Torrance facility failed its inspection, ICE transferred in a group of approximately 80 Haitian asylum seekers, some of who suffered inhumane abuse in Del Rio, Texas, by U.S. Border Patrol.These individuals have experienced severe barriers to legal and language interpretation services. Four individuals were given deportation orders who had not had access to legal representation. The lawmakers are expressing that without legal representation and language interpretation services, Haitian asylum seekers detained in Torrance face a nearly impossible task of being prepared for their immigration hearings and thus finding refuge in the United States.Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Secretary Mayorkas, Acting Director Johnson, and Mr. Hininger:We write to request the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conduct increased oversight on CoreCivic’s management of Torrance County Detention Facility (Torrance) in Estancia, New Mexico and for ICE and CoreCivic to implement immediate remedial measures addressing current barriers to legal counsel and language interpretation services experienced by Haitian asylum seekers detained at this facility.In May 2021, DHS publicly stated it would not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention. Yet, the Department continues to detain individuals at Torrance, which failed an ICE-contracted inspection less than four months ago. In the year leading up to the failed inspection, Torrance received 43 grievances from individuals detained at the facility regarding safety concerns, medical care, and food violations. The fact that Torrance had advance notice of the inspection, and still failed it, underscores the deeply rooted structural problems at the facility.Approximately two months after Torrance failed its inspection, ICE transferred into the facility a group of approximately 80 Haitian migrants. Some of these individuals suffered inhumane abuse in Del Rio, Texas at the hands of U.S. Border Patrol (USBP), actions which were strongly condemned by the American public and President Biden. At Torrance, these individuals have faced severe barriers to legal representation, prohibiting them from being able to prepare for their asylum hearings, which are scheduled in an immigration court with an asylum denial rate of 93%. It took over two months for ICE to grant a group of attorneys and legal representatives permission to speak with many of these individuals , during which at least four were given deportation orders who had not had access to legal representation. Providing detainees with access to legal services, particularly for non-English and non-Spanish speakers, is integral to a fair and just immigration system. Furthermore, due to CoreCivic’s failure to provide language interpretation services, Haitian Creole-speaking detainees are unable to communicate with detention officers present at the facility. Documented onsite visits reveal CoreCivic staff have provided individuals limited information about the asylum process and without interpretation to Haitians in Creole. On the rare occasions that attorneys had success meeting with Haitian detainees, they were also not provided interpretation services to effectively communicate with their clients. Due to the lack of interpretation services and the steep barriers blocking access to counsel, Haitian asylum seekers detained in Torrance face the nearly impossible task of being prepared for their immigration hearings and thus finding refuge in the United States.Lastly, given that some of the Haitian migrants at Torrance were subject to the USBP’s abusive treatment in Del Rio, Texas, DHS must take all necessary actions to ensure that potential witnesses are not removed from the United States pending the Office of Professional Responsibility’s investigation on such abuse. For this reason, and the aforementioned barriers to legal representation at Torrance, we request DHS and ICE take the following actions:Thank you for your attention and we look forward to hearing about the actions you will expeditiously take to remediate these issues.Sincerely,###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/icymi-fox-news-oped-by-sens-heinrich-blunt-democrats-and-republicans-can-work-together-to-save-americas-wildlife,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 17, 2021) - In an op-ed published by Fox News, U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) describe how their bipartisanRecovering America’s Wildlife Act (RAWA) of 2021 would invest in proactive, on-the-ground conservation work led by states, territories, and Tribal nations to support the long-term health of fish and wildlife habitat all across America. These locally-driven, science-based strategies would restore populations of species with the greatest conservation need.Since introduction, the legislation has gained significant momentum with 32 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and is backed by over 60 Tribes and 1,500 organizations representing state fish and wildlife agencies, sportsmen and women, conservation groups, and industry associations and businesses.Democrats And Republicans Can Work Together To Save America's WildlifeBY U.S. SENS. MARTIN HEINRICH AND ROY BLUNTFRIDAY, DECEMEBER 17, 2021At a time when it has become difficult to find many areas of agreement in Washington, the outdoors have proven to be a real uniting force.The two of us were proud to help lead the bipartisan effort last year to pass the historic Great American Outdoors Act into law, which is already helping us tackle the longstanding infrastructure backlog at our national parks and public lands. We are now teaming up to make similar historic progress on species recovery and wildlife habitat.The abundance of many species that we hunt and fish today is the direct result of collaborative work financed by bedrock conservation laws like Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson. Yet despite the incredible successes of these programs—particularly with game species like elk and mule deer in New Mexico and sportfish like black bass in Missouri— and the successes of the Endangered Species Act in preventing hundreds of species from going extinct, it’s been clear for decades that thousands of species of plants and animals are still declining or even heading towards extinction.Without enough resources, state, and Tribal wildlife agencies have been forced to pick and choose which species are worth saving. Instead of doing the proactive work that is necessary to maintain healthy wildlife populations on the front end, they have been forced into using reactive, ""emergency room"" measures to rescue species after they are listed as threatened or endangered.We urgently need to change this paradigm and save thousands of species with a solution that matches the magnitude of the challenge. Our bill, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, offers us a constructive path forward. This legislation would be the most significant investment in wildlife conservation in a generation—it would fund proactive, voluntary conservation efforts to address the nation’s wildlife crisis. These efforts could and often would include partnerships with private landowners.The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act establishes a new program, the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program, within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to promote voluntary conservation efforts to restore and protect at-risk, threatened, or endangered species. This new program would provide approximately $1.3 billion annually to states, U.S. territories, and Tribes for activities related to proactive and collaborative habitat restoration efforts to increase wildlife populations and prevent species from ever needing to be listed under the Endangered Species Act.These projects will create substantial economic benefits, including good-paying jobs in rural communities. They will preserve outdoor recreation activities like hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing that support millions of additional jobs all across our country. And they will help us restore healthy habitat for the more than 12,000 species in our country that are currently identified as species of greatest conservation need.We’re proud of the broad, bipartisan coalition of sportsmen and sportswomen, conservationists, scientists, states, Tribes, and wildlife advocates who are calling on Congress to pass RAWA. The bill has garnered support from all fifty states, Tribes, and nearly 2,000 organizations across the country, such as the National Wildlife Federation, Ducks Unlimited, the Boone and Crockett Club, the Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies, the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, NRDC, the Audubon Society, and the Nature Conservancy.The numbers of wildlife currently facing down threats can be daunting. But just think how dire things must have seemed many decades ago when sportsmen came together to establish a tax on themselves and to voluntarily limit harvest in order to recover the game they loved to hunt. We should follow their example if we want to successfully recover healthy populations of wildlife species—from bob-white quail and meadow larks in Missouri to Gila trout and Southwestern willow flycatchers in New Mexico. If we can pass the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act into law, our grandchildren will be able to experience the same rich and abundant American wildlife—from bumblebees to bison—that we have been so lucky to grow up with. We will pass on the full complement of our natural heritage as well as traditions like hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing to future Americans. We hope all of our colleagues and our constituents will join us in backing this effort to pay it forward. ###"

Based on formula funding alone, New Mexico can expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years in federal highway formula funding authorized by this new law. On an average annual basis, this is about 29.7% more than the State’s Federal-aid highway formula funding under current law.“Transportation infrastructure is what connects us all and is fundamental to a thriving economy,” said Heinrich. “These substantial transportation investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will have real-life impacts on New Mexicans, including new jobs, safer roads, better public transportation, modernized airports and ports of entry, and a national network of chargers for electric vehicles.” “Safe roads are critical to every facet of our community, from children getting to school safely, to New Mexicans traveling to and from work,” said Luján. “That’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues in announcing the first traunch of federal funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I was proud to help shape that will renovate New Mexico’s roads and bridges and create more good paying jobs in the process.""“We are excited to announce this first round of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to modernize our roads and bridges, and create good-paying jobs for New Mexicans,”said Leger Fernández. “Safer roads will help revitalize our communities and allow our local economies to thrive. I’m proud to have helped deliver this critical funding for our state and look forward to seeing money flow directly into our communities.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill is bringing over $3.7 billion in funding to New Mexico to fix our roads and bridges, install broadband, and address the water and drought needs of our communities,” said Stansbury. “Today we’re excited to announce the first traunch of road and bridge funding which will help make it easier for New Mexicans to get to work and be safe on our roads. This funding will also help create good-paying jobs and invest in our local economy. I was proud to vote for this bill and see the funding now coming to our state.”The historic and bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, strongly supported by Heinrich, Luján, Leger Fernández, and Stansbury and signed into law by President Biden on November 15th, secured new federal funding for highway and bridge repair for communities across the nation. The funds, administered by the Federal-aid Highway Program, can be used for construction, reconstruction, or improvement.The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced yesterday that it is providing $52.5 billion in funding to all 50 states and the District of Columbia under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/members-of-nm-delegation-applaud-final-passage-of-annual-defense-bill,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 15, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representatives Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) are welcoming the final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022. The defense bill has passed both chambers of Congress with strong bipartisan support and now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.“After serving over a decade on Armed Services Committees in the House and Senate, I’m proud to continue supporting New Mexico’s military installations and the incredible service members dedicated to carrying out our national security missions,” said Heinrich, now Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. “This bill makes major investments to provide our Armed Forces with the state-of-the-art equipment they need to stay ahead of our adversaries and to advance our leadership in emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Directed Energy, and Hypersonics. I'm especially pleased that we are passing provisions that I authored to advance the Department of Defense’s Artificial Intelligence and digital capabilities so we can maintain our competitive advantage in the rapidly changing cyber space. These provisions, among many others, benefit New Mexico’s economy, and advance our state’s position as a leader in national security for years to come.”Heinrich concluded, “I’m proud that this legislation maintains a strong commitment to our service members who keep all of us safe, and makes historic reforms to the military’s handling of sexual assault cases.” ""Today, I was proud to support the passage of the annual defense authorization bill that supports New Mexico's service members and their families, our four military installations, and two national laboratories,"" said Luján. ""I’m proud this legislation includes a much-needed pay raise for service members, long overdue military justice reforms to provide independent oversight of sexual assault cases, and other critical diversity measures to ensure that our military leadership reflects the brave men and women serving our nation. This NDAA also delivers on the commitment DOD and DOE made by pushing the Air Force to remediate contaminated water caused by PFAS and other legacy waste disposal around Los Alamos."" “This year’s NDAA increases military pay, addresses vital needs of our service members and their families, and funds programs important to our economy and national security,”said Stansbury. “New Mexicans have a long and proud history of answering the call to serve, and I am proud to be able to represent our communities and to help deliver key funding for our bases and National Labs.”“Today, the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act with provisions to improve the quality of life for our brave service members, including increased pay, strengthened parental leave, and funding for education. I’m proud to have secured an amendment requiring Air Force reporting on PFAS contamination and remediation. I also secured funding for UNM to stimulate the workforce development needed for our science and innovation economy,” said Leger Fernández. “This bill also makes historic changes to how the military handles sexual assault. These life-saving reforms will better protect our women and men in uniform.The National Defense Authorization Act supports a total of $777.7 billion in fiscal year 2022 funding for national defense. Within this topline, the legislation authorizes $740.0 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and $27.8 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy (DOE).The full text of the FY22 NDAA can be found here. A summary of the FY22 NDAA can be found here.###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-stansbury-lujn-leger-fernndez-introduce-legislation-to-authorize-investments-in-early-childhood-k-12-education,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 15, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) introduced bicameral legislation to provide federal approval for the State of New Mexico’s proposal to invest Land Grant Permanent Fund (LGPF) dollars into early childhood education, as approved by the Legislature earlier this year. U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) are original cosponsors. In March 2021, the New Mexico Legislature passed House Joint Resolution 1 (HJR1), a historic resolution that will propose a constitutional amendment to the voters to invest the state’s permanent funds in early childhood education programs throughout the state. This change to the state’s constitution requires proposed authorization from Congress and approval from New Mexico voters, likely to be on the ballot in the November 2022 election.The New Mexico Education Enhancement Act serves as the mechanism to grant the required federal approval needed for New Mexico to advance on its goals.“Too many children in New Mexico are showing up to kindergarten so far behind their classmates that they can’t catch up. We need to level the playing field for our kids—especially in their earliest years—if we want to set all of them up with a strong foundation for long-term academic and career success,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud to introduce this legislation to provide Congressional consent to allow New Mexico to tap into our Land Grant Permanent Fund so we can provide high-quality early childhood education for all of our kids.”“Investing in our kids and their education, is an investment in our future. Investing in early childhood education and care is one of the best investments we can make in our families, our economy, and the well-being of our communities,” said Stansbury. “That’s why I’m proud to join Senator Heinrich and our delegation to introduce a bill to empower New Mexico to invest in our early childhood education system. Combined with the universal pre-K investments in the Build Back Better Act, New Mexico’s plan to use the Land Grant Permanent Fund to invest in early education will create one of the best-funded early education systems in the country. I was proud to stand with our kids, our educators, and our families in New Mexico in passing this legislation in the state legislature earlier this year, and I am deeply proud to introduce this legislation in Congress today to ensure a brighter future for our state.”“This legislation is instrumental in providing New Mexico’s children, students, and teachers with permanent and sustainable funds for early childhood education,” said Luján. “It will be the single most important investment we can make in our children and their educators in New Mexico, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to act on this critical legislation to transform early childhood and K-12 education in my state.” “Thank you, Congresswoman Stansbury and Senator Heinrich, for introducing this legislation and for the entire coalition behind New Mexico’s constitutional amendment. We are at an important moment. Next year, New Mexicans have the opportunity to make their voices heard at the polls and invest in the future of our children,” said Leger Fernández. “I look forward to helping champion the passage of this bill that will incorporate this historic amendment into the New Mexico constitution. When we invest in our children, we invest in our future.”New Mexico’s Land Grant Permanent Fund is derived from revenues generated on 13 million acres of land granted by the United States to the Territory of New Mexico under the Ferguson Act of 1898 and the Enabling Act of 1910 after New Mexico was incorporated into the U.S. after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Since that time, the fund has grown through royalties from natural resources development and returns on invested capital. As of September 30, 2021, the Land Grant Permanent Fund was valued at $24.5 billion, with 5 percent of earnings distributed annually to New Mexico’s public schools.The proposed constitutional amendment would allocate an additional 1.25% annual distribution from the Land Grant Permanent Fund, with 60 percent of the additional allocation directed to early childhood education — estimated to be about $126.9 million per year — and 40% to public education. The total additional distribution would be an estimated $245.7 million each year for New Mexico’s children.Senators Heinrich and Luján and Representatives Stansbury and Leger Fernández are also backing the Build Back Better Act, which will make access to high-quality universal preschool a reality for children across the country. The proposal builds on states’ existing infrastructure to expand access to free, universal, high-quality, and inclusive preschool services for 3- and 4- year olds and raise wages for preschool teachers. With New Mexico ranking as 49th or 50th in many national education and childhood well-being metrics, the Build Back Better Act and Land Grant Permanent Fund investments would complement each other, doubling down on efforts to set children up for success. The federal legislation authorizing New Mexico’s constitutional amendment has been endorsed by over 30 New Mexico organizations and passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support in the state legislature.Those organizations include CHI St. Joseph's Children, Organizing in the Land of Enchantment (OLE), Center for Civic Policy, Youth Development, Inc. (YDI), Abriendo Puertas/Opening Doors, NM Communidades en Accion y de Fe (CAFÉ), Center for Civic Policy, New Mexico Dream Team, Dreams in Action NM, The Semilla Project, New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, New Mexico Voices for Children, New Mexico Working Families Party, NAVA Education Project, New Mexico Black Central Organizing Committee (NMBCOC), New Mexico Thrives, New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops, Lutheran Advocacy Ministry, New Mexico and the New Mexico Conference of Churches, New Mexico Asian Family Center, National Education Association New Mexico (NEA-NM), Save the Children Action Network, Partnership for Community Action, Southwest Organizing Project, Ngage New Mexico, New Mexico Association for the Education of Young Children (NMAEYC), The League of Women Voters of New Mexico, NACA Inspired Schools Network (NISN), Together for Brothers, and Growing Up New Mexico.“We are grateful to Senator Heinrich and Congresswoman Stansbury for helping us advance HJR1 in the US Congress. Passing HJR1 earlier this year in the New Mexico Legislature was a huge first step in the kinds of deep investments that will turn the tide on education and family well-being in New Mexico. We will continue to work together to make sure that we get this across the finish line, giving voters the opportunity to make a transformational investment in our children—because the future of our state depends on it,” said N.M. State Representative and House Leader Javier Martinez. “Our children are our future. We have the resources to provide world class early childhood services for all New Mexico’s children,” said N.M. State Representative Moe Maestas. “New Mexico’s hardworking families need the security of sustainable and reliable funding for crucial early childhood programs like home visiting, child care assistance and preschool. This constitutional amendment will provide the stability needed to grow, improve and sustain our early childhood system, stability that is often lacking with our oil revenue roller coaster or the ebb and flow of federal funding,” said Jessa Cowdrey, Vice President of CHI St. Joseph’s Children (Disclaimer: CHI St. Joseph’s Children does not accept government funding).""Ngage NM fully supports this groundbreaking opportunity for New Mexico to invest recurring dollars in early childhood education and K-12 education. There is no denying the importance of strategically dedicating state resources to our most valuable assets, our children, so that every child has opportunities to thrive. New Mexico voters deserve to have their voices heard on this critical amendment to the state constitution,” said Lori Martinez, Executive Director of Ngage New Mexico. “The plan to invest a small share of the Land Grant Permanent Fund in early childhood services has been in the works for many years, and Senator Heinrich has always been a champion of it. He understands the transformational power of high-quality early childhood care and education programs for New Mexico’s children. We appreciate that he and Rep. Melanie Stansbury are co-sponsoring the legislation needed to garner congressional support for this important change to the state constitution,” said Amber Wallin, Deputy Director of New Mexico Voices for Children.Read the full text of the bill by clicking here. ###"

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujn-call-on-treasury-irs-to-ensure-all-eligible-same-sex-couples-receive-pension-survivor-benefits,"Under current law, some individuals in same-sex relationships who lost their partners shortly after being married or before they were able to legally marry are being denied survivor benefits by retirement plansWASHINGTON (Dec. 13, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), and 43 of their Senate Democratic colleagues sent a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Charles Rettig calling for the Biden Administration to revise current guidance that has led to members of the LGBTQIA+ community being denied pension survivor benefits after losing their life partner.The letter calls for action to address the fact that some retirement plans are refusing to deem same-sex marriages as having met the one-year requirement necessary to be eligible for survivor benefits in situations where the couples were legally barred from marrying within one-year of the participant’s death. The Social Security Administrationrecently took action to stop such obstacles from denying people survivor benefits through Social Security, and the Senators urged the IRS to take similar action to ensure individuals aren’t denied pension survivor benefits due to discrimination.“We write to urge you to reconsider the guidance issued under the Obama Administration that permits certain qualified retirement plans to discriminate against providing survivor benefits to same-sex couples. We should not let the echoes of the bigotry that robbed so many people of the right to marry for so long rob them once again after they have lost their loved ones,” wrote the senators. The senators added, “When the Supreme Court struck down state bans on same-sex marriage, tens of thousands of Americans rushed to get married. These LGBTQ+ Americans had been in committed relationships for years—some, for decades—and were finally able to have their love recognized under the law and receive all of the benefits that come with marriage. However, in a painful reminder of the inequality these couples have long faced, some in same-sex relationships who tragically lost their partner shortly after being married or before they were able to legally marry have also been kept from receiving survivor benefits. For these surviving spouses or partners, difficulties arise where access to benefits depends on the length of their marriage.” The letter was led by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Chair of the Senate Finance Committee. Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Secretary Yellen and Commissioner Rettig:We write to urge you to reconsider the guidance issued under the Obama Administration that permits certain qualified retirement plans to discriminate against providing survivor benefits to same-sex couples. We should not let the echoes of the bigotry that robbed so many people of the right to marry for so long rob them once again after they have lost their loved ones.When the Supreme Court struck down state bans on same-sex marriage, tens of thousands of Americans rushed to get married. These LGBTQ+ Americans had been in committed relationships for years—some, for decades—and were finally able to have their love recognized under the law and receive all of the benefits that come with marriage. However, in a painful reminder of the inequality these couples have long faced, some in same-sex relationships who tragically lost their partner shortly after being married or before they were able to legally marry have also been kept from receiving survivor benefits.For these surviving spouses or partners, difficulties arise where access to benefits depends on the length of their marriage. For example, under current law, certain qualified retirement plans must provide a qualified joint and survivor annuity (“QJSA”) upon retirement to married participants (and generally must provide a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (“QPSA”) to the surviving spouse of a married participant who dies before retirement). A plan, however, does not have to treat a participant as married unless the participant and spouse have been married throughout the one-year period ending on the earlier of the annuity starting date or the date of the participant’s death.It has come to our attention that some retirement plans are refusing to deem same-sex marriages as having met the one-year requirement when the couples were legally barred from marrying within one-year of the participant’s death. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued guidance following the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.In Notice 2014-19, the IRS required a qualified retirement plan to recognize the same-sex spouse of a participant as the participant’s spouse on and after June 26, 2013, if the participant was domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, as well as on and after September 16, 2013, if the participant was domiciled in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriages. The guidance, though, also notably provided that a qualified retirement plan will not be disqualified “merely because it did not recognize the same-sex spouse of a participant as a spouse before June 26, 2013.”By permitting a plan to disregard same-sex relationships before that date, the IRS ignores the reality that many of these couples were barred from marriage because of discriminatory marriage laws where they lived—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could. It was not until June 26, 2015, that same-sex relationships were properly recognized, when the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodgesa constitutional right to marry, including the “constellation” of rights associated with marriage, such as the “rights and benefits of survivors.”The Social Security Administration recently recognized this reality and will accept and/or reconsider claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were unable to be married for the required nine months because of state marriage bans. The IRS should do the same for pension survivor benefits. Just as laws barring same-sex couples from marriage are unconstitutional, so, too, are exclusions from survivor benefits that are tied to those marriage bans. Specifically, the IRS should revise its 2014 guidance to require that qualified retirement plans with marriage duration requirements must recognize as eligible for survivor benefitsbona fide same-sex relationships where same-sex partners had married their loved ones but were denied equal access to benefits because they were prevented from being married for the time required under the plans’ documents, or where they were prevented from marrying their loved ones at all. While the use of a marriage duration requirement may be justified as a proxy for detecting or deterring sham relationships between opposite-sex couples—who have always enjoyed the right to marry—it cannot serve that function for same-sex couples who were banned from marrying one another. Surviving same-sex partners and spouses who were unable to be married because of discriminatory marriage laws should be permitted to submit new claims for survivor benefits or reopen previously denied claims. Correcting this error will end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex partners and spouses, and allow them to access the benefits they are owed.We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-supports-inclusion-of-groundbreaking-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-amendment-in-final-ndaa,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is cosponsoring an amendment included in the final National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 to establish an office that would replace the current Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force and would have access to Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community data related to UAPs. The office will have the authority to establish a coordinated effort to report and respond to UAPs, significantly improve data-sharing between agencies on UAP sightings, address national security concerns, and report health effects people may experience in relation to UAP events. The office will be administered jointly between the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, and will empower military and civilian personnel working for the DoD and Intelligence Community to report incidents and information involving UAPs.“The American people deserve transparency when it comes to UAPs – especially given the national security implications,”said Heinrich. “To do that, we need to elevate this issue within our defense and intelligence agencies so they have the mandate to focus not only on what is happening in our skies, but also on relaying these findings to the American people. By creating this new office, we start taking a critical, unified approach to collecting and reporting UAP data, ending the previous cycle of sweeping these sightings under the rug.”As established in the NDAA, the UAP office would be given the task of providing a full spectrum of intelligence, scientific, and technical assessments related to UAPs, including:"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/bipartisan-recovering-americas-wildlife-act-receives-key-hearing,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 8, 2021) – Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) delivered remarks on his Recovering America’s Wildlife Act (RAWA) before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee legislative hearing.The bipartisan Recovering America’s Wildlife Act invests in proactive, on-the-ground conservation work led by states, territories, and Tribal nations to support the long-term health of fish and wildlife and their habitat all across America. These locally-driven, science-based strategies would restore populations of species with the greatest conservation need.Senator Heinrich, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, introduced the bipartisan legislation alongside U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in July. Since introduction, the legislation has gained significant momentum with 32 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and is backed by over 60 Tribes and 1,500 organizations representing state fish and wildlife agencies, sportsmen and women, conservation groups, and industry associations and businesses. Senators Heinrich and Blunt’s legislation is cosponsored in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Angus King (I-Maine), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Marco Rubio

(D-Minn.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.).A copy of the bill is here. Senator Heinrich’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below.Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished members of this Committee:Thank you for allowing me to share a few words about the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act—or RAWA.I’ve been proud to team up with my Republican colleague from Missouri, Senator Roy Blunt, on this bipartisan legislation.And I’m grateful for the support of the 16 Republican and 16 Democratic co-sponsors, including many members of this Committee.As well as the support from the administration on this issue, including their testimony in support of the House version of this legislation.RAWA would establish a robust and reliable federal funding stream for collaborative, proactive, voluntary, on-the-ground conservation work.  Consistent funding support has long been the missing piece in scaling up the type of recovery projects that have proven effective recovering wildlife and plant species to healthy levels. We’re just coming off of elk season in New Mexico, and I'm happy to say that my freezer is full.But elk were extinct in New Mexico a century ago.It is thanks to previous generations of conservationists and sportsmen and women that I have the privilege of interacting with this amazing and beautiful animal.I am indebted to people like Aldo Leopold, Elliot Barker, and federal, state, Tribal leaders whose actions led to the restoration of elk, mule deer and pronghorn populations in my home state and species like wild turkey, waterfowl, and white-tailed deer all across America.  The abundance of many species that we hunt and fish today is the direct result of collaborative work inspired by those previous generations of Americans and financed by bedrock conservation laws like Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson. Yet despite the incredible successes of these programs, particularly with game species and sportfish, and the successes of the Endangered Species Act in preventing hundreds of species from going extinct, it’s been clear for decades that too many species are still declining or even heading towards extinction.Without enough resources, our state, local, and Tribal wildlife agencies have been forced to pick and choose which species are worthy of their attention.And as a result, more than 12,000 species are currently identified as species of greatest conservation need.We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change this paradigm and save thousands of species with a solution that matches the magnitude of the challenge.The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act offers us a path forward.RAWA will fuel locally-driven, science-based projects that will restore healthy fish and wildlife habitat and robust wildlife populations.These projects will create substantial economic benefits, including good-paying jobs in rural communities.They will preserve outdoor recreation activities like hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing that support millions of additional jobs all across our country.And they will save the federal government and the private sector tens of billions of dollars by saving species before they need “emergency room” measures to survive.Before I finish, I want to emphasize just how bipartisan this issue is.This committee has proven that we can still pass bipartisan conservation provisions within the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, in the American Conservation Enhancement Act, and in the Water Resources Development Act. Last year, many of us here helped to pass the historic Great American Outdoors Act into law, which is already helping us tackle the longstanding infrastructure backlog at our national parks and public lands. As one of the most important wildlife bills in decades, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act will allow us to make similar historic progress on species recovery and wildlife habitat. I’m proud of the coalition of sportsmen and sportswomen, conservationists, scientists, states, Tribes, and wildlife advocates who are calling on Congress to pass RAWA.I have letters of support that I would like to submit for the record representing all fifty states, Tribes, and nearly 2,000 organizations across the country, such as the National Wildlife Federation, Ducks Unlimited, the Boone and Crockett Club, the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, NRDC, the Audubon Society, and the Nature Conservancy.I’ll close by saying that I want my grandchildren to experience the same wonder I had as a child catching leopard frogs and watching fireflies light up the dark.I hope we can pass on to them the full complement of our natural heritage—from bison to bumblebees—as well as traditions like hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing.That’s what this is all about.Thank you.### "
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/members-of-nm-delegation-welcome-almost-2-million-to-support-drought-response-projects-for-six-pueblos-in-nm,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 3, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representatives Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) and Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are welcoming almost $2 million in funding from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to support drought response projects for six Pueblos in New Mexico.The funding is through the Native American Affairs Technical Assistance to Tribes Program. BOR's Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program provides technical assistance to Indian Tribes to develop, manage, and protect their water and related resources. The program has supported a broad range of activities each year since its inception in the early 1990s.“The federal government has a trust responsibility to Tribes– especially when it comes to basic necessities like water. This funding from the Bureau of Reclamation, along with relief we secured in the American Rescue Plan and the historic investments in water infrastructure in the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, will deliver on this commitment,” said Heinrich, member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. “I’m proud to see Pueblos across New Mexico directly benefitting from the infrastructure investments that I’ve been fighting for.”“Robust water infrastructure is essential for the health and wellbeing of Tribal Nations, and these investments in six Pueblos in New Mexico will help preserve this critical resource,” said Luján, member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. “The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will deliver $3.5 billion for Tribal water and wastewater infrastructure – building off legislation that I introduced to make a difference in the lives of New Mexicans across the state.” “Increased droughts and rising temperatures make resources like water critical for our Tribal communities. Our trust responsibility combined with the Pueblos’ reverence for their precious water means that the $2 million dollars in funding will help these six Pueblos not only survive, but thrive,” said Leger Fernández. “As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples I championed water funding in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Act.”“I’m excited to see this funding come to Pueblos across New Mexico. Water is life and water is essential. Pueblo communities have lived and farmed on this land since time immemorial. Investments in water infrastructure are essential to keeping water flowing where it is needed most,” said Stansbury. “I’m looking forward to seeing these projects get underway, and all that will come from the bipartisan Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act we just passed. These projects are essential, especially as we are grappling with drought and climate change. The Build Back Better Act will help further these investments in drought and long-term climate resilience.”The funding will be provided to Tribes as grants or cooperative agreements. The projects selected are:The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that was recently signed into law includesprovisions championed by Senator Heinrich to improve Tribal access to clean water. The provisions in largely mirror the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act introduced by Senator Heinrich and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.).The Native American and International Affairs Office in the Commissioner's Office serves as the central coordination point for the Native American Affairs Program and lead for policy guidance for Native American issues in Reclamation.

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-murkowski-applaud-house-passage-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-safeguard-tribal-items,"WASHINGTON (Dec. 3, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) are applauding the House-passage of companion legislation to their bipartisan Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act to prohibit the exporting of sacred Native American items and increase penalties for stealing and illegal trafficking.In the 116th Congress, Senators Heinrich and Murkowski successfully passed the STOP Act out of the Senate by unanimous consent. Senators Heinrich and Murkowski reintroduced the legislation in April of this year. It was favorably reported from the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs over the summer and now awaits Senate approval.“For years, I’ve been proud to work with Pueblos in New Mexico, the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apache Nations, the Navajo Nation, and Tribes across Indian Country to halt the trade of culturally significant items and repatriate stolen pieces to their rightful owners,” said Heinrich. “I thank Representative Leger Fernández for successfully taking up this fight in the House. It’s clear that we have the support and the momentum to get the STOP Act across the finish line.""“Alaska Natives and American Indians experience loss of culture and heritage through the illegal exportation and overseas auctions of sacred objects with no recourse to repatriate these items back to the United States. These tribal cultural heritage items are vital to protecting the identity of Native people. I reintroduced the STOP Act with Senator Heinrich to prevent individuals from exporting sacred objects without the consent of tribal communities. The action taken by the House of Representatives is another positive step forward in safeguarding native cultures,"" said Murkowski. The House companion is led by U.S. Representatives Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), Don Young (R-Alaska), Tom Cole (R-Okla.), and Sharice Davids (D-Kan.).“For years, many sacred, tribal cultural items not meant for commercial use were stolen, exported, and sold to the highest bidder,” said Leger Fernández. “Today, we acted to put an end to this and passed the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act. This bill will provide American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and federal agencies the necessary tools to protect these sacred items. These cultural items should be with those who create them and know how to revere and protect them.""The STOP Act will help prevent instances like the auction of a shield stolen from the Pueblo of Acoma. Senator Heinrich played a role in the effort to bring the shield home by working with Governors Kurt Riley and Brian Vallo to call for its return. The STOP Act has been endorsed by organizations and Tribes across Indian Country.

https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujn-call-for-inclusion-of-military-justice-bill-in-final-ndaa,"WASHINGTON (Nov. 30, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) are part of a bicameral push of lawmakers urging Senate Armed Services Committee leadership to keep the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act (MJIIPA) in the final National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The inclusion of this bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by both Senators Heinrich and Luján, would create an impartial, fair, and accountable military justice system. In a bipartisan, bicameral letter signed by 44 senators and 22 members of the House, the lawmakers write, “It is outrageous that the Senate and House Armed Services Committees would even consider stripping out a provision that is backed by a bipartisan majority in both chambers and has been included in the Senate version of the bill.”The lawmakers continued, “Sexual assault in the military is a serious concern and demands a real solution, not a watered-down provision slipped in the final bill behind closed doors. Retaining the full provision will ensure that the will of this strong majority of members is respected. This provision is the only reform that will provide true independence for prosecutors in the military justice system and is essential to ensure that victims, accused, and the public all have full faith and confidence in the military justice process.”MJIIPA would professionalize how the military prosecutes serious crimes by moving the decision over whether to prosecute them to independent, experienced military prosecutors, and was successfully included in the committee-passed Senate NDAA for Fiscal Year 2022. MJIIPA currently has 66 Senate co-sponsors and the House companion legislation has 220 co-sponsors, representing a majority of the House.In addition to the bill’s widespread congressional support, veterans service groups are also applying pressure to congressional leadership. On November 23, coalition of veterans groups—including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Student Veterans of America, the Service Women Action Network and Vietnam Veterans of America— wrote a letter to congressional leaders pushing them not to remove or water down military sexual assault reform provisions in the final NDAA. The American Legion sent a similar letter on November 29.The letter, led by U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, was also signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Chris Coons (D-Del), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rob Marshall (R-Kan.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).Read the full text of the letter by clicking here. ###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-lujn-push-for-latino-womens-smithsonian-museums,"WASHINGTON (Nov. 23, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) are part of a bipartisan group of senators requesting Lonnie G. Bunch III, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to reiterate the intent of congressionally approved legislation from last year that both the National Museum of the American Latino and Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum be located on or near the National Mall.“The 116th Congress saw the passage of the creation of two new Smithsonian Museums into law… As we continue to move through this process, we want to take this opportunity to re-emphasize Congressional intent as stated in the authorizing legislation that both the National Museum of the American Latino and Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum be located on or near the National Mall, to the maximum extent practicable,”wrote the senators. The passing of this critically important legislation is the culmination of a decades-long process to create Smithsonian Museums that celebrate the historical, cultural, and economic contributions of women and Latinos throughout American history. The senators added, “With more than 25 million people visiting the National Mall each year, it comes as no surprise that many Smithsonian Institutions have claimed this area their home and best for the diffusion of knowledge. The addition of the two new museums on the Mall will further the Smithsonian’s mission by showcasing and highlighting the untold and overlooked contributions to our nation of both women and Latinos. It is fitting that these two museums be prominently located as that will help ensure that more visitors will be able to enjoy and learn from them.”The letter, led by U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), was also signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Michael Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), John Cornyn (D-Texas), Marco Rubio (D-Fla.), and Susan Collins (D-Maine). U.S. Representatives Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) and Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.-12) led an identical letter in the U.S. House of Representatives. Read a copy of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Secretary Bunch:The 116th Congress saw the passage of the creation of two new Smithsonian Museums into law. It comes with great excitement and comfort to have a partner at the helm who oversaw the creation of the extraordinary Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture that opened its doors in September 2016. Further, we applaud you for how quickly your team has begun to work to lay the foundation for both the Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum and the National Museum of the American Latino. As we continue to move through this process, we want to take this opportunity to re-emphasize Congressional intent as stated in the authorizing legislation that both the National Museum of the American Latino and Smithsonian American Women’s History Museum be located on or near the National Mall, to the maximum extent practicable. From our perspective, the National Mall is the two-mile park from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, bounded on the north and south by Constitution and Independence Avenues. With more than 25 million people visiting the National Mall each year, it comes as no surprise that many Smithsonian Institutions have claimed this area their home and best for the diffusion of knowledge. The addition of the two new museums on the Mall will further the Smithsonian’s mission by showcasing and highlighting the untold and overlooked contributions to our nation of both women and Latinos. It is fitting that these two museums be prominently located as that will help ensure that more visitors will be able to enjoy and learn from them.We appreciate your consideration of Congressional priorities as the Smithsonian works to establish these important museums. We look forward to working together and having a continued dialogue on how best to meet this intent. Sincerely,###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/heinrich-statement-on-house-passage-of-build-back-better-act,"WASHINGTON (Nov. 19, 2021) – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) issued the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act:“The Build Back Better Act is a game changer for our country. It will make once-in-a-generation investments in the American people, lower costs, cut taxes, create climate careers, and make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share. ""I remain deeply committed to seeing that the Senate takes this up quickly -- to increase opportunities for families in New Mexico and go big on climate action so our kids can inherit a safe and livable planet. Their future literally depends it. This is our best, and maybe our last, chance to pass policies that meet the scale of the climate crisis. We can’t afford to waste it.""###"

Senator Heinrich’s Buffalo Tract Protection Act and legislation to reauthorize the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area (NRGNHA).VIDEO: Heinrich’s Locally-Driven Conservation, Protection Bills Advance Out Of Committee [HD DOWNLOAD LINK HERE] The Buffalo Tract Protection Act would withdraw four parcels of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in southern Sandoval County, including the Buffalo Tract and the Crest of Montezuma, from any mineral development, including gravel mining.During the hearing, Senator Heinrich noted the local support behind the legislation “the local community is united in their opposition to new gravel mining on these particular tracts.” Senator Heinrich touted the conservation benefits of removing these Bureau of Land Management (BLM) parcels from mineral development as they serve “as critical wildlife connections between the Sandia Mountains to the south and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the north.” Senator Heinrich informed his colleagues that a vote to advance the legislation out of committee represents “a vote for the Pueblo of Santa Ana, the Pueblo of San Felipe, the people of Placitas, Merced De Comunidad De San Antonio De Las Huertas land grant, and everyone in this community who has worked so hard to craft this legislation for more than a decade now.”In October, Senator Heinrich secured support for the legislation from the BLM. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management at the U.S. Department of the Interior Dr. Steve Feldgus testified that Senator Heinrich’s bill aligns with the goals of the Biden administration.Senator Heinrich’s legislation to reauthorize the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area (NRGNHA) would continue the preservation of local cultural and historic resources through 2036. Without this critical reauthorization, the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area would lose federal support provided through the National Park Service (NPS). Senator Heinrich introduced the bicameral legislation with U.S. Representative Teresa Leger Fernández in order to extend NPS support for an additional 15 years.Both bills now head to the Senate Floor for full consideration.For an archived video of the full hearing click here. ###"
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/ahead-of-holidays-heinrich-hosts-discussion-about-covid-19-vaccines-for-kids-with-unm-pediatrician,"WASHINGTON (Nov. 18, 2021) – U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is encouraging New Mexico parents to take action now so that children ages 5 and up can complete their COVID-19 vaccination process in time for December holiday gatherings. Senator Heinrich hosted a Facebook Live discussion today with Dr. Heather Pratt-Chavez, a pediatrician at the University of New Mexico Hospital about the safe, effective, and approved COVID-19 vaccines for children in this age group.VIDEO: Heinrich Hosts Discussion With UNM Pediatrician About COVID-19 Vaccines For Kids [HD DOWNLOAD LINK HERE] “As a parent of two teenage boys, I thought it would be helpful for parents around New Mexico to hear directly from a leading expert in our state about the COVID-19 vaccines that are now approved for children ages 5 and up,” said Heinrich. “I know how seriously we have to consider questions about what is best for the health of our kids. A safe and effective dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for children is a critical step in helping us continue to fight this deadly virus, and finally get back to a sense of normalcy.” Senator Heinrich encouraged New Mexicans to consult with their pediatrician, doctor, or health provider about COVID-19 vaccines. For more information about how to schedule a vaccine appointment, visit the New Mexico Department of Health’s website, vaccinenm.org. Last month, Senator Heinrich welcomed the announcement that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for children ages 5-11 to begin receiving the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. In September, Senator Heinrich led a group of Democratic Senators in a letter calling on FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock to grant the EUA for the COVID-19 vaccine for children under the age of 12.According the American Academy of Pediatrics, more than 6.6 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide since the pandemic began. Nearly 1.6 million of those cases have come since the first week of September. The prevalence of Long COVID in children after initial infection may also create long-term impacts on their success and health. Tragically, over 625 children have died of COVID-19.### "
https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/press-releases/members-of-nm-delegation-call-on-usda-to-take-action-to-prohibit-lunch-shaming-of-students-with-meal-debts,"WASHINGTON (Nov. 17, 2021) – U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representatives Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) and Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) are calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to prohibit lunch shaming of students with school meal debts through the existing authority of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).In a letter to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, the lawmakers express their concerns that “[d]espite some successful local and national efforts to ban the practice, the FNS still permits [Local Education Agencies (LEAs)] to engage in a variety of pernicious practices in an attempt to collect families’ meal debt. These efforts are clearly unethical and disproportionately impact students of color. Examples include preventing youth from graduating or participating in extracurricular activities, and selling a family’s meal debt to a collection agency, which increases the debt and harms the family’s credit, exacerbating the economic insecurity of already struggling families.”The lawmakers are requesting that FNS issue guidance to ban punitive measures on students, prohibit billing children, and require notifications to be provided in multiple languages. The lawmakers are also asking that FNS issue guidance that prohibits LEAs and collection agencies from charging any interest and/or fees in addition to the original debt, and require LEAs to use the maximum timeframe for eligibility in establishing the effective date of eligibility for family certification and participation in the free or reduced meals program.Read the full text of the letter below or by clicking here.Dear Secretary Vilsack,We appreciate the efforts made by the USDA to address the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 public health emergency, including issuing several nationwide waivers and flexibilities. We recognize schools will continue to have the option to serve free meals to all students through June 2022 via the Seamless Summer Option. However, as districts transition off the waiver, there is urgent need to address unpaid meal charges through updated guidance by Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). We write to ask the FNS employ its existing authority to prohibit lunch shaming of students with school meal debts.Despite some successful local and national efforts to ban the practice, the FNS still permits LEAs to engage in a variety of pernicious practices in an attempt to collect families’ meal debt. These efforts are clearly unethical and disproportionately impact students of color. Examples include preventing youth from graduating or participating in extracurricular activities, and selling a family’s meal debt to a collection agency, which increases the debt and harms the family’s credit, exacerbating the economic insecurity of already struggling families.FNS has not updated guidance on this issue since 2017. Congress specifically directed the Secretary to “provide additional guidance to program operators to address the ongoing issue of shaming school children for unpaid school lunch fees” in the FY2020 report to accompany the Agriculture Appropriations Bill and again in the FY 2021 report.It is not enough to encourage LEAs to communicate respectfully, discourage them from stigmatizing children, or provide additional payment options. FNS should issue guidance that would ban punitive measures on students, prohibit billing children, and require notifications to be provided in multiple languages. FNS should also issue guidance prohibiting LEAs and collection agencies from charging any interest and/or fees in addition to the original debt, and require LEAs to use the maximum timeframe for eligibility in establishing the effective date of eligibility for family certification and participation in the free or reduced meals program.In May of this year when questioned by Congresswoman Leger Fernández about the USDA policies regarding lunch shaming during a hearing before the House Committee on Education and Labor, Deputy Under Secretary Stacy Dean stated that “Children should not be put in the middle of this problem, and that’s just unacceptable, and we need to see if there’s a way that we can develop a framework so that districts just don’t do that.” We believe that the changes outlined in this letter provide such a framework to limit accrual of meal debt, improve the collection of unpaid meal charges, and reduce lunch shaming and child hunger.We look forward to a timely response from your agency how you plan to move forward with these changes.  ###"
