WICKER, HYDE-SMITH PRAISE $5 MILLION AWARD TO SUPPORT MISSISSIPPI SHIPBUILDINGWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today praised the award of $4,999,634 from the U.S. Department of Defense to the State of Mississippi to modernize the state’s shipbuilding industry. The Defense Manufacturing Community Support Program funding will specifically target workforce development initiatives to increase the defense sector’s capacity, capability, and resilience in Mississippi.  The grant will be matched by an additional $1.8 million investment from the state.“Mississippi’s shipbuilders are the finest in the nation, but developing and retaining our talent requires long-term investment,” Wicker said.  “I am glad that the Department of Defense is making our shipbuilding mission a priority, and I am confident that this grant will help enhance our industrial capacity and strengthen our workforce.  I look forward to seeing Mississippi lead in building the world’s strongest fleet.”“This sizeable influx of Defense Department resources will strengthen the hand of this Mississippi shipbuilding consortium to prepare more shipbuilders to be part of the stronger national security industrial base our nation must have,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Ultimately, we want to ensure there are more opportunities for more men and women to join the powerhouse that is Mississippi’s shipbuilding industry.”AccelerateMS will lead a newly-formed Mississippi Shipbuilding Industry Preparedness for National Security (MS-SHIPS) Consortium, alongside the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, which will serve as the grant’s fiscal agent.  The MS-SHIPS Consortium is composed of 30 organizations including defense manufacturers and suppliers, academic institutions, government agencies, economic development organizations, and nonprofits.Consortium members include Mississippi State University Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems, the University of Mississippi Center for Manufacturing Excellence, Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, Pearl River Community College, Jones College, East Mississippi Community College, Southwest Mississippi Community College, Meridian Community College, Ingalls Shipbuilding, VT Halter Marine, Rolls Royce, Raytheon Intelligence & Space, the Jackson County Economic Development Foundation, the University of Southern Mississippi’s Mississippi Defense Initiative, the Mississippi Community College Board, the Mississippi Manufacturers Association-Manufacturing Extension Partnership, government entities, and K-12 districts.“Mississippi’s defense industry represents billions of dollars and thousands of jobs which not only keep our country safe but also are a critical piece of our state’s economy,” said AccelerateMS Executive Director Ryan Miller.  “I am encouraged by this partnership and the impact it will most definitely have on enhancing shipbuilding capacity and expanding workforce opportunities across Mississippi.”Read more about the grant here.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH SUPPORT SPORTSMEN, OPPOSE TRADITIONAL AMMO & TACKLE BANMiss. Senators Cosponsor Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2022WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) last week joined 21 Senators to advance legislation to prohibit the Biden administration from banning the use of traditional lead ammunition or tackle on public lands.The Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2022 (S.4940) would stop the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management from imposing such bans unless such an action is supported by science and state wildlife and fisheries agencies.“Mississippi’s sportsmen are some of our state’s strongest advocates for conservation, but recent moves from left-wing environmentalists threaten to limit their ability to hunt and fish on federal lands,” Wicker said.  “Moving forward with a ban on traditional ammunition and tackle is not supported by science or good sense, and I am glad to join many of my colleagues to fight to preserve the rights of hunters and anglers across our country.”“Attempts to ban traditional ammunition and fishing tackle was a bad idea in the Obama years and later in the Green New Deal.  It remains a flawed and scientifically unjustified notion under the Biden administration,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Hunting and fishing is a way of life for many Mississippians and an economic staple in our state and across the country.  Renewed efforts to ban traditional ammo must be stopped, which is what this bill will do.”Earlier this year, the FWS entered into settlement negotiations with activist organizations over a lawsuit regarding the use of traditional ammunition and tackle on over three million acres of federal land.  Wicker and Hyde-Smith in May urged FWS Director Martha Williams not to cave in to activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands earlier this year. U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) introduced S.4940 after the FWS published a rule that, while expanding access to hunting and fishing at certain wildlife refuges, prohibited the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle.Wildlife Mississippi is among the groups supporting the Senate bill, along with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, American Sportfishing Association, National Shooting Sports Foundation, National Deer Association, and others.“Senator Daines’ legislation on lead is grounded in science, a key to managing fish and wildlife, it enables hunting and angling to continue to thrive, and takes into account the needs of ordinary people from Mississippi to Montana,” said James L. Cummins, Wildlife Mississippi executive director.Additional S.4940 cosponsors include Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Hoeven (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.).###

HYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS MILITARY READINESS PRESERVATION BILL AS COVID VACCINE TERMINATION POLICIES STANDWASHINTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) has joined U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) in introducing legislation to preserve the readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces by limiting separations based on COVID–19 vaccination status.The Preserving the Readiness of Our Armed Forces Act (S.4925) would restrict COVID-related separations until recruiting benchmarks are met among the Services. It would also ensure continued pay and benefits for servicemembers while religious and health accommodations are pending.“Defending our nation and its interests represents our primary constitutional duty.  President Biden’s unwillingness to give up his COVID vaccine mandates and penalties is hurting U.S. military retention and recruitment, which affects national security,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Senator Blackburn’s commonsense legislation to correct this situation deserves consideration, passage, and enactment.”“Joe Biden announced the ‘pandemic is over,’ and therefore has no reason to continue to fire our servicemembers using his politically-motivated vaccine mandate. America’s national readiness should not be jeopardized because this White House is hellbent on preserving their forever pandemic. My legislation continues my work to strengthen our armed forces and prevent yet another unconstitutional power grab from the Biden administration,” said Blackburn.U.S. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.) also cosponsored S.4925, which has two main focuses:The bill has been referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee.###

INFRASTRUCTUREAppalachian Regional Commission Awards Nine Grants for Road and Building Improvements, Site Developments, and Water InfrastructureWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today welcomed the award of $7.7 million for nine infrastructure projects in multiple Mississippi counties in the Appalachia region.The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) approved the grants, which are designed to help the region achieve socioeconomic parity with the nation.“Critical infrastructure investments are the building blocks of a healthy economy, and rural areas deserve opportunity to grow,” Wicker said.  “These projects will give North Mississippi communities the opportunity to innovate and secure growth for generations to come.  I look forward to continuing work to secure support for counties across our state.”“New or improved infrastructure is essential to rural counties across Mississippi as they work on local developments,” Hyde-Smith said.  “These Appalachian Regional Commission investments will help spur and strengthen economic growth by leveraging local resources to better serve rural Mississippi.”The nine grants for Mississippi include:The ARC is an economic development agency of the federal government and 13 state governments, including 423 counties from southern New York to north Mississippi.  ###

HYDE-SMITH QUESTIONS WHETHER AMERICANS CAN AFFORD BIDEN, DEMS AS INFLATION BATTERS FAMILY BUDGETSIn Floor Speech, Miss. Senator Says Biden Out of Touch with Working AmericansVIDEO CLIP:  Senator Hyde-Smith Says Biden’s Take on Inflation Shows He Lives in a “Different World.”VIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Delivers Speech on Inflation.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today questioned how much longer American workers and families, battered by historically high inflation, can afford President Biden and his congressional allies.In a floor speech, Hyde-Smith accused Biden and congressional Democrats of living in “a very, very different reality” as they celebrate passing big-government spending legislation that will do nothing to ease inflationary prices that are tanking family budgets.  The Senator also took umbrage with Biden downplaying the latest inflation report issued last week.“On Sunday, we were given more evidence that the President is living in a completely different world than the rest of us,” Hyde-Smith said.  “When asked what he could do better and faster to help Americans get some relief at the grocery check-out line, he claimed inflation was up ‘hardly at all.’  Hardly at all?  Say that to parents paying 40 percent more for a dozen eggs just to feed their children breakfast.  Say that to workers who are watching their savings dwindle month after month because their paychecks can’t keep up with these prices.  Say that to the Americans who are just barely getting by in this economy,” she said.“President Biden, you might not have to visit the grocery store or pay an electricity bill, but my constituents and I do,” the Senator added.  “Time and time again, the President and his allies in Congress have proven he is out of touch with American priorities and in denial about the real suffering and fears of the American people.  They are right to question whether they can still afford the leadership they’re getting out of the White House and the Democrat-led Congress.”Hyde-Smith took issue with the recent White House celebration of its mislabeled “Inflation Reduction” legislation as Americans learned that prices in August were up 8.3 percent compared to this time last year, and up 13.2 percent from when Biden took office in January 2021.  Stock markets took it steepest plunge of the Biden era on that day.Read Hyde-Smith’s speech to the Senate below:Mr. President, over the past week, Americans were hit once again with a grave inflation report.  Worse, the American people got more evidence of just how out of touch the White House and congressional Democrats are to the damage inflation is doing to families across the country.We were all hoping President Biden’s crushing inflation might show signs of easing and give folks a chance to catch their breath after months and months of watching their paychecks shrink.That is not what happened at all.  Inflation is up 8.3 percent from last year—a disastrous number.We are feeling the inflation in every aspect of our lives.  From paying utility bills, to gassing up cars, to rent and insurance, and especially for the basics like food.Grocery prices are up 13.5 percent from this time last year, which is a crushing blow to most Americans who visit their local store once a week.  Milk is up 17 percent. Bread and chicken are up 16 percent.  Eggs are up an outrageous 40 percent. The list goes on and on.  I do my own shopping for my family and I see this weekly, and it is incredible.   This is the reality.  But President Biden appears to be living in a very, very different reality.When the latest bad inflation numbers were released last week, the President and Washington Democrats threw a party on the White House lawn. That’s right—a lawn party.  The President and Democrats celebrated as the rest of us watched the Dow plummet and received an inflation report confirming this is worst year for food and electricity inflation since the fallout from President Jimmy Carter.What exactly did they celebrate?  Their latest reckless, big government spending bill. Mr. President, I don’t have to remind you that just over a year ago, the Democrats rammed through their $2 trillion dollar spending spree despite economists warning that it would be a catalyst for rampant inflation.Economists warned us then and they are warning us now about the misnamed “Inflation Reduction Act”—namely that it won’t do anything to ease inflation, but it will certainly add to the deficit.Apparently, hosting a big party is preferable than heeding these nonpartisan warnings and getting to work to get our nation back on the right track.When the ‘Inflation Act’ was on the floor, Republicans tried countless times to adopt solutions to tackle inflation, crime, and secure our borders.  But our efforts were consistently shut down because not one Senate Democrat could spare a penny from their Green New Deal.No, they have their own priorities, and they are awfully out of touch with the priorities of American families. On Sunday, we were given more evidence that the President is living in a completely different world than the rest of us. The President appeared on 60 Minutes, where he discussed several challenges currently facing our nation.  Only, according to him, our nation is doing swell. Indeed, the President seemed to paint a rosy picture of little-to-no inflation, and suggested we should be relieved by the new inflation numbers. When asked what he could do better and faster to help Americans get some relief at the grocery store check-out line, he claimed inflation was “hardly at all” up.Hardly at all? Say that to parents paying 40 percent more for a dozen eggs just to feed their children breakfast.Say that to workers who are watching their savings dwindle month after month because their paychecks can’t keep up with these prices.Say that to the Americans who are just barely getting by in this economy. President Biden, you might not have to visit the grocery store or pay an electricity bill, but my constituents do.Time and time again, the President and his allies in Congress have proved he is out of touch with American priorities and in denial about the real suffering and fears of the American people. They are right to question whether they can still afford the leadership they’re getting out of the White House and Democrat-led Congress.It’s high time for the President and Democrats to align their priorities with those of the people, allow real solutions to be considered on the Senate floor, and get our economy back on its feet.I yield the floor.###

HYDE-SMITH, COLLEAGUES PRESS DHS FOR SANCTUARY CITY DATASenators Want Answers on Which Sanctuary Cities Draw Illegal Immigrants after DHS Catch & ReleaseWASHINGTON, D.C. – With illegal border crossings reaching unprecedented levels, U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) joined colleagues in asking the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for detailed information on the effect sanctuary cities have on drawing illegal immigrants.Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, signed a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that requests data on which cities illegal immigrants list as their “current address.”  By law, illegal immigrants allowed into the country are required to provide an address in order to be contacted regarding immigration proceedings.“We are concerned that the Biden administration’s border crisis is being made worse because of states and communities who adopt or perpetuate sanctuary policies.  To better understand the impact of sanctuary policies on illegal immigration, we request additional information about where illegal immigrants are choosing to go once they receive a Notice to Appear (NTA),” the Senators wrote.“We are deeply concerned that sanctuary jurisdictions are serving as a pull factor for illegal immigrants and for criminal aliens.  This failure to comply with federal law creates an incentive for illegal immigrants to travel to the United States and avoid accountability by moving to sanctuary jurisdictions,” the Senators wrote. The Senators argue sanctuary cities threaten public safety by preventing law enforcement officials from cooperating with federal immigration officials to enforce detainer orders for dangerous, violent criminal aliens.Among other information, the Senators ask Mayorkas to respond by Oct. 21 with the number of times each city or municipality has been listed as the “current address” for illegal immigrants who were issued an NTA during FY2021 and FY2022, as well as DHS efforts to ensure that illegal immigrants do in fact travel to the address listed on their NTA.A DHS Office of Inspector General report showed that the Custom and Border Patrol (CPB) did not record addresses for illegal immigrants 35 percent of the time between March and June 2021.  The Senators also asked for the current rate at which CBP is recording addresses.U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) led the letter, which was also signed by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Read the letter to Mayorkas here.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH MOVE TO NULLIFY BIDEN RESTRICTIONS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS Miss. Senators Cosponsor Resolution to Overturn New Education Dept. Rule WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) recently cosponsored legislation to nullify the Biden administration’s new rule to impose federal, one-size-fits-all requirements on charter schools that seek federal funding.The Mississippi lawmakers are original cosponsors of Congressional Review Act (CRA) legislation (S.J.Res.60), which would stop a U.S. Department of Education final rule that violates congressional intent for supporting charter schools.“Educational freedom has helped millions of Americans build better and more prosperous lives,” Wicker said.  “President Biden’s proposed rule targeting charter schools would restrict that freedom, and I am glad to join Senator Hyde-Smith in opposing its implementation.”“The Biden administration’s wholehearted embrace of teacher unions shouldn’t result in rules that hogtie charter schools and the choices they offer parents and students.  Unfortunately, that’s just what the Education Department’s new rule does,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I hope a majority of Senators agree that the administration exceeded its authority and overturn this harmful rule.”S.J.Res.60 is based on the fact that the Secretary of Education exceeded his authority and violated congressional intent by making substantial changes to the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP).  The new rule includes a broad range of federal mandates intended to restrict the growth of charter schools around the country.Among other things, the new rule would force charter schools to co-develop curriculum with traditional public school bureaucracies.  In addition, charter schools applying for federal grants would be required to conduct a federally-micromanaged “needs analysis” that requires schools to provide a description of projected demographics to ensure student body and staff diversity.Congress can consider S.J.Res.60 using expedited procedures under the CRA and pass it by a simple majority vote.U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced S.J.Res.60, which is also cosponsored by Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH & COLLEAGUES SAY UNPRECEDENTED DRUG PRICE CONTROL SCHEME THREATENS INNOVATION, FUTURE DRUG COSTSIn Letter, Senators Raise Concerns, Seek Answers from Federal Health Agencies WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) this week raised concerns about the risks of serious unintended consequences as the Biden administration attempts to establish a permanent government price control program for prescription drugs.Wicker, Hyde-Smith and 23 other Republican Senators signed a letter that asks Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development, and domestic manufacturing under the unprecedented price-setting scheme enacted with the Democrats’ misnamed “Inflation Reduction” bill.  Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) led the letter to highlight the outsized risks the government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole.“As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years,” the Senators wrote.“Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.   The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight,” the Senators continued.“Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts,” the Senators said.The letter requests responses to a series of questions regarding the implementation of the program, which is being funded with billions of taxpayer dollars.The letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Becerra and Administrator Brooks-LaSure:
 
Congress recently acted, on a party-line basis, to establish a permanent government price-setting program for prescription drugs, financed with billions of taxpayer dollars and enforced through an unprecedented excise tax of up to 95 percent.  We write to express concerns with the disruptive and distortive administrative undertaking that the implementation of this far-reaching federal expansion will inevitably represent, as well as to raise a number of questions regarding your department’s plans for putting this new program into practice.  Given the outsize risks that the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, we urge you to weigh both direct and indirect impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), and domestic manufacturing as you take the first steps toward implementing this program. 
 
As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years.  Scores of life-threatening conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer’s and sickle cell disease, could see a substantial decline in possible treatment options on the horizon.  Moreover, based on CBO’s analysis, some manufacturers may choose to terminate participation in Medicare and Medicaid altogether as a result of the compulsory new price-setting program, jeopardizing access to a range of therapies and cures for the most vulnerable Americans.  Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.  The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight. 
 
Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts.  In light of the urgent importance of clarity and caution regarding the forthcoming implementation of this colossal government initiative, please provide the following information by the close of business on October 28, 2022:
 
1.    Consultation with Patient Advocates, Caregivers, Health Care Providers, Researchers, and Small Businesses:  In drafting the authorizing legislation for the so-called Drug Price Negotiation Program, our colleagues opted to insulate initial implementation from the standard notice-and-comment rulemaking process typically required for substantive regulatory policymaking.  This problematic policy choice will deny patients, caregivers, health care providers, researchers, small businesses, and other stakeholders the opportunity to engage with the Administration on key considerations and decisions regarding the program’s operations and methodologies.  The exclusion of patient voices from policymaking poses potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly for individuals living with rare diseases or with disabilities.  
2.    Quality-Adjusted Life Years and other Discriminatory Metrics:  A broad range of experts and advocacy organizations, including the National Council on Disability, have rightly criticized the use of so-called quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and other similar metrics for devaluing the lives of certain populations, including those living with disabilities, as well as older individuals.  While the reconciliation legislation includes vague language purporting to bar the use of comparative effectiveness research incorporating discriminatory measures along these lines, a number of analysts have flagged questions and concerns around the potential for government officials to sidestep this alleged prohibition in administering the price-setting program.  To that end, CBO, in modeling the proposed pricing process enacted under this law, relied on data using QALYs.  
3.    Methodology for Determining Prices:  Critics of the reconciliation legislation have justifiably taken issue with the lack of a floor for Secretary-dictated prices under the new program, along with the absence of any meaningful opportunity for appeal.  The law’s preclusions of administrative and judicial review with respect to a range of key administrative actions and decisions regarding the program have further crystallized these concerns.  
4.    Bureaucratic Expansion:  Our colleagues have financed this program with a staggering $3 billion in administrative funding.  How, in specific terms, does the Administration plan to make use of this massive sum of taxpayer dollars? 
 
5.    Monitoring Effects:  What actionable steps does the Administration plan to take in order to monitor the effects of the new program on patient access, R&D investments, launch prices, new drug approvals, domestic manufacturing jobs, and other health and economic areas? ###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH MOVE TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION OF DEADLY FENTANYL CHARGEABLE AS FELONY MURDERMiss. Senators Cosponsor Bill to Toughen Punishment for Knowingly Dealing Lethal OpiateWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on Thursday joined U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in introducing legislation to make the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death chargeable as a felony murder.In instances of deaths resulting from illegal fentanyl-related opiates, the Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act (S.4876) would amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to make it a felony to distribute fentanyl and fentanyl-analogs if the dealer has knowledge or reason to know that the substance they are dealing contains fentanyl or a fentanyl-analog.“The lethal drug fentanyl is destroying lives across the country, and dealers who put it on our streets should be held responsible,” Wicker said. “This bill would send a strong signal that the federal government will not tolerate this deadly drug which is tearing apart communities, or those who distribute it.”“The Biden administration has failed to enforce multiple policies to stop fentanyl from coming across the border, even though it is now the leading cause of death for adults aged 18 to 45,” Hyde-Smith said.  “This legislation is desperately needed to protect our communities by ensuring harsher consequences to those who knowingly distribute this deadly drug in Mississippi and across the country.”According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, authorities seized enough fentanyl in July — 2,071 pounds — to kill 469 million Americans.  That is up from 680 pounds seized in June as the issue continues to hit close to home for far too many Americans, whether or not they live in a border-state. Under current law, the CSA treats all Schedule I and Schedule II drugs the same for purposes of distribution resulting in death by mandating a 20-year minimum and no more than life, despite varying degrees of lethality, availability, and medicinal purposes.A March 2022 Mississippi State Department of Health report shows a sharp escalation of overall deaths in Mississippi involving fentanyl, including a 125 percent increase in overdose fatalities due to synthetic opioids from 2019 to 2020.Additional S.4876 cosponsors include Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).Click here to read the text of S.4876, which has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH URGE SCHUMER TO BRING ANNUAL DEFENSE BILL TO A VOTEMiss. Senators Fight for Major Investments in Armed Forces, Want Vote This Month WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, have joined a letter to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) demanding that the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) be brought to a vote without delay. The letter, signed by 23 Senators, cites the risks of leaving the military “directionless” without an authorized bill, as well as the major investments the bill would make in personnel, technology, and deterrence of American adversaries.Read the full letter here or below.Leader Schumer,At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well.”  Two centuries later, that still rings true.  Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight.Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe saw to it that the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act remained bipartisan and the result safeguards the United States.  Additionally, the bill invests in technology advancements and procurement through a $45 billion budget topline increase, provides service members with a 4.6 percent pay raise, and strengthens our forces in cybersecurity, space, the Indo-Pacific, personnel management, and many other areas.Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 - 101.  For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process.  As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period.###

Overdose DeathsWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined seven colleagues in an effort to hold the CEOs of Instagram, TikTok, Snap Inc., and YouTube accountable for the role their platforms play in the nation’s overdose death crisis.In a letter to the executives, the Senators demand answers on what actions the companies are taking to prevent the sale of fentanyl-laced pills to teenagers and young adults on their social media platforms.  Senators also contend the escalating crisis is fueled by drug smuggling linked to President Biden’s failing southern border policies.“Overdose deaths related to fentanyl in Mississippi are increasing, some of it linked to illegal drug buys facilitated by social media.  It’s time for answers and action by these companies to combat this crisis,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.According to a March 2022 Mississippi State Department of Health report, 69 percent of overdose deaths in Mississippi in 2020 involved opioids, with synthetic opioids like fentanyl accounting for 53 percent of all overdose deaths—up from 35 percent a year before.U.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) authored the letter to the social media executives.  It was also signed by Senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.).“We write to you today regarding reports that the use of your social media platforms has been linked to the sale of fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills that have caused the deaths of teens and young adults across the country.  In light of the devastating rise in drug overdose deaths in the U.S., especially linked to fentanyl, we are requesting more information regarding steps your companies are taking to protect children and crackdown on illegal drug sales on your platforms,” the Senators wrote.“Social media platforms like yours provide a convenient venue for dealers to anonymously and discreetly peddle these counterfeit pills to a young audience.  With 4 in 10 of these pills containing a lethal dose of fentanyl, more and more of these online transactions are ending in tragedy,” the Senators continued.Click here to read the full letter to social media CEOs, including specific questions regarding tracking/banning drug dealers, law enforcement coordination, and public awareness.###

HYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS BILL TO EMPOWER PARENTS TO HELP KIDS REGAIN LEARNING LOSSESRECOVER Act Would Give Unspent ARPA Education Funds to Parents for Bolstering Educational ProgressWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) has cosponsored legislation to redirect unspent federal funds to empower parents to help their children regain learning losses from pandemic school closures.The Raising Expectations with Child Opportunity Vouchers for Educational Recovery (RECOVER) Act (S.4753) would allow states and school districts to use unspent American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) education funding on providing Child Opportunity Scholarships to parents directly.“We are seeing the price paid by students because of the long pandemic shutdown of our schools.  We can begin to help recover learning losses by giving parents resources directly to use on what will help their children academically,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Committee.  “The RECOVER Act is a responsible way to use what would be otherwise wasted ARPA dollars to empower families.” As of May, states and school districts had yet to spend 93 percent of the $122 billion from the Democrats’ ARPA for education.  At the same time, national test results in elementary school math and reading have fallen to levels not recorded in more than 20 years.The Child Opportunity Scholarships outlined in the RECOVER Act would be targeted for low-income families to be used for educational opportunities, including: tutoring services, private school tuition, books and other curriculum materials, testing fees; and educational therapies for children with disabilities.  This legislation does not authorize new spending.U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced S.4753, which has been endorsed by the American Federation for Children, Parents Defending Education Action, Heritage Action, and Independent Women’s Voice.“States and school districts have only spent a fraction of the education funds they received through the Democrats’ American Rescue Plan — leaving kids helpless as they struggle to recover from academic setbacks,” Scott said.  “It’s clear that big-government bailouts won’t solve our education crisis.  That’s why the RECOVER Act allows those funds to flow to a much better steward: parents.” Additional S.4753 cosponsors include Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), James Risch (R-Idaho), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).  A companion measure (HR.8671) has been introduced in the House of Representatives.Click here to read a copy of S.4753, the RECOVER Act.###

HYDE-SMITH ASKS BIDEN ADMIN. TO AMEND FUNDING REQUEST TO INCLUDE JACKSON WATER CRISISMiss. Senator Suggests Capital City Emergency Warrants as Much Attention as Other Disasters and MonkeypoxWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today asked the Biden administration to submit a new funding request to Congress to help resolve the water crisis in Jackson, arguing the Mississippi capital city’s emergency needs to be on par with other disaster situations around the country.In anticipation of Congress considering a short-term funding bill before Sept. 30 to avoid a government shutdown, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week submitted a request for Congress to include an additional $47.1 billion in the must-pass legislation for Ukraine, COVID-19, monkeypox, and recent natural disasters affecting California, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas.“The same day that the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator and other White House officials traveled to Mississippi to ‘ensure’ Jackson had everything needed to restore its water quality, OMB submitted an emergency funding request addressing a host of issues deemed critical by the Biden administration.  The City of Jackson was not included,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Jackson’s water crisis is nothing short of a full-blown emergency, and it’s disappointing and concerning that the city’s water and wastewater infrastructure needs did not make it in the administration’s $47.1 billion emergency request.”Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Thursday sought additional support for Jackson in a letter to OMB Director Shalanda Young.“I am deeply concerned that the administration’s emergency funding request fails to address the serious and ongoing water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi,” Hyde-Smith wrote.“Support for Ukraine, COVID-19, monkeypox, or natural disasters in other states should not take priority over the needs of Jackson residents to have access to clean water,” the Senator wrote.  “As I continue working with my Senate colleagues on this important issue, I respectfully request that you consider submitting an addendum to the supplemental funding request that your agency submitted to Congress on September 2, 2022.”Hyde-Smith, who expressed appreciation for the Biden administration’s attention to the crisis in Jackson, outlined opportunities for OMB to consider to provide direct assistance to the City of Jackson.These options correspond with the Senator’s use of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency programs in the FY2022 and FY2023 appropriations cycles to help the city with its water and wastewater infrastructure.  She also cited Senate-passed legislation to allow states and local governments to use previously appropriated COVID-19 relief funds for natural disasters and infrastructure projects.“These are just a few examples of how Jackson could soon receive adequate and additional relief for its ongoing water crisis should Congress enact a supplemental spending measure as part of a short-term continuing resolution before September 30, 2022,” Hyde-Smith wrote.Read the Hyde-Smith letter here or below.Dear Director Young: I am writing regarding the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) supplemental funding request submitted on September 2, 2022, which calls on Congress to appropriate an additional $47.1 billion for needs deemed critical by the Administration.  Those needs include:  Support for Ukraine, COVID-19, monkeypox, and natural disaster recovery.  I am deeply concerned that the administration’s emergency funding request fails to address the serious and ongoing water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi.The City of Jackson serves as the State capital and is the most populous city in Mississippi.  On August 29, 2022, floodwaters from the Pearl River overwhelmed the city’s primary water treatment plant, resulting in system-wide failure.  Approximately 150,000 residents were left without a steady flow of safe drinking water, adequate water pressure to flush toilets, or to fight fires.  President Biden issued an Emergency Declaration on August 30, 2022, allowing federal agencies to take temporary measures to begin restoring water to residents, schools, public services, and businesses.  In fact, the city remains under a boil water notice implemented more than a month ago.Unfortunately, the water infrastructure crises Jackson residents are facing is not new.  A winter storm in February 2021 left tens of thousands of residents without running water, some for up to a month.  Storms in 2010, 2014, and 2018 resulted in similar water outages.  The crumbling water infrastructure in Jackson has plagued residents for decades, and the required cost of water and wastewater system improvements are estimated to be more than $2 billion.  That is simply not feasible for the state and local governments alone.According to United States Census Bureau data, 82.5 percent of Jackson’s population is African American.  The median household income is $40,064 ($27,457 below the national average), and 24.5 percent of the population lives in poverty (13.1 percent above the national average).  Nearly 24,000 residents have left the city since the 2010 Census.  It is fair to presume that some Jackson residents have fled due to the lack of reliable access to one of our most vital necessities of life – clean water.While I am grateful for the level of attention the Administration has given to the City of Jackson’s ongoing water crisis, the OMB supplemental funding request fails to meet what the city truly needs.  Jackson needs significant funding for improvements to its water and wastewater system infrastructure.  The supplemental appropriations request fails to address those dire and immediate needs.  For instance, the $1.4 billion Department of Housing and Urban Development request for Community Development Block Grants is only for major disasters that occurred in 2021.  The $2.9 billion Department of Homeland Security Disaster Relief Fund request is for response costs, not long-term solutions.  The $50 million U.S. Army Corps of Engineers request is only for investigations and operation and maintenance of existing systems with respect to drought resilience, not construction of congressionally-authorized environmental infrastructure projects.  The OMB news release accompanying its supplemental request mentions natural disaster response needs for California, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas, but makes no mention of Mississippi.  There are available avenues to provide direct assistance to the City of Jackson for its crumbling water infrastructure.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers received $5 million in fiscal year 2022 to address Jackson’s water infrastructure through its Section 219 Program, authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, as amended.  The City of Jackson received $4 million in congressionally-directed spending in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, through the Environmental Protection Agency Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.  Further, the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Fiscal Recovery, Infrastructure, and Disaster Relief Flexibility Act (S. 3011), which was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent, would allow states and local governments to use previously appropriated COVID-19 relief funds for new categories of spending, including for natural disasters and infrastructure projects.  These are just a few examples of how Jackson could soon receive adequate and additional relief for its ongoing water crisis should Congress enact a supplemental spending measure as part of a short-term continuing resolution before September 30, 2022.  Support for Ukraine, COVID-19, monkeypox, or natural disasters in other states should not take priority over the needs of Jackson residents to have access to clean water.  As I continue working with my Senate colleagues on this important issue, I respectfully request that you consider submitting an addendum to the supplemental funding request that your agency submitted to Congress on September 2, 2022.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH URGE BIDEN TO ADDRESS SUPPLY CHAIN THREATS TO SOUTHEAST ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTUREMiss. Senators, Colleagues Sign Letter on Shortages that Put Grid at Risk Ahead of Storm Season WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) last week joined colleagues in calling on President Biden to immediately address the urgent supply chain shortages threatening the Southeast region’s electric infrastructure as storm season begins.U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) spearheaded a bicameral letter to the President regarding the risk to infrastructure in the Southeast, citing concerns raised by local power companies in the region about the supply of transformers. “Beyond the current invocation of the Defense Production Act for certain energy infrastructure components, more must be done to ensure electric reliability heading into storm season,” the members of Congress wrote.
 
The members of Congress called for specific action regarding the availability of critical transformers and the raw materials used to make them.
 
“Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles.  This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events.  In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years - while others are not taking orders at all,” the letter continued.
 
To address this urgent matter, the lawmakers asked Biden to “direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required,” and to “engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.”
 
In addition to Wicker and Hyde-Smith, others signing the letter include Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and U.S. Representatives David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), Morgan Griffith (R-Va.), and Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.).Read the letter here or below.Dear Mr. President: We are writing to encourage you to take further action to address the urgent supply chain shortages threatening our region’s electric infrastructure.  Beyond the current invocation of the Defense Production Act for certain energy infrastructure components, more must be done to ensure electric reliability heading into storm season. We have heard from Local Power Companies serving our region that the availability of transformers is particularly dire.  Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles.  This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events.  In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years - while others are not taking orders at all. At issue is the availability of raw materials like steel.  Your Capstone report on America’s Supply Chains notes that there is only one domestic manufacturer of the steel used to produce transformers, and this company is unable to meet demand.  The Department of Energy’s (DOE) February 2022 report which informed that conclusion recommends, among other things, lowering manufacturing costs of large power transformers. At a minimum, we request that you direct DOE to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required.  According to a letter sent to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm by the American Public Power Association and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, this would allow manufacturers to increase transformer availability by allowing less steel to be used for each device. Further, we request you engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.Thank you for your attention to this matter. ###

HYDE-SMITH STRESSES NEED FOR YAZOO BACKWATER PUMPS TO FEDS MEETING IN VICKSBURGInteragency Working Group Convenes in Miss. to Learn More on Desperate South Delta Flood Control NeedsVICKSBURG, MISS. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today addressed federal officials to again stress the need for the federal government to construct a pumping station to successfully deliver effective flood protection to the Yazoo Backwater Area of the South Delta.Hyde-Smith was among members of the congressional delegation who participated in presentations on Wednesday to an Interagency Working Group, which was formed after the Biden administration canceled work on the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumps Project in November 2021.“As federal agencies and special interest groups continue to debate pumps vs. no pumps, it seems forgotten the United States Congress decided that a long time ago,” Hyde-Smith said.  “The authorized Yazoo Backwater Area Project calls for an intricate system of flood control features—levees, floodgates, drainage channels, and pumping stations—to protect a nearly 1,500-square-mile area.  That system cannot function without all of its parts.  And clearly, it’s not.”“The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the world’s largest and most respected public engineering agencies, has studied the Yazoo Backwater Area Project for nearly four decades,” the Senator added.  “The Corps has not been able to identify any other practicable way to manage such enormous volumes of water, other than a pumping station.”Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan told Hyde-Smith in May that an interagency group would soon “agree on what we believe to be a legally-sound and engineering-durable solution to the Yazoo pump issue.”White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Chair Brenda Mallory headed the federal contingent meeting in Vicksburg.  The meeting also included national and regional officials from EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and National Weather Service.Hyde-Smith has made the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumps project a priority since becoming a U.S. Senator in 2018, including securing funding for pre-construction planning and other activities on the Army Corps’ 2020 New Proposal and continuing to press for the project following the EPA reversal of its previous approval of the new plan.The following is the text of Hyde-Smith’s prepared remarks for the Interagency Working Group meetings:Chair Mallory, thank you for traveling to Mississippi to discuss solutions to the flooding that perpetually disrupts the lives of thousands of Mississippians. As federal agencies and special interest groups continue to debate pumps vs. no pumps, it seems forgotten the United States Congress decided that a long time ago.The authorized Yazoo Backwater Area Project calls for an intricate system of flood control features – levees, floodgates, drainage channels, and pumping stations – to protect a nearly 1,500-square-mile area.That system cannot function without all of its parts.  And clearly, it’s not.Hundreds of thousands of acres flood nearly every year despite our spending hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars to build levees, floodgates and drainage channels.Yes, the area that is supposed to be protected, floods nearly every year.Rain that falls just south of Memphis, Tennessee, ends up a few miles north of where we are sitting today.When the Mississippi River is high, any above-normal rain event results in a tremendous amount of water being trapped inside the levee system.This water has no outlet…no exit.  It’s trapped.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – one of the world’s largest and most respected public engineering agencies – has studied the Yazoo Backwater Area Project for nearly four decades.The Corps has not been able to identify any other practicable way to manage such enormous volumes of water, other than a pumping station.We are not talking about draining a vast, pristine wetland area.We are talking about removing floodwaters from peoples’ homes, their property, and keeping floodwaters off of our roads so people can go to work, church, and school.Do residents of the South Delta deserve to be compensated for their prior losses?  Absolutely.But what we really need is a long-term solution, and there cannot be a long-term solution without a pumping station.There are currently 59 pumping stations within the comprehensive Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) project footprint, which this project falls within.  As I mentioned earlier, the Corps has considered every possible alternative.  How much good does it do to elevate homes, or build a ring levees around them, if they’re surrounded by water as far as the eye can see?Remember, in 2019 the Yazoo Backwater Area remained flooded for roughly half the year.  Many people had nowhere to go.  So often do we hear, “We need to listen to the science.”  Despite what we hear from pump opponents, this is what the science said with regard to the Corps’ 2020 Proposed Plan:
•   All area residents would benefit from the pumps.
•   The pumps would reduce flooding on up to 140,000 acres.
•   The vast majority of structures and homes would be better protected from flooding. 
•   The negative effects of extended duration flooding on aquatic resources, wildlife and recreational resources would be dampened. 
•   Not a single acre of wetlands would be converted to non-wetlands.       Many smart people dedicated a lot of time and resources in reaching those conclusions.  The bottom line is area residents will continue to suffer until a pumping station is constructed.    ###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH COSPONSOR BILL TO PROHIBIT TAXPAYER-FUNDED ABORTIONS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTSWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced their support for legislation to prohibit taxpayer-funded abortions for illegal immigrants.The No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act (S.4770) would prohibit any employee or contractor with U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) or the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) from transporting illegal immigrants across state lines for the purpose of procuring an abortion.“Abortion is wrong, and American taxpayers should never have to pay for it, whether for citizens or illegal immigrants,” Wicker said.  “I am proud to stand with my fellow pro-life legislators to protect the sanctity of all human life.”“The Biden administration’s willingness to act outside the law makes this legislation necessary.  The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.  Whether it be ICE personnel or any other executive branch employee, spending American tax dollars to escort illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions is a clear violation of the law.  It must be stopped,” Hyde-Smith said.U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.) introduced the legislation in response to an internal ICE memo stating any pregnant illegal alien in its custody will continue to have access to abortion services.S.4770 would also prohibit ICE or HHS to require any person to perform, facilitate, or pay for an abortion except to save the life of the mother or in the case of rape or incest.“No Americans’ tax dollars should pay for any illegal migrant’s abortion, just like they should not pay for any American citizen’s abortion.  Deportations are the only form of government-funded travel ICE and HHS should be providing to illegal immigrants,” said Marshall.  “We’ve seen President Biden and his cabinet secretaries repeatedly abuse their power to enact a radical agenda that is failing our country.  The deterioration of our country will not stop unless Congress acts to put a check on this far left administration”Organizations that advocate for pro-life causes, including the Family Research Council and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, endorse the legislation, which is also cosponsored by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).Access the text of S.4770 here.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH WELCOME $15.4M IN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR MISS.Yazoo City, Tupelo, Ripley Awarded Grants for Train Station, Highway & Nature TrailWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today praised the award of $15.4 million for infrastructure projects in Yazoo City, Tupelo, and Ripley.The three grants, which are specifically designed for local projects, were awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) grant program.“These grants will help several important projects move forward across our state,” Wicker said.  “Yazoo City will soon see a major investment in revitalizing their downtown, and both Tupelo and Ripley have secured support to begin planning to reduce congestion and improve quality of life in their communities.  I look forward to working with the rest of our delegation to help more Mississippi communities secure support for infrastructure improvements like these.”“Each of the proposals put forth by these cities offer great potential for improving the quality of life for their residents, through improved public safety, better infrastructure, and more economic opportunities,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I am especially hopeful the large award to Yazoo City will result in a new vibrancy for the city, and look forward to progress on the Tupelo rail and Tanglefoot Trail extension projects.”The three RAISE grants for Mississippi include:1.  Yazoo City Main Street Revitalization Project (Yazoo City) – $12,641,440 for the construction of a train station, development of a stormwater park, and street-level redevelopment that would include bike lanes, broadband, and stormwater management.
2.  Tupelo RAIL Improvements Program (Tupelo) – $1,452,290 for engineering and planning work to construct a highway overpass at Eason Boulevard and Kansas City Southern Crossing; work to change the location of the switching operation away from the intersection at Main Street and Gloster Street; develop quiet zones; and install new safety features.
3.  Tanglefoot Trail Extension (Ripley) – $1,400,000 for planning operations in regard to a potential 20-mile expansion of the Tanglefoot rail from New Albany to Ripley.The RAISE Grant program is highly competitive, and is one of the few DOT discretionary programs for which regional and local governments can directly compete for multimodal transportation funding.  The program replaced the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) Transportation grants program and the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program.###

Senator Contends Job Creators, Workers Will Ultimately Pay for ‘President Biden’s Bad Ideas’WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) tonight denounced the latest iteration of the Democrats’ reckless tax and spend scheme forced through the Senate, predicting that job creators and middle-class families will ultimately pay the price for the radical policies in the legislation.Hyde-Smith will vote against the nearly $740 billion package (HR.5376) that includes broad aspects of the Green New Deal and more than $300 billion in new taxes on manufacturers and U.S. oil and gas producers.  It is a reiteration of the nearly $4 trillion Build Back Broke initially proposed by President Biden last year.“This legislation may be a watered-down rehash of President Biden’s bad ideas, but it still has the power to make things worse.  There is no way hard-working middle-class families won’t end up paying the price for increased taxes and government mandates on job creators, energy producers, and companies,” Hyde-Smith said following the procedural vote to proceed to the bill following the vote to proceed to the bill.“American workers today continue to pay the price for the record-high inflation caused by an unnecessary $1.9 trillion stimulus forced on us by the same folks who are now pushing this reckless, green dream on us.  The same people who have taken a recovering economy and pushed it into recession,” the Senator said.  “This legislation has been described by a supporter as ‘the beginning of a long, forced march.’  I fear that will become true—a long, forced march toward more economic hardship and more government in our lives.”Among the problematic issues in Schumer/Manchin-negotiated HR.5376:###

HYDE-SMITH VOTES TO OVERTURN EXPANSIVE BIDEN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW RULEMiss. Senator Joins Effort to Stop Onerous New NEPA Requirements on Public Works ProjectsWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today voted to overturn the Biden administration’s efforts to greatly expand the scope of federal environmental reviews for public works projects, including pipelines, bridges, roads, and other infrastructure.Hyde-Smith is an original cosponsor of S.J.Res.55, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) final rule, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions.  “Taxpayers, cities, and states will pay the price for the environmental zealotry driving White House policies.  What does the Biden NEPA rule mean for Mississippi?  More costs and more delays for projects like highways, infrastructure, or even the proposed Yazoo pumps,” Hyde-Smith said.  “If allowed to stand, the rule will make already costly and time-consuming NEPA reviews even more expensive and time consuming.”The Senate voted 50-47 to overturn the new NEPA rule, which the CEQ indicated is the first phase of a scheme to repeal a 2020 NEPA rule that streamlined the time and costs associated with environmental reviews for public works projects.  The 2020 rule was the first major modernization of federal environmental reviews since 1978.The rule promulgated by CEQ, which went into effect on May 20, requires environmental impact statements (EIS) and other environmental reviews to assess the indirect and cumulative impact of a project on climate change.  The rule will drive up costs and time to complete the EIS process, which already takes an average of four to six years to complete and cost millions of dollars.S.J.Res.55 was introduced by U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), with all Republican Senators cosponsoring the measure.  S.J.Res.55 still requires House approval and the President’s signature to complete the Congressional Review Act process to stop the CEQ rule.###

HYDE-SMITH HELPS INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING BIDEN TO CONTROL SOUTHERN BORDERLegislation Would Force Administration to Restore & Maintain Operational ControlWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today said she has thrown her support behind legislation to force the Biden administration to restore and maintain control of the southern border.Hyde-Smith joined U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in introducing the Comprehensive Southern Border Strategy Act (S.4642), which would give the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 12 months after enactment to produce a comprehensive plan for security at the border.“Like so much else, it’s clear the Biden administration’s border policies are doing more harm than good,” Hyde-Smith said.  “This legislation would force us to acknowledge what’s needed to regain and maintain control of the southern border.  The status quo of rampant illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and human smuggling cannot continue for the sake of our nation.”“The Biden Administration has proven time and time again that they have no strategy for gaining control of our southern border, and it’s time they start showing some leadership and accountability,” said Tillis.  “The situation at our border is undeniably a crisis as the cartels continue their human trafficking and their smuggling of illicit drugs like fentanyl into our country.  This legislation will ensure that DHS enacts a plan, using every resource available.  I am proud to introduce this legislation with my colleagues because the American people deserve to see this administration finally taking control of this chaos.”S.4642 would require the Homeland Security Secretary to complete a comprehensive strategy to restore and maintain operational control and situational awareness across the entirety of the southern border.  The plan must also include a strategy for combatting human smuggling and drug trafficking.
 
The crisis at our southern border has intensified with President Biden’s failed immigration policies such as rescinding Remain in Mexico, his attempts to dismantle immigration enforcement, and his efforts to end Title 42.Since President Biden took office, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has had more than 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at the southern border.  In FY2022, CBP has apprehended more than 8,000 criminal aliens, including 50 with convictions for murder and nearly 250 with convictions for sex crimes.  CBP also interdicted over 10,700 pounds of fentanyl in 2021 and more than 5,700 pounds so far in 2022–nearly 3.7 billion lethal doses. U.S. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) also cosponsored the measure.  U.S. Representatives Young Kim (R-Calif.) and Michael Guest (R-Miss.) introduced similar legislation (HR.7260) earlier this year.###

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked from within the U.S. Supreme Court.  The measure required 60 votes to proceed.Hyde-Smith, a Christian and pro-life advocate, voted against a similar House-passed pro-abortion bill (HR.3755) in February.  It, too, failed to receive sufficient support to advance in the legislative process.###

HYDE-SMITH, COLLEAGUES CHIDE BIDEN ADMIN. FOR ‘BACKSEAT’ STANCE ON U.S. TRADE AGENDATwenty-Four Senators Urge Administration to Prioritize U.S. Trade and Agriculture AgendaWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined colleagues in chiding the Biden administration’s “backseat” approach to expand U.S. agricultural and other trade, and strongly encouraged the White House to prioritize market access initiatives as part of America’s trade agenda.Twenty-four Senators signed a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack that outlines their concern over the administration’s approach to trade, which affects markets for U.S. agricultural products and American influence around the world.“Advancing U.S. economic interests – particularly in the Indo-Pacific region – requires meaningful and enforceable market access commitments,” the Senators wrote.  “We are concerned that the Biden administration is foregoing America’s trade and strategic leadership by failing to pursue such commitments, whether through its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) or through its decision not to pursue comprehensive free trade agreements, which was reflected in the President’s 2022 Trade Policy Agenda.  The lack of ambitious market-opening initiatives not only disadvantages U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses today, it jeopardizes America’s competitiveness, resilience, and security in the long-term.”“Regrettably, U.S. trade leadership has thus far taken a backseat to other priorities under this administration. But, as you know, global trade does not simply pause until the administration deems it worthy of pursuing,” the Senators continued.The Senators stressed the importance of fair market access for U.S. goods, pointing out that farm and food product exports grew from $46.1 billion in 1994 to more than $177 billion in 2021—largely due to greater market access opportunities for American exporters.In seeking greater market access and enforceable commitments as part of the IPEF and any other U.S. trade agreements, the Senators also contrasted the Biden administration’s trade record with China’s aggressive trade agenda.U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), and John Boozman (R-Ark.) led the letter, which was also signed by these members of the Senate Agriculture and Senate Finance committees:  Hyde-Smith, John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.).Click here to read the letter.###

HYDE-SMITH LOOKS TO FUNDING NEEDS FOR USDA WATERSHED, FLOOD PROTECTION PROGRAMAg. Secretary Assures FY22 Watershed Funding Secured by Hyde-Smith Will Help Address Damages Caused By June 2021 Excessive Rain EventVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Reviews Outlook for NRSC Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today looked to determine a sufficient level of funding for a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that assists Mississippi communities with flood mitigation, water quality improvements, erosion control, and related activities.The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee on which Hyde-Smith serves today hosted Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack at a hearing to review the FY2023 budget request for the USDA and related agencies, like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and its Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) Program.“Like many rural communities and landowners across the United States, Mississippi and its people have been hit particularly hard in recent years by excessive rainfall, flooding, and other problems caused by natural disasters,” Hyde-Smith said.  “The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program has been invaluable in allowing small towns to recover from these events, and, importantly, to also prepare for the next one because the next one will be coming as well.”Hyde-Smith sought assurances from Vilsack that the NRCS could effectively use the additional funding sought for the WFPO Program in FY2023, a $25 million increase over the $100 million appropriated this year.  Vilsack endorsed increased funding, adding, “I think the key here is not just increasing the resources, but making sure that you got the staff on the ground to make sure you can implement these resources in a proper way.”Responding to Hyde-Smith, Vilsack also said NRCS personnel are now working with local sponsors on using the $8.4 million in WFPO funding the Senator secured in FY2022 for nine flood control, erosion reduction, and bank stabilization projects in nine Mississippi counties.  He also noted additional resources being delivered to the state through the recently-enacted infrastructure bill.“We know that a lot of the sediment issues in Mississippi are not a result of your losing your top soil.  It’s the result of the banks basically eroding over time, creating some challenges.  I think you’re going to see significant activity in this space in Mississippi because of the money and resources that have been provide through the appropriations process and the infrastructure law,” Vilsack said.
 
In a second round of questions, Hyde-Smith and Vilsack concurred that investments in combatting Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) are leading to a better understanding of the fatal disease that threatens cervids, like Mississippi’s whitetail deer population.“Historically, there have been many questions and unknowns surrounding this disease,” Hyde-Smith said.  “However, thanks to new CWD research being conducted by USDA and its university partners, along with better surveillance and response efforts carried out by State wildlife agencies, we are starting to make strides in the area of CWD.”Hyde-Smith last week cosponsored the Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act (S.4111) to authorize a five-year CWD research and management program involving USDA cooperative agreements with state and tribal wildlife agencies, and state agriculture departments.###

MISS. DELEGATION REQUESTS FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATION FOR MARCH STORMSTornadoes, Severe Storms Destroyed or Damaged More Than 150 Homes across StateWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), along with U.S. Representatives Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), and Michael Guest (R-Miss.) today requested that President Joe Biden approve Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves’ request for federal major disaster declarations to recover from severe storms across the state in March 2022.The damage from March storms has strained emergency response resources and capabilities, as more than 150 homes have been damaged or destroyed, and more than $2 million in property damage has been reported.  If approved, the disaster declaration would unlock additional federal resources to supplement state recovery efforts.“Currently available resources from state and local governments and volunteer organizations are inadequate to meet the state’s recovery needs,” the congressional delegation wrote.  “Significant federal assistance and cooperation are needed for Mississippi to rebuild.”Read the letter here or below:Dear President Biden,In the wake of recent extreme weather that brought dozens of tornadoes to the State of Mississippi, we request your full consideration of Governor Tate Reeves’s recent requests for a Major Disaster Declaration under the Stafford Act.We appreciate the continued efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and anticipate expeditious support from the agency in assisting state and local officials in Mississippi as they continue assessing the severity of damages.  Mississippi experienced 27 tornadoes across four counties on March 22, 2022, and then 30 tornadoes across eight counties on March 30, 2022.  Winds topped 100 miles per hour and damaged or destroyed over 150 homes.As Governor Reeves indicated in his request, the Joint Public Assistance damage assessments conducted by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), FEMA, and other agencies indicated that on March 22, 2022, 68 homes were destroyed or suffered major damage, with more than $1 million in estimated property damage. These tornadoes also injured three people.  Regarding the second disaster declaration for March 30, 2022, additional assessments showed 85 homes were destroyed or suffered major damage, with more than $1 million in estimated property damage and three people injured.Currently available resources from state and local governments and volunteer organizations are inadequate to meet the state’s recovery needs.  Significant federal assistance and cooperation are needed for Mississippi to rebuild.Thank you for your consideration of this request.  Please do not hesitate to contact us should you need further assistance in this effort.###

HYDE-SMITH ASKS HOMELAND SEC. WHEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES A THREAT, RECEIVES NO ANSWERAppropriations Subcommittee Challenges DHS Secretary Mayorkas in FY2023 Budget ReviewVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Presses Homeland Secretary to Determine when Migrant Influx Constitutes a National Threat.PHOTO:  Senator Hyde-Smith and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas.WASHINGTON, D.C. – With the outlook for the ongoing border crisis projected to get worse in coming weeks, U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today pressured Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to define the level at which the record-breaking influx of illegal immigrants becomes a homeland security threat.During a Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the FY2023 budget request for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Hyde-Smith challenging Mayorkas’ assertions that the Biden administration’s border security and immigration policies are working.“It’s remarkable to me that the Secretary of Homeland Security can’t, or won’t, articulate the point at which the alarming and growing influx of illegal immigrants at the border represents a threat to homeland security,” Hyde-Smith said following the hearing.  “That inability is at the core of the border crisis we’re experiencing today, and it’s only going to get worse.”In an extended exchange, Mayorkas would not respond specifically to Hyde-Smith’s repeated question:  “At what point, in your judgement, does the growing number of encounters become a threat to homeland security?”“Like many of my colleagues, I have traveled to the southwest border and seen the admirable work that the Border Patrol agents do on a daily basis.  An unbelievable task,” Hyde-Smith said.  “We’ve heard statistics of border security operations under your leadership versus previous DHS secretaries.  During the month of March, there were 220,000 encounters at the southwest border—220,000.  As Secretary of Homeland Security, would you consider the 220,000 migrant encounters in March a threat to the homeland security?”Mayorkas instead repeatedly pointed to a six-pillar plan to confront an unprecedented immigration surge when the Title 42 public health rule is lifted on May 23.  Many subcommittee members believe the plan is designed to process migrants into the country more quickly rather than to secure the border.The overall $97.3 billion DHS budget request includes a request for $375 million to expedite processing of asylum claims and $389 million to reduce asylum petition backlogs.Related to aircraft manufacturing in Mississippi, Hyde-Smith also asked Mayorkas whether a $20.5 million request for the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Light Enforcement Platform aircraft procurement will focus on rotary wing aircraft.  Congress last year appropriated an additional $8.8 million for more light enforcement helicopters.“Equipping our Border Patrol with the workforce, tools, and technology needed to secure our borders is vital to meet the growing crisis that we face at our southwest border.  As I’m sure you are aware, CBP’s Light Enforcement Helicopter fleet is critical to providing surveillance and supporting Border Patrol agents on the ground disrupting unlawful activity,” Hyde-Smith told Mayorkas.Also as part of his testimony, Mayorkas attempted to defend his agency’s Disinformation Governance Board, which he downplayed as a “working group.”  Hyde-Smith this week cosponsored legislation to defund and terminate this board.###

HYDE-SMITH TO HHS SECRETARY:  YOUR AGENCY LACKS URGENCY IN HELPING THOSE HURT BY COVID-19 VACCINESSenator Cites Miss. Case during Appropriations Subcommittee Review of FY23 HHS BudgetVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Cites Mississippi Case in Questioning HHS Injury Compensation Program.PHOTO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Questions HHS Secretary Becerra.WASHINGTON, D.C. – Citing the case of a Mississippi constituent, U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today asked Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra about his agency’s lack of transparency and urgency in resolving compensation claims filed by people who experienced severe health reactions from COVID-19 vaccines.Hyde-Smith addressed the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) process during a Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee hearing regarding the FY2023 budget request for the HHS Department.“I certainly still advocate for the vaccine, and I myself received the vaccine and encourage others to speak with their doctors about receiving it.  However, as with any new medical product, some people will have side effects.  The CICP exists for that very reason.  I am very concerned by the amount of time it takes your agency to process claims and the lack of clarity given to these folks who were adversely affected,” Hyde-Smith told Becerra.Hyde-Smith cited the case of Cody Flint, an agricultural pilot from Boyle, Miss., who filed a CICP claim after experiencing severe side effects immediately after receiving his first COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021.  The continued serious health issues have prevented him from returning to his job.“For more than a year, Mr. Flint has been painstakingly going through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program seeking compensation he may be entitled to based on his experience.  I have worked with him to try to navigate this process, and I have been stunned not only by your agency’s lack of urgency in reviewing such claims, many claims, but also by the total lack of transparency throughout the process,” Hyde-Smith said.  “He’s totally lost his income,” the Senator added.  “The financial burden is just unbelievable, but the frustration of trying to just get some answers of when something could be done for him for this compensation has been very great.”Becerra acknowledged the CICP backlog, discussed the need for more transparency, and the required accountability in dealing with cases.  He offered to work with Hyde-Smith on resolving the Flint case.“We have heard this story on many occasions.  We know that millions have been saved because of the vaccine, but we know many people are still suffering,” Becerra said.Successfully obtaining CICP compensation, particularly related to COVID-19 countermeasures, is extremely difficult as Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) data indicates.  As of April 1, 2022, of the 7,669 COVID-19 countermeasure claims filed—accounting for more than 90 percent of all CICP claims ever filed—none have received any compensation. In March, Hyde-Smith cosponsored the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Amendment Act (S.3810), legislation to reform and improve the CICP process.###

HYDE-SMITH WANTS BIDEN’S ‘DISINFORMATION’ BOARD DEFUNDEDMiss. Senator Cosponsors Bill to Stop all Funding for Homeland Security Censorship PlanWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today helped introduce legislation to prohibit the use of any taxpayer funding for the Biden administration’s new Disinformation Governance Board at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, is an original cosponsor of S.4124, a measure to prohibit the use of federal funds “to establish or support the activities of a Disinformation Governance Board at the Department of Homeland Security, or any other similar entity established in the Department of Homeland Security.”“All Americans should distrust any government plan to monitor and control what they say or don’t say,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Officials with the Biden administration swear this board won’t censor Americans, but their testimony and other statements make it clear that’s not true.  This is an unconstitutional and terrible idea that needs to be stopped immediately.”Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week announced the formation of the Disinformation Board, which immediately generated concerns about muzzling free speech rights and drawing comparisons to the “Ministry of Truth” in George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984.  U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced S.4124.  In addition to Hyde-Smith, other cosponsors include Senators John Boozman (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Kennedy (R-La.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).Access a PDF copy of the legislation here.###

HYDE-SMITH SEEKS JUSTIFICATION FOR INCREASING IRS BUDGETSenate Subcommittee Weighs IRS Budget Requests for FY2023WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today said funding increases sought by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must be met with “fiscally-responsible decision making” for the agency to overcome persistent backlogs and deficient customer service.Hyde-Smith, ranking member of the Senate Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig at a hearing to review the agency’s FY2023 budget request.  “The IRS entered this year’s tax filing season with a historically high backlog of unprocessed paper returns and correspondence.  When such issues arise, the IRS usually speaks about the need for more funding,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Despite robust funding, critical IT modernization projects lag, the tax gap remains wide, the backlogs remain high, and customer service is at an all-time low.”“I believe it is time for these funding increases to be met with fiscally-responsible decision making — decision making that prioritizes the everyday taxpayer and efficiency,” she said.  “I want to ensure that money appropriated to the IRS is no longer diverted away from measures and programs devoted to improving taxpayer services and enforcement.”The Biden administration’s FY2023 budget recommends $14.1 billion for the IRS, a 12 percent increase over the $12.6 billion provided by Congress for FY2022.  Hyde-Smith noted that $1.0 billion of $3.0 billion in supplemental funding provided since 2020 remains unused.Hyde-Smith covered a variety of issues with Rettig, including:  efforts to eliminate backlogs that include 3.3 million unprocessed paper tax returns and 380,000 pieces of unopened mail; technology upgrades to prevent future backlogs; poor customer service; harboring data on IRS employees who request COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions; and other topics.Additionally, Hyde-Smith sought information on the IRS “Special Delta Initiative,” part of an effort to increase work opportunities in underserved areas.  The IRS in March announced job openings for an automated collection system site in Clarksdale.

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH & PALAZZO WELCOME DISTRIBUTION OF $36.7 MILLION IN GOMESA FUNDS TO MISS.Off-shore Energy Production in FY2021 Generates Revenue for State, Three Coastal CountiesWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Congressman Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.) today welcomed the distribution of more than $36.7 million to the State of Mississippi and its three coastal counties for coastal conservation, restoration, and hazard mitigation activities.The funding represents Mississippi’s share of revenues generated through the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA).  The State of Mississippi will receive $29,417,448 in FY2021 funding, with another $3,056,656 for Jackson County, $2,898,939 for Harrison County, and $1,398,765 for Hancock County.“The steady flow of revenue from oil and gas leases is a significant asset for our Mississippi’s conservation and resiliency efforts,” Wicker said.  “The Gulf Coast plays a crucial role in offshore oil and gas production, which can keep our country energy independent.  It is important this production continue and not be hampered by President Biden’s overbearing environmental agenda.”“GOMESA ensures that Mississippi gets a share of royalty revenues from off-shore energy production to undertake conservation and coastal restoration projects,” Hyde-Smith said.  “GOMESA is a strong benefit to Mississippi, and we will continue to work to improve it.”“The conservation of Mississippi’s Gulf coast through hurricane protection, coastal restoration, and flood control projects that are possible because of these GOMESA funds proves year after year the importance of the legislation passed in Congress,” said Palazzo.  “However we should not forget that these revenues should and could be higher.  The Biden Administration’s anti-energy policies cancelling oil and gas lease sales indirectly defund our states flood and hurricane protection measures.  Increasing domestic oil production will not only supplant our energy independence, it will bolster our National security and coastal resilience.”The U.S. Department of the Interior administers the GOMESA revenue sharing program that provides funding to Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas based on qualified offshore oil and gas leasing revenues.  In all, the Interior Department distributed more than $252 million in FY2021 revenue-sharing receipts to the four states.According to the Interior Department, more than $1.26 billion has been distributed to the four coastal states since GOMESA was enacted.  The law also directs a portion of revenue to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.###

HYDE-SMITH BACKS CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT ACTBipartisan Legislation Would Empower State & Tribal Governments to Address & Prevent CWD OutbreaksWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced her support for bipartisan legislation to increase both research and management of chronic wasting disease (CWD), which has been identified in Mississippi and has the potential to negatively affect recreational hunting, outdoor tourism, local businesses, farms, and ecosystems.Hyde-Smith joined U.S. Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) in offering the Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act (S.4111).  The bill would authorize a five-year CWD research and management program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The work would be carried out through USDA cooperative agreements with state and tribal wildlife agencies, and state agriculture departments. “The spread of chronic wasting disease, which has a presence in Mississippi, is a major cause for concern.  We must dedicate more resources to understanding all we can about the cause, spread, management and control of this always-fatal disease,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I am pleased to support Senator Hoeven’s legislation to give the USDA more resources to focus on this problem.”“CWD is a growing threat to both wildlife and livestock, impacting sportsmen, ranchers and the local ecology of regions across the U.S.,” said Hoeven.  “Our legislation would empower state and tribal governments to better manage and prevent outbreaks of this deadly disease, while also advancing new methods for detecting CWD and limiting its spread.”CWD is a neurological disorder, similar to “mad cow disease,” which is contagious within each species and always fatal.  As of 2021, CWD has been discovered among deer, elk, and moose (cervids) in 26 states, including Mississippi.  Mississippi has an estimated, and well-managed, population of 1.75 million whitetail deer.  Deer hunting represents the largest segment of the outdoor/hunting industry in the state and helps fund the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks.S.4111 would authorize funds for the following priorities:
Research 
•   Methods to effectively detect CWD in live cervids and the environment.
•   Testing methods for non-live cervids.
•   Genetic resistance to CWD.
•   Sustainable cervid harvest management practices to reduce CWD occurrence.
•   Factors contributing to local emergence of CWD.
Management
•   Areas with the highest incidence of CWD.
•   Jurisdictions demonstrating the greatest financial commitment to managing, monitoring, surveying, and researching chronic CWD.
•   Efforts to develop comprehensive CWD management policies and programs.
•   Areas showing the greatest risk of an initial occurrence of CWD.
•   Areas responding to new outbreaks of CWD.The measure would also authorize USDA and state and tribal agencies to develop educational materials to inform the public on CWD and directs USDA to review its herd certification program within 18 months.Both Hyde-Smith and Hoven serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee and Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.In addition to Hyde-Smith, additional original cosponsors include Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kan.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).The Mississippi State University Deer Ecology and Management Laboratory and Mississippi Wildlife Federation support S.4111.  Other groups endorsing the legislation include:  Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, National Wildlife Federation, Boone & Crockett, National Deer Association, North American Deer Farmers Association, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the Mule Deer Foundation.###

HYDE-SMITH CHALLENGES FDA DECISION TO BROADEN ACCESS TO THE CHEMICAL ABORTION PILLSSenator Wants Review of FDA Data behind Decision to End In-Person Dispensing Requirement for Abortion-Inducing MedsVIDEO CLIP:  Senator Hyde-Smith Will Seek Review of Material Behind FDA Chemical Abortion Decision.VIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Questions FDA Commissioner on Access to Mail-Order Abortion Pills.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today said she wants a full review of the data that led to the recent Food and Drug Administration decision to end in-person dispensing requirements for chemical abortion pills, a move that puts the health of women at risk.Hyde-Smith challenged the “mail-order abortion” decision while questioning FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, M.D., who testified Thursday at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to review the agency’s FY2023 budget request.  In February, Hyde-Smith led a letter to Califf seeking to overturn the December decision to remove in-person dispensing requirements from the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for mifepristone.“Your response, which I did get last week, said that you had conducted ‘a comprehensive review’ of the REMS Program, and that you concluded that even without the in-person dispensing requirement, the drug would be ‘safe and effective.’  I and many others disagree with that.  There is plenty of evidence showing these chemical abortion pills are dangerous to the women who take them, and can be extremely dangerous in certain situations,” Hyde-Smith said“It is the job of the FDA and your job as commissioner to protect patients by ensuring the safety of drugs.  The stronger REMS that had been in place since 2019 included safeguards to protect patients from unnecessary risk posed by the drug,” she added.Hyde-Smith, citing Cardiff’s “unequivocal belief that your review was fully comprehensive,” indicated she will request information on all literature used by the FDA to broaden access to the abortion-inducing drug.Hyde-Smith, who highlighted Charlotte Lozier Institute research on the dangers of mail-order abortions in a March op-ed, expressed her concern that chemical abortions now make up a majority of all abortions in the United States, including an 11 percent jump in Mississippi in 2019.“This is, of course, a serious concern of mine from talking to my OB/GYN friends.  As you said you want to see the number of abortions go down, what are you doing to reverse this trend of increasing chemical abortions and actually help lower the numbers?” Hyde-Smith asked Califf.Related to this issue, Hyde-Smith and U.S. Congressman Bob Latta (R-Ohio) in January 2021 introduced the Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act (S.78 and HR.554) to prevent labeling changes for already-approved abortion drugs; prevent providers from dispensing these drugs remotely, by mail, or via tele-medicine; and prevent FDA approval of new chemical abortion drugs.###

Senator Says Safety of American People Will be Worse if Title 42 Policy LapsesVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Rebukes Biden Border Policies, Growing Security Crisis.CHART:  Biden’s Bad Immigration Policies.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and colleagues today rebuked President Biden and his administration’s failed border and immigration policies, which imperils border security and public safety.Hyde-Smith on Wednesday participated in a news conference to highlight the risks the nation will face as unprecedented numbers of illegal immigrants head to the United States as the administration prepares to lift Title 42, the temporary, pandemic-related authority to expedite the expulsion of migrants.“I think it’s pretty clear that everyone who has spoken today wants President Biden to do his job and to protect the American people.  This administration is continuing to just wreak havoc on the southern border,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.“One million more people would cross the border illegally in the first six weeks after Title 42 is eliminated.  That’s what we’re looking at.  It will make this issue that is already an unbelievable crisis, it will make it three-times as bad as it is now,” she said.Hyde-Smith highlighted the duplicity of the Biden administration assertions that Title 42 is unnecessary because COVID is abating, while “in the same breath asks Congress for billions of dollars in more COVID relief.”  Regarding public safety, Hyde-Smith pointed to the flow of illegal drugs across the southern border, which are being detected in Mississippi.She also cited the administration effectively ending the COVID emergency for illegal immigrants, while seeking to restore a federal mask mandate on the American people.“Our job is to protect Americans.  Our job is to enforce American laws.  When it comes down to it, the Biden Administration is just simply using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to push through these liberal policies, and it just doesn’t matter what it’s doing for the safety of Americans.  It is unbelievable,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Again, we’re just asking President Biden to do his job, to protect Americans, and to enforce the laws that have already been passed.”In 2021, DHS officials recorded more than two million crossings by illegal immigrants along the southern border, which does not include the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who crossed the southern border undetected.  There were 1.1 million migrants turned away from the border under Title 42 authority last year.This week, Hyde-Smith signed on as an original cosponsor of Senator John Boozman’s legislation (S.4082) to prevent the Biden administration from diverting U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs resources intended for veterans to manage the growing illegal immigration crisis on the southern border.###

AT AG HEARING, HYDE-SMITH STRESSES NEED FOR FAIRNESS FOR U.S. CATTLE PRODUCERSSenate Panel Receives Testimony on Two Bills that Address Price Disparity between Producers and ConsumersVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Addresses Fairness for Cattle Producers, Consumers.VIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Questions Mississippi Producer on Negative Trends Hurting the U.S. Cattle Industry. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today stressed that American cattle producers deserve to compete in a fair marketplace as the Senate Agriculture Committee began a review of legislation to address the growing price disparity between producers, packers, and consumers.The committee conducted a hearing to receive testimony on the Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act of 2022 (S.4030) and the Meat and Poultry Special Investigator Act of 2022 (S.3870).  At the hearing, William “Ricky” Ruffin of Ruffin Farms in Bay Springs testified on behalf of the United States Cattleman’s Association.“Producers are such hard workers and all we ask for is a fair market that we can compete in,” said Hyde-Smith.  “An increasingly consolidated industry structure has given rise to anticompetitive practices that harm independent cattle producers, especially the small, mom-and-pop operations.”“Something in the system is broken.  Meat packing companies are bringing home tremendous profits while producer earnings are declining.  The ‘Big Four’ have increased gross profit shares by 120 percent while net income has surged by 500 percent.  How do we explain these skyrocketing profits, while input costs are rising?” she said.Hyde-Smith is an original cosponsor of S.4030 and S.3870, both of which were drafted to address the significant difference between the prices received by farmers and ranchers for their cattle in relation to the prices paid by consumers for beef products.Administration witnesses at the hearing were Andy Green, senior advisor for Fair and Competitive Markets at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and USDA Agricultural Marketing Service Administrator Bruce Summers.###

HYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS BILL TO PRIORITIZE VETERANS OVER ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERSLegislation Shields VA Resources as Biden Scrambles to ID Funding to Handle Growing Border CrisisWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.) in introducing legislation to stop the Biden administration from diverting funding and resources intended for veterans programs to manage the growing illegal immigration crisis on the southern border.The bill (S.4082) would prevent the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from prioritizing the needs of illegal immigrants over the nation’s veterans as the administration expects a surge at the southern border after the Trump-era immigration policy, Title 42, is lifted next month.“President Biden and his administration refuse to acknowledge that their actions are ruining any semblance of security on our southern border, and ending Title 42 will make the situation worse.  Tapping resources intended for our veterans and their dependents to spend on the administration’s border crisis amounts to one more irrational plan out of this White House,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.  “I’m pleased to join Senator Boozman in trying to stop this affront to our veterans.”“Veterans should not bear the burden of President Biden’s disastrous immigration policy.  Moving resources away from serving the needs of our veterans to supporting a foreseeable and avoidable crisis at our southern border is unacceptable.  Our legislation ensures the care and services for the men and women who bravely fought for our country are prioritized over illegal immigrants,” said Boozman, the ranking Republican on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds VA programs and a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.The already unprecedented influx of illegal crossings is expected to get worse as the Biden administration on May 23 lifts Title 42, the policy implemented in 2020 to allow federal immigration officials to expedite the return of illegal immigrants to their native countries after having crossed the southern border.This new legislation would keep VA resources off limits as the Biden administration scrambles to identify funding sources to help the U.S. Department of Homeland Security handled an expected 1 million illegal crossings in the first six weeks after Title 42 is ended.In addition to Hyde-Smith, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.).Click here for the text of the bill.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH WELCOME COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION IN GREENVILLE WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today welcomed a construction contract for the new U.S. courthouse in Greenville, which will be built on the “Stein Mart Site” at 200 Washington Avenue in the historic downtown area.The new federal courthouse will provide the judiciary with a 55,639 gross square foot facility along with secure parking.  The award is the result of commitment and partnership between GSA, the courts, elected officials, and the local community.  The GSA expects construction to begin this summer with completion targeted for summer 2024.“The U.S. Courthouse in Greenville is an important project for citizens in the Mississippi Delta,” Wicker said.  “Its completion would modernize and make more secure a crucial government function.  I am glad the General Services Administration is working to ensure its construction moves forward, promotes justice, and invigorates the city’s growing business district.”“Before he left office, my predecessor, Senator Thad Cochran, made it his mission to move the Greenville courthouse project forward and to secure the federal appropriations to get it built. The award of a GSA construction contract on this much-anticipated courthouse is wonderful news, and news which has been years in the making,” said Hyde-Smith, ranking member of the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the GSA.  “It has been a pleasure to work with the GSA on this major project. I look forward to the completion of the courthouse and the energy it can bring to downtown Greenville.”“GSA’s mission is to deliver value and savings in real estate, acquisition and technology to our federal customers like the U.S. Courts, their supporting agencies and the local communities they serve,” said Acting Regional Administrator Giancarlo Brizzi.  “Projects like the new U.S. Courthouse in Greenville allow us to go even further by creating a space that becomes a part of the city center adding vitality and economic growth to the area.”The new federal courthouse will be built on a 2.5 acre site in the city’s original central business district near the east bank of the Mississippi River.  The facility will have two courtrooms, one district and one magistrate, and three judicial chambers.  Tenant agencies include GSA, the U.S. District Court, U.S. Clerk of the Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S. Marshals, U.S. Probation, Federal Public Defender, and U.S. Attorneys.The City of Greenville was also awarded $500,000 for a green space adjacent to the courthouse as a part of the larger downtown revitalization project.Members of the Mississippi congressional delegation, including Wicker and then Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), supported the FY2016 appropriation of $52 million for GSA construction and acquisition funding for joint United States courthouses, federal buildings, with not less than $46 million was set aside for a new Greenville federal building.###

HYDE-SMITH STATEMENT ON JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement regarding her decision to vote against the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to serve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court:“I cannot in good conscience support the confirmation of Judge Jackson.“I take seriously my responsibility to weigh the merits of each Supreme Court nominee, including their commitment to fairly interpret the law and not substitute their own judgment for that of Congress or the Constitution.  I am not confident that Judge Jackson meets that standard after having reviewed her record and confirmation proceedings.“Judge Jackson’s record indicates a readiness to legislate from the bench, at times in a manner that risks some of the basic freedoms that are at the core of our Constitution.  Such activism, for example, has threatened free speech rights and other individual American liberties.“Judge Jackson may be confirmed to the Supreme Court, but not with my support.  As she assumes her historic role on the Supreme Court, I will pray she commits to a fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.”Hyde-Smith, who voted against confirming Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2021, issued the statement after meeting with the nominee on March 31 and as Senate Democrats brought the nomination to the full Senate for consideration. ###

Senators Among 68 Senators Asking Sec. of State to Refocus Resources on Actual Human Rights Crises WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) are among a broad bipartisan Senate majority that is encouraging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to assert his influence to end “discriminatory and unwarranted treatment” of Israel by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).Sixty-eight Senators have written Blinken encouraging the Biden administration to lead a multinational effort in the UNHRC and in the United Nations to end the permanent Commission of Inquiry (COI) on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“We appreciate your commitment to put the Council’s ‘disproportionate focus on Israel’ at the top of the Biden administration’s agenda for reforming the Council when the U.S. announced it would seek to rejoin the UNHRC,” the Senators wrote.“By unfairly singling out Israel, the UNHRC undermines its credibility to investigate human rights violations around the world,” they continued.  “The COI is the latest endeavor by UNHRC to discredit the only Jewish state and is likely to further fuel antisemitism worldwide.  Therefore, we urge you to act upon the administration’s commitment to defend Israel from discriminatory treatment at the Human Rights Council and throughout the UN system.”In their letter, the Senators urge Blinken to redirect resources toward human rights crises around the world instead of wasteful and biased investigations into Israel, noting that the COI budget and staffing “represents considerable resources devoted to maligning and ultimately prosecuting Israel.”U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) led the letter, which was signed by 36 Republican Senators and 32 Democrats.Click here to read the letter to Secretary Blinken.###

Environmental Protection Agency case before the U.S. Supreme Court.The Sackett case is directly related to how much authority the federal government has over states and private citizens to regulate “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act (CWA).“Like the members of Congress that enacted the CWA, [we] support policies that protect the environment while also ensuring that States retain their traditional role as the primary regulators of land and water resources, and that farmers, manufacturers, small business owners, and property owners like the Petitioners in this case can develop and use their land free of over-burdensome, job-killing federal regulations,” the legislators wrote.  “These entities need certainty about the scope of ‘waters of the United States’ under the Clean Water Act, and the Court’s endorsement of the Scalia test would provide that long-needed certainty.”“Congress made clear its intent in legislative text, structure, and history to establish a limited federal regulatory presence in cooperation with the States.  In the CWA, Congress selected language that, from practically the Founding, was understood both to exercise limited jurisdiction and to preserve the States’ traditional role as the principal regulators of local waters and lands.  But this intent has now been turned on its head,” the legislators continued.  “Through the ‘significant nexus’ test, the EPA and Corps can instead use any ecological connection between land and nearby water as a pretext for intrusive central planning.  This case presents an opportunity for the Court to finally put the genie back in the bottle and endorse the functionally equivalent test proposed by Justice Scalia. Only then will Congress’s dual purposes of cooperative federalism and environmental protection in the CWA be fully vindicated.”The brief was led by U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and U.S. Representative Sam Graves (R-Mo.), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.  In total, the brief was signed by 46 Senators and 155 House members.Click here for the full text of the amicus brief and complete list of the signers.###

Senators Stand Against Concessions to Iran for Renewed Nuclear DealWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today pushed back on President Biden’s consideration of delisting Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in exchange for the approval of a new nuclear deal with Iran.The Senators and 12 of their colleagues expressed their concerns in a letter to the President, highlighting the fact the IRGC is responsible for hundreds of American deaths and remains a threat to U.S. interests.“Not only would this removal be wildly misguided, but it would betray our partners and allies in the region—particularly Israel and the Gulf states,” wrote the Senators.  “These allies and partners already hold concerns that the United States is reducing its regional presence.  The enactment of such a deal would provide the Iranian regime access to funds that it would use to destabilize the region through terrorist proxies.”The letter follows reports that President Biden and his diplomatic team are in talks to finalize negotiations related to Iran’s nuclear program and reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal.  Delisting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps would be a potential precondition for an agreement.  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that he did not support delisting the IRGC given its recent activities.“When it comes to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the realities are grim.  The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is actively trying to kill U.S. politicians and public servants on U.S. soil—most notably, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,” the Senators continued.  “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is responsible for the deaths of more than 600 American troops… [it] has shown no meaningful change in conduct and is actively engaging in terrorist activates.”“We humbly request that you meet this test of resolve and conscience by publicly and categorically rejecting any discussion of delisting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization,” the Senators conclude.U.S. Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) led the letter, which is available here.  ###

HYDE-SMITH COSPONSORS HEARING PROTECTION ACTMeasure Would Reclassify Suppressors to Regulate Them as Regular FirearmsWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced she has cosponsored legislation to reform the regulation of suppressors and make them more available to help preserve the hearing of sportsmen and their hunting dogs. The Hearing Protection Act (S.2050) would reclassify suppressors to regulate them like a regular firearm.  U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) authored the measure.“Eliminating a lot of the red tape that restricts access to suppressors could help hunters and sport shooters in Mississippi avoid permanent hearing damage,” Hyde-Smith said.  “The Hearing Protection Act would make commonsense improvements to make it easier for responsible, law-abiding Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment rights and protect their hearing.”    Regulated under the National Firearms Act (NFA), suppressors are subject to additional burdens that often exceed those imposed by more liberal European nations that actually require their use to reduce hearing-related injuries.  S.2050 would:The Hearing Protection Act would not change any laws in states that already prevent suppressors, nor does it get rid of the requirement of a background check. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, American Suppressor Association, Gun Owners of America, and National Rifle Association support this legislation.###

HYDE-SMITH & CORPS OFFICIALS AGREE PUMPS WOULD BRING MEANINGFUL FLOOD PROTECTION TO YAZOO BACKWATER AREAAt Hearing, Hyde-Smith Pressed Army Corps Officials on Environmental Justice and Reviving Pumping Station Cancelled by EPAVIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Presses Army Corps Officials on path forward for Yazoo Backwater Pumps.VIDEO CLIP:  Senator Hyde-Smith on Peer-Reviewed Science &Environmental Justice Behind Yazoo Backwater Pumps.PHOTO:  Senator Hyde-Smith, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Michael Connor, and U.S. Senator John Kennedy (R-La.). WASHINGTON, D.C. – Responding to questions from U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on the need for meaningful flood protection in the Yazoo Backwater Area, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials testified that “pumps are still in the mix” as the agency works to find new path forward.At a Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to review the FY2023 Army Corps budget, Hyde-Smith focused on how to overcome the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decision in November to halt the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumps. “I believe the Corps understands that the Yazoo Backwater Pump project is one of my very top priorities because I have seen the suffering that has happened in Mississippi,” Hyde-Smith said following the hearing.  “It’s clear to me that the Corps understands that a pumping station is the only way to bring meaningful flood protection to this part of Mississippi.  I hope ongoing talks help us make that a reality sooner rather than later.”During the hearing, Hyde-Smith asked Lt. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, about the reality of being able to provide sufficient flood protection for the area’s residents, businesses, and environment without a pumping station to remove trapped floodwaters.“We are confident in our science.  We are confident in our engineering that the pump station can be operated in a manner that protects these communities that you mentioned, but also protects the 38,000 acres of wetland that are in that area,” said Spellmon, who noted the Corps had considered almost three dozen non-pump alternatives that were not practicable or economically feasible.In November 2021, the EPA halted the Corps’ new Proposed Plan for the pumps by disputing the peer-reviewed science and documentation.  EPA also sought to justify its conclusion by arguing that the Corps’ 2020 Proposed Plan was the same plan vetoed by EPA in 2008, despite the 2020 plan being in an entirely different county with a host of different features.  “We often hear:  ‘We need to listen to the science.’  Well, what does the science say?  The science says the Corps’ new Proposed Plan would not convert any wetlands to non-wetlands.  The science says the project would benefit all sections of the economy and contribute to the well-being of all area residents.  The science says the project would benefit wetlands, aquatic species, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and every other important resource that flooding has been destroying for decades,” Hyde-Smith said.“But here is the real irony:  The current administration has placed environmental justice at the top of its priority list.  The Yazoo Backwater Area population is nearly 70 percent minority with roughly 30 percent living in poverty,” the Senator said.  Michael Connor, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, testified that the Biden administration considers the Yazoo Backwater Pumps an environmental justice issue.“We have got to deal with that Backwater flooding.  We’ve got to figure out the mix of structural and nonstructural.  When I say structural, I think pumps are still in the mix for the discussion that we’re going to have in this interagency group,” Connor said.  “I can assure you this is part of the environmental justice agenda to get to a project, to get to a solution because of the factors you mentioned with respect to minority residents in that area, as well as the poverty level in that area.”“We are getting the attention we need at a very high level,” Connor said, noting that an interagency working group, led by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, is trying to identify a path forward.During the subcommittee discussion on the Yazoo Backwater Area, U.S. Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) added his voice to Hyde-Smith’s call for the Army Corps and EPA to reach an agreement on the last unfinished component of the Yazoo Backwater Area flood control project—a pumping station.###

HYDE-SMITH ANNOUNCES $8.0 MILLION TO BACK INVESTMENT IN RURAL & UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIESForty-Eight Miss. Financial Institutions Awarded Bank Enterprise Award Program FundingWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced the award of more than $8.0 million that will allow 48 Mississippi banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions to back investments in economically-distressed areas.The FY2021 Bank Enterprise Award Program (BEA Program) grants were approved through the U.S. Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund).“The BEA Program is well received by local banks and credit unions because it allows them to leverage their assets to invest in small businesses and start-ups, which gives them the ability to support job creation and retention in areas that most need it,” Hyde-Smith said.Hyde-Smith, as ranking member of the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Treasury Department and the CDFI Fund, last year invited Bank of Anguilla CEO and President Andy Anderson to testify on the benefit of programs like the BEA.The CDFI Fund provides BEA Program awards to FDIC-insured depository institutions committed to increasing their investments in CDFIs or in their own lending, investing, or service activities in the most distressed communities.Last June, Anderson advocated for more BEA resources in his testimony, stating:  “BEA has the strongest demand among the CDFI Fund programs and is far oversubscribed compared to other programs.  In 2020, only $1 in BEA funding was available for every $5.68 in requests.  Given the benefit generated by the BEA Program it is critical to increase funding…  Through the financial benefits of the BEA Program, Bank of Anguilla is able to make commercial loans to small minority businesses and consumer loans to individuals that need financial help.”The $8,054,00 million will be distributed as a $170,699 award to each of following institutions, with the exception of FNB Picayune Bank ($168,625) and Richton Bank and Trust Co.

HYDE-SMITH VOTES TO SANCTION KREMLIN-OWNED ENERGY PIPELINESenate Bid to Block Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Falls Short as Most Democrat Senators Uphold Biden Sanction WaiverWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today expressed regret that insufficient votes were cast to advance a Senate bill to challenge the security threats posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin-owned Nord Stream 2 AG natural gas pipeline to Germany.Hyde-Smith on Thursday voted for the Protecting Europe's Energy Security Implementation Act (S.3436), which would impose mandatory sanctions on Nord Stream.  On a 55-44 vote, the Senate failed to reach a 60-vote threshold for passage.“The security and economic situation for U.S. allies and interests has worsened in the months since President Biden waived Nord Stream sanctions in favor of diplomacy and dialogue with Russia.  This legislation would reinstate sanctions and put the United States in a stronger position to deal with Putin and support our allies,” Hyde-Smith said.“It is deeply regrettable that partisan considerations stopped passage of this important legislation,” she said.Hyde-Smith has been sharply critical of Biden energy policies, including the cancellation of U.S.-pipelines while allowing construction completion on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 after the President waived sanctions last May.  Shortly thereafter, Hyde-Smith cosponsored the Protecting Our Well-being by Expanding Russian Sanctions (POWERS) Act to reinstate sanctions.President Biden’s actions toward the Russian pipeline were also a factor in Hyde-Smith last summer calling on the administration to help American families and the economy by reversing its flawed energy policies.###

HYDE-SMITH JOINS BILL TO SANCTION BEIJING FOR ONGOING OBSTRUCTION OF COVID ORIGINS INVESTIGATIONPenalties include Suspending, Prohibiting U.S.-China Viral Research EffortsWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today cosponsored new legislation to impose sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) if it continues to obstruct international investigations into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.Coronavirus Origin Validation, Investigation, and Determination (COVID) Act of 2022 (S.3463) would authorize sanctions if the CCP fails to allow for a credible and comprehensive international investigation into the origins of COVID-19 at laboratories in Wuhan, including a review of risky research involving bat coronaviruses. “The Chinese Communist Party's inexcusable roadblocks to legitimate scientific investigations of the coronavirus deserve a strong response by the United States and other world leaders,” Hyde-Smith said.  “The sanctions outlined in this legislation could finally prompt the CCP to help us understand the origins of a health pandemic that started in China and that continues its global rampage today.” Specifically, S.3463 would sanction the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and its affiliated institutes and laboratories, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  It would also suspend U.S. federal research funding across all academic fields for studies involving the CAS.  In addition, the measure would impose a prohibition on gain-of-function virus research cooperation between any U.S.-based individual or institution that receives federal funding and any People’s Republic of China-based individual or institution. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) authored the COVID Act of 2022, with these additional original cosponsors:   Tim Scott (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and John Kennedy (R-La.).Read the full text of S.3463 here.###

Senators Join Colleagues in Opposition to OSHA Vaccine OrderWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) joined 45 Senators and 136 Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States urging the court to stay the Biden Administration’s order requiring COVID vaccines or weekly testing for all employees of private businesses with 100 or more employees.In the brief, the legislators argue that Congress did not give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which will be implementing the order, the authority to impose a vaccine mandate.  The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on January 7.  If it is not blocked, the order will take effect on January 10 and authorize punitive action toward private businesses that do not comply starting February 9.“Congressional members have an interest in the powers they delegate to agencies not being abused—the legislative authority vested in the federal government belongs to Congress, not the Executive branch,” the members wrote.“The promulgation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of a sweeping, nationwide vaccine mandate on businesses intrudes into an area of legislative concern far beyond the authority of the agency.  And it does so with a Mandate enacted through OSHA’s seldom-used ‘emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) provision that allows for bypass of notice and comment rulemaking under certain circumstances.  That OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the ETS Mandate is not a ‘particularly hard’ question.”The members also asserted the rights of states and localities in overseeing the public interest for their citizens, such as through the oversight of vaccinations and public health.“Moreover, congressional members—as representatives of the people of their States and districts—have an interest in the citizens they represent being able to craft local solutions to problems facing their States and districts,” the brief continues.  “Federalism concerns should be addressed before requiring federally-imposed solutions.  And this is especially true when the question at issue involves an area typically reserved to the States (such as vaccine mandates).  At the least, Congress should be forced to make clear any delegations of authority into areas of State control.”Read the full text of the brief here. ###

Environmental Protection Agency. In this case challenging overreaching Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rulemaking to restructure the nation’s power sector, the lawmakers agree EPA acted outside its congressionally-authorized authority by issuing significantly overreaching rules—namely the Clean Power Plan—to attempt to transform the nation’s power sector through emissions regulations under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.In their amicus brief, the lawmakers stress:“If Congress had intended to give the EPA such sweeping authority to transform an entire sector of our economy, Congress would have done so explicitly.  An administrative agency like the EPA may decide issues of such vast economic and political significance only when the agency can point to ‘clear congressional authorization.’ …“Section 111(d) provides limited authority for the EPA to prescribe regulations in certain narrow circumstances. Section 111(d) does not provide the EPA with the authority to compel a substantial and costly shift in electric power generation across the entire nation.“Decisions regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the power sector are major policy questions with vast economic and political significance.  Only elected members of Congress, representing the will of the people, may decide these questions.  The EPA’s attempt to issue expansive regulations cannot stand in the absence of clear congressional authorization.“Congress knows how to address greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, Congress has decided to pass transformative laws that incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from a wide range of industries, including the electric power sector.”U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) led the amicus brief, which is available here.###

Bay Springs Telephone Company Inc., Hinds County – $3 million Community Connect grant for an approximately 80-mile Fiber-to-the Premises system to benefit 1,066 residents and five businesses in the Jasper County service area.  Subscribers will have access to service up to 1 Gbps, expanding access to economic, educational, health care, and public safety opportunities.  A community center will be provided in an existing building where residents can access the Internet free of charge for at least two years.
Quincy Water Association, Monroe County – $1.867 million grant and $2.381 million loan for constructing two new treatment facilities, and making necessary improvements to the distribution system to allow water to be adequately distributed.  The project will also include installing new radio read meters.
The Town of Sherman, Pontotoc County – $1.41 million grant and $1.89 million loan for two treatment facilities that will allow the water to be adequately distributed and to install radio read meters.

HYDE-SMITH VOTES AGAINST VEHICLE FOR DEBT LIMIT INCREASEWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement regarding her vote Thursday against the Senate proceeding to legislation allowing rules changes to facilitate expedited consideration of a measure to raise the nation’s debt limit:“I vowed this summer not to help the Democrats raise the debt limit, and I’m holding fast to that commitment not to vote to increase the debt ceiling.  The nation cannot be allowed to default on its obligations, but we should not raise the debt limit in a manner that enables President Biden and Democrats to spend trillions of dollars on reckless socialistic programs.“It is unfortunate that necessary provisions to avoid cuts to Medicare and agriculture programs were linked to the debt limit.  I am among a strong bipartisan core that supports ensuring seniors and farmers aren’t harmed, but helping them should not have been tied to a controversial debt limit question.”Hyde-Smith voted no on a procedural motion to S.610, a measure that addresses sequestration cuts to Medicare and most U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, in addition to setting the stage for Senate Democrats to increase the debt limit increase.  Having received more than 60 votes to proceed, the Senate could pass S.610 later this week.In August, Hyde-Smith signed a letter, which stated, “We, the undersigned Republican Senators, are letting Senate Democrats and the American people know that we will not vote to increase the debt ceiling, whether that increase comes through a stand-alone bill, a continuing resolution, or any other vehicle.  This is a problem created by Democrat spending.  Democrats will have to accept sole responsibility for facilitating it.”###UPDATE 12/14/2021:  U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), as she pledged this summer, today voted against the Democrat plan to raise the debt limit by $2.5 trillion. The measure, S.J.Res.33, passed 50-49 and now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.

Senators Cosponsored Congressional Review Act Challenge to Overreaching MandateWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today cheered Senate passage of a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution they cosponsored to overturn President Biden’s mandate to force private businesses to require COVID-19 vaccines for their employees.The Senate on Wednesday night voted 52-48 to approve a CRA, the official process for Congress to eliminate an Executive Branch rule, to stop the Biden private-sector vaccine mandate.  S.J.Res.29 now requires House approval.  “President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates are rightfully being challenged in the courts.  Today’s vote confirms that a majority of the Senate disapproves strongly of the President’s actions.  We will continue working to overturn this blatant executive overreach that threatens to wreck our economy,” Wicker said.“We understand the seriousness of the pandemic, its toll on personal lives and our economy, and the effectiveness of vaccines.  This awareness, however, does not give President Biden license to impose imperial vaccine edicts that impede personal freedoms and impose a vast government overreach over a struggling private business sector,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I continue to believe COVID vaccines save lives.  I also trust the American people to make the best medical decisions for themselves and their families.”Wicker and Hyde-Smith cosponsored S.J.Res.29 in November, not long after announcing an earlier intent to challenge the mandate.The Biden administration rule mandated vaccines for all employees who work at private businesses with 100 or more workers.  The subsequent Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) final rule outlined a $13,653 fine for each offense, with willful violations resulting in a $136,532 penalty.S.J.Res.29 was filed on the basis that this federal mandate is a highly inappropriate invasion of what should be a personal medical decision for every American, and that it could worsen labor shortages and supply chain disruptions.U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced S.J.Res.29, which is supported by:  National Federation of Independent Business, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant Association, American Trucking Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, Associated General Contractors of America, American Pipeline Contractors Association, National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association, National Association of Home Builders, National Grain and Feed Association, and others.###

https://www.hydesmith.senate.gov/hyde-smith-gosar-introduce-legislation-block-state-gun-registries,"HYDE-SMITH, GOSAR INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO BLOCK STATE GUN REGISTRIESLawmakers Offer ‘GRIP Act’ in Continued Effort to Protect Gun Owners’ Privacy RightsWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and U.S. Representative Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (R-Ariz.) today introduced the Gun-owner Registration Information Protection Act (GRIP Act) to prohibit states, localities, or any other organization from using federal funding to maintain gun registries.The GRIP Act would clarify existing law that prohibits the use of any federal funding by states or local entities to store or list sensitive, personal information related to the legal ownership or possession of firearms.  The legislation is in response to states that in recent years enacted statutes requiring gun owners to register their handguns. “The fight to protect Second Amendment rights is unending,” said Hyde-Smith, a lifetime NRA member.  “The GRIP Act would protect the rights and personal information of law-abiding citizens who own or purchase firearms legally.  It would require adherence to the law that specifically says federal monies cannot be used to track or hassle gun owners.”“Another year, another swipe at the American people’s second amendment right.  This week, Speaker Pelosi plans on ramming through Congress two overreaching gun control bills.  Egregiously, these bills would create a firearm registry database that could be made available to the public creating the likelihood for discrimination against gun owners.  In contrast, this week I was proud to work with Senator Hyde-Smith to introduce the Gun-owner Registration Information Protection (GRIP) Act.  Supported by the National Rifle Association, the GRIP Act prohibits the use of federal funding of firearm registry databases that list gunowners who lawfully own or possess firearms,” said Gosar.Current law prevents the federal government from storing information acquired during the firearms background process.   The GRIP Act would ensure the federal government does not support, either intentionally or otherwise, state or local efforts to collect and store personally identifiable information related to legal firearm purchases and ownership.This legislation (S.712 and HR.1827) further clarifies that states and local entities cannot use federal grant funds from programs, such as the National Criminal Histories Improvement Program, NICS Amendment Records Improvement Program, or the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, to create or maintain full or partial gun registries.The measure does not include any limitations related to state recordkeeping for permitting, law enforcement-issued firearms, or lost or stolen firearms.The National Rifle Association (NRA) has endorsed the bill.“On behalf of our more than 5 million members, the National Rifle Association thanks Senator Hyde-Smith and Congressman Gosar for introducing this important piece of legislation to prevent the use of federal funds to create a national gun owner registry.  Biden-Pelosi-Schumer and their gun control cohorts have longed for the disarming of America, and a national gun registry is a dangerous step towards reaching that goal,"" said Jason Ouimet, executive director, NRA Institute for Legislative Action.Original cosponsors of the Senate measure include Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Thune (R-S.D.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).Original cosponsors of the House measure include Representatives Brian Babin (R-Texas), Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Jerry Carl (R-Ala.), Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), Rick Crawford (R-Ark.), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Glenn Grothman (R-Wisc.), Michael Guest (R-Miss.), Jim Hagedorn (R-Minn.), Jody Hice (R-Ga.)

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT FAITH-BASED FOSTER CARE PROVIDERSMiss. Senators Take an Important Step to Protect Religious FreedomWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined their colleagues in introducing the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act to protect child welfare providers from being discriminated against for acting in accordance with their deeply held religious beliefs.“Faith-based adoption and foster care providers do incredible work finding loving homes for our nation’s orphans,” Wicker said.  “It is deeply disturbing that certain states are seeking to drive these providers out of the marketplace because of their religious and moral beliefs, leaving children to pay the price.  This legislation would protect federally-funded child welfare providers from discrimination based on their beliefs, allowing them to continue serving children in need.” “Our nation is entering into a precarious time when religious liberties can be so easily trampled,” Hyde-Smith said. “This reasonable legislation would protect child welfare providers, who hold fast to their religious beliefs or moral convictions.  States that choose to discriminate against these workers would in turn be choosing to hurt overall services for all caregivers, children, and families.”This legislation would prohibit federal, state, and local government agencies that receive federal adoption assistance funding from discriminating against child welfare service providers based on the providers’ unwillingness to take action contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. This would include all agencies that receive funding under Part B (Child and Family Services) or Part E (Federal Payments for Foster Care, Prevention, and Permanency) of Title IV of the Social Security Act.Wicker and Hyde-Smith joined Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in introducing the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, along with Senators Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), James Risch (R-Idaho), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).Supporting organizations include Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Heritage Action, and the Family Research Council. “Far too many children are waiting, right now, either for adoption or foster families.  Our government must not stand in the way of those seeking to care for them.  It is difficult to imagine a more important goal for child welfare policy than the goal of seeing vulnerable children who need a loving home be united with families committed to caring for them.  Protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care agencies only ensures that more children will have access to the love and support they so desperately need.  This is precisely what the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act would do,” said Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.Representative Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives.###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH ENCOURAGE INCREASED U.S. RICE EXPORTS TO IRAQ WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined colleagues from other rice-producing states to encourage U.S. and Iraqi officials to take steps to increase U.S. rice exports to Iraq.In separate letters to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Dr. Fareed Yasseen, the Iraq Ambassador to the United States, Senators from Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, encouraged the issuance and implementation of a U.S.-specific rice tender under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for rice tenders between the two countries.Highlighting the benefit to both nations, the Senators wrote, “Rice farmers in our states recently finished harvesting the largest American rice crop in a decade. The U.S.-specific rice tender under the terms of the MOU would positively impact both the Iraqi people and our American rice farmers, especially those farmers struggling with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”Iraq is an important destination for American-grown rice because the majority of its population consumes rice daily and almost 90 percent of the nation’s supply is imported.  The United States shipped 390,000 metric tons to Iraq since the first MOU was signed in 2016.In 2020, Mississippi Delta farmers harvested almost 12.6 million hundredweight of rice on 170,000 acres.  The $138 million value of the crop made Mississippi the sixth leading rice producer in the United States last year.Led by Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member John Boozman (R-Ark.), the letters were also signed by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Read the letter to Secretary of State Blinken here and the letter to Iraqi Ambassador Yasseen here.###

Senators Reintroduce Legislation to End Twice-a-Year Need for Americans to Change their ClocksWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to reintroduce legislation to make Daylight Saving Time (DST) permanent across the United States.DST begins this Sunday, March 14, and lasts until Sunday, November 7.  The Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 would simply negate the need for Americans to change their clocks twice a year.  Many studies have shown that making DST permanent could benefit the economy and the country.“The public safety improvements, economic benefits, and the wellbeing of the American people are all excellent and credible reasons to embrace year-long Daylight Saving Time,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I know the agricultural sector in Mississippi and across the nation desires this change.  I believe the Sunshine Protection Act would give us an immediate and long-term boost after a terrible pandemic year and a very dark winter.”“The call to end the antiquated practice of clock changing is gaining momentum throughout the nation,” Rubio said.  “Studies have shown many benefits of a year-round Daylight Saving Time, which is why the Florida legislature voted to make it permanent in 2018.  I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan bill to make Daylight Saving Time permanent, and give our nation’s families more stability throughout the year.”If enacted, S.623 would apply to those states who currently participate in DST, which most states observe for eight months out of the year.  The remaining four months, November to March, fall under Standard Time.Florida legislature in 2018 enacted year-round DST; however, for the act to apply, a change in the federal statute is required.  Fifteen other states (Arkansas, Alabama, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) have passed similar laws, resolutions or voter initiatives, and other states are considering similar action. Additional cosponsors of Rubio’s legislation include Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).  The legislation has been referred to the Senate Commerce Committee, where it awaits action.BACKGROUNDPotential effects of making Daylight Saving Time permanent for the nation:###

HYDE-SMITH VOTES AGAINST $1.9 TRILLION TO FUND LIBERAL AGENDABiden, Democrats Use Coronavirus Pandemic to Force Radical Agenda on NationWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) issued the following statement regarding her vote against the $1.9 trillion plan advanced by President Biden and congressional Democrats as COVID relief, but would actually advance a radical liberal agenda.  The plan passed on a strictly partisan 50-49 vote.“This package is not the just reward for a nation marking its first anniversary of the pandemic lockdown, unimaginable hardships, tragic numbers of lives lost, and truly remarkable examples of heroism, charity, and fortitude by Mississippians and people across the nation.  We should have worked together just as we did on the last five COVID bills.
 
“What the President and congressional Democrats have produced is bad policy.  It opens the door to a radical liberal agenda thinly veiled as COVID relief.  In fact, less than 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion goes toward healthcare needs to fight the virus, and less than 1 percent is dedicated to vaccines.  The bulk of this plan amounts to audacious political favors over the next few years to Democratic special interests, unions, abortion providers, and poorly managed Blue States.  I am very disappointed.”During a nearly 12-hour delay over unemployment benefits on Friday, Hyde-Smith encouraged Senators to work toward a revised, bipartisan deal.As part of an overnight “vote-a-rama” amendment process, Senate Democrats rejected all attempts to improve the measure.  Among the amendments left on the cutting room floor was a Hyde-Smith amendment to extend USDA aid to agriculture producers affected by disasters and to ensure U.S. catfish and seafood are included in USDA commodity help for foodbanks and families.Democrats also defeated amendments supported by Hyde-Smith to uphold the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of taxpayer funding for abortion services. She also cosponsored an amendment to stop increased Medicare reimbursements for hospitals in all-urban states, which would disadvantage rural states like Mississippi.  It also failed to pass.###

 Support for Bipartisan Jobless Benefits Amendment Grinds Senate to a HaltVIDEO:  Hyde-Smith Appeals for Bipartisanship on COVID Legislation.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on Friday appealed for a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package as Senate Democrats stopped floor action in an effort to quash a bipartisan amendment on unemployment benefits.“You know, when I got here, I intended to come and work with everybody in this building, and I’m still willing to work with everybody in this building,” Hyde-Smith said at a news conference during an ongoing stall now headed past its seventh hour.“The employers in Mississippi have voiced to me their need for this unemployment amendment because they need their people to be at work.  We have got to get past this COVID epidemic.  We’ve got to let the basic fundamentals of economics work so everybody can have the dignity of the job,” she said.Pointing to bipartisan work on five previous coronavirus bills since March 2020, the Mississippi Senator asked her Democratic colleagues to abandon their effort to force through a strictly partisan package stuffed with non-COVID items.“We can do this one just the way we did the others.  Let’s move forward.  Let’s get this in a position where we can be proud of this bill instead of having to be right here wasting the time of the American people while the clock ticks,” she said.The Senate came into session Friday morning expecting to begin a “vote-a-rama” amendment process to the Democrat’s $1.9 trillion bill.Democratic leadership stopped work when there appeared to be sufficient bipartisan support to pass an amendment to lower federal unemployment benefits to $300 a week from $400, extended through mid-July.  U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business support the amendment.Among the bill changes supported by Hyde-Smith is her own amendment (SA.971) to extend USDA aid to agriculture producers affected by disasters and to ensure U.S. catfish and seafood are included in USDA commodity help for foodbanks and families.###

Cosponsor Bill to Prohibit Spending on Global Climate Change Agreement Embraced by President BidenWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today highlighted their support of legislation to prohibit the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to implement an international climate change pact that would drive up the cost of food, energy, and services for American families.Wicker and Hyde-Smith are original cosponsors of the No Taxpayer Funding for Paris Climate Agreement Act (S.364), which was introduced in response to President Biden’s inauguration day decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement.  President Trump judged the agreement as patently unfair to the United States and abandoned the plan.  “Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement is disastrous for our economy and does little to improve our environment,” Wicker said.  “Americans will bear the cost by paying higher prices for food and other goods and services.  This legislation would ensure Americans do not also pay for this job-killing agreement with their own tax dollars.”“Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement is a mistake.  This poorly negotiated accord is a challenge to American sovereignty and our economic growth, while giving worse polluters like China a pass,” Hyde-Smith said.  “There are better ways to confront climate change without putting Mississippi families and businesses on the line for higher energy bills and restrictions on their futures.”S.364 would prohibit the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which was reached in December 2015 by the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Heritage Foundation analysts found if the United States stayed in the Paris Agreement, there would be an overall loss of nearly 400,000 jobs, half of which would be in manufacturing.  This analysis also determined the Paris Agreement would result in an average total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four; and an aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion.From the beginning, critics panned the Paris Agreement for being unfair to United States and lenient with major polluting nations like China, India, Pakistan, and Russia.  MarketWatch reported in December 2020 that China, a Paris accord member and the world’s largest polluter, “released the equivalent of 10 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2018, according to the Global Carbon Project that tracks emissions worldwide. That was almost twice as much as the U.S. and three times as much as the European Union.”Introduced by Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the legislation has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.###    * indicates a required field.By completing this form, you are authorizing us to send regular e-mail updates to your e-mail account."

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH INTRODUCE FAIR ACCESS TO BANKING ACTMiss. Senators Work to Prevent Discrimination by Financial Service ProvidersWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today joined colleagues in introducing the Fair Access to Banking Act, which would prevent discrimination against constitutionally-protected industries and law-abiding businesses by banks and financial service providers. “Financial service providers wield immense power and should not be able to block constitutionally-protected businesses or industries to please political activists,” Wicker said. “Attempts to cut off law-abiding organizations like energy producers or firearm manufacturers from our economy are an affront to the rights of all Americans.”“Banks, credit unions, and financial service providers are not above the law, and have no legal standing to refuse law-abiding businesses service, especially for political reasons,” Hyde-Smith said.  “This important legislation would ensure banking institutions operate on an impartial basis, and establishes penalties for those that put political agendas over the law.”The purpose of the Fair Access to Banking Act is to protect fair access to financial services and to ensure banks operate in a safe and sound manner, basing judgements and decisions on impartial, individualized risk-based analysis developed through empirical data and evaluated under quantifiable standards.If enacted, this bill would:Currently, some of the largest United States banks are using their economic standing to discriminate against energy producers. Last year, five of the country’s largest banks announced they would not provide loans or credit to support oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge even though Congress explicitly authorized it.  Last fall, JP Morgan Chase declared it would refuse financial services to coal producers, and Bank of America began a politically-motivated effort to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its financing activities by 2050, an effort directly targeting producers of reliable American energy. Discrimination by financial service providers also extends to industries protected by the Second Amendment, with banks like Capital One including “ammunitions, firearms, or firearm parts” in their prohibited payments section, and payment services like Apple Pay and PayPal denying their services for transactions involving firearms or ammunition.This legislation builds off the Trump Administration’s Fair Access Rule, which was issued in response to these developments to prevent these examples and other acts of discrimination.  However, the rule’s implementation has since been paused under President Biden. Wicker and Hyde-Smith joined Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), the bill’s author, and Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.),  Bill Cassidy (R-La.),  Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).The bill has broad industry support, including endorsements from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), National Rifle Association (NRA), Kentucky Coal Association, Lignite Energy Council, National Mining Association, Amusement and Music Operators Association, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the Day 1 Alliance.A copy of the bill is available here.###

HYDE-SMITH OPPOSES POSSIBLE DUTIES ON PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS
 
Miss. Senator Joins Letter Highlighting Hardships on U.S. Farmers if Penalties ImposedWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) has signed a letter calling on the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to oppose imposing countervailing duties on Moroccan phosphate fertilizers, fees that would adversely affect the availability and affordability of fertilizers for Mississippi farmers and ranchers.“The rising costs and availability of fertilizers are a problem to Mississippi farmers and ranchers.  Fertilizer supplies have tightened across the country and phosphate fertilizer prices are substantially up 25 percent or more since last summer.  The ITC should not act in a manner that adds to the hardships already affecting U.S. agriculture,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Agriculture Committee.In July 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation into imports of phosphate fertilizers from Morocco, which could result in the imposition of duties. The ITC Commission decided last August to continue the investigation.  The ITC is expected to make a final determination this month.Hyde-Smith joined Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and nine other Senators in writing, “The imposition of duties between 9.19 and 47.05 percent on phosphate fertilizers would result not only in higher input costs for U.S. farmers but also potentially limit their options for applying necessary crop inputs.  Given the unprecedented volatility experienced in the agricultural economy over the past three years, it is especially important to avoid imposing unnecessary duties that will further limit fertilizer options and raise the cost of production for farmers.”The letter also received support from the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, American Soybean Association, National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform.  A copy of the letter is available here.Hyde-Smith raised the fertilizer issue at the February confirmation hearing for Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, asking how he would address concerns about fertilizer supplies and ensuring reliable markets.Vilsack responded, “So one thing I would expect to do is to reach out to the Commerce Department to determine whether or not there was anything that can be done that would put us in a more competitive circumstance and ensure the supply of fertilizer throughout the U.S.  I also think it's important for the Department of Agriculture when faced with circumstances where, for whatever reason, a rule or regulation is impacting and affecting folks out on the farm, looking for ways in which we can utilize the tools of the USDA to provide some kind of transition assistance or provide some kind of way of mitigating the impact and effect.”###

WICKER, HYDE-SMITH ASK DOD TO COMMIT TO NAVY SHIPBUILDING REQUIREMENTSFive Senators Sign Letter Saying ‘The U.S. Navy Must be Prepared to Compete’ to Counter Chinese Shipbuilding Growth WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) on Thursday signed a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks requesting a commitment to the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding requirements to ensure America stands ready to deter Chinese provocations and to safeguard the future of freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region.Wicker and Hyde-Smith joined U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in sending the letter.“According to the Department of Defense’s 2020 annual report to Congress, Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China, ‘China has already achieved parity with—or even exceeded—the United States in several military modernization areas, including shipbuilding… [t]he PRC has the largest navy in the world, with an overall battle force of approximately 350 ships and submarines including over 130 major surface combatants,’” the lawmakers wrote.  “The U.S. Navy must be prepared to compete, or we will face a future in which the seas are dominated by China.” “In your respective hearings with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, concerns regarding the Navy’s ability to modernize and produce more ships were answered with a promise to review the situation, but no substantial commitments were made,” the lawmakers continued.  “As such, we request a formal response from the Defense Department which unequivocally commits to the requirements outlined in the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding plan.  This is crucial to America’s national security.” The full text of the letter is below. Dear Secretary Austin and Deputy Secretary Hicks:We write to express deep concern about the uncertainty surrounding this administration’s commitment to the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding requirements and America’s overall ability to project power throughout the world. According to the Department of Defense’s 2020 annual report to Congress, Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China, “China has already achieved parity with—or even exceeded—the United States in several military modernization areas, including shipbuilding… [t]he PRC has the largest navy in the world, with an overall battle force of approximately 350 ships and submarines including over 130 major surface combatants.”  The report goes on to say that, “China is the top ship-producing nation in the world by tonnage and is increasing its shipbuilding capacity and capability for all naval classes.”  In Deputy Secretary Hicks’ Senate confirmation hearing, she described China as the “measuring stick” by which America must gauge its own capabilities.  The U.S. Navy must be prepared to compete, or we will face a future in which the seas are dominated by China. Even more alarming are the predictions within the 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission, to which Deputy Secretary Hicks contributed.  Within this document, the commission predicts a bleak future in which the People’s Liberation Army Navy intimidates America and its allies through sea dominance, which results in China overwhelming Taiwan or denying America and its allies access to the South China Sea.  The U.S. Navy has answered these predictions and responded to other national strategic documents by proposing an increase in ship numbers and capabilities in their report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels.  If implemented, this plan would increase America’s ability to counter and deter Chinese influence abroad, and increase protection for American interests overseas and at home.  In your respective hearings with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, concerns regarding the Navy’s ability to modernize and produce more ships were answered with a promise to review the situation, but no substantial commitments were made.  As such, we request a formal response from the Defense Department which unequivocally commits to the requirements outlined in the U.S. Navy’s shipbuilding plan.  This is crucial to America’s national security. We look forward to your prompt response.###

HYDE-SMITH OPPOSES HHS NOMINEE XAVIER BECERRASlams Nominee’s Healthcare Experience as Limited to “Filing Lawsuits to Go Against Anything That is Pro-Life”VIDEO:  Senator Hyde-Smith Speaks Against Confirmation of HHS Nominee.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today expressed strong opposition to the confirmation of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, joined colleagues at a news conference Thursday to discuss Becerra’s nomination.“This nomination certainly, certainly concerns me, not only as a mother, not only as a woman, but as a legislator who has worked very hard through this COVID pandemic.  To think we have a nominee from President Biden that has zero experience in any healthcare field,” Hyde-Smith said.  “His experience is filing lawsuits to go against anything that is pro-life.  And as the AG in California, he used that position to do that there.  He will use it here.”“It is still pretty incredible that his name was put up.  I do not know him personally, but I certainly know his record.  His record scares the American people.  I know it scares the people in Mississippi.  It’s such proof that this is definitely not the person that we need heading this agency,” she said.Hyde-Smith is among the lawmakers who are critical of Becerra, who testified earlier this week at confirmation hearings conducted by the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Becerra, who has no particular experience or expertise in health, does have an extensive pro-abortion record as attorney general and former member of Congress.  In fighting pro-life causes, he has championed positions challenged in the courts for conflicting with religious liberties.###

HYDE-SMITH RENEWS EFFORT TO PROTECT PRO-LIFE HEALTHCARE WORKERS FROM DISCRIMINATIONWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today renewed her support for legislation to protect all healthcare providers from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions.Hyde-Smith is an original cosponsor of the Conscience Protection Act of 2021, which provides a private right of action for pro-life victims of discrimination.  She cosponsored the same measure introduced previously by U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.).“Religious liberty cannot be suspended if one’s workplace has misguided policies regarding abortion,” Hyde-Smith said.  “Congress must act to provide legal protection for pro-life healthcare workers, who shouldn’t be penalized for refusing to participate in abortions.”Congress has enacted multiple laws to protect conscience rights for individuals who have religious or moral objections to abortions.  However, courts have so far declined to find these laws to provide a “private right of action,” which leaves victims of discrimination unable to defend their conscience rights in court.The Lankford measure (S.401) would allow healthcare providers, such as doctors and nurses, to pursue legal action if they are coerced into participating in abortions or if they face discrimination at work for refusing to perform abortions.  It would also prohibit federal, state and local governments that receive federal funds from discriminating against those who decline to take part in abortion or abortion coverage.Hyde-Smith is among 78 lawmakers who filed an amicus brief to New York v. HHS, a pending case on former President Trump’s “Protecting Statutory Conscience Rights In Health Care” rule to enforce existing statutory protections for healthcare providers’ conscience rights.The Christian Medical & Dental Associations, Concerned Women for America, Ethics and Public Policy Center, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Family Research Council, Freedom2Care, Heritage Action, March for Life, National Right to Life, Susan B. Anthony List, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops support this legislation.###

HYDE-SMITH QUESTIONS INTERIOR NOMINEE ON MISS. JOB LOSSES IF OIL & GAS LEASE BAN LASTSVIDEO: Hyde-Smith Questions Interior Secretary nominee, New Mexico Rep. Debra Haaland.WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today indicated she wants more assurances from the Secretary of the Interior nominee that job protection and the economy will be given greater weight as the Biden administration works to curtail fossil fuel production.Hyde-Smith serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which opened confirmation proceedings for U.S. Representative Debra Haaland (D-N.M.) to lead the Department of the Interior.  Haaland’s confirmation hearing will continue Wednesday.“I recognize the historic nature of Representative Haaland’s nomination and her life story.  However, I need greater assurances that jobs and the economy will be given greater priority as public lands and energy policies are developed and implemented,” Hyde-Smith said.“The casualness of President Biden’s ban on new energy leases and cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline, with associated job losses, signal a troubling approach to terminating livelihoods today for the promise of future climate-related work,” she said.At the confirmation hearing, Hyde-Smith focused her questions to Haaland on job losses and economic harm linked to executive orders issued by Biden from his first day in office.  In addition, Haaland is on record as stating, “I pledge to vote against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, and to fight instead for 100 percent clean energy.”Hyde-Smith asked, “By halting this production of essential fossil fuels, Mississippi jobs alone would be just decimated, leaving families without a source of income during an already troubling time, economically.  Halting offshore energy production would also deny my state resources that are now dedicated to conservation and other very good works.  Frankly, your positions on energy are alarming to Mississippians.  What do you recommend I tell my constituents, to assure them that their livelihoods are secure?”In response, Haaland committed “I will listen to you… I will take into consideration your issues,” while pointing out that the ban on new federal oil and gas leases are temporary and that existing leases remain operational.“I feel like, in the short term, hopefully their jobs have not been affected,” Haaland told Hyde-Smith.Hyde-Smith pointed to a 2020 analysis which concluded that banning federal leasing would result in nearly 14,000 Mississippi jobs lost in the first 12-24 months, a 44 percent decrease in offshore oil production and a 68 percent natural gas decline by 2030.  A federal leasing ban would also pose significant loss of revenue to the state of Mississippi.Due to Biden’s Executive Order 14008 “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on February 12 announced the rescinding of the Record of Decision for the Gulf of Mexico Oil and Gas Lease Sale 257.  The decision pauses planning for the proposed sale, which was expected to occur this March.The Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf contains an estimated 48 billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and 141 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered technically recoverable gas.###

We believe in the value of every child.  Each precious child should be honored by our nation and protected by our laws.
 
The Hyde Amendment is the law of the land, as has been so since 1976.  The Hyde Amendment has enjoyed decades of bipartisan support, including from then-Senator Joe Biden, and has been signed into law by Democrat and Republican Presidents alike.  We are deeply opposed to efforts to allow taxpayer funding of abortion on demand and eliminate this more than four-decade-old consensus.  Instead, we urge you to allow the Senate to continue its long tradition of bipartisan cooperation in enacting annual appropriations, as well as other health-related spending, with longstanding pro-life protections intact.
 
Abortion is not health care; rather, it is a brutal procedure that destroys the life of an innocent unborn child.  The Hyde Amendment reflects a consensus that millions of pro-life Americans who are profoundly opposed to abortion should not be coerced into paying for it or incentivizing it with their taxpayer dollars.  A substantial majority of the American public agrees.  A 2021 Marist poll found that nearly six in ten Americans, including even more than a third of those who identify as pro-choice, oppose the use of their taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions.  Most importantly, the Hyde Amendment saves lives.  Analysis by the Charlotte Lozier Institute estimates that over 2.4 million Americans owe their lives to the Hyde Amendment, and it routinely saves more than 60,000 lives every year.
 
In addition to preserving the Hyde Amendment’s inclusion in the annual Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, it is equally important that the Senate maintain all other longstanding pro-life protections in Federal law.  These include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on funding for abortion and abortion coverage for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as well as foreign aid due to the Helms Amendment.  Other longstanding pro-life provisions prevent the District of Columbia from funding elective abortions, prohibit the destruction of human embryos in federally funded research, prohibit funding for abortion-related lobbying overseas, as well as protect the conscience rights of Americans opposed to abortion. 
 
We are united in our resolve to guard against any changes to Federal law that would unsettle nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus against taxpayer funding for abortion on demand, or otherwise threaten the lives of unborn children.  Accordingly, we are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.###

HYDE-SMITH VOTES AGAINST NEARLY $2 TRILLION DEMOCRAT BUDGET FRAMEWORKMiss. Senator Says Measure Veiled as COVID-19 Relief, But Really a Backdoor Scheme for Big GovernmentWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) early Friday morning voted against a Senate Democrat budget resolution that she criticized as a backdoor scheme for liberal big government spending.The Senate approved the FY2021 Budget Resolution (S.Con.Res.5) on a strictly party-line vote (51-50), signaling a sharp turn away from bipartisan agreements to deliver COVID-19 resources to families, the jobless, small businesses, and the healthcare sector.  The budget framework outlines $1.9 trillion in spending and tax provisions under filibuster-exempt instructions that could allow, among other things, nearly doubling the federal minimum wage.“Veiled under the guise of COVID-19 relief, this budget resolution is really a backdoor scheme to rush through Congress a big government wish list that has little to do with defeating the coronavirus.  It is yet another signal since the inauguration that pledges of unity and bipartisan working relations continue to ring hollow,” Hyde-Smith said.“I am not opposed to additional targeted funding to help overcome our national health emergency and rebuild the economy.  A lot of the money already provided by Congress still isn’t even out the door, which calls into question the rush to spend nearly $2 trillion more now,” she said.Hyde-Smith pointed out that only about half the money for testing and a third of the funds available for vaccine distribution from the December COVID-19 relief package have been obligated.  Furthermore, since the start of the pandemic last year, Congress has provided almost $68 billion to support K-12 education and reopen schools, but only $4 billion has been spent.  (Backgrounder.)The Mississippi Senator was also critical of the filibuster-exempt reconciliation instructions in S.Con.Res.5, which could allow Democrats to set a $15 federal minimum wage.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates this action would eliminate 1.3 million jobs.“It’s hard to understand how anyone believes that in an economic downturn, the best thing to do is place new burdens on small businesses and accelerate job losses,” said Hyde-Smith, who voted for a Republican amendment to prohibit the increase of the federal minimum wage during a global pandemic.The Senate-passed FY21 Budget Resolution must be reconciled with a House-passed measure before it can be finalized and then carried out by committees of jurisdiction.###
