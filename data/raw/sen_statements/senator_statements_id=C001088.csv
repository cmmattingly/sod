https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-celebrates-passage-of-resolution-recognizing-september-as-national-workforce-development-month,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) celebrated the passage of their Senate resolution recognizing September 2022 as National Workforce Development Month.“Delawareans up and down the state deserve quality, good-paying careers that utilize their skills and build on their interests. Thanks to concentrated efforts to prepare our kids for the workforce, Delaware’s high school students have the chance to earn early college credits, participate in a certificate program or an apprenticeship, and begin a pathway to a successful career,” said Senator Coons. “This month, let’s acknowledge the success of workforce development programs across the country and think of ways to continue to build up the next generation of workers.”“From clean energy and advanced manufacturing to sustainable agriculture and innovative technology, we need to ensure that the American workforce is ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century economy,” Senator Feinstein said. “Our resolution recognizes the vital role workforce development plays in growing America’s next generation of workers as well as supporting the advancement of current professionals looking for new employment opportunities.”“Americans know that, in order to compete on the global stage, we must train our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. By investing in workforce training, we are investing in ourselves,” said Senator Young. “This resolution highlights the importance of workforce development in providing a pathway to a meaningful career and a chance to live the American Dream.”“I’m proud to join this bipartisan effort to highlight the importance of investing in workforce development programs, apprenticeships, and career and technical education. We know that we can meet workforce readiness challenges effectively if we support students, workers, and businesses and have strong public-private partnerships at the local level that are backed by a Congress working across party lines. This bipartisan resolution shows our commitment to being a federal partner to help make sure our workforce is better equipped for high-skilled, good paying jobs that will help raise incomes for workers and boost economic growth for businesses,” Senator Baldwin said.In addition to Coons, Feinstein, Young, Baldwin, and Scott, the resolution is also cosponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.).Full text of the resolution is available here and below: ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-coons-marshall-introduce-the-supporting-small-business-career-and-technical-education-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) introduced the Supporting Small Business Career and Technical Education Act, important legislation that helps small businesses hire new employees and supports aspiring entrepreneurs. The bill directs Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and Women Business Centers (WBCs) to assist small businesses in hiring graduates of career and technical education (CTE) programs – sometimes called vocational education programs.“Delaware small businesses, whether they’re in health care, construction, or engineering, are hungry to hire workers with specialized skills. The Supporting Small Business Career and Technical Education Act will help bridge the gap between these businesses and the students at career and technical education institutes, who are training to fill those good-paying jobs, get the opportunities they deserve,” said Senator Coons. “I’m proud to work with my colleague from across the aisle to ensure Delawareans and workers across the nation can make the most of their careers.”“I managed Great Bend Regional Hospital for many years. I understand how challenging it is to have enough employees on your team to keep up with demand. We often hear how our big cities and small towns alike struggle with access to essential trade services, and part of the problem is there aren’t enough people with the skills to provide those services,” said Senator Marshall. “Senator Coons and I are offering a bipartisan solution with this bill that helps CTE graduates get jobs with small businesses in areas where their trade skills are needed and, if a community does not have a business that offers a certain trade, our bill assists CTE graduates with starting their own.”The Supporting Small Business Career and Technical Education Act introduced by Senators Coons and Marshall is the Senate companion to legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Marie Newman (Ill.-03) and Congressman Roger Williams (Texas-25).“Small businesses are the lifeblood of so many of our communities – from Illinois to Kansas and Delaware. Many are looking for workers to help run and expand their businesses. The Small Business Career and Technical Education Act will help provide resources to help skills-trained workers and students find jobs or start businesses of their own,” said Congresswoman Newman. “I am proud to have worked with Congressman Williams to pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation in the House earlier this year and thankful to Senators Coons and Marshall for their efforts in the Senate. Now, let’s get this bill to the president’s desk so we can continue building on our economic recovery, put people back to work, and strengthen our nation’s small businesses.”“I am proud to see Senator Coons and Senator Marshall introduce the Senate Companion to the Supporting Small Business and Career and Technical Education Act,” said Congressman Williams. “Skilled workers make extraordinary contributions to the economy and provide critical services that Americans depend on every day. This bill will encourage more young people to pursue valuable CTE professions and assist graduates in translating their skills into their own small businesses one day. I look forward to working with the two Senators to get this bill to the President’s desk to become law.”You may click here to read the full text of the Supporting Small Business Career and Technical Education Act. Shortages in skilled trade labor are causing an employment gap in many industries. For example, the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates there were 393,000 unfilled positions in construction in July 2022, a 7.9% year-on-year increase. These unfilled jobs include electricians, carpenters, plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters. Adding to the problem, 41% of the workforce in this industry is expected to retire by 2031, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. Labor shortages in these fields are common across the United States, and cause delays in the completion of projects on large commercial buildings, small business improvements, and residential projects.###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-sen-coons-and-rep-david-price-publish-op-ed-in-foreign-policy-after-travel-to-tunisia,"Washington – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) and U.S. Representative David Price (N.C.-04) published an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine following congressional travel to Tunisia last month. In the piece, they offer takeaways from their visit, including meetings with civil society leaders and President Kais Saied, and a path for strengthening Tunisia’s economy and democracy.  Foreign Policy magazine: How Tunisia Can Save Its Economy By Chris Coons, a U.S. senator from Delaware and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and David Price, a U.S. representative from North Carolina.September 26, 2022In December 2010 and January 2011, the Tunisian people inspired the world during a 28-day pro-democracy uprising known as the Jasmine Revolution, which deposed longtime dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The Jasmine Revolution is widely seen as having catalyzed the broader Arab Spring, and for years thereafter, Tunisia stood out as the sole democratic success story to come out of that tumult. The country adopted a progressive and inclusive constitution and then held free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections in 2014 and 2019. In 2015, Tunisia’s four leading civil society groups won a Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in securing this new constitutional order.Tunisia’s good news story has since lost its sheen. Just over a decade after the Jasmine Revolution, democracy in the country is struggling to survive. In a series of brazen moves over the past year, Tunisian President Kais Saied—who was democratically elected in 2019—has dismissed parliament; transferred its powers to himself, assuming full executive authority; dissolved a top judicial body that served as a watchdog; and stacked the country’s electoral commission with loyalists. Initially, Tunisians largely backed Saied’s moves. The president claimed he was trying to fix a paralyzed system and, when pressed by critics, pointed to pending electoral reforms and scheduled parliamentary elections in December of this year.Last month, we led a bipartisan, bicameral U.S. congressional delegation to Tunis, Tunisia’s capital, to see where the country goes from here. We met civil society leaders who conveyed deep frustration over years of political gridlock and corruption in their country. After a decade of democracy, Tunisians’ core demands of “jobs, freedom, and dignity”—a rallying cry of the Jasmine Revolution—have still not been met. Instead, rising unemployment, falling living standards, and food and fuel shortages have undermined public faith in democratic institutions and left many Tunisians desperately seeking a different path forward. In this context, it is easy to understand their support for Saied.Read more here ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-joins-colleagues-to-introduce-bill-to-ban-us-recognition-of-any-ukrainian-territory-annexed-by-russia,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) joined colleagues to introduce the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act, legislation that would bolster support for Ukraine and defend against efforts to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory. The bill would require the United States government to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine. Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.“Russia’s plan for a referendum in occupied parts of Ukraine is an undisguised attempt to annex territory in Ukraine and change the narrative of this war to distract from the fact that Putin’s illegal and unjustified invasion is failing,” said Senator Coons. “The American people stand with Ukraine, and our government will never recognize these territories for anything other than what they are: part of a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.”“There is no amount of propaganda or political scheming that can change the reality of what is happening in Ukraine,” said Senator Rubio. “Vladimir Putin is the real aggressor in this war, and he is attempting an unjustified takeover of a sovereign, democratic country. The United States cannot recognize Putin’s claims or we risk establishing a dangerous precedent for other authoritarian regimes, like the Chinese Communist Party, to imitate.”“Putin’s threatened sham referendums reek of desperation,” said Senator Durbin. “The world knows the war in Ukraine is a disaster and increasingly so to the Russian people, who are tired of their kids dying over Putin’s warped nostalgia for Soviet dystopia. Today’s bill reaffirms our commitment to the Ukrainian people and that the United States will never recognize sovereign Ukrainian territories as part of Russia.”Vladimir Putin announced plans to hold referendums in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine with the goal of annexing these regions into the Russian Federation. Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.The bill was introduced by Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). In addition to Senator Coons, Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Cardin (Md.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) are cosponsors of the legislation.  ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-introduces-bipartisan-legislation-to-improve-fbi-child-victim-protocols,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) yesterday introduced the Respect for Child Survivors Act, which would improve the treatment of FBI child victims and witnesses by requiring trauma-informed experts to be a part of any interview of a victim who reports child abuse or trafficking to the FBI. Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “We must provide investigators of child abuse and sexual exploitation with the tools and training to interact sensitively with survivors and witnesses,” said Senator Coons. “We’ve seen the tragic consequences of mishandled victim interviews that can resurface the trauma of abuse for survivors of these crimes. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation requires the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams of trained professionals in the course of such investigations to ensure the pursuit of justice does not inadvertently cause more harm to the very people the system is trying to protect.”“It takes tremendous courage for young victims of sexual assault to tell their story and overcome the fear that they may not be taken seriously, may be ignored, or may be wrongfully blamed,” said Senator Cornyn. “To avoid re-traumatizing victims during the investigation process, it’s imperative we give these individuals the support they need to ensure survivors feel respected during the interview process and abusers are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”“I applaud Senator Cornyn’s leadership on this issue to correct an egregious wrong committed by certain FBI agents regarding their treatment of victims of sexual abuse,” said Senator Graham. “Requiring the FBI to use appropriate, tried and true methods to interview child victims will help ensure the FBI’s failure in the Nassar case doesn’t happen again. This legislation will make it clear that we expect better.”“As we work to support survivors of child sexual abuse and trafficking, we need to provide law enforcement with the training and skills they need to investigate these crimes and help victims,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Our bipartisan legislation will ensure law enforcement officers can partner with child advocacy centers to use the most effective techniques when conducting these critical investigations.” Background: During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing examining the Inspector General’s report on the FBI’s handling of the Larry Nassar investigation last year, retired gymnast and survivor McKayla Maroney shared striking testimony about how she was treated by the FBI personnel who interviewed her. This legislation was formulated with input from child welfare groups to address the mistreatment of witnesses like Maroney and others described during that hearing.Under this legislation, victims would be interviewed by those with the expertise to appropriately address and treat their trauma. This bill would require the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams when investigating child sexual abuse cases, child sexual abuse material cases, and child trafficking cases, including in situations where the interviewed victim is no longer a child. These multidisciplinary teams would be composed of appropriate investigative personnel, mental health professionals, medical personnel, family advocacy case workers, child advocacy center personnel, and prosecutors. Members of these teams have expertise in their field, can provide trauma-informed care, and are required to stay current on industry training. The use of multidisciplinary teams is proven to prevent retraumatizing victims, and the information-sharing and case review provisions would ensure accountability so cases are not dropped or forgotten in the future. Investigations would be reviewed by a multidisciplinary team at regularly scheduled times to share information about case progress, address any investigative or prosecutorial barriers, and ensure victims receive support and needed treatment.The bill encourages the FBI to work with multidisciplinary teams at existing Children’s Advocacy Centers, which are funded and authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act (VOCAA). Senator Coons has worked twice to successfully lead the reauthorization of this critical VOCAA funding, and he has recently introduced a bill to further extend VOCAA programs through fiscal year 2028.The Respect for Child Survivors Act is supported by the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network; the National District Attorneys Association; Army of Survivors; and the National Children’s Alliance. ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-sen-coons-delivers-floor-speech-on-kigali-amendment-ukraine-and-the-disclose-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) delivered a speech on the Senate floor yesterday to highlight the Kigali Amendment, press for continued support for the Ukrainian people as they repel Russia’s invasion, and decry obstruction of the DISCLOSE Act.“Mr. President, I rise to address three different topics, if I might. First, this week, the Senate of the United States did something important – something that is genuinely a big deal: We ratified a treaty. This is something we don’t do often enough, and it bears repeating what this Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol is. By a vote of 69 to 27, a big bipartisan vote,” said Senator Coons. He continued, “The projections are there’ll be as many as 33,000 new manufacturing jobs in the United States, some in my home state of Delaware, but spread across the country, over a billion dollars in new exports that will impact just this year, the American economy, because of this, and a 25% increase in the exports of American-made refrigerators and air conditioners and so forth. This was a rare moment of bipartisan consensus, where we were able to come together and address a global challenge and create more opportunity here at home. And I thought it bore some celebration as we conclude this week.”On September 22, Senator Coons – who co-Chairs the Climate Solutions Caucus – voted to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which passed the Senate by a vote of 69-27. On August 4, Senator Coons, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voted to ratify the treaty to add Sweden and Finland to NATO, which passed the Senate by a vote of 95-1. Yesterday, Senator Coons voted to invoke cloture on the DISCLOSE Act to combat anonymous special interest spending in American politics, which he has also cosponsored.Full audio and video available here. A transcript is provided below.Senator Coons: Mr. President, I rise to address three different topics, if I might. First, this week, the Senate of the United States did something important – something that is genuinely a big deal: We ratified a treaty. This is something we don’t do often enough, and it bears repeating what this Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is. By a vote of 69 to 27, a big bipartisan vote, this Senate ratified a treaty that will reduce global warming by a full degree Fahrenheit, something critical to the future of the planet, and will do it in a way that is a win for American manufacturing, a win for American exports, and a win for our planet and creation. Some of you may remember a long time ago, we discovered a problem, a growing hole in the ozone layer that was being caused by propellants, by CFCs, and so the world came together to eliminate CFCs and replace them with a new generation of artificial propellants and refrigerants known as HFCs. That was good news.The hole in the ozone layer has largely been addressed and the threat of skin cancer and being bombarded by radiation that that post largely resolved. Yet this next generation of chemicals, HFCs, had an unexpected additional problem. They are a thousand times worse for global warming, for climate change, than carbon dioxide. So much so, and they are so broadly used in every industrial setting, that it’s led to a rapid increase in global warming. Well, the solution was actually invented in Delaware. It’s a next generation of chemicals that are much less harmful to the climate and to the environment, effective as refrigerants being manufactured now in places across the United States, and that, if exported to the rest of the world, can grow thousands of manufacturing jobs. I just wanted to take a moment and celebrate.The projections are there’ll be as many as 33,000 new manufacturing jobs in the United States – some in my home state of Delaware – but spread across the country, over a billion dollars in new exports that will impact, just this year, the American economy because of this, and a 25% increase in the exports of American-made refrigerators and air conditioners and so forth. This was a rare moment of bipartisan consensus, where we were able to come together and address a global challenge and create more opportunity here at home. I thought it bore some celebration as we conclude this week.Mr. President, earlier this week, our President, Joe Biden, stood before the world at the United Nations General Assembly and continued his forceful, clear, and strong efforts to call on the world to enforce the U.N. Charter and to push back on Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.Since February, when Putin’s forces swept into Ukraine and threatened to overrun the entire country, the West has pulled together, and allies and supporters of the Ukrainian people from around the world have imposed sanctions on Russia and Russian oligarchs, have provided funding and support and assistance to millions of Ukrainian refugees that have flooded throughout the rest of the world, and, critically, have provided financial support for the men and women of the Ukrainian armed forces, who just in recent days made a dramatic breakout in northern Ukraine, recapturing an area the size of Delaware — more than 3,000 square miles — in a rapid advance east of Kharkiv. President Biden has asked this body – in a bill we will take up in just a few days – to provide $11.7 billion in additional support for Ukraine. Mr. President, you and I are appropriators. We know how precious the resources of the American people are, and I am grateful that on a broad bipartisan basis, we have provided tens of billions of dollars in humanitarian relief for refugees, in support for the government of Ukraine, and in critically needed military support for the Ukrainian armed forces. It is because the Biden administration has delivered the most advanced and targeted long-range artillery systems we have, called HIMARS, that suddenly the Ukrainians are making real advances on the battlefield. We must continue this critical support. President Zelenskyy has pulled together and mobilized the Ukrainian people in a remarkable show of determination. A fierce resistance; despite being badly outnumbered by a much greater military force with advanced and sophisticated weaponry, the Ukrainians have fought bravely and with enormous determination. They deserve our continued support.In just recent weeks, there have been some real signs of progress in opening the Black Sea ports of Ukraine so that grain can be exported to a dozen hungry countries, in making progress on prisoner-of-war exchanges between the Russians and the Ukrainians, and in protests in Russia. In an act of desperation, President Putin has called up hundreds of thousands of reservists in a mobilization to try and push back against Ukrainian forces. Russia is losing this fight. They’re losing on the ground in Ukraine. They’re losing in the court of public opinion, and they’re losing strategically.My entire life, we had thought it was unlikely that Sweden or Finland would ever join NATO, the most successful multilateral security arrangement we’ve ever engaged in as a nation, but because of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine now, both Sweden and Finland are seeking admission to NATO. This body acted quickly to ratify their admission to NATO – we are down to just a few countries – and in New York, I had a chance to meet with President Erdogan of Turkey, to convey to him both our appreciation of his help in getting the grain out of the Black Sea ports of Ukraine, but the urgency of expanding NATO to secure it against further Russian aggression. It’s my hope that we will move quickly as a united NATO alliance, and that we here in this body will act quickly to provide the additional assistance to the Ukrainian people, government, and armed forces, that our president has sought.Mr. President, earlier today, we took up a vote on the DISCLOSE Act. Since 2010, when the Supreme Court of the United States issued an ill-conceived opinion in the case of Citizens United, we have seen a flood of dark money steadily become more and more pernicious in its impact on our politics and our policies here in Washington and now around the country. Wealthy individuals and corporations and shadowy special interest groups have contributed hundreds of millions – now billions – of dollars, across several election cycles that have undermined the integrity and fairness of our elections that are at the very heart of our democracy.This bill would do a simple thing: It would require full disclosure of all corporations, trade associations, and nonprofits engaging in electioneering. They would have to disclose any donors of $10,000 or more over any two-year period. It wouldn’t solve all the problems created by Citizens United, but sunshine is the best disinfectant, and it would allow the American people to know who is truly behind the dark-money-funded ads that now bombard citizens in competitive elections around our country.Tragically, it was a straight party-line vote today, and we were not able to proceed to take up and vote on the DISCLOSE Act. In the end, one party continues to defend the practice of dark money flooding our elections, while another is seeking to open up clarity for the general public and for our electorate, on who’s giving money to whom. We should have had a vote on the DISCLOSE Act. Instead, we failed to get to that bill, because we could not get in this chamber 60 votes to move ahead. Mr. President, it’s my hope that the American people are paying attention and realize on whose side we are in this fight over transparency in our elections. With that, Mr. President, I offer my thanks, and I yield the floor to my colleague from Michigan.” ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/carper-coons-decry-senate-failure-to-pass-disclose-act-to-increase-transparency-in-our-elections," WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-Del.) today voted in favor of passing the DISCLOSE Act, legislation to combat anonymous special interest spending in American politics. Both Carper and Coons are cosponsors of the legislation, which would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors and major sources of funding, allowing the American people to be more aware of who is attempting to influence public opinion and elections.“Dark money has left our democracy vulnerable to foreign interference and unfettered political spending by special interest groups for too long. I’m disappointed that my Republican colleagues in the Senate have once again blocked the DISCLOSE Act—a set of commonsense reforms to our campaign finance system that will shine a light on the millions of dollars secretly being poured into political campaigns each election cycle,” said Carper. “Despite today’s setback, I will continue to build support for passing the DISCLOSE Act to restore trust in our electoral process and ensure American voices are heard.” “We have seen a flood of dark money steadily become more and more pernicious in its impact on our politics and our policies, here in Washington and now around the country,” said Coons. “Wealthy individuals and corporations and shadowy special interest groups have contributed hundreds of millions, now billions of dollars, across several election cycles that have undermined the integrity and fairness of our elections that are at the very heart of our democracy. This bill would do a simple thing: require full disclosure of all corporations, trade associations, nonprofits, engaging in electioneering, of any donors of $10,000 or more over any two year period. It wouldn't solve all the problems created by Citizens United, but sunshine is the best disinfectant, and despite today’s vote, the fight for increased transparency continues.”Background: Special interest influence over elections is a major problem in America. Citizens United and subsequent Supreme Court rulings permit super PACs and certain types of tax-exempt groups, such as 501(c)(4) nonprofits, to spend unlimited sums in elections. Many of those groups are not required to disclose their donors, allowing corporations and individuals to spend unlimited, undisclosed – or “dark” – money without being tied to the television ads and other electioneering activity the groups carry out.  Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, election spending has exploded. Dark money in particular has skyrocketed, despite the Supreme Court, by an 8 to 1 margin in Citizens United, upholding disclosure requirements as a means for citizens and shareholders to hold elected officials and corporate spenders accountable. The DISCLOSE Act requires organizations spending money in elections – including super PACs and 501(c)(4) dark money groups – to promptly disclose donors who have given $10,000 or more during an election cycle. The DISCLOSE Act will be vital in helping Americans understand who is behind the massive uptick in dark-money and other special interest spending in recent years.  Dark money spending in our elections since Citizens United has now topped $1 billion, and the pace of spending by outside forces (i.e., not the candidates themselves) is accelerating.  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, outside spenders—super PACs, dark money groups, and political parties—spent $2.6 billion in federal elections during the 2020 election cycle; that is roughly twice what was spent in the last presidential cycle in 2016.   ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-legislation-to-address-global-malnutrition-passes-senate-heads-to-president-biden,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) celebrated the passage of his bipartisan bill to bolster federal efforts and increase coordination to address global malnutrition. The Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act, which will authorize the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to scale up programs and activities to prevent and treat malnutrition globally, passed the Senate last night on a voice vote. After previously passing the House on a strong bipartisan vote, the bill now heads to President Biden for his signature. In addition to Senator Coons, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS), U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and John Boozman (R-Ark.) also led the bill. The bill was led in the House of Representatives by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Ranking Member Mike McCaul (R-Texas).“The Senate’s passage of the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act demonstrates our bipartisan commitment to address malnutrition that leads to the suffering of millions of children across the globe,” said Senator Coons. “As the world recovers from COVID-19 and deals with escalating military conflicts, this bill will help the U.S. lead by example to improve the health of children, mothers, and families around the world. I am delighted that the Senate passed this bill unanimously and look forward to President Biden swiftly signing this bill into law.” “Malnutrition affects millions throughout the world, and it takes a heavy toll on children and expecting mothers,” Senator Wicker said. “The targeted reforms included in the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act will increase our ability to address this growing challenge and save lives.” “The pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine have exacerbated global food insecurity, and the United States’ leadership is crucial to the reduction of world hunger,” said Senator Kaine. “The Senate’s unanimous passage of our bipartisan Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act will help keep starvation at bay for children and families in need across the globe. I urge President Biden to sign this bill into law as quickly as possible.”“Passage of this legislation is an important and necessary step to fight global malnutrition and improve coordination with our partners around the world,” Senator Boozman said. “I urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law so we can get help to the children and families who need it most.”The Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act:The bill is endorsed by 1,000 Days, Action Against Hunger, Alliance to End Hunger, Bread for the World, CARE, Farm Journal Foundation, Food for the Hungry, Global Health Council, HarvestPlus, Hellen Keller International, InterAction, ONE Campaign, RESULTS, Save the Children, UNICEF USA, and World Vision US.The full text of the bill is available here."
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-celebrates-ratification-of-kigali-amendment-to-montreal-protocol,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, voted today to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The amendment phases down the use of powerful greenhouse gasses called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and aligns with existing bipartisan law.“It’s a great day for the planet, for American manufacturers, and for Delaware,” said Senator Coons. “Paring down hydrofluorocarbons is one of the single most impactful steps we can take. Not only will it help us avoid 0.5 degrees Celsius in warming, but it will also create thousands of new jobs in manufacturing the next generation of heating, ventilation, and refrigeration products – including in Delaware, where Chemours created a refrigerant with low global warming potential known as Opteon. I’m proud to see a vast majority of my colleagues support this effort to protect our planet and secure America’s place as a global leader in key manufacturing industries, and I’m grateful to Senators Carper and Kennedy for their leadership to get this done.” Earlier this year, Senator Coons led a letter with several fellow members of the Senate Climate Solutions Caucus to urge ratification of the Kigali Amendment. Today’s vote will safeguard U.S. export access in other countries that have ratified the Kigali Amendment and help ramp up U.S. production of alternatives to HFCs. It is estimated that implementation of the Kigali Amendment will add 33,000 new jobs and $1.2 billion in direct output to the U.S. economy, while also generating a 25 percent increase in exports of American-made refrigerators, air conditioners, and other products.###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/bill-from-senators-coons-rubio-reauthorizing-the-united-states-commission-on-international-religious-freedom-to-become-law,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) today praised the House of Representatives for passing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2022, which reauthorizes the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) through fiscal year 2024. The bill now heads to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.) are also original cosponsors.Created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the USCIRF is a bipartisan commission that monitors and reports on religious freedom internationally. The commission’s authorization would expire on September 30, 2022 unless reauthorized.“I’m proud to have worked to protect international religious freedom by passing the USCIRF reauthorization in the Senate on a bipartisan basis, and I’m glad that our House colleagues have finally passed and sent the bill to President Biden for his signature,” said Senator Coons. “Around the world, communities like the Rohingya in Burma, Christians in Nigeria, and Uyghurs in China face horrific attacks because they practice their human right to freedom of religion. The United States is built on the founding value of religious freedom, and we must continue to work with our international partners to ensure the global community enjoys the same opportunity to peacefully worship.”“I’m grateful the House has voted to reauthorize USCIRF’s mission and reaffirm the importance of religious freedom everywhere. USCIRF does phenomenal work defending this sacred right around the globe, but its authorization will expire in just a matter of days. President Biden must sign our bill immediately,” said Senator Rubio. “The House passage of our USCIRF reauthorization bill is an important step in ensuring the United States can properly promote religious freedom around the globe and investigate violations, including the persecution of Yazidis, Baha’is, Christians, and others in the Middle East, genocide of Uyghurs in China, and attacks on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. I hope the president will sign this legislation into law quickly,” said Senator Risch.“The United States has a long tradition of promoting religious freedom abroad, and this Commission is dedicated to advising Congress and the Executive Branch about how to successfully ensure religious freedom is protected and that religion is not exploited to justify human rights abuses. As the global refugee crisis worsens, the United States must do more to address the scourge of religious persecution, including holding perpetrators accountable and providing a safe haven to refugees. It’s heartening to see Congress come together on this pressing issue to ensure that the Commission can effectively fulfill its mission,” said Senator Durbin.“USCIRF does invaluable work to help our nation protect and promote the unalienable human right of religious freedom for all people of every faith around the world. I’m glad to see the House finally pass my bill to reauthorize this commission,” said Senator Lankford. "

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-senator-coons-chairs-judiciary-subcommittee-hearing-on-protecting-americans-private-information-from-hostile-foreign-powers,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, chaired a hearing focused on hostile foreign powers’ access to Americans’ data. Senator Coons welcomed leading researchers on cybersecurity policy and national security law to discuss the threat of foreign adversaries’ collection and use of American citizens’ data. The full hearing can be seen here.Senator Coons chaired this Subcommittee hearing a day after participating in the full Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to explore a whistleblower complaint that alleged foreign intelligence agencies target social media platforms to mine information from inside the companies.Video and transcript of Senator Coons’ opening remarks are available below:    WATCH HERE.Senator Coons: This hearing will come to order. I'd like to thank all of our witnesses for participating today and offer my apologies. The Foreign Relations Committee was engaged in a challenging and important markup of legislation relating to the State Department and to our policy regarding Taiwan, and I want to specifically thank Ranking Member Sasse and his staff for working with us on a constructive, consensual basis around putting together this hearing, the agenda, and the witnesses.This is a critical topic and I'm looking forward to a productive conversation today. We're going to explore how American citizens’ private personal data are being accessed, collected, and used by our foreign adversaries. We know that hostile foreign intelligence services continue to work to gather sensitive information about each and every one of us. They collect information about to whom we speak, the places we visit, the news we consume, the products we buy, and a great deal more, and they do this because the insights buried in that data can be used against us. It can be used to either pressure or blackmail people in positions of responsibility and power, and with access to critical national security information. It can be used to gain strategic insights into social or economic trends. It can be used to sharpen and refine misinformation or disinformation, campaigns that other nations have engaged in to sow discord and to weaken our democracy. There's no shortage of ways foreign adversaries can gather and compile this sensitive personal information.Yesterday, the full committee had a hearing with Twitter whistleblower, “Mudge,” Peiter Zatko, and he testified that foreign intelligence agencies have targeted social media platforms to mine information from inside those companies. Now, there's also been a public reporting about a steady stream of hacking and ransomware attacks. It seems we have heard over and over about wide-scale data breaches. We also know applications and software that are controlled by foreign nations presents its own risk with American users being directly targeted— providing their data to companies who are incorporated in or located in adversarial nations, and there's other sources of less prominent data leakage through a vast system of data brokers that buy and repackage and sell data from tens of millions of Americans and resell it to the highest bidder.We have very little insight into these transactions. Almost no understanding of how they are happening, who's on the receiving end, and no limitations in it. So, my view, in order to get our hands around this data flow to our adversaries, we have to understand its sources so we can move towards more appropriate controls, and we have to be clear-eyed about the scope and depth and reach of this problem and that no single solution will be readily available. We have to approach this holistically and not just simply as a nation playing whack-a-mole every time there is a new emergent app or device or avenue for data leakage. So, we also have to respect our core values, our democratic values, and make sure that we're serving our nation's competitive interests. So, Congress should consider how any proposed intervention will also impact fundamental freedoms: freedom of speech and association and the free flow of data that benefits our country and our companies.So, there's no shortage of potential solutions. I will discuss some of them today. I know the Ranking Member and his staff have been working on a proposal to assume our government doesn't enter into contracts jeopardizing U.S. citizens’ data. I look forward to working with him on that proposal and to find other paths towards some common regulatory proposal. We've assembled an all-star panel of witnesses with a wide range of views today, and I'm grateful for Senator Sasse’s close cooperation in getting this hearing moving forward, and I'll now defer to my Ranking Member.” ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-senator-coons-questions-twitter-whistleblower-about-social-media-security-failures-at-judiciary-committee,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) questioned data security expert and former head of security at Twitter, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, at a full Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to assess allegations of widespread security failures at Twitter. Senator Coons questioned Zatko on his disclosures about Twitter’s security vulnerabilities, foreign infiltration, and misrepresentations to regulatory agencies. Senator Coons also highlighted his bill, the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, which would provide researchers with access to internal platform data to conduct research on the impact that major social media platforms have on our lives. Senator Coons is the Chairman of the Committee’s Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, and he will hold a subcommittee hearing tomorrow on protecting Americans’ private data and information from hostile foreign powers.Video and transcript of Senator Coons’ opening remarks and questioning is available below:    WATCH HERE.Senator Coons: Thank you Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley. And thank you, Mr. Zatko, thank you Mudge, for coming forward. This is yet another eye-opening moment for our public, for our nation, and for this committee. We know that social media and new communications technologies have empowered people across the world to connect and share information at an unprecedented scale, but we also know that concentrating all this information, all these resources, in just a few hands, comes with great risks. So your whistleblower complaint contains really striking allegations, which shed light on several key realities, and I wanted to focus on those. The first, as you’ve stated in a number of exchanges with my colleagues, is that the public lacks any credible way to assess whether and how major platforms and technology companies are protecting or prioritizing user privacy. And I want to talk for a bit about a bill that I’ve got, that Senator Klobuchar also mentioned, that would help strengthen some of that transparency. And then the second, which I'll get to later, is that these platforms are a target for foreign actors, something where a subcommittee I chair is having a dedicated hearing tomorrow afternoon. You commissioned an independent report regarding Twitter’s platform integrity, and their ability to combat misinformation, disinformation, and that report found, and I’m quoting, “Twitter’s consistently behind the curve in acting against disinformation and misinformation threats, and that Twitter doesn’t have the ability to measure the impact of its work to protect site integrity.” What I’ve concluded from your testimony today is that Twitter lacked the ability to measure the effects of interventions it implemented because of decisions by management and because of the lack of a credible regulatory oversight agency and penalties. Is that correct? Do I understand your testimony correctly?Mudge: Yes, sir. The inability internally came from 10 years of security and engineering debt that just kept accruing.Senator Coons: Your complaint also details how Twitter’s executive team was concerned that the report that you’ve commissioned would be damaging if it got out and that they worked to intentionally remove or modify information that might be especially embarrassing for Twitter. Is that correct?Mudge: Yes, sir. I found that very disturbing. The company that I hired with the knowledge of the other executives and the head of site integrity, which did not report to me, that this independent organization was going to analyze and do gap analysis. The company reached out to me and said, “Hey, Mudge, Twitter is jumping in and making us open a separate contract, and telling us not to provide you the results to your own work. This does not feel right to us. What’s going on?""Senator Coons: So, a lot of the information that both regulators and Congress relies on when considering how to regulate social media companies comes from the companies themselves;as I think you’ve put it before, they're essentially grading their own homework. So the conclusion we ought to reach is the information we receive isn’t trustworthy from some social media platforms?Mudge: Yes. sir. That’s what I experienced.Senator Coons: So, I’ve released a bill with Senator Portman. Senator Klobuchar referenced it earlier; we are looking for additional Republican co-sponsors. It’s called the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act; it would allow external researchers to look at exactly these kinds of problems to better understand and analyze the algorithms that drive social media and some of their practices. Would empowering researchers and mandating better disclosure help hold companies more accountable and cause them to invest more resources in site integrity?Mudge: Yes, sir. In fact, I think one of the things that we learned from that study, and what I am hopefully shedding light on in my lawful disclosures, is just how much of a gap there is between Twitter and some of Twitter’s peers, and even learning that sort of discrepancy would help understand and raise the level of hygiene for these organizations in their ability to perform their tasks, and the ability for us to accept what they’re saying as to whether it could possibly be true or not.Senator Coons: This also opens up enormous national security risks. As you testified earlier, there’s roughly half of Twitter’s employees that had unnecessary access to vast amounts of sensitive user data. As Senator Kennedy was asking you earlier, [you] just gave us a quick sense of what information Twitter might have about Senator Grassley, or about any of us on this committee. It is deeper and broader, and I suspect if you’d gone further, it then unlocks a whole profile that can give really dramatic insight into members of law enforcement, members of the military, Members of Congress and their families, their travel, their preferences, their actions, their consumer activities, and all of that has some real consequences. You wrote in your complaint, the Indian government “forced” Twitter to hire Indian government agents, who then had direct and unsupervised access to data and a former Twitter employee was convicted last August of working as an agent of the Saudi kingdom. How common do you think it is for foreign entities, for hostile agencies, to successfully install sympathetic actors at Twitter, and why might they do so?Mudge: Well, there’s any number of reasons, you know, there are many reasons why you would do so. In particular, not just to identify people of interest or track groups of interest, but also to maybe look at whether or not Twitter has identified your agents or your information operations — what other governments has Twitter possibly identified. And remember, you know, outside of the ability to access large amounts of data on the engineering side, you would want to know what Twitter’s plan is, as far as whether they will cede to your demands for control of information within their environments or not, in order to change different types of political pressures such as strong arming, and as we saw, that that country was even threatening to put Twitter employees in jail if Twitter didn’t change particular activities on the platform.Senator Coons: With 80% of Twitter’s users outside the United States and with Twitter having a deep access and resources to critical leaders in our country and other countries, I think this is genuinely concerning. Tomorrow afternoon, the subcommittee I chair, the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, Senator Sasse and I will be holding a hearing on how to further understand the depth to which hostile actors and adversaries are going to obtain American citizens’ data and that’ll expand on a lot of the topics we’ve pursued today. I hope members of the committee will attend. I want to thank you for your testimony, and Mr. Chairman, for the chance to participate in today’s hearing. ###"

The resolution pays tribute to the Queen’s historic legacy and her 70-year reign, expresses condolences to her family as well as the citizens of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and reaffirms U.S. commitment to its close alliance with the United Kingdom. “Queen Elizabeth II’s reign as monarch – the longest ever in British history – oversaw profound changes in British society and around the world. She was an experienced stateswoman who understood the importance of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States and deepened those ties based on our shared history and values throughout her 70 years on the throne,” said Senator Coons. “I extend my sympathies to the members of the Royal Family, and all of the British people, on the passing of their sovereign. Her grace will be missed in the United Kingdom and across the world.”“I remember watching Queen Elizabeth’s coronation as a child as the world bore witness to a 25-year old woman inheriting the colossal responsibility of providing strength and fortitude to her country in the shadow of World War II. She shouldered that responsibility with a unique balance of tenacity and grace for more than seventy years,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we look back at her historic reign, the U.S. Senate offers this resolution to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her legacy that is etched into our collective global history. She was a steadfast leader to the people of the United Kingdom during the most tumultuous of times, from wars to humanitarian crises, economic turmoil and much more. She advised fifteen Prime Ministers and participated in diplomatic activities with countless representatives around the world. And throughout her reign, she furthered the close and important U.S.-U.K. relationship, which continues to be pivotal today as we face down global security challenges together, as partners. Our resolution pays homage to her service to the U.K. and the global community that she helped shape for seven decades. My thoughts are with her family, citizens of the U.K. and all those mourning her passing.”“For 70 years, Queen Elizabeth II has been a source of strength and stability for one of America’s greatest allies,” said Senator Collins. “Her historic reign was defined by her dignity, character, and devotion to duty. She will be deeply missed, but her faithful service and leadership will be long remembered.”The resolution can be read in full here.The resolution is currently cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) and U.S. Senators Durbin (D-Ill.), Warner (D-Va.), Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cornyn (R-Texas), Murray (D-Wash.), Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Warnock (D-Ga.), Menendez (D-N.J.), Risch (R-Ind.), Stabenow (D-Mich.), Lujan (D-N.M.), Rubio (R-Fla.), Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Cardin (D-Md.), Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Hassan (D-N.H.), Capito (R-W.Va.), Fischer (R-Neb.), Heinrich (D-N.M.), Booker (D-N.J.), Murphy (D-Conn.), Kaine (D-Va.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Smith (D-Minn.), Bennet (D-Colo.), Moran (R-Kan.), Reed (D-R.I.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Cassidy (R-La.), Marshall (R-Kan.), Graham (R-S.C.), Shelby (R-Ala.), Blunt (R-Mo.), Crapo (R-Ind.), Portman (R-Ohio), Hawley (R-Mo.), Wicker (R-Miss.)

They were joined by Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Angus King (D-Maine), and Susan Collins (R-Maine).Following calls by families of those killed in the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress first established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance in 2009, in tribute to the 9/11 victims, first responders, recovery workers, volunteers, and members of the U.S. military who rose in service in defense of our nation. This year, as co-chairs of the National Service Congressional Caucus, Senators Coons and Cassidy are calling on their colleagues in the Senate to reaffirm that commitment and honor the heroes who answered the call to service in response to attacks in New York City, at the Pentagon, and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. “Nearly 21 years ago, our country went through a tragedy that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people, including a dozen Delawareans,” said Senator Coons. “On that day, however, we saw the best of the American spirit – countless Americans who risked their own lives for their fellow men and women, often for no reason other than that it was the right thing to do. Our commitment to volunteering on 9/11 reminds us that no matter the physical damage done that day, the American dream of building a more perfect union endures. As a nation, we work together and stand as one to remember those we lost.”“Americans will never forget the tragedy of the attack, the heroism of the first responders and our service members, and the unity of the American people,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We honor those we have lost with service of our own and by remaining ever vigilant of future threats.”“Every September 11th, we grieve the 2,977 lives taken too soon and we remember the sacrifice and bravery of American heroes who sprang into action that day. We also honor the selfless service and sacrifice of the thousands of U.S. service members, diplomats, and intelligence professionals who have worked tirelessly to keep our country safe in the years since that fateful day. I’m joining this bipartisan resolution to honor our first responders and brave civilians who heeded the call to action to save lives and keep our country strong,” said Senator Shaheen. “They represent the best of the American spirit, and this resolution is a testament to their courage and to our shared commitment to never forget what happened on September 11, 2001.” ### "

Senator Coons is a member of the committee.Bipartisan leaders from Delaware have written to the Senate in support of Justice Montgomery-Reeves due to her extensive record of service. Governor John Carney and former Governor Jack Markell both sent letters of support, and the Delaware State Senate also submitted a bipartisan letter “unequivocally endors[ing]” her nomination.“Justice Montgomery-Reeves has top-notch credentials, intellect, and integrity. She would bring a much-needed spirit of collegiality and consensus to the Third Circuit — I’m confident that she will serve our nation with honor and continue to make Delaware proud,” said Senator Carper. “Senator Carper and I were delighted to recommend Justice Montgomery-Reeves to our President for this nomination. She has been a model of judicial temperament and legal acumen in her seven years of service on Delaware courts,” said Senator Coons. “She was appointed to Delaware’s highest court, our Supreme Court, in 2019 and according to her colleagues on that court, she’s continued to demonstrate ‘all the qualities of an exceptional jurist: a keen intellect, strong work ethic, humility, and balanced and well-reasoned decision-making.’”On June 29, 2022, the White House announced it was nominating Justice Montgomery-Reeves, who was recommended by Senators Carper and Coons, for a judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Justice Montgomery-Reeves has been nominated for the judicial vacancy that will be created when Judge Thomas L. Ambro occupies senior status. Justice Montgomery-Reeves has served Delaware state courts for seven years. She is the first Black person to serve on the Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court, where she has served as an Associate Justice since January 2020. Prior to that, Justice Montgomery-Reeves was the first Black woman to serve as the Vice Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery from November 2015 to November 2019. Before her public service, she was a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Wilmington, Delaware.Justice Montgomery-Reeves graduated from the McDonnell-Barksdale Honors College at the University of Mississippi in 2003. She received her law degree in 2006 from the University of Georgia School of Law. Justice Montgomery-Reeves served as a law clerk for Chancellor William B. Chandler of the Delaware Court of Chancery.Full audio and video of Senator Carper’s remarks are available here. Full audio and video of Senator Coons’ remarks are available here. A full transcript is provided below.Senator Coons: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will endeavor to be brief, given my colleagues. I am very pleased to be introducing the nominee for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals from the State of Delaware and the current Delaware Supreme Court Justice, Tamika Montgomery-Reeves. Senator Carper and I were delighted to recommend Justice Montgomery-Reeves to our President for this nomination. She has been a model of judicial temperament and legal acumen in her seven years of service on Delaware courts. First appointed to our Delaware Court of Chancery in 2015, she quickly developed an unmatched reputation among litigants as a thorough and thoughtful jurist. She’s published over 100 opinions, meaningfully shaping corporate law on a court widely regarded as a critical national forum for business disputes. She was appointed to Delaware’s highest court, our Supreme Court, in 2019, and according to her colleagues on that court, she’s continued to demonstrate, and I quote from a supportive letter, “all the qualities of an exceptional jurist: a keen intellect, strong work ethic, humility, and balanced and well-reasoned decision making.” Justice Montgomery-Reeves is also a trailblazer, the first person of color appointed to our state’s Court of Chancery, only the second woman to serve on that court, and the first person of color and youngest person ever to serve on our state’s highest court, the Delaware Supreme Court.Born in Jackson, Mississippi, a graduate of the University of Mississippi and University of Georgia School of Law, Justice Tamika Montgomery-Reeves first came to Delaware as a law clerk for long-serving and well-regarded Chancellor Bill Chandler, who is with us today. We have Chancellor Chandler to thank for convincing Justice Montgomery-Reeves to build her legal career in Delaware. One of the most distinguished legal minds in Delaware, the former chancellor is here and I’d like to quote briefly, if I could, from his letter of support to this committee, in which he comments both that she was in many ways one of the finest law clerks that served with him in a 26-year career, and that he is often approached by lawyers who have appeared before either Vice Chancellor or Justice Montgomery-Reeves, and they invariably praise her for her grasp of the often complicated issues; her perceptive and to-the-point questions; her patience; modesty; and abiding respect for those affected by the judges’ exercise of judicial power. Before becoming a judge, she was a distinguished corporate litigator, first as an associate at the nationally distinguished firms of Weil, Gotshal and Wilson Sonsini, becoming a partner at the Wilmington office of Wilson Sonsini in 2015, and like the members of the Court of Chancery and the Supreme Court, Justice Montgomery-Reeves’ former colleagues at those firms have also reached out to this committee to praise her character and qualifications.Justice Montgomery-Reeves has been supported in all of her accomplishments; she is joined by many of her family today. I will simply reference and introduce her husband, Jeffrey, and their oldest son, Jackson, and I suspect Justice Montgomery-Reeves will introduce the rest of her wonderful family who are here today. She’s a brilliant legal mind, a woman of exceptional character, and is held in the highest regards by litigants who have practiced before her and colleagues from the bench. It’s my honor to introduce her and I’d urge all of my colleagues to support her swift confirmation to the Court of Appeals and, Mr. Chairman, we have strong bipartisan and supportive letters from the Delaware State Senate; from our current governor, John Carney; and former Governor Jack Markell and now ambassador; from Chancellor McCormick; the Delaware Federal Bar Association; as well as a compelling letter from Chancellor Chandler, and I would urge that all of those be admitted for the record. Thank you for the opportunity to offer this introduction. ###"

His strong commitment to public service inspired the careers of his children, including his daughter, Mary, a former state treasurer and three-term senator, and his son, Mitch, a former Lieutenant Governor, Mayor of New Orleans and today President Biden’s Special Advisor for implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act.“Several years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting New Orleans, where I got to sit with Moon and his wife, Verna, and my friend and Senate colleague Mary in Cafe Du Monde while they held court, greeting and enjoying the company of friends of all backgrounds. It was apparent why Moon was such a beloved leader in his community; his graciousness and personal focus on every person he spoke with was abundantly clear.“While the Landrieu family has lost its patriarch, the nation has also lost a wonderful, gracious man. Annie and I extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to Moon’s wife, Verna, as well as Mary, Mitch, and the entire Landrieu family.” ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-carper-and-coons-commerce-under-secretary-locascio-announce-8-million-in-new-funding-for-university-of-delawares-niimbl,"Sens. Carper & Coons, Commerce Under Secretary Locascio announce $8 million in new funding for University of Delaware’s NIIMBLNEWARK, Del. — U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-Del.) today announced $8 million in new funding for the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) on the University of Delaware Science Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus.NIIMBL is supported by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Director of NIST and Under Secretary of Commerce Laurie E. Locascio joined the senators for a tour of NIIMBL prior to today’s announcement. Today’s grant announcement includes $3 million from NIST that will be paired with an additional $5 million from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to plan, design, and procure equipment for a new testbed which will enable rapid development of manufacturing processes to produce next-generation pharmaceuticals. NIIMBL’s goal is part of a larger effort to increase U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing. It is a public-private consortium working to address the challenges associated with manufacturing biopharmaceuticals and training the workforce needed to produce them. Delaware’s congressional delegation previously helped NIIMBL secure an historic $75 million grant to support its launch in 2016. The 2016 grant remains the largest federal grant in the University of Delaware’s history. “As Governor, I worked hard to make Delaware a thriving hub for the biopharmaceutical industry,” said Senator Carper. “I was proud to work alongside Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester to secure the federal funding we're announcing today that will help the industry continue to grow. This grant will enable Delaware to continue advancing our nation's biopharmaceutical research and manufacturing, while securing an investment in our workforce for years to come.""“NIIMBL’s work bringing new medicines to market faster will keep costs down for patients, while ensuring that the United States is more prepared to respond to new and more dangerous viral threats,” said Senator Coons. “I’m proud to have secured this new funding that will ensure that NIIMBL and Delaware continue to lead the way in cutting-edge biopharmaceuticals that will save lives while growing our economy and creating good-paying jobs right here in the First State.” “Investing in the domestic manufacturing of critical goods – such as biopharmaceuticals – is critical to the health, wealth, and competitiveness of our state and nation,” said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Today’s announcement of $8 million in federal funding for NIIMBL – that I helped secure with Senators Carper and Coons – is another step towards helping us achieve that goal. Alongside the University of Delaware and NIST, we’re as committed as ever in working together to ensure that Delaware remains a leader in research, development, and innovation.”“[I] look forward to hearing how we can continue to work to support you and strengthen this impact for this critical piece that enhances competitiveness and public health,” Director Locascio said. “NIIMBL works, and delivers returns. The work you lead helps make sure that breakthrough inventions don't get stuck in labs and don't get made overseas, but get manufactured here in the United States where we need them, where we need good jobs.” “Together we win, and we make significant and huge strides in developing the processes and the protocols for more efficient manufacturing of life-saving medicines that we all need, or many of our loved ones may need one day,” said University of Delaware President Dennis Assanis. “It's not just critical to do the research, but it's also important to enable the skills and experience the industry needs to ensure that products are consistently made in the USA, of the highest quality standards…That's the sweet spot, and we feel that is going to be a truly amazing game-changer for our state, region, and the world.”For more photos from the event, click here. ###"

Since February 24th, Putin’s invasion has displaced more than 12 million Ukrainians and left a wake of indiscriminate destruction and grotesque atrocities that should compel the international community to continue to provide robust support for Ukraine and defend the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity across the globe. “In April, we called upon our allies and the United Nations to recognize their moral obligation to hold the Russian government accountable. Today, especially as Ukrainians recognize their national identity, we call for continued vigilance by the international community to account for war crimes and violence against innocent civilians in Ukraine.” ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-emphasizes-importance-of-us-leadership-around-the-world-after-leading-bipartisan-congressional-delegation-to-africa,"WILMINGTON, Del. – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) hosted a press call today after returning from a congressional delegation to Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tunisia. Senator Coons, Chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with Cabo Verdean President José Maria Neves, Mozambican Prime Minister Adriano Maleiane, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto, former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and Tunisian President Kais Saied, among others. The delegation also met conservation leaders in Mozambique, Kenya, and Rwanda to learn about how the United States can support African-led efforts to conserve protected areas, promote economic development, and make communities and wildlife more resilient to climate change. Excerpt of Senator Coons’ remarks:Senator Chris Coons: Across these five countries, we had a series of briefings and meetings, both in American embassies with presidents or prime ministers, and visits to community organizations, public health organizations and conservation groups. And broadly across the five countries, we were looking at the prospects for democracy in each, the challenges they face in terms of stability and security. Three countries in particular have significant challenges from known terrorist organizations, and either domestic insurgencies or Islamist organizations that have recently conducted attacks, and then in three of the countries, we also very explicitly looked at conservation and the balance between human development and preserving biodiversity, taking action to combat climate change, and to protect wildlife. Five years ago, I introduced and the President signed into law - I guess, maybe six years ago now actually - the End Wildlife Trafficking Act with Senator Flake. Senator Portman and I are working to get that reauthorized before the end of the year. A group called the International Conservation Caucus Foundation or ICCF, and a group called African Parks that manages parks, 20 different parks in 11 African countries, joined us for two different events and meetings. Across all five I have to say there were clear themes. Every one of these five countries looks to the United States as a partner of choice for security, for economic opportunity and for democracy, but in all five countries in different ways, both Chinese and Russian influences are clearly present to varying degrees.… In Kenya, where I have long relationships, having studied at the University of Nairobi in 1984, we met with President Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president who is leaving after completing two five-year terms. And we met with the two contestants in the presidential election, Deputy President William Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Former Prime Minister Odinga is hotly contesting the election results, challenging them in the Supreme Court. Given the history of election violence, in which thousands of lives were lost over two previous cycles and where the Supreme Court invalidated the last election, our ambassador thought that my direct engagement with all three and conversations about encouraging their supporters to remain peaceful and respecting the legal process was important.The full call can be accessed here. ### "

As Delaware’s congressional delegation, responsible for serving nearly 80,000 veterans in our state, and as Director of Wilmington’s VA Medical Center, focused on meeting the health care needs of veterans, we all share the president’s view of that obligation.That’s why, over the past few weeks, the congressional delegation voted to pass the Honoring our PACT Act — a bill aimed at providing benefits for Veterans who had known or suspected toxic exposures, including those who worked near burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill represents the single most significant expansion of care from the Veterans Administration since the passage of the GI Bill during World War II. We were delighted to see Biden sign it into law earlier this month.Let’s be clear — it took far too long for Congress to act to get these Veterans the resources they need. Vietnam veterans, like Sen. Carper, have been fighting for decades to establish a presumption of harm for exposure to chemicals like Agent Orange. But now that the bill has been signed into law — our work is still not over. By comparison, the PACT Act will expand VA benefits eligibility to more the 3.5 million Veterans, by some estimates. That means implementing the bill and ensuring that the VA has the resources they need to provide our Veterans with care must be a top priority for Congress and the Biden Administration.READ MORE"

Tunisia inspired the world in 2011, when widespread peaceful protests led to the fall of Ben Ali’s regime, ending decades of authoritarian rule and launching a new era of freedom and democracy. Now, that democracy is at a critical turning point.  During our visit, we met with prominent civil society leaders to hear their concerns about democracy in Tunisia. Many Tunisians have expressed concerns with President Saied’s dramatic efforts to reform the constitution, including by replacing many judges and suspending the parliament. We met with President Saied to raise these issues and better understand his recent actions and political reforms. We were encouraged that President Saied committed to holding inclusive parliamentary elections in December and protecting freedom of speech and assembly. These commitments are fundamental to Tunisia’s democratic future.  “Since 2011, the United States has strongly supported Tunisia and provided over $2 billion in aid that directly benefits the Tunisian people through economic opportunities, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. While we expect to continue our strong partnership, efforts to undermine Tunisia’s democratic institutions will risk impacting our relationship and this critical assistance. “We also have work to do at home to strengthen and sustain our democratic institutions. Through open and honest communication, we hope our nations can work together to safeguard democracy and protect the rights and freedoms of our citizens.” ###"

I am encouraged by the peace the nation has enjoyed following the recent announcement of the election results and the commitment of both candidates to see the electoral process through and respect the results. In meetings with President Kenyatta and presidential candidates William Ruto and Raila Odinga, my colleagues and I discussed the importance of upholding the rule of law, respecting electoral and judicial processes, and ensuring a peaceful transfer of power that reflects the will of the people. I hope we will continue to look back on this election as a moment when Kenya stood forpeace, democracy, and the rule of law.“Kenya is a strong ally of the United States, and the success of its democracy is important to promoting peace and security and combatting terrorism in Kenya, Somalia, and throughout the region.

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-klobuchar-graham-blunt-blumenthal-and-murkowski-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-allowing-afghan-allies-in-the-united-states-to-apply-for-permanent-legal-status,"WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to introduce the Afghan Adjustment Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation allowing Afghans with temporary status that undergo additional vetting to apply for permanent legal residency. Improving these newly arrived Afghans’ legal status would provide certainty as they build new lives in the United States. Currently, Afghans who were admitted on temporary humanitarian status can only gain permanent legal status through the asylum system or Special Immigrant Visa process (SIV), which both face severe backlogs and long processing times.The Afghan Adjustment Act would also improve and expand the SIV process, including by broadening SIV eligibility to include groups that worked alongside American forces such as the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command and the Female Tactical Teams of Afghanistan. Companion legislation is being led in the House of Representatives by Representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Peter Meijer (R-Mich.). “We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Afghan people for the ways they supported U.S. forces for almost 20 years, often at great personal risk,” said Senator Coons. “The introduction of the Afghan Adjustment Act is a first step towards keeping our word as a nation and honoring that debt. This bipartisan legislation will provide a pathway to lawful permanent status for certain Afghan civilians, offering them a way out of legal limbo and the looming threat of deportation with great risk to their personal safety. Congress has a track record of passing similar legislation on humanitarian grounds, and we must swiftly do so again. Our Afghan partners deserve nothing less.”“Giving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” said Senator Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will help provide these newly arrived Afghans who have sacrificed so much for our country with the legal certainty they deserve as they begin their lives in the U.S. It’s important to do what we can to help our Afghan friends find stability, opportunity, and community in their new home.” “I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to deal with the Afghan parolee problem in a manner that enhances our national security and keeps our commitment to those who helped us at their own peril,” said Senator Graham. “This legislation starts us down a road of creating a strong vetting program to protect our national security while allowing for Afghans who risked their lives for America to move forward in the process, and while determining what to do with other parolees we brought to the U.S. after our hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. Most have no place to go, and it is imperative that we protect our own nation while also not abandoning those who were there for us in the fight. This is a complicated endeavor, and we will seek input from our colleagues as we try to move forward.”“Nearly a year ago, thousands of our Afghan allies fled their homes as their country fell to the Taliban,” said Senator Blunt. “These evacuees are people who stood by our service members, risking their safety and the safety of their loved ones, in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. This bill maintains a rigorous vetting process while providing an opportunity for Afghan refugees to rebuild their lives in America. I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to help those who helped us.”“This measure will provide safe haven for Afghans fleeing Taliban persecution. Our bipartisan bill fulfills a moral obligation to the men and women who sacrificed in support of the U.S. mission helping American troops and diplomats. These Afghan allies worked as journalists, translators, non-profit workers, guards, and interpreters – as well as other dangerous professions that put their and their families’ lives on the line. This effort is urgent as their situation is increasingly desperate. These at-risk Afghans deserve a clear path to citizenship. I am especially proud to have authored language in the bill that will expand eligibility for the SIV program to members of the Afghan Special Forces, including the Female Tactical Teams. The idea developed from the work my office has been doing with several U.S. veterans and service members who fought alongside these Afghans and who have spent the last year trying to get them to safety. I am honored to work with them to fulfill our moral obligation to those who fought alongside us,” said Senator Blumenthal.  “This month, we mark the one-year anniversary of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the end of America’s longest war at nearly 20 years. During the withdrawal, and the weeks that followed, I worked diligently with my staff, and alongside our military and our federal agency partners, to urgently evacuate American citizens, vulnerable Afghans and our Afghan allies; brave individuals who risked their lives supporting our troops and mission in Afghanistan. More than 76,000 Afghanevacuees were brought the United States, many of them were given humanitarian parole – a temporary immigration status typically granted for one to two year periods. Alaska has welcomed over 100 Afghan evacuees who are now settling in as valuable members of our communities across the state,” said SenatorMurkowski. “I never supported indefinite American troop presence in Afghanistan, but I shared the concerns about the lasting negative impact that complete withdrawal would have. Those concerns have become reality as the Taliban wreaks havoc on Afghanistan, condemning millions to live under oppression, and sentencing our allies who were unable to evacuate to death. It is unlikely than Afghans brought to the United States on temporary status will be able to return to their homes in the near, mid, or even long-term future. At the same time, there are allies and vulnerable Afghans who are desperately trying to leave their crumbling nation, and who live under great risk. The United States must ensure that we keep our promises to our Afghan allies, and provide certainty for those who fled to the United States and have no place to return. I am proud to join my Senate colleagues in legislation to give innocent Afghans hope for a safer, brighter future.”“The Afghan Adjustment Act is critical for tens of thousands of U.S.-affiliated and at-risk Afghans, many of whom are already living in the United States,” said Congressman Blumenauer. “We must keep our commitment to provide safe, legal refuge to the those who willingly put their lives on the line to support U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Congress has provided a legal adjustment process for previous wartime evacuations and humanitarian crises and should do so once again, without delay.”“As we reflect on the last year without a U.S. presence in Afghanistan, it is clear that our mission there is not yet complete,” said Congressman Meijer. “We still have thousands of interpreters and other Afghan partners who put themselves and their loved ones at risk remaining in Afghanistan, and thousands more who were evacuated to the U.S. now facing legal uncertainty as they try to rebuild their lives. I am proud to help lead this bipartisan, bicameral effort to enhance security vetting procedures, support our allies overseas, and keep the promises we made to our Afghan partners by providing a pathway for them to obtain legal status to stay here in the United States. Our credibility with our allies and our moral standing in the world depend on the completion of this mission.” Modeled after bipartisan bills that Congress has passed in the wake of other humanitarian crises, including the Vietnam War, the Afghan Adjustment Act would: The legislation has received the endorsement of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Veterans for American Ideals, With Honor Action, Association of Wartime Allies, Church World Service, National Immigration Forum, International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Afghans For a Better Tomorrow, Voice for Refuge Action Fund, Immigrant ARC, Afghan-American Foundation, Human Rights First, and the Advocates for Human Rights."

With this bill, we will make real progress in meeting these goals. I’d like to thank them, as well as Majority Leader Schumer, Senator Manchin, and the rest of my Democratic colleagues for their hard work, negotiation, and compromise that has produced this legislation.

If enacted, the Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022 (S.4007) will help establish mental health programs for America’s first responders who often face long-term effects from providing life-saving services in moments of crisis.  Sen. Coons introduced the bill with Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).  Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-Chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus with Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).“As a co-Chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, I know how important it is to give the men and women who keep us safe the resources they need, especially those who have been scarred by their sacrifices,” said Senator Coons. “Developing new programs for law enforcement officers suffering from PTSD will help us have the backs of the brave individuals who protect us every day. I’m delighted that the Senate passed this bill unanimously, and I hope the House will quickly take it up and pass it on to President Biden for his signature.”“In times of crisis, we count on first responders and dispatchers to deliver life-saving aid – often at their own exposure to tremendous risk,” said Senator Grassley. “Beyond the physical scars, this essential service can also take a mental and emotional toll. This bill takes an essential step toward ensuring that the brave individuals who respond in critical situations have access to mental health services needed to manage stress, stay healthy and continue to serve our communities.”Police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and 911 dispatchers routinely encounter high-stress situations, putting them at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which increases the risk of suicide. The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act would require the Justice Department to issue a report proposing  evidence-based treatment programs for first responders across the country, similar to services available to military personnel who develop PTSD or acute stress disorders. The bill requires the Justice Department to consult with stakeholders, including public safety officer organizations in developing the program, which would be available to serve first responders in communities of all sizes across the country.The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD.Text of the Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act is available HERE###"

Today, we voted for Finland and Sweden to do just that as they join the NATO alliance and bring more power and strength to our collective defense.”“This February, days before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, I traveled to Eastern Europe as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation. While in Lithuania, we visited NATO troops at Camp Herkus where I shared a meal with Private First Class Elijah Williams, a soldier and Delaware native stationed there. Meeting American soldiers like Pfc. Williams reminds me every day of the stakes of Russia’s invasion and the American lives being put at risk by Putin’s war. =“With strong economies and experienced militaries, Sweden and Finland will strengthen the NATO alliance. In so doing, they will not only make America safer but will also make it less likely that the countless Delawareans like Pfc. Williams serving overseas will be pulled into this fight. I am proud to join my colleagues and vote to welcome these vital new partners to a NATO alliance that is stronger and more unified as ever.” Senator Coons, a member of the U.S. Senate NATO Observer Group and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke on the floor of the Senate earlier this summer in support of this measure, and joined colleagues in a visit to Sweden, Finland, and the NATO summit in Madrid in June.  Senator Coons with Pfc.

I’m glad we could show Secretary Becerra the crucial work happening at Westside today, and I’m thankful for the investment HHS is making in Public Health AmeriCorps that will allow similar programs across the country to thrive.”“As the former Delaware Secretary of Labor, one of my top priorities throughout the pandemic, and in its wake, was ensuring that our health care workforce was robust and well-trained,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “That’s why I was thrilled to welcome Secretary Becerra to Delaware today to see the fruits of those labors in the form of the National Health Corps that we helped create through the American Rescue Plan. The Corps has been instrumental in Delaware’s response to COVID and will continue to ensure that we’re ready and resilient facing the health challenges ahead.”       ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-statement-senator-coons-on-reconciliation-agreement-this-is-a-big-big-deal,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) released the following recorded statement today reacting to the news that Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had reached a deal on the Inflation Reduction Act – a reconciliation bill to tackle climate, prescription drugs, inflation, deficit reduction, and other issues. A full transcript is below:   WATCH HERE. Senator Coons: “Health care, prescription drugs, the deficit, and climate: that's a big deal.“We've just announced a framework here in the Senate that will tackle all four of these big issues. I get lots of calls from Delawareans saying they’re concerned or they're upset about the price they pay at the pump; about the pollution that's making our climate hotter and hotter, year in and year out; about the deficits we're running here in Washington; or about how much they're paying for prescription drugs.“I just called Joe Manchin, just spoke to Senator Schumer and spoke earlier today to President Biden to congratulate them on coming together around a bold reconciliation package, a legislative deal that I look forward to supporting here in the Senate. The Democratic Caucus in the Senate is going to get this to President Biden's desk, and I'm excited about the impact it'll have. It'll be the biggest deal to combat climate change we've ever done. It'll cut emissions by 40% in the next eight years; it'll reduce our deficit by $300 billion; it will allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices for the first time; and it will extend by three years, help [through the Affordable Care Act] for 14 million Americans to afford health care. Folks, this is a big, big deal.” ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/at-senate-foreign-relations-hearing-sen-coons-highlights-his-legislation-to-counter-economic-coercion,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, participated today in a hearing focused on economic statecraft and discussed his legislation to support allies facing economic coercion. That bill, the Countering Economic Coercion Act of 2022, is also led by Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), and equips the president with new tools to reduce the impact of economic coercion by strengthening trade and commerce ties with partners on an expedited basis. Senator Coons at Senate Foreign Relations Hearing: Thank you very much Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and our panel of witnesses. Chairman Menendez, I am very encouraged by your focus on economic coercion, your legislative leadership on this and look forward to working with you closely on it. I think you’ve brought a real focus in the work on this committee to not just studying or thinking about what we need to do strategically and what tools we need, but then delivering those results so that we can strengthen the hand of our partners, diplomats, development professionals, and I'm excited to work with you on your Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century Act. I have recently introduced a bill, the Countering Economic Coercion Act, with Senator Young. I view them as complementary and I'm very hopeful that we can work together to move both of these pieces of legislation. We have both seen ways in which Russia, and China, and other states deliberately inflict economic damage, economic harm, on some of our partners and allies and countries that are at an uncertain point. They use economic power to punish or bully or influence sovereign states in our hemisphere and around the world, sometimes through informal pressure, intimidation, or threats, sometimes through formal actions. It harms our national security interests, our economy and undermines international rules. The Chairman's bill would establish an interagency task force to develop a strategy to counter economic coercion, and I enthusiastically support that, and my bill would provide the President with new tools to offer rapid and – I would argue – effective economic support to our partners targeted by economic coercion. For example, many of us have offered our support for Lithuania in recent months. President Biden has voiced support for Lithuania. The bill I'm trying to move forward would add tools to the president's toolkit to make such support not just in words but in deeds by targeting specific tariff reductions, by expediting decisions on relaxing import restrictions or export restrictions, offering greater flexibility for export financing. ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-senator-coons-highlights-recent-investments-by-congress-and-white-house-to-support-law-enforcement-at-hearing,"WASHINGTON – Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) spoke at a Senate Judiciary hearing today about the importance of law enforcement officer safety where he touted legislation delivered by Congress and the Biden White House to fund police departments and protect officers’ physical and mental health.Participating in the hearing were Chief of Constitutional Policing and Reform for the Chicago Police Department Angel Novalez; Commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department Michael Harrison; Dwight Henninger, Chief of the Vail, Colorado Police Department; Cedar Falls Public Safety Officer Zachary Allen Anderson; Michael Bouchard, Sheriff of Oakland County, Michigan; and President and Executive Director of the National Fallen Officer Foundation Sgt. Demetrick “Tre” Pennie.  “Whether it's working together to try and keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of those who would do harm to law enforcement, making sure that we've got bulletproof vests for agencies, large and small, that are appropriately fitting [and] state of the art… or investing in mental health, in resources, and training, and support to make sure that officers have the resources they need to continue to serve, or to go on and lead productive lives,” said Senator Coons at the hearing. “There's a solemn obligation on us not to turn this into a show, but to be serious and deliberate about the work that we do with you.”In his remarks, Senator Coons highlighted the American Rescue Plan’s $10 billion investment in policing and other public safety efforts.  Senator Coons also discussed President Biden’s recently announced Safer America Plan, which would invest $37 billion in law enforcement and crime prevention, including by helping communities hire and train 100,000 additional police officers.In addition to being a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Coons is co-Chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. WATCH HERE Sen. Chris Coons: Thank you, Chairman Durbin, thank you Ranking Member Grassley. Thank you for holding this valuable and this critical hearing, and I want to thank each of our witnesses today who have not just testified, but who have demonstrated, through your lifetime of service and through the actions you've taken, what Commissioner Harrison said in his opening: that policing is a calling, and that having the courage and determination to stand up and serve and to continue serving – Officer Anderson, Chief Novalez – after witnessing or being directly harmed in the line of duty, after having the opportunity to understand just how challenging this calling is; I just wanted to open by expressing my gratitude to each one of you individually, and to the men and women you represent with whom you serve, and to the families and fellow officers who are here.I know that it is more difficult than I can comprehend, to come and to testify about what was a horrific, life-altering day in Cedar Falls, in the line of duty; to see Patrol Sergeant Smith killed and to have to then talk with his widow and his family, to have been wounded yourself, Chief Novalez. And then to have with us Ella's mother, Elizabeth, and to continue serving and leading an agency that looks to you for leadership in a difficult and dangerous time. I had the honor to serve as the County Executive in New Castle County, Delaware. We had 380 sworn officers during most of my time there, and I will never forget one of the hardest days of my life in this body was when Joe Szczerba, someone known personally to me, an 18-year veteran of our force, a talented and warm and – literally one of the best – was killed in the line of duty, responding to a disorderly subject in Penn Acres, and doing what Lieutenant Szczerba – He was a sergeant but was promoted posthumously – what he always did was to, you know, lean in, take matters into his own hands, help solve and track down. He was stabbed in the neck and killed by someone who's now serving life, but I will never forget that funeral, and his widow Kathy, and what she said. She, at the very end, there were 5,000 people there – law enforcement from all over our nation and thousands of Delawareans – and she looked every one of us in the eye and said, ""Do not cry for me. Other women, other people will have decades of marriage to an ordinary person. I had a few brief years with an exceptional man, with a hero.” And you couldn't hear a pin drop in that room, and our community, Salesianum School – where Lieutenant Szczerba attended – the Newcastle County Police Department, and so many others have every year renewed his memory and continued to invest in the training and the support and the needs of the men and women of law enforcement in Delaware. I could continue. I went to the funeral for Patrolman Chad Spicer and have had the blessing of knowing his mother and his daughter; Corporal Stephen Ballard, whose widow, Louise Cummings, continues to lead law enforcement efforts in Delaware to respect our state police. Her husband was an exceptional patrolman killed in the line of duty; Corporal Keith Heacook from Del Mar, whose funeral early this year, excuse me, last year, was a simply riveting moment. You have brought to this hearing today the sort of quiet dignity and determination that is so important as we try to come together to address this issue as a nation.I will tell you that whether it's working together to try and keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of those who would do harm to law enforcement, making sure that we've got bulletproof vests for agencies, large and small, that are appropriately fitting, state of the art; something I've worked hard over 12 years with Senator Leahy to make sure we sustain the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, or investing in mental health, in resources, and training, and support to make sure that officers have the resources they need to continue to serve, or to go on and lead productive lives. There's a solemn obligation on us not to turn this into a show, but to be serious and deliberate about the work that we do with you. I am a Delawarean. I succeeded, on this committee and in the Senate, our president, and I know him personally, and I know that he doesn't just say thank you for your service. He doesn't just say that he supports law enforcement. To the debate back and forth about defunding the police, he has put into action – in his budgets and with his priorities – making America safer. The American Rescue Plan delivered over $10 billion for state and local hiring for law enforcement, and the Safer America Plan, just announced, highlights that in his FY23 budget, there's $37 billion for law enforcement. That includes the funding to hire 100,000 more officers. The agency I was fortunate to have some responsibility for benefited directly from COPS grants many years ago. I hope we will, on a bipartisan basis, provide these resources to you.I know I'm running short on time, so let me ask two questions, if I could, of Chief Henninger in particular if I might. I work closely with IACP, providing critical advice – PERF and IACP – in leadership and management decisions I had to make as county executive – I'm grateful for the IACP. I'm leading, along with Ranking Member Grassley, a bill that would direct the DOJ to propose programs to better address PTSD and law enforcement. Senator Blunt and I co-lead the law enforcement caucus here in the Senate, and we had an event about this to try and better understand PTSD resources. My impression is that unlike the military – which is also working to address critical issues in terms of soldier suicide –which has a unitary chain of command, we have 18,000 agencies. We have disaggregated resources at the federal, state, and local level. How can we best address the lack of resources, training, and support? Are there models for mental health and law enforcement that you would urge us to invest in?Chief Dwight Henninger: Thank you, Senator. The question is very broad, and there are things – there's a lot that needs to be done to solve the mental health-related crisis issues around policing. It goes to the way that officers are treated on a regular basis in the street, and we feel like the fact that we've pulled in the military and we've pulled in the experts to try to identify the best practices is really moving forward with that, but the mental health check-ins for our officers on a regular basis is really important, and funding that is a difficult thing, as you would know. From a local level, that's a very expensive proposition, so we feel that those are very important things to the wellness of our officers. ###

I’m grateful to Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield, Secretary General Guterres, and President Erdogan for securing this deal, as well as to President Zelenskyy for his willingness to ensure people in all places have access to food. “Despite this progress, the only lasting solution will be for Russia to end its invasion and for Ukraine to regain its territorial sovereignty. The United States, NATO, and the international community must continue to use every tool at our disposal to isolate Putin’s regime, aid the Ukrainians defending their homeland, and hasten the end to this invasion.” Senator Coons is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS). ###

See his full remarks below.   WATCH HERESen. Chris Coons: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and the ranking member of this committee for holding a full committee hearing on this remarkable, grave global crisis in food security, and the attendance here and your engagement as senior administration representatives is important. I thought it was striking at the outset, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield, when you said this is -- you've never seen a food crisis like this in your career, and I expect that Administrator Power and Mr. Beasley would both agree with you. We first met in Liberia. You've been to tough places; you know what food crisis looks like. And it is striking to me that at exactly this moment when we have a bitter cocktail coming together, of conflict, and COVID, and climate, that the United States is stepping up in a massive way. Each of the descriptions Administrator Power just gave of ‘this ally, this ally, this ally’ was billions from the United States, millions from this allied partner. And one of the things I'm most concerned about is the lack of engagement and presence by the PRC, yes, by our Gulf partners, absolutely, and the ways in which our European partners and allies are providing – yes, support for refugees – but modest support for the development, the urgent food security and development needs of sub–Saharan African. Administrator Power, thank you for outlining in your speech at CSIS the actions we need to take in response to this food security emergency, and I'm encouraged by the plan for a $1.3 billion surge for the Horn of Africa where you're about to travel, as well as the $200 million in ready-to-use therapeutic foods which are used for children in starvation, but I’d be interested in hearing concisely, where you see funding gaps and what more we can do to mobilize the donor community both through the UN and through USAID and I’ll also be asking Mr. Beasley about his particular brand of effective and forceful personal engagement with those who still sit on the sidelines.Hon. Samantha Power: Thank you. Well, let me just say that I think President Biden took advantage of his trip to the Middle East to engage the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Qataris, I think there's a lot of room for growth in terms of those contributions and particularly in fulfilling pledges that have been made publicly but not yet delivered upon. And you know, money is fungible for an organization like the World Food Program. And so, if, for example, Gulf countries were to concentrate their resources for example, on Yemen, that would free up resources for other countries to be able to use in the Horn of Africa or in South Sudan and so forth. So too, it has to be said again, that European commitments and contributions inside Ukraine are very important, and it's very important that the UN appeals for inside Ukraine be met with the same kind of urgency and the same kind of resources as the needs of refugees that passed into Europe have been met with.Sen. Chris Coons: A number of us are eager to work with you in coordination on pressing our closest allies and partners to meet their commitments and to be a part of this global moment. I'm struck, Ambassador, by the anger, frankly, the breadth and depth of anger in the developing world, at what many of our long-standing partners, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, see as an abandonment of their public health and humanitarian and hunger needs, in the face of what has been year after year after year of drought. I'd be interested in your thoughts on both what we can most do to help with opening up the Black Sea ports – I met with the Secretary General recently, I'm encouraged that the UN is at the table, and I frankly think we should focus on this like it is the Berlin Airlift, that it could be an opportunity to show the UN's engagement and relevance at a critical moment – but I'm also wondering, where you see the UN going. We are behind in our commitments; we are billions of dollars behind in our dues, obligations, our commitments to the UN, although we are billions ahead in our contributions and support to UNICEF and UNHCR and World Food Program. How does it hurt our standing at the UN, when we are billions behind in our commitments?Hon. Linda Thomas-Greenfield: Thank you so much for the question, Senator, because that is really the crux of the challenge that I face in New York every single day as we are put in a position of having to compete with our adversaries on being able to influence the UN action, putting staff who are capable, in the United Nations. We’re reminded publicly and attempted to shame but we don't feel shame that we are -- that we have such a large debt, such large arrears in the United Nations. So, we really do have to address that issue, if we're able, if we're going to be able to compete—Sen. Chris Coons: Does that create an opening for countries like China and Russia to influence the UN system despite our significant leadership in our contributions?Hon. Linda Thomas-Greenfield:  Every gap that we leave is an opening for the Chinese. They flow into every open space that we leave. So that means staffing in the UN, means funding for junior professional offices. These are young people like we have around in this room, who we'd like to see working at the United Nations and the way they get in is through a professional program that's funded by their government. The Chinese have more than 400, if not more, of those young people inside the United Nations. We can't compete.Sen. Chris Coons: As we work on the SFOPS appropriations bill this year we will keep both of those things in mind. I'm mindful I'm out of time and many of my colleagues have gone over. I'll just conclude by saying if I can, Administrator Power, I am interested in hearing from you about our investment in food storage to help the Ukrainians but frankly, also globally, and in programming, you're launching around food waste. We don't have any extra food to waste in this world. And then last, I want to continue engaging with you, Ambassador, on the SDRs, on the IMF, and the ways in which international financial institutions can help stabilize some of the countries we're most concerned about. But if the Chinese keep piling on the debt and we don't fund the Development Finance Corporation as our alternative that is more transparent and more sustainable, we will continue to go in the wrong direction in the developing world. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-on-electoral-count-act-reform-proposal,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the group of bipartisan senators who worked to negotiate improvements to the Electoral Count Act and other laws to help guarantee a peaceful transition of power, issued the following statement today after the group released its draft proposal:“I am proud to join a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to safeguard American democracy, and I urge all of my colleagues to support these critical reforms. As a result of Donald Trump’s and his allies’ coordinated effort to undermine the results of the 2020 election, we came perilously close to seeing our democracy destroyed. We cannot forget that a group of bad actors could so easily undermine the peaceful transition of power that Americans have taken for granted for centuries. These bipartisan fixes to the Electoral Count Act will help close the loopholes that former President Trump and his associates attempted to exploit, including by clarifying that voters, and not the Vice President, select the next President of the United States of America and making it harder to launch frivolous and unfounded objections in Congress to states’ lawful electoral votes. Our reform of the Presidential Transition Act will also protect the critical administrative transition process from becoming a political battleground that can endanger our national security.“The solutions we introduce today will accomplish necessary fixes to protect the fair and honest results of our elections, but the work to ensure that American democracy will last beyond the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren still continues. No one should mistake these critical reforms for the whole of what is needed: a lasting and comprehensive restoration of the Voting Rights Act, protection of the right to vote against attempts at suppression and subversion, and large-scale investment in our election infrastructure. Today’s legislation is a critical first step towards repairing damage to our democratic process and public confidence in our free and fair elections, and I am optimistic it will move forward in the days to come.” ###

We must take threats that come from extremes on both sides of the political spectrum against Supreme Court Justices seriously, and that makes this bill an unfortunate necessity.”“The events of the past week have intensified the focus on Supreme Court Justices’ families, who are unfortunately facing threats to their safety in today’s increasingly polarized political climate,” said Sen. Cornyn. “We must act to ensure Justices and their families are protected from those who wish to cause them harm by extending Supreme Court police security to family members.”If enacted, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act would extend security protection to Supreme Court Justices and their families in line with what is provided to certain Article I and Article II officers and their families. Sections from an earlier draft of this bill were removed prior to introduction, citing free speech concerns.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-chairs-judiciary-subcommittee-hearing-on-transparency-around-social-media-platforms,"WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, chaired a hearing focused on understanding the impact of social media. He discussed his bipartisan bill, the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act (PATA), to increase transparency around social media companies. The full hearing can be seen here. His full opening remarks are below: “Social media companies, as we all know, play an enormously important role in our lives and in our society. They have helped to connect billions of people across the world and deliver a whole range of new and innovative services, in ways that provide tremendous value to individuals, families and communities.At the same time, there are critical questions about the potential negative effects these platforms may have, concerns about propagation of misinformation, incitement of violence or serious impacts on their self-concept or mental health. A central issue that we face in confronting these questions, whether as a consumer, as a parent, or as policymakers, is what are the facts? What are the actual facts? Right now, we don't really have a well-grounded, data driven understanding of how social media platforms are impacting us in our society. The reality is the vast expanses of human interaction that occur on any given large social media platform can be studied and analyzed really only by that platform. It's a problem, and it's why in my view, we need to promote greater transparency. And transparency is important for consumers and the public, who should know how a platform they're choosing to engage with is potentially affecting them. Transparency is important for policymakers so we can better write whatever rules will regulate these platforms going forward. And transparency, I would argue, is important for platforms themselves. Because transparency itself is a positive means to change. Greater transparency can address the deeply-rooted market failure of imperfect information. We've seen how public disclosure of internal research or other data can create a conversation, can alter consumer behavior or lead to regulatory scrutiny and then initiate market pressure that then leads these platforms to adjust their behavior in potentially positive ways. On top of all that, I think pursuing greater transparency is and should be nonpartisan. All signs, all points along the political spectrum, have questions that can be answered by greater transparency. Some of the most pressing topics like the effects platforms have on our children's mental health, transcend political affiliation. This hearing will explore how to bring about greater transparency. What are the right pathways? What are the questions that we have? We need to ask and answer them. Last winter, late last winter, I released the discussion draft of the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, known by the catchy acronym PATA, with Senators Portman and Klobuchar. That draft bill would provide for transparency by creating the first provision to require platforms to make certain key information available to the public on an ongoing basis, high levels of ads, algorithms, and widely-viewed content. Second, a mechanism for data access by truly independent researchers through the National Science Foundation, Federal Trade Commission, and third a safe harbor so researchers conducting research in the public interest need not hear legal action. We released this though as a discussion graph knowing that it raises important questions. I look forward to this hearing, to discussing those questions as well as many others alongside my ranking member. I think those questions include making sure we are striking the right balance between privacy and transparency, and appropriately also, again, when colleagues are doing on these issues in Europe, and what legislation may arise in the states. Of course PATA is not the only goal out there to address these issues. I want to thank some of my colleagues, Senator Blumenthal, Blackburn, for example, for their work on the Kids Online Safety is also relevant to this discussion. With Senator Sasse’s cooperation we've assembled an all-star panel with a diversity of views and perspectives to grapple with these questions today. I look forward to it. I will introduce you shortly, but now I'm going to turn to my colleague ranking member Senator Sasse.  ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-statement-on-draft-opinion-overturningaroe-v-wade,"WASHINGTON—Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement after the publication of a purported draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was released that would overturn Roe v. Wade:“Reversing the long-settled protections in Roe is outrageous. Every woman in America deserves the chance to make their own reproductive health care choices. Should this decision become law, roughly half the states in our country will make all or nearly all abortions illegal, leading to gross inequalities in health care access. This decision would be the end result of a decades-long conservative campaign to construct a Supreme Court that would gut the right to choose, put at risk women’s access to birth control and allow states to criminalize women seeking access to reproductive health care, even in cases of rape or incest. “This country cannot return to a time of unsafe, back-alley abortions. It’s more important than ever that we work to make sure women broadly have access to reproductive health care.”  ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-rep-blunt-rochester-visit-air-liquide-innovation-campus-to-support-use-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles,"NEWARK, Del. – Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester (both D-Del.) joined Air Liquide and Toyota at Air Liquide’s Delaware Innovation Campus today to highlight the future of hydrogen energy and support the use of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and fueling stations in Delaware and across the United States.In March, Senator Coons and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced the Hydrogen for Trucks Act, a bipartisan bill to support the adoption of heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fueling stations. The Hydrogen for Trucks Act is the latest addition to the Coons-Cornyn Hydrogen Infrastructure Initiative, a package of bills to support the deployment of hydrogen technologies and cut emissions in hard-to-abate sectors. These carbon-intensive sectors—such as global shipping or the production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals—face technological barriers that limit the adoption of other forms of clean energy. “Air Liquide’s and Toyota’s collaborative work to develop trucks and cars that use hydrogen, the most abundant element in our universe, is the future of our economy and the next chapter of energy innovation and development,” said Senator Coons. “I am proud to be working with Senator Cornyn on four bills that would incentivize the development and delivery of commercial scale hydrogen deployment to make sure that the hydrogen hub of the future is built right here in Delaware.”“I was proud to join Senator Coons and the leadership at Air Liquide this morning to see the enormous potential of hydrogen as a fuel source put into action,” said Rep. Blunt Rochester. “Ensuring that Delaware is a central hub of hydrogen deployment for decades to come is a top priority of our congressional delegation, and working with innovative companies like Air Liquide, I’m confident that we’ll be able to realize that better – and cleaner – future.”“Air Liquide thanks Senator Coons for his commitment to the role of hydrogen in supporting a U.S. clean energy transition. The development and deployment of hydrogen is essential to decarbonizing sectors across our economy, and through innovation and critical R&D, Delaware is playing an important role,” said Katie Ellet, president, Hydrogen Energy and Mobility, Air Liquide. “The growth of a domestic hydrogen mobility market will go a long way in lowering our carbon emissions, while creating new jobs, revenue, and opportunity in Delaware and across the country. The leadership of our policymakers, like Sen. Coons and Rep. Blunt Rochester, helps ensure that the United States unlocks the full benefits of a clean energy economy with hydrogen at its core.""Hydrogen offers significant potential to contribute to the energy sector and our economy. Offering the highest energy content of any fuel on the market, hydrogen in transportation applications emits only water as a byproduct. This allows hydrogen to contribute as a fuel for zero-emission fuel-cell powered vehicles. Air Liquide has been collaborating with Toyota to support their hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, the ""Mirai."" To support the Mirai's sales in the U.S. as well as future hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, Air Liquide has built and supplied hydrogen fueling stations in the Northeast U.S., and has a number of stations ready for commercial operation."
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-cornyn-bill-to-apply-stock-act-requirements-to-federal-judges-heads-to-presidents-desk,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) released the following statements after the House of Representatives passed their Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, which would require online publication of financial disclosure reports for federal judges and mandate they submit periodic transaction reports for certain securities transactions:“I’m proud to see the bipartisan Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act pass the House and head to the President’s desk for signature. This law will help protect our legal system from conflicts of interest by increasing transparency around federal judges’ financial interests. It’s an important step toward ensuring equal justice under the law. I thank Senator Cornyn and Reps. Ross and Issa for their partnership in moving this legislation across the finish line, and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law,” said Sen. Coons.“One of the bedrocks of American democracy is our independent judiciary, and it is imperative that federal judges are held to the same standard of transparency as other federal officials under the STOCK Act,” said Sen. Cornyn. “This legislation will help bring potential conflicts of interest to light and bolster public trust in our judicial system, and I’m glad it is on its way to the President’s desk.”  The legislation is cosponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senators John Kennedy (R-La.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.).Background:The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would require that federal judges’ financial disclosure reports be made publicly available online and require federal judges to submit periodic transaction reports of securities transactions in line with other federal officials under the STOCK Act. The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously in February, would amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to:Importantly, the bill also preserves the existing ability of judges to request redactions of personal information on financial disclosure reports due to a security concern.Under current ethics guidelines and federal law, federal judges are prohibited from hearing cases that involve a party in which they, their spouse, or their minor children have a financial interest. Federal judges are instead supposed to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality may be questioned. Despite this, a recent report from the Wall Street Journal found that between 2010 and 2018, more than 130 federal judges failed to recuse themselves in nearly 700 cases in which they or an immediate family member held stock in a company involved in the case. While federal judges are required to submit financial disclosure reports, current law does not provide sufficient transparency or certainty for litigants to discern if the judge has a conflict of interest. The current process for obtaining judicial financial disclosure forms can be cumbersome and take months or even years. By contrast, financial disclosure reports for the President, Members of Congress, and Presidential-appointed and Senate-confirmed officials are readily available online. Litigants need real-time access to judges’ financial disclosures and securities transactions in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and ensure a recusal when there’s a potential conflict of interest in their case. The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act would enact necessary updates to disclosure rules and provide litigants and the public with greater confidence in the judicial system.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-leads-congressional-delegation-to-europe,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will lead a congressional delegation this week to France, Georgia, and Italy. Joining Senator Coons’ delegation are Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and Bob Casey (D-Penn.), and Representatives Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), Kathleen Rice (NY-04), David Cicilline (RI-01), and Ted Deutch (FL-22).The delegation will meet with U.S. diplomats, senior government officials, and civil society leaders in each country to discuss the importance of sustaining and strengthening the trans-Atlantic alliance, maintaining an forceful response against Russia’s war against Ukraine, and bolstering European security. The delegation will also address global issues of mutual interest and concern, including the COVID-19 pandemic, global hunger, the refugee crisis, climate change, and non-proliferation.“I am proud to join my colleagues on a congressional delegation to Europe at a critical moment on the continent and for the trans-Atlantic alliance,” Senator Coons said. “The United States must lead the way in addressing the global challenges and opportunities before us, from global security to the COVID-19 pandemic to developing a 21st century global agenda built on democratic values, but we can only do that together with our friends and allies. I look forward to engaging with key U.S. partners on these critical issues over the coming week.“The Russian government’s aggression against Ukraine has only reaffirmed the need to further strengthen our close partnership with our European allies,” Senator Peters said. “The trans-Atlantic alliance has been steadfast and in lock-step in responding to Vladimir Putin and supporting the Ukrainian military and people. I look forward to meeting with our partners and allies in Europe to build off our joint efforts and continue upholding our mutual democratic values.""“As Putin continues to attack Ukraine, our trans-Atlantic alliances are as important as ever. Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, they are also stronger than ever,” Senator Casey said. “Putin may have thought he could damage democracy, but the world stands united against him. I look forward to engaging with key allies as we continue to address global challenges and uphold our shared values.” “I am honored to take part in this important delegation to reaffirm the strength of our relationships with our European allies during this time of unrest,” Congresswoman Rice said. “International alliances are the United States’ greatest tool in maintaining global peace and stability, and I look forward to discussing how we can best come together to support the Ukrainian people and end this needless violence.”   “Thanks to President Biden, the United States has reclaimed its place as a leader on the world stage. With this delegation, we are reinforcing the importance of our alliances, especially as we work together in a unified response against Russia’s illegal, unwarranted invasion of Ukraine,” Congressman Cicilline said. “I look forward to our meetings and to discussing how we can continue building a better future as we all recover from the economic and health crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.” “In the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s critical for America’s leaders to consult, show unity with, and reassure our European allies and partners,” Congresswoman Murphy said. “Our delegation will travel to France and Italy, two of America’s strongest allies, and Georgia, one of NATO’s closest partners. I look forward to discussing additional steps we can take to support Ukraine and impose severe costs on Russia.” ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-on-face-the-nation-senator-coons-argues-for-robust-international-covid-funding,"In case you missed it,  Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), chair of the Senate State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined CBS Face the Nation on Easter Sunday and discussed the urgent need for Congress to pass international COVID funding as part of any upcoming pandemic assistance package. You can see the whole interview here.SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Margaret, I was so disappointed that we in Congress could not come together and deliver critically needed global help to deliver the vaccines that we've already invented, developed and purchased, and to make sure that the nearly 3 billion people around the world who haven't yet had a single vaccine dose get some protection against this pandemic. As we were fighting over this additional payment, this additional funding for COVID relief globally, one of my colleagues memorably said, “well, my constituents are done with this pandemic”. Margaret, just because we're done with the pandemic doesn't mean it's done with us. And the best way to protect the American people from the next variant that might kill more Americans and more people around the world is to ensure that the rest of the world has access to America's vaccines. Last point, there's dozens of countries that had to rely on Chinese and Russian vaccines that don't work. …SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I think this is critical to our national security. Look, we've already lost a million Americans this weekend as families gather to celebrate Easter Sunday or to celebrate Passover or during the holy month of Ramadan. We have folks from all three major global faiths, from Islam, from Judaism, from Christianity that jointly have their roots in the Middle East millennia ago. All of these great faiths have a common principle to do unto others as you would have them do unto you and to care for those in need around the world. I think we can and should justify this additional spending as critical for our national security or as teaching our values, showing to each other the best in the human spirit and the most central tenets of the faith that inspires so many Americans."
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/carper-coons-blunt-rochester-announce-10m-to-reach-riverside-for-new-kingswood-community-center,"Wilmington, Del. – Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons, Tom Carper and U.S. Representative Blunt Rochester (all D-Del.) announced $10 million for REACH Riverside and The WRK Group, which includes The Warehouse, REACH Riverside, and Kingswood Community Center, in support of a new Kingswood Community Center.The Senate Appropriations Committee recently passed the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 government spending package, which includes funding for all government agencies and programs through the end of Fiscal Year 2022. The package includes $97 million for key Delaware projects, with the second largest amount of funding set to go towards a new Kingswood Community Center facility.Kingswood Community Center’s mission is to be a community that assists Wilmington residents and surrounding communities in achieving their potential for economic, social, and personal wellbeing and provide them with positive, reassuring programs that empower families. Kingswood is dedicated to youth and educational services, family, and senior support services.“I was thrilled to work with my congressional colleagues to deliver this much-needed funding to help build a new Kingswood Community Center,” said Senator Carper. “The WRK Group continues to improve the lives of Eastside residents, and their work will have lasting effects for generations to come.”“I will never stop being grateful for the ways in which REACH and The WRK Group support our community,” said Senator Coons. “We have to remember that Kingswood has always been a place that has been a foundation and a refuge. What we’re celebrating today is the next generation, the next iteration, and a re-imagination of Kingswood. This $10 million is the result of years of planning and visions for this community, and I couldn’t be more hopeful for the impact the new Kingswood Community Center will have in Wilmington.”“Today’s announcement will help drive the passionate revitalization efforts of the Riverside neighborhood by REACH Riverside and the WRK Group,” said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. “This $10 million in funding, secured by Senator Carper, Senator Coons, and me, will accelerate their impactful work to bring the Kingswood Community Center to fruition, providing a safe, supportive, and state-of-the-art space for the surrounding Riverside community to thrive.”“The Riverside neighborhood has been relegated to the side lines for decades.  Our community has waited, and our prayers and hopes are finally being answered and forward motion is being felt and seen,” said Logan Herring Sr., CEO of REACH Riverside. “Thanks to the dedication of elected officials like Senator Chris Coons, as well as Senator Tom Carper and Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester the dream of a new state-of-the-art Kingswood Community Center is that much closer to becoming reality. Thank you, Senator Coons, for securing $10 million in funding and for seeing the value of investing in underserved communities like Riverside.”Built in 1958, Kingswood Community Center has outgrown the space and is faced with deteriorating systems that require frequent repairs. The current 17,494 square-foot building is no longer adequate for the current program or able to support the growing demand and ambitious REACH Riverside community redevelopment plan. It cannot provide the amenities that would attract new residents to the Riverside community, a key strategy for creating a mixed-income neighborhood. A new Kingswood Community Center will be the centerpiece of Riverside revitalization, creating a tangible and meaningful structure that will catalyze the community’s transformation. ###"

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-at-university-of-michigan-our-challenge-is-to-to-make-sure-that-freedom-is-armed-better-than-tyranny,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, participated in the fourth annual University of Michigan Vandenberg lecture. He discussed the war in Ukraine and the domestic and international policy implications, along with the need for broader bipartisanship in Congress to tackle pressing global challenges.Below are selected quotes from the lecture. The full discussion can be viewed here: Senator Coons on Ukrainian security assistance: “We are coming right up against a Cuban missile crisis moment in terms of a direct confrontation between NATO, the United States, the West, and Russia… This is a 1939 moment and so as we watch night after night, as our news shares with us graphic details of horrific assaults that are killing tens of thousands of civilians, and decimating ancient cities throughout Ukraine, we have to ask ourselves that very question: ‘How far are we willing to go? What is the line we're willing to push’, and to hear President Zelensky’s plea that we need to make sure that freedom is armed better than tyranny.” “… I think the question that we have to ask ourselves and the Europeans are asking us, is, first, will we actually heed that commitment [to NATO’s Article V]? Will the United States, across electoral cycles, reliably come to the aid of Lithuania or of a Balkan or Baltic state, if invaded by neighboring country…Will we come to the aid of a country like Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, that has sought NATO membership, is trying to get into NATO, is trying to align with the West, but is not currently covered by that NATO treaty? And then last, and this is a point President Zelensky of Ukraine has made repeatedly, pointedly, and at least in my case, effectively, that really troubles my conscience. In 1994, Ukraine had the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world. And they willingly gave it up in exchange for a written commitment from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity. On the refugee crisis and our obligation to support Ukraine: “This is the worst refugee crisis a country has faced since the Second World War. Syria, Yemen, other countries in the Middle East and North Africa have also endured horrific internal civil wars and displacement, but 10% of the population of Ukraine has fled in just a few weeks, and overwhelmingly the refugees of Ukraine are women and children. First, we have a profound moral obligation to come to their aid and to provide a financial support, food, temporary shelter, and other assistance to the 4.7 million Ukrainians who have already left their country and the 7 million or more who are already displaced within Ukraine…I think we have an obligation to provide every possible weapons system to the Ukrainian defenders. The challenge there is how far do we go up the technology scale and what is militarily most useful….“…At some point, we are going to have to confront the reality that Putin may be willing to escalate beyond our willing to take risks. And if we allow Ukraine to become the Syria of Eastern Europe, I think we will have failed both the Ukrainian people, and this moment in history….The entire West is allied and organized in a way they haven't been in decades, even the Swiss have imposed banking sanctions, and even the Swedes, who sat out the Second World War have sent material aid. In fact, Vladimir Putin’s violence and aggression, his barbarism towards the Ukrainian people, may have finally expanded NATO by having Finland and Sweden seek admission, something they've considered for years, but they've never actually sought. So, our obligation to the Ukrainian people is that their sacrifice be worth it. What is happening here is being watched by other autocrats around the world, from the DPRK and Iran to obviously, the PRC and Xi Jinping, leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I think the future of the 21st century is going to be written in the next few weeks or months in how fiercely we are willing to defend freedom in Ukraine.”On Congress’ role in foreign policy: “We are in a tragically broken a period in terms of the Senate and policy setting... We are going to have to do another Ukrainian supplemental both to fund the war effort and to providing humanitarian assistance and reinforcements to the Eastern Flank of NATO… But we should not be doing this through emergency supplementals. We should not have last minute deals being cut between the leadership of the two parties with very little consultation and transparency…I think we need to be building in more robust support for the ongoing humanitarian crises and for the security needs that we are now going to see. NATO has a new focus, a new purpose. It was initially formed to resist Soviet aggression. It is now being re-strengthened and reformed, in some ways in direct opposition to Putin’s aggression. I do think we're going to need to look at, over the long term, providing more investment in security and in development, diplomacy, and the softer sides of national security.”###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-and-warner-reintroduce-legislation-to-support-worker-training,"WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) reintroduced legislation to give low- and moderate-income workers more access to lifelong learning opportunities. The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act would establish a tax-preferred savings account with a generous government match to support workers looking to retrain or develop new skills throughout their careers.In the coming years, more workers will be required to learn new skills throughout their careers. A National Academies of Sciences report focused on information technology and the U.S. workforce recently stressed the need to prepare individuals for the changing labor market. Due to automation, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that up to a third of the U.S. workforce will need to learn new skills or find new work in new occupations by 2030. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 87 percent of workers believe training and developing new job skills throughout their work life is essential to succeed in the workplace. The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act would give workers a tool to access that training by providing them with a portable, government-matched savings vehicle for lifelong learning.“By strengthening access to skills training and fostering a culture of lifelong learning, we can support American workers while ensuring we have a workforce ready to fill the jobs of tomorrow,” said Senator Coons. “That’s why I’m proud to partner with my colleague Senator Warner to invest in our future with this needed investment, and make available the growth and retraining we know will be vital in a competitive, global economy.”“Access to lifelong learning and education is a critical tool that workers need to succeed in today’s economy. Therefore, it is essential for the federal government to support Americans’ ability to retrain and upskill throughout their career,” said Sen. Warner. “This is a no-brainer investment that would help workers continue to expand their skillsets and grow their earning potential. It would also help employers who need skilled workers to fill those jobs, particularly in a competitive labor market.”“Small business owners often struggle to find skilled workers, which has become even more challenging during this competitive labor market,” said John Arensmeyer, Founder & CEO of Small Business Majority. “In fact, Small Business Majority's scientific opinion polling found more than one-third of small employers said it is difficult to find candidates with the right education, skills or training. Since small firms rarely have enough time to dedicate to extensive staff training or sufficient funds to pay for employee education, the Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act would be a huge boost to small businesses by offering them another way to invest in the development of their staff. This legislation would also help solo entrepreneurs invest in their own development and acquire skills without the aid of an employer.”The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act creates employee-owned Lifelong Learning and Training Account (LLTA) savings plans. Contributions to an LLTA by low- and moderate-income workers or their employers would be eligible for a dollar-for-dollar federal match of up to $1,000. Under this legislation, the federal matching funds would be directly deposited into the LLTA immediately after a contribution by the worker or employer. The worker would then get to choose how to use the LLTA funds, which could be applied towards any training that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential.For workers that need to contribute to the cost of updating their job skills, this significant federal investment can make a huge difference in whether or not these workers seek additional training. If employers are willing to match employees’ savings, the returns can be even greater—a $500 contribution by a worker would create $2,000 in training opportunities (a $500 match by the employer, and then a $1,000 match from the federal government.) The accounts are portable from job to job, and always under workers’ control.Contributions by workers and employers are after-tax dollars, but face no additional taxes on earnings if the LLTA funds are used for qualified training expenses. Eligibility is for workers age 25 to 60, with incomes of up to $82,000 per worker. States will manage the accounts. Accounts are designed to encourage the worker to use the funds to regularly update their skills, rather than build up large balances over many years. Restrictions are put in place to ensure that the government’s matching dollars go only to qualified training expenses.The full text of the bill can be found here. ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-colleagues-unveil-resolution-honoring-former-secretary-of-state-madeleine-albright,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 15 of their colleagues in introducing a resolution to celebrate the life, achievements, and legacy of former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. In addition to commending Secretary Albright’s patriotism and public service in the pursuit of a more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative world order, the bipartisan resolution extends the Senate’s sincere condolences and sympathies to Secretary Albright’s family and friends in the wake of her passing.“Madeleine Albright will be remembered as a giant of American diplomacy,” said Senator Coons. “I had the blessing of knowing Secretary Albright’s humor, brilliance, talent, and remarkable insights into world affairs over many years, and I am pleased the Senate has taken a moment today to honor her immense contributions to our country and to our world. As a stateswoman and a fierce advocate for democracy and human rights, Madeleine Albright truly made a lifetime of difference.”“With this bipartisan resolution, we honor Secretary Albright’s extraordinary contributions to our global community and her unparalleled dedication to serving others both as the first woman Secretary of State and throughout her tenure in public service,”said Chairman Menendez. “As a child, she fled fascism as a refugee, later becoming a leading voice for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. As in her life, Secretary Albright’s legacy will continue to shape American statecraft and to inspire foreign policy leaders and public servants for generations to come. She was a dear friend and mentor to me and to many, and she will be deeply missed.”“Madeleine Albright, a giant in the field of foreign policy, was a fierce defender of democracy and internationally-recognized human rights across the globe,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This resolution honors the indispensable work she did on behalf of the United States and extends sincere condolences to Secretary Albright’s family and loved ones.”Joining Senators Coons, Menendez, and Risch in introducing the resolution were Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “Madeleine Albright embodied the ideals of America. She was a constant light in the struggle between freedom and oppression, relentlessly advocating for people to have rights she knew didn’t exist under authoritarian regimes. She broke the highest glass ceiling in her field, then spent the rest of her life fighting for opportunities for women. We’ll remember her as a diplomat and a trail blazer,” said Senator Schatz.“Secretary Albright was a friend, a dedicated public servant, and a true champion for democracy around the globe,” said Senator Sullivan. “I was honored to work with her in our respective roles as Chairs of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Secretary Albright will be greatly missed, but her life and legacy—which began when she and her family fled Soviet communism as a young girl, and led her to the highest branches of government—will help ensure the light of freedom and liberty continues shining brightly for many years to come.”“A refugee who went on to become the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright’s life story is one of resoluteness and a reflection of the bright promises of democracy,” said Senator Romney. “Her service to our country and mark on U.S. foreign policy will be felt for generations to come.”“Madeleine Albright was a Virginian, a tireless champion for democracy, and a dear friend. She represented the very best of America—an immigrant from Czechoslovakia who rose to the highest position in American diplomacy, paving the way for women around the world,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m glad the Senate passed a resolution today in her honor. I will miss her wise counsel.”“Madeleine Albright came to the United States as a child refugee from war-torn Europe, fleeing Nazi and Soviet persecution. She grew up to become the first female Secretary of State – our nation’s top diplomat – breaking down barriers for generations of women to follow in her footsteps and stand on her shoulders. I’m proud to be one of those women and I’m honored to join members of the Senate to honor Secretary Albright for her service to our nation and for forging a path in government service that created space and leadership for women,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we mourn her loss, we don’t look back, but forward, on the opportunities she created for women around the world to realize their full potential. I urge Senate leadership to swiftly pass this resolution.”“Secretary Madeleine Albright was a trailblazer, a leader, a seasoned diplomat, and a champion for all humankind. After arriving in the United States as a refugee, she always fought to give a voice to the voiceless. And she was a force to be reckoned with,” said Senator Van Hollen. “Her legacy will never be forgotten. This resolution is a fitting way to highlight her courage and leadership which will continue to serve as an example for generations to come.”“The United States and the free world lost a giant with the passing of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,” said Senator Cardin. “She was a champion for democratic values and institutions, as well as diplomat extraordinaire, best-selling author, long-time leader of the National Democratic Institute, trailblazing Ambassador to the United Nations and glass-ceiling breaking Secretary of State. Secretary Albright also was the mother of three remarkably successful daughters and a mentor and friend to countless other women. Her contributions to strengthening American diplomacy and standing up for democracy cannot be overstated. She was an incredible leader and a presence the world will not soon forget.”“Madeleine Albright was an accomplished diplomat, human rights champion, and trailblazer,” said Senator Merkley. “As the first woman to hold the position of Secretary of State, she broke barriers and has left a long lasting legacy of effective global diplomacy which will continue for years to come and serve as a model for future generations of diplomats.” Full text of the resolution is available here.                                                                        ###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-votes-to-confirm-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. Senator Coons issued the following statement after the vote:“Today, I was honored to vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.“As I learned during my meeting with her last month and in our week of confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee, Justice Jackson has a deep understanding of the Constitution, a balanced judicial temperament, and a great sense of the role of a judge in our democracy. She is a working mother, and a devoted daughter, sister, wife, and friend; someone with a wealth of judicial experience who earnestly knows and loves the Constitution from which our freedoms flow.“Supreme Court decisions impact the lives of millions of Americans and the health of our system of democracy and the rule of law; it matters who sits on this Court and takes part in these decisions. Justice Jackson stands on the shoulders of those who went before her. Her parents were both proud HBCU graduates who went on to devote their careers to public education; her uncles and her brother served in law enforcement and the military. Justice Jackson is so well grounded in the institutions and traditions that have made our nation great, and it fills me with confidence to know that a person of her character and skill, with her background and judicial temperament will serve on the Supreme Court.”###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senate-passes-coons-clyburn-bill-to-commemorate-brown-v-board-of-education-sites-across-multiple-states,"Once signed into law, sites in Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, Virginia, and D.C. will receive new National Park Service designation House committee unanimously passed bipartisan bill on WednesdayWASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation last night to commemorate the historic sites that contributed to the 1954 landmark Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The purpose of this legislation—first introduced by U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.)—is to expand theBrown v. Board of Education National Historic Site to include historic sites in South Carolina and designate National Park Service (NPS) Affiliated Areas in other states. It would recognize the importance of the additional sites that catalyzed litigation in Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia by designating them NPS Affiliated Areas, and expand the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka, Kansas.On Wednesday, the bipartisan bill unanimously passed in the House Committee on Natural Resources. The House will soon consider the bill, and then it will go to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.  “The painful but significant impact the ‘separate but equal’ doctrine had on our nation must never be forgotten. With new National Park Service designations, we will better honor and remember those who worked to correct the injustice of school segregation in Delaware and states across the country,” said Senator Coons. “I was raised just a few hundred yards away from the so-called Hockessin Colored School – one of the segregated schools that played a role in the Brown v. Board of Education case, but I did not learn until law school that two cases successfully challenging Delaware’s segregated school system eventually made their way to the Supreme Court and became part of the Brown decision. We must ensure that future generations learn this history, and the best way to do that is by improving and expanding the community spaces that document and share these stories.”“The integration of our nation’s public school system was a critical step toward making America’s greatness accessible to all of her citizens,” said House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn. “Brown v. Board of Education and its companion cases undeniably chartered a course forward, creating educational equity in communities across the country. I am proud to join Senator Coons in leading this legislation to expand the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Kansas, to include other historic sites that played a critical role in catalyzing the 1954 landmark Supreme Court decision. Summerton High School and former Scott’s Branch High School in my home state, are historic sites connected to the Briggs v. Elliott case that will continue to tell the story of struggle and perseverance for years to come. I commend the Senate for taking action on this bill and look forward to swift passage of similar legislation in the House.”The legislation was crafted in partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the Senate, the bill was originally cosponsored by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).“South Carolina played a prominent role in one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions in the history of our nation,” said Senator Graham. “It is important we protect and preserve these historical sites so future generations can learn from them. I appreciate my Senate colleagues working to advance this important legislation as well as the leadership of Congressman Clyburn on this issue in the House.”“Seventy years ago, 16-year-old Barbara Johns led a walkout to protest school segregation alongside all 450 of her fellow Black classmates at the Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. Ms. Johns’ student-led demonstration spurred one of the five cases that would eventually head to the Supreme Court under the Brown v. Board of Educationlawsuit,” said Senator Warner. “As we honor Barbara Johns’ legacy in the halls of Congress with her statue, I’m proud to join this effort to commemorate the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site and further recognize the vital role played by the R.R. Moton School in Farmville in ending school segregation.”“The Brown v. Board of Education case changed the course of history, but it didn't happen overnight. It was the work of many individuals and court cases — including the Briggs v. Elliott case in Summerton, South Carolina — that made this landmark decision possible,” said Senator Tim Scott. “I'm proud to have supported this bipartisan effort to protect historic sites and ensure the full story behind Brown v. Board is heard and remembered for generations to come.”“Brown v. Board of Education stands to this day as one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions, ending the unjust notion of ‘separate but equal’ in our nation’s schools for good. We must ensure future generations learn about our history, including the many institutions that contributed to the decision to end school segregation,” said Senator Carper.“Places like the Hockessin Colored School, Claymont Community Center, and Howard High School in Delaware played a crucial role in this movement and are still working today to advance social justice and progress today. I’m so proud the Senate could come together today to pass this bipartisan bill, which will guarantee these sites are forever recognized for their part in our nation’s history.”“Kansan Linda Brown and her parents took their case all the way to the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, leading to the unanimous overturn of the ‘separate but equal’ doctrine that discriminated against school children because of their skin color,” said Senator Moran. “I look forward to the President signing this legislation into law to expand and preserve the historic sites in Kansas and around the country connected to this case. Kansas has played a key role in the civil rights movement, and we must seek to preserve this legacy which calls on all Americans to uphold the self-evident truth that all men and women are created equal.”“In April 1951, Barbara Johns led her classmates in a protest to demand better conditions for Black students at the segregated Moton School in Farmville, Virginia. I’m proud the Senate passed our bipartisan bill to honor the Moton Museum and other historic sites connected to Brown v. Board of Education,” said Senator Kaine. “As we approach the 68th anniversary of this landmark ruling, we must continue to tell inspiring stories of Americans fighting for equality and recommit ourselves to upholding the principle of equal protection under the law.”“Decades ago, parents in the Topeka area stood up for their children and fought against segregation, ultimately leading to a vital Supreme Court decision that changed our nation for the better,” said Senator Marshall. “Kansas has a rich history of engagement in the fight for civil rights and these historical sites hold a special place in our hearts. I am proud to work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to advance this important legislation so future generations can continue to learn about these pivotal times in American history.”“With the passage of the Brown v. Board National Historic Site Expansion Act to designate all of the sites associated with this monumental Supreme Court case, history is not just memorialized but also made whole,” said Paul Edmondson, President and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. “At the National Trust, we have been diligently working to reveal and amplify a more complete view of our national history and we’re pleased to have partnered with Senator Coons and Congressman Clyburn in this important work. The heroism of the communities, parents and schoolchildren who dared to demand equal access to education can now be properly celebrated through these historic places.”“This preservation process reveals how all history is truly made,” said Brent Leggs, Executive Director of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund. “So often it takes more than one great man, woman or even a single community to create change, despite the way the stories of history are often recounted. Actually, it requires many ‘ordinary people with extraordinary vision’ to move a society forward. We applaud those courageous attorneys, families, and activists, some known and others unknown, who put so much at risk to secure educational equality for all Americans. Thanks to our preservation partners, the full history of this landmark case will forever be memorialized and interpreted to inspire the next generation of social justice leaders.”The 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka was described by constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak as “probably the most important American government act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation.” The Brown decision transformed the United States, striking down the separate-but-equal doctrine established byPlessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The Plessy decision was the linchpin that condoned and entrenched legalized segregation across the South, despite protections clearly stated in the U.S. Constitution and underscored by the 14th and 15th Amendments.These laws stayed in placed for nearly 100 years after Reconstruction, but pioneering civil rights lawyers like Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood Marshall, William Hastie, Constance Baker Motley, Louis Lorenzo Redding, and others challenged the constitutionality of segregation and won. The Brown decision ended the practice of legalized segregation in educational facilities and was a major catalyst of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s.The history of Brown v. Board of Education is represented in our national consciousness by a single building, Monroe School, which is a National Historic Site located in Topeka, Kansas. This limited geographic scope condenses public memory of these events and inadvertently fails to recognize the contributions of the other communities in Claymont, Delaware; Hockessin, Delaware; Wilmington, Delaware; Summerton, South Carolina; Farmville, Virginia; and the District of Columbia that were also important to the fight for equality and that saw their cases consolidated with the Brown case. The geographic dispersion of these locations demonstrates that Brown v. Board of Education is truly a story of a national struggle with national significance.“Recognizing Hockessin Colored School #107 as an affiliated area of the National Park System is a fitting tribute to Delaware’s unique role in the Brown decision,” said the Honorable Collins J. Seitz, Jr., Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court. “Of the five cases appealed in Brown, the Delaware decision in Belton v. Gebhart – requiring the immediate admission of African American students to schools attended by white children – was the only appeal affirmed by the Supreme Court.""“The family of Louis L. Redding commends the preservation of these historic schools as reminders of the hard-won rights of African Americans to equal access in education,” said JB Redding, on behalf of the family of Louis L. Redding, Delaware’s first Black attorney and the lawyer who argued the Delaware school desegregation cases. “Further, their existence serves as a reminder that the struggle for full implementation of these rights continues.”“With the path to the infamous Brown v. Board of Education beginning its genesis in Summerton, South Carolina, with the Briggs v. Elliott case, the Clarendon School District One’s Board of Trustees and residents of the local community are humbled and honored to have two historic facilities entrusted to the National Park Service,” said former Superintendent Barbara Champagne of Clarendon County, South Carolina. “The designation of the Summerton School and the Scott’s Branch School is steeped in the authentic American story of the journey for equality and equity. The voices of those courageous men and women who were given the vision for better opportunities and for equitable resources will not remain silent or forgotten. Instead, their voices will echo through the annals of history as a reminder of what can be achieved through determination, perseverance, and faith.”“The Robert R. Moton Museum is excited to join with communities involved in the historic Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision. In seeking to become an affiliated area of the National Park Service, we know this affiliation will allow us the opportunity to better collaborate with other communities involved in the historic Brown decision as we work to ensure that countless individuals have the opportunity to know of the courage and sacrifice that citizens made towards equality in education,” said Cameron D. Patterson, Executive Director of the Robert R. Moton Museum in Farmville, Virginia. “The Moton Museum Board of Trustees, Moton Museum Community Council, and our partner institution Longwood University in offering their support towards this effort, recognize that the resources and benefits offered from this affiliation with the National Park Service will only strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission as a museum.”The creation of NPS Affiliated Areas in Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia for sites associated with the Brown v. Board of Education case and an expansion of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site to include the related sites in South Carolina provides an opportunity for these sites to tell their own uplifting, under-recognized stories of students, parents, and their allies who helped shape American society. Enactment of this legislation has the potential to appropriately recognize the sites associated with the other four court cases and help them to combine current uses with preservation and public education.  In collaboration with local partners and other stakeholders, the National Trust will continue their collective work to bring recognition to communities that fought for school integration, helping these sites to tell their own history of the Brown v. Board of Education case and make connections to other communities engaged in the fight for educational equity, past and present.The bill text is available here. About the National Trust for Historic PreservationThe National Trust for Historic Preservation is a privately funded nonprofit organization that works to save America’s historic places.

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-delivers-remarks-at-notre-dame-symposium-emphasizes-need-for-international-covid-funding,"WASHINGTON – Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) delivered remarks tonight at the Notre Dame symposium titled Insight & Outlook on National and Global Affairs. In his remarks, Senator Coons made the case for building momentum and support for a global emergency funding package with robust funding to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and for global food aid. He also discussed bipartisanship in foreign policy, the importance of defending democracy around the world, and the conflict in Ukraine.Said Senator Coons, “We are as divided as we've been in my adult lifetime. The last two presidential elections, the last four Supreme Court confirmations, the ways in which we are having difficulty hearing and respecting each other, it makes the daily work of crafting and passing legislation harder than ever. I'm having a particularly tough time today because we just tried unsuccessfully to pass a COVID supplemental that would provide funding for the rest of the world. I made the argument until I was blue in the face to colleagues that we have millions of lifesaving vaccines that are going to expire. We have a unique opportunity to show dozens of countries that are relying today on Chinese or Russian vaccines that are ineffective against Omicron, and that frankly, it's in our own selfish interest. Because if we don't vaccinate some of the 2 billion unvaccinated people around the world, the next variant will come back to us. We may be done with this pandemic, but it's not done with us. And I have some good friends and colleagues who have been working with me on that. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina… Senator Romney of Utah, Senator Portman of Ohio. But the challenge was we couldn’t in the end count to ten in the other party to get that bill done.”He continued, “We need to be braver about what we bring to the world. Both in free speech, in civil discourse, and in the future that we can offer of prosperity and freedom. But we're at a moment where because of some events in our own country's recent past, the rest of the world isn't completely confident that's where we're heading…I'm here to tell you that every one of you is needed and welcome in finding that path forward where we can respect each other, honor each other, and fight for democracy by stilling some of the voices in our country of division and insisting that in a moment where the whole world literally is watching, we can work together.”He concluded, “We need a comparable, concise advocacy from the current Pentagon leadership about why it matters to fund things seemingly disconnected from national security like vaccinations or therapeutics. Right now, Ukraine, which is the breadbasket for two dozen other countries, is being ravaged by Russian aggression. A consequence of [this invasion of] the greatest source of wheat and sunflower oil for countries like Pakistan and Sudan, Yemen, and Egypt, is going to be food riots and instability. It doesn't seem like it's a hard defense investment to spend more on food aid or on diplomacy or on development. And there are lots of Americans who have questions about whether our development investments are well spent. I am every bit as concerned about making sure that our development dollars are spent well as you are, but they are a tiny fraction of our total federal spending, less than 1%.” ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-help-law-enforcement-de-escalate-mental-health-crises,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, today joined Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and five of their colleagues in introducing the Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act, bipartisan legislation to help law enforcement respond more effectively to people suffering mental or behavioral health crises. The bill would improve training for police officers interacting with individuals dealing with mental or behavior health issues, including using de-escalation tactics and alternatives to force as well as working with mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams. It would also empower police and the mental health professionals working with them to link individuals to mental and behavioral health services in their community.  “Too often in communities around the country, we task police officers with responding to individuals with mental health issues in our communities without giving them the resources to provide appropriate care,” said Senator Coons, co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus. “On both sides of the aisle, we agree on the importance of improving resources for those experiencing mental or behavioral health crises in our communities. By helping to connect police officers with health providers and emergency services, this bipartisan bill would create better outcomes – both for law enforcement and for those in need of support.”“Too often, police respond when someone is suffering a mental health or behavioral health issue, yet lack the resources they need to do so effectively. We can save lives by equipping officers to recognize and respond appropriately to those situations, to work with mental health professionals, and connect people to treatment,” said Senator Whitehouse. “I’m pleased to join with Senator Cornyn on this important bill.”“We ask law enforcement in our communities to wear too many hats, including that of mental health provider, and they often do not have enough resources or training to provide the level of care individuals in crisis need,” said Senator Cornyn. “We must give them the necessary tools so officers feel supported while helping those experiencing mental health emergencies and other crises, and this legislation would do just that.”Underfunded and overworked mental and behavioral health systems often leave police to confront people who urgently need mental or behavioral health care. But many police departments don’t train officers on how to deal with such situations, leading to encounters that are dangerous for all involved. In response, a growing number of communities have developed community intervention programs to help law enforcement address mental or behavioral health crises. These programs connect officers on the street with mental and behavioral health providers and hospital emergency services. In addition to protecting officers and communities, these programs reduce arrests and prison time for people in need of mental or behavioral health treatment. This is better for the individual facing mental or behavioral health challenges, and can save governments on prison costs. As the National Alliance on Mental Illness has observed, an inmate in Detroit battling mental illness costs $31,000 a year in jail, while mental health treatment costs only $10,000 a year in the community.At a minimum, all police officers should be equipped with the skills to respond to people with mental or behavioral health issues safely and with compassion. To improve officer training on mental and behavioral health, and to promote community intervention programs, the Bipartisan Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act would: The bill is endorsed by the National Criminal Justice Association, National Association of Counties, American Psychological Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Counseling Association, National Register of Health Service Psychologists, American Association of Suicidology, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, National Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs’ Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists, the American Association on Health and Disability, the Lakeshore Foundation, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, the National Association for Rural Mental Health, and the Niskanen Center.In addition to Senators Coons, Whitehouse, and Cornyn, the bill was cosponsored by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) The full text of the bill can be found here.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/tillis-and-coons-statement-on-reports-of-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), co-chairs of the Senate Human Rights Caucus, issued the following statement on reports of war crimes by the Russian military in Ukraine:“The grotesque atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military in Bucha should shock the world’s conscience. These horrific images have not been seen on European soil since the conclusion of World War II. We already know that the mass killings of innocent civilians are not limited to Bucha and have occurred in other parts of Ukraine, and further evidence of the wreckage left behind by Russian troops is likely to emerge.“We agree with President Biden that Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders responsible for these massacres should be tried in the Hague for their war crimes. The United States, our allies, and the United Nations all have a moral obligation to hold the Russian government accountable. We must work together to bring these crimes and Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion to an end.” ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-statement-on-covid-19-emergency-funding-deal,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today issued the following statement after the announcement of $10 billion emergency supplemental that contained no international funding:“I am deeply disappointed by the outcome of negotiations on the COVID-19 emergency supplemental package announced today, a short-sighted agreement that contains not a penny to distribute vaccines around the world to prevent the emergence of more deadly and transmissable variants. I’d like to thank those colleagues of mine, including Senator Schumer, who joined me in fighting for international funding in this package. Unfortunately, despite tireless efforts, the bill will not include any of those funds.“Failing to include any international spending in this bill is a grave mistake, but it goes far beyond that. It is fiscally foolish, risking the chance that tens of millions of vaccines our government has already paid for go to waste instead of being delivered across the developing world as intended. We also risk passing up the opportunity to show the dozens of countries who have relied on Chinese and Russian vaccines that didn’t work against the Omicron variant that we can be a reliable partner at a time when we need to unite the world more than ever. 2.8 billion people worldwide are unvaccinated, and the longer we fail to provide them with shots, the more likely it becomes that another, more transmissible or deadly variant will find its way to our shores, infecting Americans and threatening our economic recovery.“I understand that domestic public health spending is also urgently needed, and so I intend to vote for this bill. However, this is only a partial step, and I will push my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass a robust international funding bill in the coming weeks to address pandemic-related needs and the growing global hunger and food security crisis.”###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/carper-coons-cosponsor-bipartisan-bill-to-boost-school-lunches-through-september-2023,"As 1 in 6 Delaware children face hunger, new bipartisan bill seeks to extend popular program providing for additional school lunches, summer meals for studentsLawmakers seek to extend program that has resulted in 3X more summer meals for Delaware schoolchildrenWASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-Del.) cosponsored the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, legislation which would extend school meal flexibilities, a range of policies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that allow schools to provide additional meals and stand up summer meal programs.In Delaware, school meal flexibilities have been crucial in feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Feeding America, 1 in 6 Delaware children and 1 in 9 Delawareans face hunger. The policy of school meal flexibilities—first implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—has more than tripled the number of Summer Food Service Program meals for Delaware students from 800,000 meals in Summer 2019 to 3,000,000 meals in Summer 2020, according to the Delaware Department of Education.“Right now, 13 million children in the U.S. have to worry about where they will get their next meal,” said Senator Carper. “I’m proud to cosponsor this legislation to ensure that when school is out during the summer, children in the First State and across the nation can count on a good meal for breakfast and lunch. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get this bill across the finish line.”“We need to dedicate resources to make sure that no child goes hungry this summer or the next school year,” said Senator Coons. “Delaware students have faced many challenges through two years of a pandemic, and the last thing they should have to worry about is their next meal. That’s why I’m working with my colleagues in Congress to maintain these critical lifelines for Delaware families.” The current school meal flexibilities are set to expire on June 30, 2022. The Support Kids Not Red Tape Act would extend these flexibilities through September 2023 and also help schools transition back to normal meal operations by October 1, 2023. The bipartisan bill was led by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). In addition to Senators Carper, Coons, Stabenow, and Murkowski, the bill was cosponsored by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Edward Markey (D-Mass), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Margaret Hassan (D-N.H.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Angus King (I-Maine), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).The text of the bill is available here.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-president-biden-first-lady-celebrate-the-commissioning-of-the-uss-delaware,"WILMINGTON, Del. — U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.); President Joe Biden; Dr. Jill Biden, First Lady of the United States and the ship sponsor for USS Delaware; and state and Navy leadership today celebrated the commissioning of the USS Delaware (SSN 791), a Virginia-Class Fast Attack Nuclear submarine, in a commemorative ceremony at the Port of Wilmington.To watch the full commissioning commemoration ceremony, click here.“The USS Delaware is one of the most capable, advanced, and sophisticated ships in the history of the United States Navy, its mission will carry it over the horizon and under the seas, and we are grateful to all who had a hand in crafting it,” said Senator Coons. “Celebrating the commemoration of the commissioning of the USS Delaware today and the brave men and women who serve on it today in Wilmington has been a moment of great joy for all of us.”“The men who serve — and will serve — aboard the U.S.S. Delaware will bear our state’s name for decades to come as they defend our nation. Through their sacrifice and service, may we grow even closer to that more perfect union,” said Senator Carper. “This latest ship to carry [the name of] the USS Delaware is part of a long tradition of serving our nation proudly and strengthening our nation’s security—the security of the United States of America, and not just us, but our allies and partners around the world as well,” said President Biden in his remarks.“This vessel will always uphold the First State’s motto of liberty and independence…Today marks the beginning of an incredible journey of the ship’s long and faithful service to our country,” Dr. Biden said in her remarks. “What a special day for Delaware and for our country,” said Governor John Carney. “I’ve been so inspired by every sailor on this ship as we’ve watched their progress -- training and learning everything about their new home on the USS Delaware. The people of Delaware are proud to embrace the USS Delaware and her crew. Thank you to Senator Carper for your leadership, and thank you to the officers and crew for your service and sacrifice. We salute you.”“Today is a historic day in Delaware as we witnessed the commemorative commissioning ceremony of the Virginia-Class Fast Attack Nuclear submarine USS Delaware, only the seventh vessel to bear the First State’s name,” said Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Congratulations to the US Navy, the crew of this magnificent ship, and those who worked so diligently to make today happen including Senator Carper and Senator Coons. May the First State’s name bring safety, strength, and skill to all of the USS Delaware’s missions going forward.”The USS Delaware is the first Navy ship to be named for the First State since 1923 and the seventh vessel to bear its name overall.In 2012, a Letter to the Editor published in The News Journal, submitted by Delawarean Steven Llanso, prompted Senators Carper and Coons (both D-Del.) and then-Congressman John Carney to send a letter to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus encouraging him to consider naming a submarine after the state of Delaware. Later that same year, the Delaware congressional delegation welcomed the announcement of the naming of the Naval submarine, the USS Delaware. The USS Delaware was built by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, and General Dynamics Electric Boat. Nearly 4,000 shipbuilders have supported the construction of the USS Delaware, and the ship will have about 135 officers and crew onboard. The USS Delaware is commanded by Commanding Officer Matthew Horton. The ship’s motto is “First Defenders of Liberty.”The USS Delaware is the 18th boat of the Virginia-class. The Virginia-class is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSNs) in service with the Navy. The Navy considers it to be the “next generation” of attack submarine. Virginia-class submarines are capable of submerged speeds in excess of 25 knots and are able to stay submerged for up to three months at a time. Virginia-class submarines are armed with Tomahawk Cruise missiles, MK-48 torpedoes, advanced mobile mines and an unmanned under sea vehicle.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-cramer-call-for-us-eu-collaboration-on-climate-in-trade,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, wrote a letter calling on President Joe Biden to work with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to consider trade policies that reduce global emissions and strengthen geopolitical alliances. The letter comes on the heels of President Joe Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen’s announcement last Friday to ramp up efforts to displace Russian natural gas exports to Europe amidst Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked and unwarranted violent assault on Ukraine. “Putin’s aggression against Ukraine, other partners in Europe, and elsewhere around the world underscores the strategic importance of blunting the Kremlin’s malign influence and ability to use critical energy supply as a weapon,” wrote the senators.The senators outline long-term opportunities and areas for cooperation and coordination to pursue our shared goal of responsible, environmental stewardship.“As we look to the future, the United States, the European Union, and our other allies have an opportunity to demonstrate global leadership in reducing reliance on Russian fuels while promoting cleaner energy production,” continued the letter. “Increasing our exports of cleaner energy will have the dual benefit of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions while diminishing the leverage of bad actors. To be successful, we must focus on the long-term opportunity to bolster our trade relationships with nations who prioritize clean, innovative energy sources..”The letter expressed concerns about unilateral action on carbon border adjustments. ""[W]e are concerned that unilateral action could lead to discrimination against U.S. businesses, driving a wedge where there should be a bond. Your administration has succeeded in negotiating a framework with the European Union on steel and aluminum by focusing on our common responsible practices while rejecting the dumping of carbon-intensive products. We have the opportunity to build on this momentum and coordinate with other countries who share our commitment to environmental stewardship. Russia’s war in Ukraine has underscored the need for close cooperation with nations who share our values. It is time to stop rewarding cheap, dirty products that increase emissions and the geopolitical leverage of despots,"" wrote the senators.  The full text of the letter is available here. ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-blunt-introduce-bill-to-renew-protections-for-child-abuse-victims,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), co-chairs of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Victims of Child Abuse Act (VOCAA). The law, first enacted in 1990, provides the only dedicated source of funding for Children’s Advocacy Centers, which bring together teams of law enforcement, medical personnel, and service providers to ensure the best outcome for child victims and help hold perpetrators responsible for their crimes. Companion legislation will soon be introduced in the House by U.S. Representatives Jim Costa (D-Calif.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), and Ann Wagner (R-Mo.).“The Victims of Child Abuse Act protects children who have been abused and brings their abusers to justice,” said Senator Coons. “The law provides resources for Children’s Advocacy Centers that provide a safe and supportive space for these children and help law enforcement conduct investigations faster, more efficiently, and at lower cost. I hope Republicans and Democrats can come together once again to extend and expand this critical program.”“In 2021, Children’s Advocacy Centers served nearly 10,000 of Missouri’s most vulnerable children,” said Senator Blunt. “Reauthorizing this program will provide much-needed resources to help Children’s Advocacy Centers and law enforcement coordinate the investigation, treatment, and prosecution of child abuse cases. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill to help keep kids safe and bring perpetrators to justice.”“National Children’s Alliance not only thanks Senators Coons and Blunt for their leadership in introducing the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, but also in leading the charge for Children’s Advocacy Centers on Capitol Hill,” said Teresa Huizar, Chief Executive Officer of National Children’s Alliance. “By reauthorizing and updating the Act to help better provide for the needs of the kids and families we serve in our centers, Congress once again demonstrates it believes and values the effectiveness of the Children’s Advocacy Center model in helping abused children find healing and justice when they need it most.”Senators Coons and Blunt have previously succeeded in reauthorizing the Victims of Child Abuse Act, first in 2014 and again in 2018. VOCAA programs are now set to expire next year without reauthorization, so it must again be extended by Congress.One of VOCAA’s key components is to fund Children’s Advocacy Centers, which provide a skilled team of trained professionals to conduct forensic interviews of children who have been victims of abuse. Such interviews are intended to be used as evidence in court while also preventing children from being required to repeat their accounts multiple times. Children’s Advocacy Centers allow for faster criminal charging decisions in sexual abuse cases, increased felony prosecutions of child sexual abuse, and lower average case costs.In addition to Senators Coons and Blunt, cosponsors include Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).The bill has garnered widespread support from law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, National District Attorneys Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Major County Sheriffs of America, Major Cities Chiefs Association, and Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD.The bill is also endorsed by child advocacy groups, including the National Children’s Alliance, National Children’s Advocacy Center, Northeast Regional Children’s Advocacy Center, Midwest Regional Children’s Advocacy Center, Western Regional Children’s Advocacy Center, and Southern Regional Children’s Advocacy Center.The bill text is available here. ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-coons-on-senate-foreign-relations-committee-vote-on-ethiopia-sanctions-legislation,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement on this morning’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote on the Ethiopia Peace and Stabilization Act: “Last Spring, I traveled to Ethiopia on behalf of President Biden to meet with Prime Minister Abiy and engaged in several days of intense conversations with him about the situation on the ground and how to move forward in the peace process. After those conversations, a year of brutal civil war continued. Today, it is clear we need to recognize two realities. One, that there is reason for encouragement, with positive developments in recent days around commitments to a ceasefire, improved humanitarian access, and the release of political prisoners. Second, actions rather than words by parties to the conflict are necessary to achieve a sustainable and lasting peace in Ethiopia. The vote today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will empower the Senate, if necessary, to move forward and consider the Ethiopia Peace and Stabilization Act on the floor if the progress of recent days does not hold. I pray this is not necessary and that we will finally succeed with a resolution to the dire humanitarian crisis and brutal violence in northern Ethiopia. But tragically we’ve seen this moment several times in the past year, only to see efforts at peace fall short. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress as well as the Biden administration to end this conflict and hopefully chart a more positive course for the U.S.-Ethiopia relationship.”  ###

The proposed framework would require social media companies to provide vetted, independent researchers and the public with access to certain platform data.Washington Post: A small step toward solving our social media woesOur social media struggles are motley and complex, but finding a solution to almost every one of them requires starting in the same place: data access. Thankfully, lawmakers are finally catching on.Sens. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) last month unveiled the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act. The bill would compel platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to share data with university-affiliated researchers whose projects are approved by the National Science Foundation — or else lose the immunity for third-party content provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The proposal, unlike other Section 230 reform salvos, wouldn’t require platforms to treat speech any differently than they do today; all it would require them to do is cough up the information they possess on how tens of millions to billions of people use their products.The full editorial is available here. ###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-colleagues-introduce-defending-ukraine-sovereignty-act-of-2022-as-threat-of-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-looms,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), joinedSFRC Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and 24 of their colleagues in introducing the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, critical legislation to impose steep costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine. As the Kremlin continues to engage in an unjustified military build-up along Ukraine’s border, the proposal by Senate Democrats to deter a military escalation sends a clear message that the United States is prepared to impose devastating consequences for Putin and the Russian economy if he goes down the path of re-invading Ukraine.Joining Senator Coons and Chairman Menendez in introducing the bill were Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.).The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022 would impose crippling sanctions on the Russian banking sector and senior military and government officials if President Putin escalates hostile action in or against Ukraine. The bill would also prohibit transactions on Russia’s primary and secondary sovereign debt and authorize sanctions on Russia’s extractive industries as well as on providers of specialized financial messaging services (e.g., SWIFT). To help meet urgent defense needs, the legislation calls upon the Departments of Defense and State to expedite transfer of defense articles to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities and authorizes $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance to Ukraine in the event of a re-invasion by Russia. Lastly, the bill also expands U.S. efforts to counter Kremlin disinformation and strengthen ties with key regional partners facing Kremlin aggression.“We have a window of opportunity to use deterrence and diplomacy to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty,” said Senator Coons. “This bill would expedite assistance to Ukraine, counter Russian disinformation, and impose punishing sanctions should Russia choose to invade its neighbor. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important bill through the legislative process.” “This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,” said Chairman Menendez. “As the Biden administration seeks a diplomatic path forward this week in Europe to avoid another bloody escalation in Ukraine, I find little reason to believe that Putin is negotiating in good faith nor do I believe he has any newfound respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is precisely why we are coming together to send a clear message—Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe. Ultimately the most effective sanction on Russia is a strong and unified Ukraine, and I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues so that we can provide the people of Ukraine the type of support they need to confront the bully in Moscow.” “Today, Vladimir Putin’s aggression is the greatest risk to the stability of Europe. Whether it is in cyberspace or as Putin orders a massive military buildup on the eastern border of Ukraine, the United States must make clear that an invasion of Ukraine will have severe consequences. Chairman Menendez’s comprehensive legislation serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and forcefully imposing crippling sanctions on Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation government, any Russian actors determined to be responsible for an invasion, and the corrupt infrastructure that props up Putin’s regime,” said Senate Majority Leader Schumer.“The basic human desire to be free and democratically choose one’s leaders is apparently too much for Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who is now threatening a further massive military invasion of Ukraine.  It’s not enough that Putin denies the Russian people their basic freedoms.  He’s determined to eradicate similar aspirations on Russia’s border in a transparent scheme to protect his own undemocratic regime,” said Senator Durbin. “As such, I am proud to join Senator Menendez’s legislation that would impose historic sanctions if Russia further invades Ukraine.  The bill’s approach is sweeping and clear. It also includes a notable provision to provide greater economic and security support to the Baltic states, including as Lithuania continues to face considerable economic and diplomatic coercion from China.”“We need legislation that addresses the political situation we face today in response to increasing Russian aggression – not last year or two years ago. The dynamics changed and so must our strategy. That is what this bill would do,” said Senator Shaheen. “There is no question that there is a bipartisan determination in the United States to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational and used as a weapon by Putin against our European allies. This legislation upholds that resolve without undermining the diplomatic progress being made. Moreover, it would empower the administration with real teeth to inflict punitive damage against the Kremlin, enhance regional partnerships and bolster military aid for Ukraine to best defend itself. Putin’s escalatory behavior against Ukraine and other American partners in Eastern Europe demands that we evolve our response – we cannot use yesterday’s plans for crises we face today.”“The Senate has wasted a lot of time talking about proposals that will do nothing to change Russia’s behavior. This bill offers real solutions intended to deter Russia from further aggression, while also countering their misinformation efforts throughout the region and increasing security assistance to Ukraine. This is the best course for U.S. national security interests,” said Senator Murphy.“Ukraine is a free and sovereign nation, and its people have the right to live without fear of invasion and subjugation by regional bullies like Russia,” said Senator Kaine. “President Putin should know by now that the U.S., along with our NATO and European allies, will always stand with our democratic partners. This legislation provides the Biden administration additional tools and support to check Russian aggression against Ukraine, and facilitate a peaceful de-escalation of tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border.”“Russia must see that there will be a strong and coordinated response to any further aggression towards Ukraine,”said Senator Markey. “While making clear the consequences of blatant and unwarranted aggression by Russia, the United States and our allies should continue to press for de-escalation in the region. This legislation will work in concert with the actions the Biden administration has already taken to demonstrate that we will continue to support Ukraine and its sovereignty.”“Russia must understand that any further aggression against Ukraine will be met by severe penalties. The triggering of comprehensive and coordinated sanctions can be an effective means of deterrence. This bill makes crystal clear in advance that Putin and Russia will face punishing consequences if he makes the drastic miscalculation to invade Ukraine and further infringe on its sovereignty,” said Senator Van Hollen.“As Russia continues its aggression towards Ukraine, we must take action to show our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and right to independence. I’m proud to join Senator Menendez in introducing the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act, which will hold Russia accountable with tough, comprehensive sanctions if the Kremlin reinvades or escalates hostilities against our Ukrainian partners,” said Senator Carper.“The bellicose actions and rhetoric that we have seen from Vladimir Putin in recent months represent the latest in a long string of offensive actions by the Russian President. Russia’s armed buildup around Ukraine – on top of their continued occupation of eastern Ukraine and Crimea – represents a serious threat not just to Ukraine, but to the broader peace and stability of Europe, and of the world,” said Senator Warner. “This bill reinforces the message that the Biden administration must be conveying to Russia in face-to-face meetings this week – that accelerated aggression towards Ukraine will only strengthen U.S. assistance for our Ukrainian partners, reinvigorate NATO’s collective defense posture, and bring about devastating consequences for the Russian economy.“Putin’s attempt to undermine Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty is unacceptable,” said Senator Bennet. “Our bill outlines comprehensive and severe consequences, including crippling sanctions, for any further aggression. We must continue to strengthen ties with our regional allies and partners to ensure freedom and stability in Ukraine and across Europe, as well as support the Ukrainian people’s desire for democracy.”""It's critical to our national interest that the United States stands with its friends and allies against authoritarian aggression. I am supporting this legislation because it is necessary to address Russia’s continued encroachment into Ukraine and hold them accountable. It sets clear guidelines for broad sanctions while providing needed assistance to Ukraine. I believe it is the right approach to strengthen U.S. ties with key regional partners,” said Senator Gillibrand.“This bill would impose crippling, crushing sanctions if Russia acts on its threats to invade Ukraine. We cannot stand idly by while Russia threatens a sovereign neighbor with military force. Strong, targeted measures to deter unprovoked aggression must be taken,” said Senator Blumenthal.“Russian aggression against Ukraine must be met with severe consequences. We also must remain committed to our transatlantic unity and stand united against Russian threats to the security and sovereignty of Ukraine and the region. I am proud to support this bill as it sends Russia a clear message: escalate hostilities against Ukraine and face crippling sanctions on a wide range of sectors, including the energy industry and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” said Senator Heinrich.""We need to be clear-eyed about the threat Russia poses and this bill takes meaningful steps to counter Russian aggression and stand with our partners in Eastern Europe. As we continue to see tensions rise on the Ukrainian-Russian border, the U.S. must make sure that Ukraine can defend itself and that we stand against any threat of invasion by Russia,” said Senator Hassan.The copy of the bill text is available here. The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty ActMandatory and Additional Sanctions in the Event of Renewed Invasion: If an affirmative determination made by the president that Russia has engaged in a renewed invasion or escalation of hostilities, the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act triggers a cascade of mandatory sanctions on Russia’s political and military leadership, financial institutions, extractive industries, and Nord Stream 2, outlined below.• Presidential Determination on Renewed Invasion or Escalation in Hostilities. Requires a Presidential determination as to whether the Russian government is engaged in or knowingly supporting a significant escalation in hostilities against Ukraine and whether the aim or effect of the escalation is to overthrow or dismantle the government of Ukraine, occupy Ukraine’s territory, or interfere with its territorial integrity.• Mandatory Sanctions on Officials: Requires sanctions on list of officials including President Putin, the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, and commanders of various branches of the armed forces, including the airborne and naval forces.• Mandatory Sanctions on Financial Institutions: Requires the President to impose sanctions on three or more financial institutions from the following: Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, VEB.RF, The Russian Direct Investment Fund, Credit Bank of Moscow, Alfa Bank, Rosselkhozbank, FC Bank Otkritie, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank, and Transkapitalbank.• SWIFT: Authorizes sanctions on providers of specialized financial messaging services (e.g., SWIFT), and requires reporting on efforts to terminate services for sanctioned Russian financial institutions.• Sovereign Debt: Prohibits transactions on primary and secondary Russian sovereign debt.• Additional Sanctions: Requires the President to identify and sanction sectors and industries the President determines should be sanctioned in the interest of United States national security, including oil and gas extraction and production; coal extraction, mining, and production; and minerals extraction and processing.• Nord Stream 2: Expresses the sense of Congress that Nord Stream 2 is a tool of malign influence of the Russian Federation, and that the United States should consider should consider all available and appropriate measures to prevent the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational, and directs the administration to review its prior waiver of Nord Stream 2 in light of the Kremlin’s military buildup and aggression towards Ukraine.• Waivers and Exceptions: Provides the President with a national security waiver and provides the standard exceptions for authorized intelligence activities, compliance with international obligations, and law enforcement activities.Expediting Security Assistance to Ukraine• Bolstering Ukraine’s Defenses: Directs State and DOD to develop a strategy to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities and enhance the delivery of security assistance to Ukraine, including meeting Ukraine’s most critical needs and coordinating with allies in providing immediate assistance to Ukraine.• Expediting Delivery of Defense Articles: Authorizes DOD and State to expedite procurement and delivery of defense articles and services for Ukraine, including through utilizing lease authority and the Special Defense Acquisition Fund.• Supplemental Security Assistance: Authorizes $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance to Ukraine in the event Russia re-invades for fiscal year 2022 and authorizes $3 million international military and education training for Ukraine.

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-murkowski-reintroduce-legislation-to-support-spouses-of-veterans-who-died-from-als,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), the co-chair of the Senate ALS Caucus, and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate ALS Caucus, re-introduced the Justice for ALS Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure the surviving spouses of veterans receive the full benefits they are owed. Companion legislation wasintroduced in the House last October by U.S. Representatives Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.).According to the ALS Association, military veterans are twice as likely to develop ALS as those who haven’t served in the military. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides an additional monthly financial benefit to the surviving spouse and family of a deceased veteran who had a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death. However, the average life expectancy for an individual diagnosed with ALS is just 2-5 years after diagnosis, resulting in many families whose spouses have not reached the eight-year threshold to allow them access to this benefit. The Justice for ALS Veterans Act would ensure surviving spouses of veterans who die from ALS receive these payments, regardless of how long a veteran had ALS prior to death.“ALS is a particularly cruel and brutal disease that takes the lives of thousands of Americans each year, including many veterans who have sacrificed so much for this nation,” said Senator Coons. “Denying the families of veterans who succumb to this disease because of a bureaucratic test shortly after the death of a parent, spouse, or other loved one is simply adding insult to injury. Our military families deserve so much better, and that’s why I’m working with Senator Murkowski to ensure families impacted by ALS have access to the benefits they rightfully deserve.”“Under current law, the spouses and families of veterans with ALS are denied full benefits if they didn’t survive at least eight years with the disease. This is tone-deaf and unreasonable considering the typical life expectancy for a person living with the disease is two to five years following diagnosis. Our current policies fail to acknowledge that the impact of ALS – losing a loved one to this cruel and unforgiving disease – will remain with their loved ones far beyond their passing,” said Senator Murkowski. “Regardless of how long the veteran lived with ALS prior to losing their battle, we have a responsibility to support our veterans and their families. I am proud to join Senator Coons in support of the ALS and military community through the reintroduction of this legislation.”“ALS is at least twice as likely to affect veterans as the civilian population. That means those who signed up to serve our country are at least twice as likely to face a relentless, currently 100% fatal disease in ALS. On top of that, their loved ones are being denied financial resources due to the rapid progression of this horrific disease,” said Dr. Megan Miller, I AM ALS Director of Research and Policy. “The Justice for ALS Veterans Act will ensure all survivors of veterans who died of ALS receive the financial support they are due. We applaud Senators Coons and Murkowski for their continued dedication to the ALS and veteran communities, and wholeheartedly support this effort.”“The ALS Association supports increasing compensation for surviving spouses of veterans who die from ALS, regardless of how long they lived with the disease,” said Neil Thakur, Chief Mission Officer of the ALS Association. “ALS not only impacts the person with the disease, but their entire family, and causes great financial stress. This bill can help ease the burden for surviving spouses. We thank Senators Coons and Murkowski for introducing this important legislation which Congress should pass immediately.”“Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an aggressive disease that leaves many veterans totally incapacitated, is recognized by the VA as a presumptive service-connected disease and, due to its progressive nature, automatically rates any diagnosed veteran at 100% once it is determined to be service connected,” said Jim Marszalek, DAV National Service Director. “Individuals diagnosed with ALS have an average lifespan of 2-5 years. Sadly, many veterans are unable to meet DIC’s 8-year requirement for the additional amounts payable to survivors. The Justice for ALS Veterans Act would allow survivors of veterans who pass away due to service-connected ALS to receive that additional monthly compensation, regardless of the length of time it was service-connected. DAV applauds Senator Coons and Senator Murkowski in their efforts in providing justice for ALS veterans and their families.”""Survivors should not be denied a benefit others receive simply because the service-connected disease their veterans acquired made it nearly impossible for them to meet an eight-year life expectancy requirement,” said Heather Ansley, Director of Government Relations at Paralyzed Veterans of America. “We thank Senators Coons and Murkowski for introducing this important legislation and urge the Senate to pass it quickly.”ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that destroys the body’s ability to control muscle movement. There is currently no known cause and no cure. Senators Coons and Murkowski were the lead Senate sponsors of the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act, which was signed into law by President Biden in December after receiving unanimous support in the Senate.The text of the bill is available here.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/carper-coons-call-for-tps-designations-for-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-and-nicaragua,"WASHINGTON – On Monday, U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-Del.) joined 30 of their Senate colleagues in formally requesting that the Biden administration grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) re-designations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a new TPS designation for Guatemala. In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the senators expressed their grave concern with the worsening humanitarian conditions across Central America being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple devastating natural disasters, all of which have contributed to an uptick in outmigration from the region.“The crisis in Central America is urgent. ... TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration,” the senators wrote. “It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration.”Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.“Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. … Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media,” the senators added. “The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region.”Joining Carper and Coons in signing the letter were Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.)The full text of the letter is available below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken,We write to express our concerns about ongoing humanitarian needs in Central America and to appeal for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and a new TPS designation for Guatemala. It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration. The Guatemalan government has requested a TPS designation, and U.S. Embassies have issued disaster declarations for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in recognition of the urgent needs. TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. Lastly, such designations would be consistent with the Administration’s commitments to address climate migration.The crisis in Central America is urgent. In the past year, the region has experienced extreme weather events, including two hurricanes followed by a months-long drought. According to the World Food Program (WFP), farmers in the region face the worst dry farming season in 35 years. Hunger in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua has increased almost fourfold over the past two years, according to WFP, from 2.2 million people in 2018 to close to 8 million people in 2021. Eight in ten households are resorting to crisis coping measures, selling their lands, tools, and livestock, and missing meals or eating less nutritious meals. It will take years to repair damage to roads, schools, bridges, wells, and other physical infrastructure caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which continue to impede citizens’ livelihoods. The pressures have led to an uptick in outmigration from the region. In January, 15 percent of people surveyed by WFP said they were making concrete plans to migrate — double the number two years ago. Media report that the region’s citizens are having to choose between migrating or facing hunger. Despite U.S. Embassies’ disaster declarations, which activated the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance, 8.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in July 2021, including 5.5 million who were in desperate need of food as of September 2021, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network.The International Monetary Fund says that remittances initially supported the region’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but tropical storms Eta and Iota interrupted progress, damaging crops and halting manufacturing. In 2020, Honduras’ GDP dropped nine percent, El Salvador’s GDP dropped nearly eight percent, Nicaragua’s dropped two percent, and Guatemala’s by 1.8 percent. The IMF supported the region with emergency financing to cope with these shocks. However, the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging vaccination campaigns, especially in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, will prolong the region’s economic recovery.Combined, the effects of the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly exacerbated food insecurity, violence, and led to rising social tensions. Forced displacement continues to plague the region. Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. On November 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights named El Salvador the most dangerous Latin American country for women. Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media.TPS is a humanitarian tool used by both Democratic and Republican administrations to provide relief for individuals who are unable to return to countries facing extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region. They would also provide immediate and tangible humanitarian benefits to new status holders and help mitigate the factors driving dangerous outmigration by securing life-saving remittances.It is our view that El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua meet the standards for TPS. We look forward to working closely with and supporting the Biden administration as it take this important step to uphold humanitarian protections, safeguard U.S. national security interests, and defend American families. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.Sincerely,###

This current crisis, artificially created by Vladimir Putin’s unprecedented build-up of Russian military forces on Ukraine’s border, reflects Putin’s refusal to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Russia’s neighbors. The undersigned Senators support your efforts to utilize all diplomatic channels to make it clear to Putin that the United States and its allies will not accept its current aggression against Ukraine, nor will it allow for an invasion of Ukraine without severe consequences.In Russia’s list of required public “security guarantees” to Western governments, Putin explicitly demanded NATO rule out membership to Ukraine, commit to preventing further enlargement of the alliance, and prohibit NATO from deploying military equipment in countries that joined the alliance after 1997, among other unreasonable demands that are unacceptable to this group of Senators. Rather than security guarantees, these demands are an attempt to recreate a Russian sphere of influence in Europe, where the Kremlin is free to coerce and bully countries like Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, who have since become firm American allies and partners.We support close engagement with our allies to ensure a coordinated and unambiguous response to Putin’s brinkmanship and ask that the administration and its allies continue to unequivocally rebuke Putin’s military threats and provocations against our allies. It is imperative the United States demonstrate our resolve and refuse to appease Putin’s unacceptable list of demands.In light of this week’s meetings with the Russian government through the Strategic Stability Dialogue, the Russia-NATO Council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Permanent Council meeting, we wish to underscore strong bipartisan support for the following: We support working with our allies, especially through NATO and the European Union, to push back on Putin’s aggressive tactics and demonstrate the United States’ commitment to maintaining a rules-based order in Europe. A world where authoritarians believe they can force their way through coercion and intimidation threatens the safety of Americans abroad and the prosperity of Americans at home.We wish your administration well for this critical week of diplomacy. This group of Senators is prepared to support increased assistance to Ukraine, push back against Putin’s revisionist agenda, and bolster support for our eastern European allies. Sincerely,###

Ambassador Satterfield will be succeeding Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman in the role.“I am encouraged that Ambassador David Satterfield, the current U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and a veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service, will be succeeding Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as the U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa. Ambassador Feltman is a seasoned American diplomat with decades of service around the world, and he has maintained a steady U.S. approach to the conflict in northern Ethiopia and other regional challenges while engaging in a forceful dialogue with regional leaders. There is ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster in northern Ethiopia, political crises continue in Sudan and Somalia, and the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam remains unresolved. The United States must sustain a leadership role in this strategically important region and work with partners and allies to find a way forward on these issues, and I am confident that Ambassador Satterfield will help ensure our efforts are effective.”###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-sen-coons-statement-on-the-anniversary-of-january-6-2021-now-we-must-choose-to-heal,"WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) issued the following statement on the one-year anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Capitol:Watch the full video statement here. ""One year ago today, what should have been a straightforward celebration of American governance was disrupted as an angry mob, egged on by President Trump, violently sought to stop the certification of a free and fair election at the seat of our national government. I'm grateful for the law enforcement officers, the Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police, the National Guard, and others who protected all of us who work and serve in our Capitol; the five officers who lost their lives as a result of that day and their families remain in my prayers today, a year later. These officers did not come to work that day as Republicans or Democrats, but simply as people responsible for working to keep us all safe. They did their jobs so that later that night, the entire Senate could reconvene to do ours and certify the results of the election.""Our Capitol is the best-known symbol of our democracy around the world. Over the past year, I’ve heard firsthand in a dozen countries how the storming of our Capitol on January Sixth made foreign leaders doubt the durability of our democracy. Our adversaries have trumpeted January Sixth a humiliating sign of weakness and disarray; our allies have seen it as a troubling sign of the fraying of our society and our democratic system. Democracy is under threat in dozens of nations around the world today. These are nations that often look to us as a model, but we cannot lead the free world unless we strengthen the rule of law and access to the ballot box here at home.""We should mark this anniversary by taking decisive steps to strengthen and to heal our own democracy. That means making progress to secure our elections, ensuring that the state and local election officials on both sides of the aisle who did their jobs last winter counting the people’s votes continue to do so in the future, and guaranteeing that those votes can be cast freely and safely. Congress should also invest in civics education and national service programs that can inspire the next generation of Americans to better know our system and each other across our political differences. Too often in recent years, we have chosen division. Now, we must choose to heal and strengthen our democracy, and lay the groundwork for future generations to sustain our trajectory along that most important path."" ###"

His resignation yesterday cements the October 25 military coup and exposes the intentions of Sudan’s military leaders to cling to power and continue to sabotage the country’s transition toward democracy.“Millions of Sudanese have taken to the streets in recent months to reject military rule and demand a civilian-led government. Sudan’s military leaders should heed their voices by handing over leadership of the Sovereign Council to civilians now and ceasing their brutal crackdown on protestors. “I have led efforts in Congress to remove crippling historical sanctions on Sudan and appropriate over $1 billion in assistance to support the transition. My colleagues and I will continue to stand with the Sudanese people through this difficult period, and we will continue to invest in democratic progress in Sudan and punish those that threaten it.” ###

The lawmakers call on Congress to appropriate an additional $1 billion to NCI, where funding for cancer research has lagged behind other NIH programs and resulted in lower research output.Scientific American: A $1 billion boost to the NCI will help us beat cancerBy Senators Chris Coons and Jerry Moran… unfortunately, not all entities within the NIH have benefited equally from the recent budget increases, and the cancer research conducted via NCI funding is lagging behind. We believe a $1-billion boost this year and consistent increases going forward will allow the U.S. to remain the global scientific and economic leader in the development of cancer diagnostics and treatments that Americans will benefit from in the years ahead.Because of the current funding lag, the NCI can only fund about one in eight meritorious research applications, leaving many potential cures for various cancers on the cutting-room floor and young cancer scientists unable to get the financial backing they need to pursue innovative ideas. This in turn means that fewer promising scientists will enter the field of cancer research and that others will leave, leading to a brain drain in the field…The full op-ed can be read here.###

His deep faith, passion for justice, and lifelong work for liberation and reconciliation both challenged and inspired me as he helped his nation find its way forward with intensity, accountability, and grace.   “As a young man, I had the chance to volunteer for the South African Council of Churches in Cape Town and Johannesburg for three months, just as the apartheid regime was fighting its hardest to retain power during a ‘state of emergency.’ As Archbishop Tutu directed a nationwide group of advocates and faith leaders with humility, humor, and determination, I saw closeup how he acted tirelessly to advance righteousness with a fierce sense of justice that would help free Nelson Mandela and end apartheid.“In 2016, I had the blessing of visiting South Africa and Archbishop Tutu again, as part of a pilgrimage with Rep. John Lewis, Kerry Kennedy, and many others hosted by the Faith & Politics Institute. In a memorable lunch meeting, I had a chance to listen as Lewis and Tutu spoke about the struggle to which they had both dedicated their lives and the work that remained ahead.“Today, Archbishop Tutu has joined Congressman Lewis in eternity, and while their fierce passion for justice and impish good humor may have left us, I hope everyone will pause to reflect on the example they set and the work that remains to be finished.”###

The OECD and its 38 member countries work to provide research and economic forecasts that help foster economic prosperity, opportunity, and well-being across the globe.Earlier this week, Senators Carper and Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chair of the Senate State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) Appropriations Subcommittee, spoke on the Senate Floor in support of Markell’s nomination to this key post, which has been vacant for the past five years.“I’ve known Jack Markell for over two decades: as a steadfast governor for the great state of Delaware, as a prudent state treasurer, as a skilled business man, and most recently, as a compassionate Coordinator of Operation Allies Welcome, leading the national effort to resettle Afghan refugees across the U.S.,” said Senator Carper. “He’s someone who senators from both sides of the aisle trust to serve as a steward for American interests abroad. I’m confident that Jack will serve the United States with great distinction as our top diplomat to the OECD.”“Jack Markell is a dedicated and capable public servant with the experience, intelligence, and character to serve admirably as our ambassador to the OECD,” said Senator Coons. “I’ve had the pleasure to know Jack for decades. Following his remarkable record of achievement in the private sector and in our state government, Jack is well-equipped to navigate this key role that seeks to grow the American and global economy. I’m pleased the Senate came together today to confirm him, and I look forward to supporting his work overseas.” ###

They also urged the administration to put digital trade at the forefront of the nation’s global economic agenda going forward, including by working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific.The letter was also signed by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Tom Carper (D-Del.).“We welcome President Biden’s announcement at the East Asia Summit that the United States will work with regional partners to develop a new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

We should use our engagement in the region to support a prosperous, free Indo-Pacific, to advance and support a rules-based international trading system anchored by democratic values and market-based economics, and to bring about less carbon-intensive global economy. In his announcement, President Biden identified several focus areas for the new Framework, including the development of standards for the digital economy and technology. We strongly agree that digital trade must be at the core of the U.S. Government’s global economic agenda in the coming decades, and we encourage the Biden Administration to develop a focused and forward-leaning plan for engaging our allies in the Indo-Pacific on these critical issues.The United States has long boasted the most innovative economy in the world. Our innovators have seen commercial success selling their products overseas, and the U.S. government has historically played a pivotal role in opening foreign markets for American exporters. As we engage with trading partners in the Indo-Pacific, we should seek to ensure that our most innovative companies—small, medium, and large—can freely export their cutting-edge digital services and technologies. Further, we should use this opportunity to set global standards for the digital economy. How governments manage data, the platform economy, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence will have an outsized impact on societies and human freedom in the decades to come, and if democratic governments do not come together to set the rules, then our adversaries will seize the opportunity to advance a digital authoritarianism built on surveillance, propaganda, censorship, and control.Data is the lifeblood of the global digital economy, and our recent trade agreements offer a strong starting point for ensuring that data can flow freely across borders and data-intensive businesses are not required to build redundant data centers in every market they serve. In building a new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework with like-minded allies, we have the opportunity to strengthen these trade rules by tying them to our shared democratic values. For example, as data moves freely across borders, the privacy of any personal information must be protected and access to personal data by government authorities must be conditioned on the rule of law and protection of human rights. Sensitive personal information should not be transferred to jurisdictions that cannot or will not protect it. In building a new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, we should also address emerging technological arenas. Artificial intelligence is increasingly prevalent across our economy, powering everything from autonomous vehicles to weather forecasting. Working with our allies, we should define rules that protect sensitive algorithms from forced disclosure and ensure algorithmic decision-making is unbiased and supportive of human freedom. Digital platforms have disrupted industries ranging from news media to local transportation, creating challenges for workers and competition while also creating opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs who have leveraged these platforms to great effect. While continuing to support innovation, free speech, and economic opportunity, democratic governments must collaborate to find ways to protect platform workers, ensure fair competition, and limit the spread of harmful content. Ongoing debate over domestic rules for the digital economy should not hold us back from substantive engagement with our allies. To be sure, our competitors are not waiting: new trade agreements in the Indo-Pacific are setting rules on digital trade, but none include the United States. We welcome recent engagement with the European Union on digital issues through the Trade and Technology Council, and we encourage similar engagement with allies in the Indo-Pacific. Going beyond principles to identify the rules and commitments that ensure economic prosperity, national security, and the advancement of democratic values is a project we must undertake in concert with our allies. On issues of trade, technology, and decarbonization, the world is at a pivot point. This is a moment that calls for creative rethinking of our international economic priorities and global leadership in implementing a new strategy. We look to you to show such leadership in the development of this new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/act-for-als-act-unanimously-passes-senate-heads-to-president-biden-for-his-signature,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act, legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) and Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). The bipartisan, bicameral bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week. The ACT for ALS Act would fund essential research into fast-progressing rare neurodegenerative and terminal diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and early access to promising investigational therapies for patients suffering from them and would authorize $100 million annually to implement these priorities.ALS affects 1 in 300 people, often leaving patients with no more than three years to live following their diagnosis, and disproportionately impacts U.S. military service members. ACT for ALS authorizes new grants to support expanded access and research programs. This expansion will bring investigational treatments for rapidly progressing diseases beyond their ongoing clinical trials to patients with diseases for which effective therapies don’t already exist and allow for additional research into the effectiveness of those interventions. It also creates a new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program to support other research and development on ALS and other life-threatening or severely debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.“Tonight, because of the tireless work of so many ALS advocates, the Senate unanimously passed the ACT for ALS Act and sent it to President Biden’s desk,” said Senator Coons. “Thanks to this legislation and the crucial research into ALS it will fund, countless Americans and their families who face down this cruel disease every day can go to sleep tonight with a renewed sense of hope. I am grateful to Senator Murkowski and Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry for their partnership on this landmark bill.”“This is all about hope. The ACT for ALS Act will make a meaningful difference for individuals and families across the country. Passage of this bill today is a hard-earned win for the ALS community and provides much-deserved hope to all who are affected by this disease,” said Senator Murkowski. “As someone whose family has been impacted by ALS, I know how terrible this disease is and how tirelessly the ALS community continues to fight for legislation to improve treatments and quality of life and search for a cure. This bill now heading to the President’s desk is huge step forward. It will offer new hope for those who are most in need, those who today—tragically—have very few options for treatment.”“I am thrilled that the Senate has passed ACT for ALS and officially cleared the way for this life-saving, transformative legislation to be signed into law. For too long, the diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease like ALS has been a death sentence that included the devastating hopelessness of no effective treatment options. ACT for ALS will finally help people living with this cruel disease access promising treatments and create the research infrastructure that could put a cure within reach,” said Representative Quigley. “I am deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of the Senate co-leads Senators Chris Coons and Lisa Murkowski and of my House co-lead Congressman Fortenberry. But, above all, I am grateful for the tireless advocacy of an entire community who has made the dream of this accomplishment a reality.”“In a true Christmas miracle, tonight the U.S. Senate gave real hope to those suffering from the cruel, merciless disease of ALS. For over 50 years and over 50 clinical trials, ALS patients have submitted themselves to tests and trials, therapies and placebos, in accordance with the rules of the current health care policy framework. But progress has been uneven, even debatable, with serious impediments to promising new treatments. Many ALS patients have sacrificed their lives to science, as they gradually weakened and died. Tonight, this Congress advanced a new way,” said Representative Fortenberry. “ACT for ALS represents a monumental shift for those suffering from ALS and other neurodegenerative conditions. The bill does two main things: it transforms the paradigm of disease research and regulation and creates a new pathway to promising new treatments. It drives the hope. With this transformative piece of public policy, we can break through faster for those who have suffered so much. I am deeply grateful to Representative Quigley and Senators Coons and Murkowski for their partnership on this groundbreaking legislation.”“For one hundred and sixty years, there has been no hope for those diagnosed with ALS. That changed tonight. Tonight, as a result of tens of thousands of ALS advocates working nonstop to make their voices heard and demanding the chance to live, hope has finally come to people living with ALS,” said Brian Wallach, co-founder of I AM ALS. “Thanks to the relentless work of Senators Coons and Murkowski as well as Representatives Quigley and Fortenberry, ACT for ALS has now passed both the House and the Senate and is on its way to President Biden. This moment was supposed to be impossible. The ALS community, however, refused to give up. So today, we celebrate the impossible becoming real and a new chapter for the fight against ALS.”“ACT for ALS will directly impact the lives of people with ALS by providing expanded access to investigational drugs and funding new research at FDA to find treatments and cures that are urgently needed. Thank you to people with ALS and their families, ALS advocates, and to Congress for passing this historic bill,” said Calaneet Balas, President and CEO, The ALS Association.“The Muscular Dystrophy Association is incredibly grateful for our champions, Senators Coons and Murkowski as well as Congressmen Quigley and Fortenberry, for every Senator who prioritized the ALS and rare neurodegenerative disease communities by passing the ACT for ALS tonight, and for all patient advocates who spent countless hours pushing for this bill,” said Paul Melmeyer, Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy at MDA.“With tonight’s vote, this legislation, which could substantially increase access to promising therapies and advance drug development in rare neurodegenerative diseases, needs only President Biden’s signature to make this a reality.”###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/video-delawares-senators-continue-to-press-republicans-to-end-obstruction-and-confirm-gov-markell-other-key-overseas-posts,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chair of the Senate State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) Appropriations Subcommittee, and Tom Carper (both D-Del.) both spoke on the Senate floor yesterday and pushed to end Senate Republicans’ obstruction of several of President Biden’s foreign policy nominees, including former Delaware Governor Jack Markell.On Wednesday afternoon, Senator Coons went to the Senate floor to make a live Unanimous Consent request – a move to secure Senate confirmation for the postings – on twelve nominees, including Governor Markell, nominee for U.S. Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and University of Delaware graduate Steve Bondy, nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain. The request was rejected by U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), leaving the positions unfilled.  As of today, 61 nominees for the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and several multilateral development banks have had their confirmation blocked by Republicans on the Senate floor, despite receiving approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This obstruction leaves critical diplomatic, humanitarian, and national security positions unfilled at a time of the utmost national need and includes the U.S. Ambassadorships to China and Japan.Senators Coons and Carper both spoke on the Senate floor to spotlight this backlog of Senate confirmations due to Republican obstruction.“At a time when we need senior people to help our country deter adversaries, advance our interests, and secure our values, it is important that all the nominees currently waiting on this floor be confirmed. […] These national security issues are important, and this chamber owes to the American people robust debate, but we also need to provide advice and consent on any president's nominees in a purposeful and timely manner,” said Senator Coons. “I've appreciated the opportunity to dialogue with colleagues about a possible path forward, but as of right now, we don't have one, so I'm seeking this Unanimous Consent. Principal among the many nominees is my dear friend, Jack Markell.”“For the last four years, not only have we as a nation withdrawn from our seat at the international table, we've stopped looking outward for solutions that can boost our own. It's been almost five years, in fact since January 20, 2017, since we had a Senate-confirmed ambassador to the OECD. Five years. Five years away from the table, our eyes closed to new solutions. That's particularly dangerous in the wake of an economic recession,” Senator Carper said. “Right now, the OECD could use someone like Jack Markell. He'll do a great job representing our nation, and he's ready to go to work.”Full audio and video of Senators Coons and Carper’s request for Senate approval of the nominees is availablehere. The Unanimous Consent request sought to confirm twelve of President Biden’s nominees including: Jack Markell to be U.S. Representative to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; Nick Burns, to be U.S. Ambassador to China; Rahm Emanuel, to be U.S. Ambassador to Japan; Steve Bondy, to be U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain; Cynthia Telles, to be U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica; Bathsheba Nell Crocker, to be U.S. Representative to the United Nations in Geneva; Michele Sison, to be Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizational Affairs; Christopher Lu, to be U.S. Representative to the United Nations for U.N. Management and Reform; Lisa Carty, to be U.S. Representative on the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations; Laura Holgate, to be U.S. Ambassador to the Vienna Office of the United Nations and U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency; C.S. Eliot Kang, to be Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation; and Adam Scheinman, to be Special Representative of the President for Nuclear Nonproliferation.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-support-next-generation-of-coastal-managers,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) introduced legislation to improve the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Management and Digital Coast Fellowships. The Coastal Fellowships Act of 2021 supports two essential programs which boost critical workforce capacity for coastal zone management programs that coastal and Great Lakes states and territories depend on to protect their communities from unique hazards. This year, the Coastal Management Fellowship celebrates its 25th anniversary, and the Digital Coast Fellowship will mark its 10th anniversary next year.“For my home state of Delaware, the lowest-lying state in the country, coastal management resources are crucial to protecting vulnerable communities. Our state is a top recipient of NOAA fellows, and we will be receiving a new fellow next year to work on critical coastal resilience issues, like sea level rise and natural resource restoration,” said Senator Coons. “I’m glad to support the authorization and increased funding of these essential NOAA fellowship programs that bring vital expertise to coastal management projects in Delaware and many other coastal states and territories.”“The NOAA Coastal Management and Digital Coast fellowships have provided opportunities that address the needs of coastal communities and help establish a better future for our economy and environment,” said Senator Wicker. “This legislation will ensure NOAA can continue training new fellows to assist Mississippi and other coastal states across the country. I am glad to join my colleague Senator Coons in advancing this worthy initiative.”“Maine has thousands of miles of coastline as well as diverse ocean and intertidal ecosystems that support the livelihoods of many Maine families and are an integral part of our state’s character,” said Senator Collins. “NOAA’s fellowship programs help to keep communities strong by supporting postgraduate students’ work with states to increase coastal resilience, protect the environment, and promote a strong ocean economy. Reauthorizing these fellowships would help preserve these precious natural resources for current and future generations.”“Rhode Island’s coasts are moving more and more into Mother Nature’s climate crosshairs,” said Senator Whitehouse. “We need to provide states with the coastal management resources necessary to protect their communities, and these NOAA fellowship programs are a smart investment in the coastal workforce.”The Coastal Fellowships Act of 2021 will:The bill is endorsed by the Coastal States Organization (CSO), The Nature Conservancy, and American Shore and Beach Preservation Association. “CSO strongly supports the Coastal Fellowships Act as valuable legislation to ensure the development of the next generation of coastal managers while supporting priority coastal initiatives,” said Derek Brockbank, Executive Director of the Coastal States Organization. “With growing coastal management issues including more frequent coastal storms and increasing demands on our nation's coasts for energy development, housing, recreation and tourism, commerce, and conservation the time to invest in the future of our coasts is now. This legislation does just that.”“The Nature Conservancy welcomes and appreciates this bipartisan proposal to promote the development of the next generation of coastal management professional,” said Stephanie Bailenson, Senior Policy Advisor for Ocean & Coasts, The Nature Conservancy. “These fellowships will provide on-the-job training for new graduates as they help communities tackle pressing challenges facing our coasts. The Conservancy has seen firsthand through its participation in these fellowship programs how they make our coastal ecosystems healthier, our communities more resilient to climate change and support robust coastal economies. We commend Senators Coons, Wicker, Collins, and Whitehouse for working across the aisle to advance this critical investment in our coasts’ future.”Bill text is available here.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/coons-portman-klobuchar-announce-legislation-to-ensure-transparency-at-social-media-platforms,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law; Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) announced the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act (PATA), a new bipartisan bill that would require social media companies to provide vetted, independent researchers and the public with access to certain platform data.While major social media companies retain granular data on their products’ impact on Americans and our communities, only a small fraction of it is ever made available to the public. Recent events, including the leak of documents as part of the “Facebook Papers,” have underscored the public value of this data and a need for legislation that increases the platforms’ transparency.PATA would meet this need by requiring social media companies to disclose certain internal data and respond to independent research requests following the approval of researchers’ proposals by the National Science Foundation. Researchers would then be able to examine the data and release findings on the platforms’ impact to the public. Throughout the process, the data would be subject to strict protections to guard users’ privacy.“Social media has connected the world in ways that were difficult to imagine only a decade ago, but the last few years have also made clear the tradeoffs that come with that,” said Senator Coons. “It’s increasingly clear that more transparency is needed so that the billions of people who use Facebook, Twitter, and similar platforms can fully understand the impact of those tradeoffs. This bipartisan proposal is an important step that will bring much needed information about the impact of social media companies to light and ought to be a crucial part of any comprehensive strategy that Congress can take to regulate major social media companies.”“Every new disclosure of problematic activities by social media companies reignites calls for Congressional action,” said Senator Portman. “Before answering any of those calls, Congress should take a step back to ensure that we are not legislating in the dark. Increasing transparency around Big Tech practices will give policymakers the high-quality, well-vetted information we need to do our job most effectively. I took the same thoughtful and measured approach to the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA) to reform Section 230, which was the result of a two year investigation into the ways in which certain social media platforms facilitate the sale of children. I have a number of concerns about Big Tech—from facilitating sex trafficking to burying content about the origins of COVID-19—and I want to ensure that any response by Congress is effective in addressing those concerns.”“Over the last several months, we’ve seen deeply concerning evidence of how social media platforms are harming our families, our communities, and our democracy,” said Senator Klobuchar. “This legislation will increase transparency, which will help us hold these companies accountable and understand what information they have on users and what they do with it. It is time for action – we cannot stand by while social media platforms continue to put profits over safety. Americans deserve to have the facts.”“This legislation represents a critical step in opening a window onto tech and in holding the large social media platforms accountable,” said Stanford Law Professor Nate Persily. “We cannot live in a world where the platforms know everything about us and we know next to nothing about them.  We should not need to wait for whistle blowers to blow their whistles before we gain insights into the greatest problems threatening our democracy and the information ecosystem.”Background:PATA is a multi-pronged bill that creates new mechanisms to increase transparency around social media companies’ internal data:The bipartisan group of legislators will continue to work and gather input as well as feedback from stakeholders before the bill’s formal introduction.The text of the bill is available here.

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-applauds-confirmation-of-bidens-nominee-to-lead-americorps,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), co-chair of the National Service Congressional Caucus, released the following statement on the confirmation of Michael Smith to be Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps, the national service agency formally known as the Corporation for National and Community Service.“As AmeriCorps members continue their remarkable work to help communities rebuild from this pandemic, I’m pleased to see Michael Smith take the helm with bipartisan support in the Senate. Michael brings a strong record of innovation on national service programs, and I’m confident he’ll strengthen the diverse functions of AmeriCorps, including climate resilience, hunger relief, housing support, education, and public health. This is a transformational moment for AmeriCorps and its 270,000 members, and I am eager to see how Michael will guide the program into its next chapter. I look forward to working closely with him as he takes up that important task.”Senator Coons has long championed national service. Prior to coming to Congress, he helped launch and lead an AmeriCorps program with the “I Have A Dream” Foundation. For nearly a decade, Senator Coons served on the Delaware State Service Commission and later, as New Castle County Executive, he helped create a program to recruit volunteer firefighters in his hometown. In Congress, Coons and Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) have built the largest bipartisan coalition in a decade for a bold expansion of AmeriCorps, with the introduction of the Cultivating Opportunity and Recovery from the Pandemic through Service (CORPS) Act. In the American Rescue Plan, Senator Coons worked to secure $1 billion for AmeriCorps, nearly doubling the funding available to the agency to bolster its community-driven response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Coons has also been among the leading voices calling for the creation of the Civilian Climate Corps and strengthening of national service programs through the Build Back Better Act.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-graham-introduce-bill-modernizing-us-tools-to-defend-democracy-calling-for-25-increase-in-investments,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, introduced yesterday the Democracy in the 21st Century Act to significantly increase investments to advance democracy and human rights abroad.The bipartisan legislation authorizes an increase in U.S. global democracy assistance to over $3 billion, 25% above current levels of $2.42 billion, and creates four flexible funds to respond to emerging threats to democracy in foreign countries, particularly in the digital and technological domains. As authoritarian powers redouble their efforts to undermine and interfere in democratic processes, this bill creates a framework and new resources to counter their tactics, including disinformation, election interference, digital authoritarianism, corruption, and direct threats to independent media and civil society.“As President Biden recommits to democracy both at home and abroad in convening the Summit for Democracy with more than 100 countries this week, I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to better equip the United States to address emerging threats and bolster resources and protections for activists defending democracy around the world,” said Senator Coons.“We live in dangerous times, and it is more important than ever for the United States to lead the way in supporting democracy throughout the globe,” said Senator Graham. “This additional funding will counter efforts by authoritarian regimes such as China, Russia, and many others that seek to cripple emerging democracies and threaten world order. Democracies resolve their disputes through the Rule of Law rather than the rule of gun. The best thing that can happen is for democracy to spread and replace radical ideology. I appreciate the work of my friend Senator Coons on this important effort.”In addition to increasing the authorization for U.S. global democracy assistance to over $3 billion, the Democracy in the 21st Century Act would establish four new funds to reinvigorate global democratic resources:A one-pager is available here.

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-on-the-passing-of-fred-hiatt,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) released the following statement on the passing of Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt:“I’m shocked and saddened by the news of Fred Hiatt’s passing. He was a real leader in the media who commanded wide respect, not just for his leadership of the Post’seditorial board at a pivotal time in our nation’s history, but for his intelligence, humor, and willingness to listen that made him such enjoyable company every time I met with him. His passing is a real loss for anyone who cares about American journalism, and my thoughts are with his wife and family.”###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-statement-on-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-2022-olympics,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement on the Biden administration’s announcement of a diplomatic boycott of Beijing’s Winter Olympics, set to take place in February 2022. “I’m pleased to see the Biden administration’s announcement today of a diplomatic boycott of Beijing’s 2022 Winter Olympics. China’s gross mistreatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang Province, its crackdown on free speech and democracy activists in Hong Kong, its arbitrary detention of Tibetans, and its method of using sophisticated technology for social and political control domestically are deeply concerning. I’m glad that President Biden is placing human rights at the center of American foreign policy, and I hope other nations and corporate sponsors will consider joining this boycott to call attention to those defending free, open, and inclusive societies in China and around the world.”###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-sen-coons-in-foreign-affairs-peace-is-still-possible-in-ethiopia,"WILMINGTON, Del. — In case you missed it, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairman of the State and Foreign Operations (SFOPS) Appropriations Subcommittee, published an op-ed in Foreign Affairs on the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia. In the op-ed, Senator Coons calls for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his government as well as the Tigrayan Peoples’ Liberation Front (TPLF) to lead the way and create conditions under which both sides to the conflict can negotiate and find a peaceful political resolution.Senator Coons travelled to Ethiopia to meet with Prime Minister Abiy in March as President Biden’s emissary. Last month, along with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Senator Coons introduced new bipartisan legislation sanctioning parties involved in the conflict in Tigray.Foreign Affairs: Peace is still possible in EthiopiaBy Chris CoonsEthiopia is sprinting toward calamity. Last week, as the rebel forces of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and their allies advanced toward the capital of Addis Ababa, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed traveled to the frontline and vowed to lead Ethiopian troops into battle himself. “We won’t give in until we bury the enemy,” he said. Not to be outdone, a spokesperson for the TPLF called Abiy’s leadership a “chokehold on our people” and pledged to continue the rebels’ “inexorable advance.”If Abiy and his opponents continue on their current path, they risk triggering not only massive bloodshed and economic collapse but the fracture of the Ethiopian state as we know it. Ethiopia is at risk of becoming this generation’s Yugoslavia: a great nation and a regional leader that violently shatters along ethnic lines. Echoes of the bloody Yugoslav wars are already evident in the polarization, hate speech, and violence that have gripped Ethiopia over the last year. The memory of those previous conflicts haunts me when I think of what may be next for Africa’s second most populous nation.The full op-ed can be read here.###

https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-coons-on-passing-of-former-senator-bob-dole,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Today, U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) issued the following statement on the passing of former U.S. Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.):“Throughout his life, Bob Dole always put his country first. I first met him as a Senate intern 40 years ago, and I was lucky enough to work with him on the effort to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities nearly a decade ago. Even then, his capability, his persistence, and sense of humor that served him so well as a Senator shone through. My thoughts are with Elizabeth and his daughter Robin in this difficult time.”###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-hagerty-introduce-senate-resolution-marking-10th-anniversary-of-the-earthquake-and-tsunami-in-japan,"WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, and Chris Coons (D-Del.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a resolution in observance of the 10th anniversary of the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.Ten years ago today, the strongest earthquake recorded in more than 100 years struck Japan, resulting in a massive tsunami that caused widespread damage, including radiation leakage at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and almost 16,000 deaths. A significant humanitarian relief effort followed to render aid and help.The resolution mourns the loss of life, sends condolences to the families of the victims, expresses commitment to the survivors, and commends the Japanese government’s ongoing revitalization efforts.“The United States stood with Japan in March 2011, extending our support to help the country recover and rebuild, and through this resolution, we stand with them now in remembering the devastation of that day,” said Senator Coons. “In particular, our hearts are with the people of Miyagi Prefecture, which shares a 24-year relationship as the sister state of Delaware. The Japanese people are an example to us all of resolve and resilience. I look forward to deepening our friendship and partnership, built on a foundation of shared values between our two nations.”“The horrible earthquake on March 11, 2011, forever changed Japan, which is why I am pleased to introduce this resolution marking this solemn day with Senator Coons,” said Senator Hagerty. “As former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I had the opportunity to visit communities that were indelibly marked by that tragic day, but I also got to see firsthand the progress, the resilience, and the incredible spirit of the Japanese people. Japan is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, and Japan has no greater ally and friend than the United States.”The full text of the resolution is available here.###"
https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sens-coons-cornyn-and-reps-delauro-cole-blumenauer-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-expand-access-to-and-strengthen-civics-education,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), alongside U.S. Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Tom Cole (R-Okla.), and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), introduced the Civics Secures Democracy Act to restore the importance placed on civics education in American classrooms with targeted federal investments to support and expand access to civics and history education.“Civic engagement is vital for the health of our democracy,” said Senator Coons. “With expanded civics education in K-12 and higher education, this bill will equip new generations of Americans with a deeper understanding of their responsibilities as citizens and how to exercise their cherished rights. I am proud to work with Senator Cornyn and Representatives DeLauro, Cole, and Blumenauer on this bipartisan, bicameral effort to expand access to civics education and invest in the future of our democracy.”“The United States continues to be a model for the world because we are taught from a young age the merits of democracy, our Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the civic duties that are inherently part of being an American,” said Senator Cornyn. “This bill would help our schools inspire the next generation of public servants and teach all young Texans the value of freedom, and I’m glad to work with Sen. Coons on this bipartisan legislation.”“Over the last several decades, civics education in American schools has seen a significant decline,” said Congresswoman DeLauro. “The divide in this country continues to grow as we neglect civics education and fail to build a nation adequately informed of our democratic principles, norms, and institutions. Now, more than ever, it is important that we work together, across the aisle to invest in our young leaders—to secure our democracy for future generations. This legislation does just that. I am proud to work with my colleagues—Republicans, Congressman Tom Cole and Senator John Cornyn, as well as Democrats, Congressman Earl Blumenauer and Senator Chris Coons—on this critical initiative to bridge the divide in the United States and invest in the future of our democracy.”“In order to preserve America’s unique form of governance, prioritizing access to civics and history education is key,” said Congressman Cole. “As a former history teacher, I believe that lack of knowledge of America’s history is one of the greatest threats to preserving our republic and ensuring a prosperous future for generations to come. Indeed, when Americans have a deeper understanding of our nation’s history and founding principles, they become more engaged citizens, who participate in our government the way our Founding Fathers intended.”“The events of recent weeks have illustrated how fragile the democratic process is. We need to help train young people to appreciate how our democracy works,” said Congressman Blumenauer. “This effort has never been more important, and our legislation is an opportunity for the federal government to place money behind efforts to supercharge civics education.”“We are very grateful to the bi-partisan co-sponsors of the Civics Secures Democracy Act for recognizing that American history and civics are critical for K-12 schools right now and for the future,” said iCivics Executive Director and CivXNow Coalition Advisory Council Chair Louise Dube. “The CivXNow coalition is deeply committed to a solution that meets the considerable need to build up these subjects alongside STEM and literacy, and we believe the Civics Secures Democracy Act is just that. We thank Senators Coons and Cornyn and Representatives DeLauro, Cole, and Blumenauer for their leadership on this issue.”Research shows that students who receive quality civics education are more likely to vote, discuss politics at home, complete college, and develop skills that lead to employment. These students are also four times more likely to give back to their communities through volunteering and working on community issues and are more confident in their ability to speak publicly and communicate with their elected representatives.The Civics Secures Democracy Act would create a variety of grants to states, non-profits, institutions of higher education, and civics education researchers to support and expand access to civics and history education. Additionally, the legislation would strengthen the Truman Scholarship and Madison Fellowship foundations. It would also create a new fellowship named for revolution-era leader Prince Hall to strengthen and diversify the American history and civics teaching workforce. Finally, the bill would reauthorize and modernize an existing Higher Education Act grant program with an eye toward strengthening civics and history education in higher education and institutions’ partnerships with local school districts.This groundbreaking legislation specifically prohibits use of the funds for the development of any national curriculum in American history or civics education.A list of organization endorsements of this legislation is available here.The full text of this legislation is available here. A one-pager on the bill is available here.A section-by-section on the bill is available here.###
