Fischer outlined how if we don’t make these investments now, it will be harder for us to surge munitions production in a time of emergency or global instability. This is especially important when considering the rate at which Ukraine and Russia are running through munitions, as well as China’s dramatic military buildup.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer's remarksA full copy of Sen. Fischer’s remarks as prepared for delivery is below: M. President.Over the years, many historians have studied how exactly the United States was able to rapidly mobilize during World War II. It was truly a remarkable thing.One book – Freedom’s Forge, by Arthur Herman – summarizes the feat well. American manufacturers produced “two-thirds of all Allied military equipment used in World War II. That included 86,000 tanks, 2.5 million trucks and half a million jeeps, 286,000 warplanes, 8,800 naval vessels, 5,600 merchant ships, 434 million tons of steel, 2.6 million machine guns, and 41 billion rounds of ammunition – not to mention the greatest super bomber of the war, the B-29, and the atomic bomb.”In the blink of an eye, entire manufacturing industries retooled their factories, and began pumping out everything from fighter planes to ships and critical munitions.There is no doubt that our immense production capacity was a critical factor behind why the Allies won the war.The threat environment we face today is much different. There are a wide range of scenarios our nation has to be prepared for. And of course, the way our economy is structured is much different. This raises an important question – are we prepared to respond to the changing threat environment of the 21st century?Repeating that incredible moment in American history would not be easy. What we can – and should do – is identify which investments we can make to effectively meet these threats and deter any adversary. For years, we have underinvested in our munitions production capacity. We can start to reverse that by expanding already hot production lines, which would have an immediate, positive effect on readiness. If we don’t make these investments now, it will be harder for us to surge munitions production in a time of emergency or global instability. That’s a concern we should take seriously. During a crisis, surge capacity is one lever the Department of Defense must be able to pull to ensure decisionmakers have a range of options at their disposal.In fact, the ability to surge production of munitions is going to be vital to respond to most types of modern conflicts.How do we know this?Well just look at Ukraine and Russia and how quickly they are running through munitions.According to the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, Ukraine needs approximately 500 Javelin missiles every single day. Well, Lockheed Martin only produces around 2,100 missiles a year. When the report was published in June, RUSI also estimated Russia had used between 1,100 to 2,100 missiles during their invasion of Ukraine. That means “in three months of combat, Russia has burned through four times the US annual missile production” for cruise missiles. These examples are important benchmarks.You can do the math and pretty quickly come up with future scenarios where demand starts to strain supply. Another important factor is the People’s Republic of China, which both the Biden administration and the Trump administration identified as America’s pacing threat. China has spent the last two decades dramatically building up its military. According to DOD’s 2019 Missile Defense Review, “a key component of China’s military modernization is its conventional ballistic missile arsenal designed to prevent U.S. military access to support regional allies and partners.”And since then, China’s arsenal has continued to rapidly grow. Again – another important reference point that our nation will have to navigate.This should not be interpreted as fearmongering. I want to be clear that I have every confidence in our military’s ability to defend this nation and our allies. Army Assistant Secretary for Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology Doug Bush recently told reporters, for example, that he was “not uncomfortable” with our stockpile levels. However, as Assistant Secretary Bush noted, the Army is “doggedly working with industry […] to boost the production of certain weapons systems to keep Kyiv armed and the US well stocked.” In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that “in the U.S., it takes 13 to 18 months from the time orders are placed for munitions to be manufactured, according to an industry official. Replenishing stockpiles of more sophisticated weaponry such as missiles and drones can take much longer.” The United States, our allies, or our partners need these munitions. The challenge is that years of underinvestment has reduced our production capacities and the speed at which we can respond to increased demand. Clearly, there are significant benefits to expanding that capacity. Again, we have to be able to meet the changing threat environment and the rise of our near-peer competitors, like China.  Congress should take a few actions to address this challenge. First –invest more in our munitions production capacity.Second – pass a clean National Defense Authorization Act without delay. I secured an amendment in this year’s Senate NDAA to require the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to produce an annual report on our industrial base and potential constraints for munitions production. This type of reporting should help to further identify gaps in our production capacity, so we can further refine future investments.Overall – these actions would be an important step in the right direction. We know our adversaries will continue threatening global stability. We know, as shown by Russia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine, that our allies and partners will continue to need munitions. And we know the United States needs to be prepared for any scenario that threatens our national security. The best response to these stark and immediate realities is to expand our ability to produce the things we need to defend ourselves. If we do that, the greater our capacity is to project strength, react to any scenario, and better support allies and partners. Thank you. I yield the floor.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-are-we-prepared-to-respond-to-the-changing-threat-environment-of-the-21st-century20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Madelyn Creedon, Rose Gottemoeller, Eric Edelman, and Franklin Miller. Sen. Fischer’s questions to the witnesses focused on adversaries testing fractional orbital bombardment systems (FOBS), the security implications of these systems, and how that should inform our deterrence structures.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s remarksAn edited transcript of Senator Fischer’s exchange with the witnesses is copied below.Senator Fischer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to thank the panel for being here today and to all of you, thank you for your very strong comments in support of nuclear modernization. And Ms. Creedon – I especially took note, when you said we also have to factor in inflation, when we look at what is needed in order to keep up on schedule with regards to nuclear modernization. So thank you for that. Also, in looking at a nuclear arms race and looking at the New START Treaty and what's there – Mr. Miller, I liked to your comments about [how] Russia's not trustworthy and China is scornful. We all know that none of us want to see an arms race. But I would say to you that I think we're seeing one.We're seeing it with our peer competitors. And that would be Russia and China. They are in a race with us in trying to outpace the capabilities that we have.So I also appreciated many of the comments that we've heard so far with regard to that. […] Look at comments from members in the past – from Ash Carter for example, who said in the last 25 years, we've only made modest investments in basic sustainment and operations and we haven't built anything new in 25 years.We are seeing tremendous advancements from the Russians and the Chinese with what they are building, what they are testing, and what they are capable of, or will soon be capable of.Mr. Miller and Ambassador Edelman – I saw in your prepared statement that you refer to China's test of a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) as an “extremely destabilizing development.” And you go on to describe “a decapitation option that would also undermine many assumptions about deterrence and force governments to adopt very risky launch on warning postures.”We've heard similar testimony to that from Admiral Richard, but I don't remember us ever digging into this at any of our hearings. So I kind of wanted to go off on that today and have you explain this problem that we're facing. Give us a little more detail on that and walk us through why you feel that this system would be so destabilizing? Ambassador, would you like to start?Amb. Edelman: […] So the basis of deterrence, which we discovered after long and hard efforts during the first 15 to 20 years of the Cold War, was for each side to be able to have an assured second-strike capability – a retaliatory capability – that would allow it to ride out a first strike, and then inflict unacceptable damage on its adversary. In order to do that, you have to have robust nuclear command and control. And the danger that the FOBS test I think represents to us – the maximum danger is that it could be (because we don't really know why the Chinese did it), but it could be because of the path it takes, which evades our early warning systems and finishes, as Madeline pointed out, with a hypersonic glide vehicle, it could essentially be the basis of a no warning attack on the National Command Authority.Sen. Fischer: It's a first strike use, and it's also a surprise attack where we wouldn't have that warning, correct? Amb. Edelman: Correct. And that's the danger in it. Because the assumptions of stability are the ones that I articulated, that we have to maintain. But if I've misstated anything I know my colleagues will correct me. Mr. Miller: Eric didn't misstate anything. We faced short warning threats in the past from Soviet cruise missile submarines off our coast way back in the old days with Yankee class ballistic missile submarines, but we would know about the launch of those weapons and we would be able to track them.  In this case, as Amb. Edelman has said, we would not have that kind of warning if this system deorbited and we wouldn't be able to tell where it was going. So, everything that you've said and that Ambassador Edelman said is correct, Senator. Sen. Fischer: Do you believe that it is necessary for us to continue to look for other options that we could have in order to maintain a very strong deterrence, including being able to identify such surprise attacks so that we wouldn't see this decapitation happen to us and that would then be off the table?Mr. Miller: Yes, ma'am. I think we need to do that. And I think we need to continue to build a strong and robust nuclear command and control system. We have allowed that system to wither after the Cold War ended.The Department of Defense is now working to improve that. But that is an absolute priority as Madeline Creedon indicated, that's often forgotten. We talked about the triad, but command and control is at the heart of all of that. Sen. Fischer: I don't forget it. NC3 (nuclear command, control and communications) is extremely important. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.# # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-on-new-threats-facing-u-s-importance-of-modernizing-nuclear-deterrence20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Anthony J. Cotton to serve as the next Commander of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Sen. Fischer’s questions focused on the diversity of STRATCOM's missions and their importance to deterring 21st century threats.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s remarksAn edited transcript of Senator Fischer’s exchange with Gen. Cotton is copied below. Senator Fischer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman…General Cotton – a lot of times, in this Committee and on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces – our main focus is on modernization of our Triad.We also try to gain a fuller understanding of the future needs that our military must have to provide for national security. We talk about things like SLCM-N and the need that commanders such as yourself will have to have to provide options to the President when or if you are ever in that position. The more options you can present, the better for the security of this country and the better for the people of this country.  But also, under the duties and responsibilities of the STRATCOM combatant commander, we need to look at the importance of NC3 (nuclear command, control and communications), and we have to look at the NNSA’s (National Nuclear Safety Administration) supporting infrastructure as well.So General, I think that when we talk about nuclear modernization, and we have that focus on the Triad, on the weapons systems and the warheads, we should not forget about NC3 - the architecture - as well as the scientific and production infrastructure of NNSA. Can you talk about how important these elements are to the deterrent, and the modernization challenge that we're seeing in these areas as well? Gen. Cotton: Senator, I'd love to. You know, I'll start with NC3. I know there's members of the Committee that say that it's the fourth [part] of the triad, right, -- that it's the quad. I've heard folks say that. I call it the tapestry. In my opening statement, you heard me discuss and talk about how it is just as important as the platforms that we're talking about modernizing. And that is absolutely true. The good news is that it is still a resilient system today. What I like, having over 36 years in this business, is the conversations that people like yourself and others also see it as just as important as the weapon systems that we often talk about. If confirmed, I'd use my authorities. As everyone's aware, the “NEC” or the NC3 Enterprise Center that is located within Strategic Command, and the commander of Strategic Command having delegated oversight authorities to be able to make sure that we as a department are modernizing with next-gen technologies. I call it NC2 over assured comms – to ensure that we have the state-of-the-art NC3 systems that we need for not only today, not only for the midterm, but for the future. And that is going to be absolutely critical for us because I guarantee you that I want to ensure that we always outpace our adversaries who are also paying attention to our NC3 systems.Sen. Fischer: STRATCOM also has significant responsibilities for the electromagnetic spectrum operations. Can you describe some of the challenges in this mission area, and what STRATCOM is doing to help rebuild the force structure and the capabilities that we need?Gen. Cotton: Yes, ma'am. So from my vantage point, as a Joint Forces Air Component Commander, I can only give my vantage of what I have from the Air Force side of the House.If confirmed, I would like to make an assessment on the entire portfolio. But from our vantage point, I think we're a little behind.And I don't think, I know we're behind. But the good news is I know that we're working to try to close the gap on us not paying attention to EMS (Electromagnetic spectrum) for decades. So if confirmed, that would be one of the things that would be on the plate that I would absolutely want to assess and be the greatest advocate that could be as the commander of STRATCOM in ensuring that we have not just the pace of our adversaries, but lead our adversaries in that domain.# # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-discusses-diversity-of-stratcom-s-missions-with-nominee-to-lead-combatant-command20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The funding shortfall must be addressed as soon as possible to ensure eligible small and rural carriers are adequately reimbursed for costs associated with removing, destroying, and replacing affected equipment. These carriers serve some of the most rural and hard-to-reach places across the country and, without adequate reimbursements, their ability to provide ongoing service to customers is seriously jeopardized,” said Steven K. Berry, president and CEO, Competitive Carriers Association (CCA).Text of the full letter is available HERE.Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Co.), Gary Peters, and Cynthis Lummis also led the letter.Background:Due to security concerns, in 2020 the FCC prohibited the purchase of equipment manufactured by Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE and also prohibited the use of FCC-administered funds to expand or maintain networks with Huawei or ZTE equipment already present.The Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act was enacted in 2020 and given a $1.9 billion appropriation for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to help small network providers remove and replace high-risk network equipment. While the initial $1.9 billion was based on a voluntary survey of possible costs small network providers would incur, supply chain disruptions and additional program requirements (such as proper disposal of suspect equipment) added to the overall costs within the Reimbursement Program.# # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-highlights-importance-of-protecting-rural-networks-fully-funding-reimbursement-program-to-counter-chinese-threats20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Fischer’s speechA full copy of Sen. Fischer’s remarks as prepared for delivery is below: M. President. Agriculture is a critical part of Nebraska’s economy.It accounts for roughly $25.7 billion of Nebraska’s gross state product. That’s a little less than a quarter of our state’s overall GDP. Nearly one in four jobs in the state are tied to agriculture.That economic output is important. Because thanks to states like Nebraska, hard-working family farmers and ranchers produce a wide variety of products that keep our grocery stores stocked and help to feed the world. But our nation’s agricultural bounty doesn’t do anyone much good if it can’t get to market.That’s where our complex transportation and infrastructure system comes into play.The railroad industry, in particular, has a big role in bringing agricultural products to locations across the United States. That includes ports, where they can then be shipped to locations around the world.Whether its grain or soybeans, railroads provide the means to affordably move thousands of tons of goods to where they need to go. It’s estimated that rail delivers 1.6 million carloads of agricultural products a year.That’s why I am deeply concerned about the potential for a rail shutdown later this week.I think it’s important that people understand what kind of economic impact such a shutdown would have and how it would upend our nation’s agricultural sector.The consequences would be devastating.When agricultural products can’t be transported, there will be price hikes and shortages.Our international exports of commodities like corn, soy, wheat, of which a large share move by rail, will fall dramatically.Fertilizer prices – an already expensive input cost due to inflation – will further skyrocket. The mere prospect of a shutdown on Friday means fertilizer and other hazardous materials have already started to be removed from the rail networks on September 12th. Biofuel plants could be forced to scale down operations or completely shut down. I would also point out that we have harvest coming up in Nebraska. Family farmers in my state, many of whom are grappling with rapidly rising input costs, need a good harvest season.If rail service isn’t feasible, that possibility could go out the window. Grain elevators, for example, could run out storage and be unable to accept additional commodities. Family farmers and ranchers will lose critical revenue streams. The bottom line is if rail shuts down, our entire agricultural system shuts down. It’s that simple. All of this economic chaos would come on top of extreme inflation. Today’s numbers put grocery prices up 13.5% over last year. Think about the toll this out-of-control inflation is taking on our working-class families. Then there’s the international turmoil. Russia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine has dramatically curtailed the flow of grain, which in turn has exacerbated food insecurity in Africa and the Middle East. And the war has also further strained the fertilizer supply chain.All of this is to say – the stakes of these rail negations couldn’t be higher.9 of the 12 labor unions in the rail sector have been able to utilize the President Emergency Board recommendations to come to an agreement. I’d note that the board is composed of neutral, impartial individuals appointed by the President.Their recommendations are widely seen as benefiting all parties. It’s critical that the remaining labor unions and the rail industry use those recommendations to reach an agreement as soon as possible.Our entire agricultural system is at stake here. The economic welfare of the American people is at stake here. And global food security is at stake here.Thank you. I yield the floor.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-on-potential-rail-strike-impact-on-ag-economy20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Currently if an approved trucking school opens a secondary facility in a new location, existing laws require that Veterans Affairs and state regulators must deny the branch’s ability to receive GI benefits for two years.“Veterans have already given so much for our country – the last thing they need is more frustrating red tape that prevents them from pursuing a career that is essential to our modern economy. These technical changes will reverse unnecessary regulations and allow more veterans to take advantage of their GI benefits,” said Senator Fischer, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. “Our veterans deserve access to resources and opportunities to support themselves and their families after serving. This bill not only supports our servicemembers by expanding work opportunities, it would also help keep goods moving throughout our nation as we continue to face supply chain challenges. And it will expand their veterans’ GI Bill benefits to help them pursue educational and career training opportunities, while maintaining strong accrediting standards for institutions,” said Senator Padilla.“The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is proud to lend its support to this proposal for veterans seeking commercial driver education programs. This bill could help reduce nationwide supply chain shortages and veteran underemployment. The VFW thanks Senators Fischer and Padilla for their bipartisan efforts to address this multifaceted challenge,” said MaCherie Dunbar, Associate Director of VFW’s National Legislative Service.  “This legislation is a win-win. It supports our nation’s heroes in their pursuit of rewarding careers as they transition out of military service, and it expands our industry’s access to this exceptional pool of talent as we need to hire 1.1 million new drivers over the next decade. We thank Senators Fischer and Padilla for standing with America’s veterans and the men and women who keep our economy rolling,” said Chris Spear, American Trucking Associations President & CEO. “Werner Enterprises is a strong advocate for legislative changes that help military veterans pursue new career opportunities as professional truck drivers,” said Gregory Hamm, Werner Enterprises VP of Field & Government Recruiting.The bill has received endorsements from:Veteran Service Organizations: Veterans of Foreign Wars, Moving Veterans ForwardLabor: International Brotherhood of TeamstersTrucking Industry: Werner Trucking, American Trucking Association, Commercial Vehicle Training Association, Nebraska Trucking AssociationBackground The trucking industry is currently facing an 80,000-driver shortage, which some estimates show could reach 160,000 by 2030. Trucking shortages have a ripple effect throughout our nation’s supply chains, worsening bottle necks and delaying delivery times.It is estimated that 8,400 commercial driving programs are approved for use by eligible veterans under the GI bill. The Fischer-Padilla legislation would ensure CDL schools that offer courses at new branches do not have to wait two years if the primary institutions has been approved by the VA and SAA to receive funding. By clarifying this two-year moratorium statute, the bill will allow veterans more accessibility to nearby CDL schools and lead to high paying careers in the industry.CDL schools must still comply with state and VA rules regarding curriculum standards to ensure no programs are exploiting veterans or offering fraudulent courses. Click here to read the text of the bill.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/fischer-statement-on-biden-student-loan-games20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The bill, known as the Foster Care Stabilization Act, would authorize grants to foster care stabilization agencies to provide emergency relief and improve pre-placement services. “Having already faced significant hardships, foster kids deserve our full support and care. I’m proud to introduce legislation that will help to increase the resources available to kids transitioning into the foster care system to ensure their needs are better met. Thank you to the Foster Care Closet for your dedication to helping children and your collaboration on this important bill,” said Senator Fischer.“We are so honored to have spent the last two years working with Senator Fischer and her team to capture the work of the Foster CARE Closet and creating a bill that would allow for more foster youth in other areas of the United States be able to experience the same trauma-informed entry into foster care.  We believe that the bill that Senator Fischer has introduced will move us towards transforming how children experience their first hours in foster care,” said Leigh Esau, Executive Director of Nebraska Foster Care Closet.""Children enter foster care with so many needs -- concrete needs like food, clothing, and shelter, as well as more complex needs including mental health and trauma resources. The Foster Care Stabilization Act will enable organizations that support youth in care to meet children's immediate needs and ease their transition into the child welfare system. The Foster and Adoptive Parent Advocacy Center is committed to helping resource parents and kinship caregivers protect and provide for the children placed in their homes, and we are grateful to Senators Deb Fischer and John Hickenlooper for their leadership in supporting youth in foster care,” said Najiba Hlemi, Executive Director of Foster & Adoptive Parent Advocacy Center (FAPAC).""Lack of access to basic resources like clothing and toiletries often compounds the trauma children and youth experience after removal from family and entry into foster care. Young people should not be forced to access the court process to have these basic needs met. The Foster Care Stabilization Act is a step in the right direction to address this endemic problem,” said Allison Green, Legal Director of the National Association of Counsel for Children.“The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) applauds Senator Fischer and Senator Hickenlooper for the introduction of the Foster Care Stabilization Act of 2022.  These demonstration grants will highlight the urgent need to provide emergency relief to foster youth who often need personal necessities, food, etc. In addition to building support for the Foster Care Stabilization Act of 2022, CWLA will continue to work with Senator Fischer and Senator Hickenlooper on the expansion of this demonstration grant so the foster children throughout the country will have access to these necessities,” said Joe Huang-Racalto, Vice President of Public Policy & Strategic PartnershipsBackgroundIt’s estimated on any given day, there are 3,000 children in foster care in Nebraska. In many circumstances, children entering the foster care system lack basic supplies, such as clothes or other personal necessities.Foster care stabilization agencies have the expertise and experience to provide direct services to children to address these issues.

Fischer’s remarks as prepared for delivery is below:M. President, let me state the obvious. Billions of dollars in reckless spending and major tax hikes will not solve the economic crisis our nation finds itself in. Yet somehow this concoction of truly terrible economic policies is exactly what my colleagues on the Democratic side are pursing.   Let’s start with the tax hikes. In the Schumer-Manchin bill, they’ve proposed imposing a corporate minimum tax on big bad corporations. 50% of this change would be borne by the manufacturing industry – an industry both Republicans and Democrats have been trying to grow, not harm with bad policies. Manufacturers are already struggling to navigate inflation and the supply chain crisis. This bill punishes manufacturers, and there is no question that this would hurt the middle class by raising prices and lowering wages. At a time of historic inflation, manufacturers will have no choice but to pass on higher prices to the consumer. And that’s just one part of it. Democrats say the rich should pay their fair share. Well let’s look at this. A non-partisan analysis of the entire bill found that it would cause a $16.7 billion tax increase for American taxpayers earning less than $200,000 in 2023. President Biden is going back on his promise and raising taxes for those earning less than $400,000 – during a recession. What about the claim that this proposal will address inflation?   The Penn-Wharton Budget Model, which Senator Manchin frequently cites for producing the best economic analysis, found the proposal produces no meaningful reduction in the deficit or inflation.  Any suggestion otherwise is insulting to the intelligence of the American people.  Now let’s look at the reckless spending. Why – during a time of significant economic hardship -- should the American people be on the hook to fund $369 billion in incentives to Green New Deal businesses to promote green energy policies? Can anyone in this chamber argue with a straight face that subsidizing Tesla purchases will help to ease inflation? It certainly won’t help working families.  Then there’s the $80 billion for the IRS, which is six times the agency’s current annual budget.   Democrats are once again trying hire an armada of new IRS agents -- 87,000 to be exact.  This would unleash a wave of new audits – half of which would hit American’s making $75,000 or less.  We’ve been here before. The public doesn’t want this deal.   Bottom line – it’s clear this economy isn’t working for the American people.  The Biden administration’s policies have saddled this country with: two consecutive months of negative economic growth, which is the definition of a recession, 9.1% inflation, a negative 3.6% inflation-adjusted decline in pay for workers, and more Americans than ever before holding two full-time jobs.  In the face of all this hardship, we need real solutions – not more of the same backwards spending policies.  The cute name that Senators Schumer and Manchin have come up with for their proposal shouldn’t hide the facts.  And the facts are, massive tax hikes and billions of dollars in reckless government spending is the last thing our country needs right now. So why are we even debating such a terrible bill? A short history lesson may offer some answers.People may recall something called the Cornhusker Kickback – an agreement in 2009 between my predecessor and Senator Harry Reid.

Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) Pete Buttigieg testified before the committee.During her line of questioning with Sec. Buttigieg, Sen. Fischer highlighted how critical the Essential Air Service (EAS) is to communities across Nebraska and the country.Sen. Fischer also raised questions regarding whether the Department of Transportation is properly implementing the bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as how the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approaches working with state and local partners.EAS Background:Last week, Sen. Fischer sent a letter to Secretary Buttigieg regarding the key role the Essential Air Service plays in rural Nebraska. Sen. Fischer noted the importance of the DOT’s work with local airport authorities to ensure contracted service is not interrupted and the replacement review process goes smoothly. A copy of the letter can be found here.In March, SkyWest Airlines announced they would be discontinuing air service at three Nebraska communities including Kearney, North Platte, and Scottsbluff.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s questions A transcript of Sen. Fischer’s line of questioning is copied below (edited for clarity):On the importance of Essential Air Service to Nebraska and other states:Sen. Fischer: Secretary Buttigieg, in March, SkyWest filed a 90-day notice of its intent to terminate service at 29 Essential Air Service communities. Nebraska has three communities served by SkyWest: Kearney, North Platte, and Scottsbluff. I’m concerned about this development because Essential Air Service is critical for these rural communities. Last week, I sent a letter requesting that DOT continue issuing a hold-in order for these Nebraska airports – requiring SkyWest to perform the minimum service required by statute. Will you commit to continue issuing “hold-in” orders to SkyWest, and ensure their contractual obligations are upheld in providing service to these rural communities?Sec. Buttigieg: Thank you for the question. We recognize how important EAS is and share your concern about this announcement by SkyWest. As you know, the DOT has ordered them to continue service. And while we will prepare a formal response to your letter, I tell you we envision extensions to ensure the public is served.Sen. Fischer: Thank you. I hope that you will work with my office to preserve the Essential Air Service program that ensures smaller communities across my state and across this country can access larger aviation network.On reporting on a recent FHWA memo and strong-arming state DOTs on the implementation on the bipartisan infrastructure law:Sen. Fischer: Mr. Secretary, I found recent comments from political appointees within the administration to be extremely worrisome when it comes to decision-making that is traditionally left up to the states. For example, internal guidance about the December 16th FHWA memo directed staff on how to implement not only discretionary grants, but also formula funding and the NEPA process. These actions do not align with the bipartisan intent of law – a law that I supported.It appears that this administration intends to have a heavy-handed and an adversarial approach with the state DOTs in the implementation of the highway program. This is a stark departure for the FHWA’s relationship with state DOTs historically.Mr. Secretary, do you feel the administration is trying to strong-arm state DOTs and local partners in the implementation of the law, in order to advance the climate change goals that didn’t make it into the bipartisan bill?Sec Buttigieg: Senator, I would say we very much value our working partnership with state departments of transportation, and we recognize that there are different conditions of needs in different states. We view the guidance as stating common sense priorities that are important to us as an administration and a department, but also take care to make sure that any guidance that goes out – internally or externally – is compatible with the law as written. Certainly nothing in this guidance would preclude any lawful use of funds from taking place, and if there is ever any indication that comes to you of any project that otherwise lawful that runs into trouble, I would welcome the chance to speak with you about it.Sen. Fischer: I will hold that to you, sir, that we have that conversation. I know it is not just in my state department of transportation but it is many others across this country that are concerned with the direction they see this going.On the FHWA’s approach to working with state and local partners:Sen. Fischer: In your view, what is the FHWA Administrator’s role in working with transportation partners that have the boots on the ground and are charged with “turning dirt” to complete these projects?Ultimately the success of this program depends on the local and state partners to get the job done. It is not federal bureaucrats that are going to be doing this.Sec Buttigieg: Again, we view this as a partnership. Of course, we have a responsibility to make sure that the states spend the funds in ways that are compliant with federal law. But ultimately the bulk of the dollars are directed and deployed by those state leaders. Federal Highways has a presence on the ground in every state, which allows us to have an especially tight working relationship.What I’ve found is that different states are at different levels of energy when it comes to pursuing some of the goals that are of interest federally and have different priorities based on conditions on the ground. But I think what is most important is to ensure that these dollars are used in a way that maximizes the value for the taxpayers. We recognize that may mean different things in different contexts, but we’ll be responsible for ensuring that any use is compliant with the law.Sen. Fischer: I appreciate that because every state is different. Every state has funded different infrastructure projects within their state differently as well. To be able to have a state set priority without the federal government coming in, or without federally elected Senators or Representatives picking projects that they think should be priorities. I think you have to look at how states set those priorities, how they determine what those priorities are based on the plans they have worked on forever, and the goals they have set forth in their five year and ten year plans – in meeting the growth that they see in various parts of their states. It’s extremely important to be able to have those decisions be made at the state and local level, don’t you agree?Sec Buttigieg: I agree. It’s in the context of a dialogue where Washington is never going to know all the details with local context. On the other hand, we may have access to best practices or important things to consider. We value that exchange where we provide whatever knowledge, insight, and resources we can, and the states are on the ground implementing the formula dollars.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/fischer-pushes-transportation-sec-buttigieg-to-address-essential-air-service-challenges-in-nebraska20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Her legislation strikes us as a reasonable approach to ensure that the cattle market will operate fairly. As we said in October: ‘It’s in the interest not only of cattle producers but of the general public itself that the market operate fairly, transparently and efficiently. Otherwise, the market can be subject to distortion and possible manipulation, harming producers and consumers alike.’”Click HERE or on the image above to read more from Progressive FarmerProgressive Farmer’s ShayLe Stewart noted: “The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) has been sheepish about the bill after its study of how a voluntary cash cattle market would work in today's marketplace failed miserably. Why you ask?As Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., stated at the hearing, ""It didn't work because packers didn't participate."" The United States Cattlemen's Association has backed the bill from its origin, and as William ""Ricky"" Ruffin (a cattle producer from Mississippi who testified on behalf of USCA) said, ""It may not be perfect, but it throws cattlemen a real-life raft."" Click HERE or on the image above to read more from NTVNTV reported: “From small ranches to the biggest feedlots and packing plants shipping all over the world, Nebraska is the epicenter of all things beef… Enter legislation by Senator Fischer and her colleagues that takes several steps, that they say shifts power back to producers.

Fischer highlighted how her legislation would ensure every segment of the beef supply chain can succeed. She also noted that while there is near universal concern over the lack of price discovery and market transparency, voluntary efforts to address these concerns have largely failed from a lack of packer participation. Furthermore, instead of being in the driver’s seat, as was claimed by some witnesses, family ranchers often face a “take it or leave it” market. Finally, Sen. Fischer heard from a producer witness how increases in negotiated sales have not resulted in the economic losses some opponents have predicted.Two panels of witnesses appeared before the committee. Panel one consisted of USDA Senior Advisor for Fair and Competitive Markets Andy Green and USDA Administrator for Agricultural Marketing Service Bruce Summers. Panel Two consisted of William Ruffin of Ruffin Farms, Kansas Livestock Association and Tiffany Cattle Company President-elect Shawn Tiffany, Ziesch Ranch Owner/Operator Shelly Ziesch, and Colorado State Agricultural & Resource Economics Professor Dr. Stephen Koontz. Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s remarks/questions (panel one)  Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s remarks/questions (panel two)  Key excerpts from Sen. Fischer’s remarks/ line of questioning are copied below (edited for clarity): On the importance of the cattle industry to the state of Nebraska:Sen Fischer: As all of you know, Nebraska is the beef state. I represent every segment of the supply chain from cow-calf producers, to backgrounders, to large and small feed yards and also, we have 3 of the 4 big packers in the state of Nebraska. The livestock industry contributes $13.8 billion to Nebraska’s economy annually. It is the economic engine of my state. I first introduced legislation nearly two years ago after hearing concerns from cattle producers in Nebraska, but also from producers all across this nation. Sen. Grassley has introduced legislation for 20 years. This is not a new issue. This is not an issue that came about due to Covid. It has existed for years.The goal of this legislation has not changed – we want to ensure every segment of the beef supply chain can succeed by ensuring robust price discovery and market transparency.On the “take it or leave it” market producers face every day:Sen Fischer: Madam Chairwoman, I have a letter of support from the Nebraska Cattlemen about the need for robust price discovery and market transparency.I wish we could have had a Nebraska producer here but as is noted in their letter, “none of our producer members we encouraged to testify were willing to put themselves out front for fear of possible retribution by other market participants – an unfortunate reality of today’s cattle industry.”This concern demonstrates an imbalance in market power.Chairwoman Stabenow – I ask for unanimous consent to submit this letter from Nebraska Cattlemen into the record.I would also like to highlight a series of articles from the Omaha World Herald. The latest article discusses that producers’ share of the beef dollar has continued to decline while the packers’ share went up 31% last year. Some today will claim that, “The seller is in the driver’s seat.” We all know how out of touch from reality that is.If cattle producers were in the driver’s seat, they would set a price and the packer would take it.  Instead, producers take the price that is offered by the buyer. Producers face a take it or leave it market – that is the reality.   On how increases in negotiated cash sales have not resulted in economic losses:Sen. Fischer: Mr. Ruffin – as a producer who sells cattle into Texas, you can speak to real world impacts that we see that negotiated trade will bring.When the Texas/ Oklahoma/ New Mexico region increased their negotiated trade, did you experience significant economic losses as some economists have claimed?Mr. Ruffin: Senator, I did not. I guess the problem is, from where I stand as a small cow/calf producer and backgrounder in Mississippi, price hasn’t really changed much up or down. Even though I know that packers are reaping premium price for animals. [...]Sen. Fischer: Thank you, sir. It’s good to hear from producers that increased negotiated trade did not impose a cost upward of 65 dollars a head as some economic models have suggested.This large of a cost would have been noticeable in the real world and impacted your bottom line. # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/recap-senate-ag-committee-hearing-on-fischer-s-cattle-price-discovery-and-transparency-act20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The bill is named for Larry and Christy Hammer of Omaha, who tragically lost their lives in a fire in their cabin onboard a Peruvian river cruise on April 10th, 2016. This Sunday marks the six-year anniversary of the incident.“As we approach the six-year anniversary of Larry and Christy Hammer’s passing, I’m reintroducing Hammers’ Law. This bipartisan bill aligns the cruise industry with the aviation industry, ensuring families affected by wrongful deaths aboard a cruise ship can pursue fairer compensation. It’s been an honor to work with the Hammers’ daughters on this bill to hold cruise lines accountable,” said Senator Fischer.“This measure is an important step toward ensuring families can hold cruise lines accountable when their loved ones tragically die onboard. Outdated laws restrict family members from seeking fair compensation following a devastating loss. I’m proud to work with Senator Fischer on this bipartisan effort to update our laws and provide justice to families after a cruise catastrophe,” said Senator Blumenthal.""Hammers' Law will protect all American cruise passengers by finally holding the cruise industry to the same standard of accountability as that of the airline industry. In honor of our parents and all those who have lost loved ones on cruise ships, we hope that this law will help prevent future tragedies from devastating more families. We are grateful to Senators Fischer and Blumenthal for their commitment to safeguarding the millions of Americans who cruise each year,"" said the Hammers’ daughters, Jill Hammer Malott and Kelly Hammer Lankford.  More information:Hammers’ Law would amend an over 100-year-old law, known as the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA). In modern times, the cruise industry uses DOHSA to avoid financial accountability for the wrongful deaths of passengers who do not have dependents or income. These passengers – including children, students, and retirees – account for a significant portion of the 12 million Americans who cruise each year. As retirees, Larry and Christy Hammer did not have financial dependents or wages, so antiquated DOHSA rules restricted the Hammer family from pursuing the accountability that would likely be available for wrongful deaths occurring on dry land. DOHSA was amended in 2000 to allow the same kind of compensation for victims of major airline accidents.Passing Hammers’ Law will enable future families to pursue fairer compensation when similar tragedies strike. And it will hold the responsible cruise line accountable by allowing for compensation that more fully reflects the company’s negligence.Hammers’ Law was first introduced in 2019.Read the full text of the bill here. # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/fischer-blumenthal-reintroduce-hammers-law-for-omaha-natives-killed-in-2019-cruise-ship-fire20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Fischer highlighted her frustration with the over-classification of important national security strategy documents, as well as the fact that the administration’s specific budget justifications have yet to be released. Sen. Fischer noted these factors make it difficult to have substantive, public debates on our country’s approach to national security and what should be prioritized in the budget. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley were witnesses before the committee.   Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s questioning A transcript of Sen. Fischer’s line of questioning is below (edited for clarity): Sen. Fischer: Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by noting my frustration with the timing of this hearing. We are here today to review the Department’s budget, but we have no detailed budget justification data. My understanding is that the J-Books will be released mid-April.We can’t talk about strategy either. The administration’s National Defense Strategy, the Nuclear Posture Review, and the Missile Defense Review were submitted to Congress last week, but all of the documents are classified.Last year, and in 2017 and 2018, this committee delayed the Secretary’s testimony so that there was ample time to review the budget and have a meaningful oversight hearing. I’m disappointed that was not the case this year.With respect to the NDS and the NPR, I would note that the previous administration released these documents publicly in early 2018, and the committee had almost three months to review them before Secretary Mattis and General Dunford appeared to testify.Sec. Austin, in your opening comments, you said that in this budget, resources are matched to strategy, matched to policy, matched to the will of the people. I think having this hearing without any detailed information about the budget, and when we are unable to openly discuss any of the administration’s strategy documents, directly undermines the committee’s ability to conduct its oversight work, and is contrary to the spirit of transparent government that these public hearings are intended to support.I will be deferring most of my questions to the classified portion, but I do have a few questions that we were able to glean from the toplines that we were given. Secretary Austin, Section 1684 of the 2017 NDAA directed the Department to designate an acquisition authority to be responsible for defense of the homeland from cruise missile threats, but the Department has still not made such a designation. What is the status of this? Does the Department intend to make a designation, and when can we expect that to happen? Sec. Austin: We do intend to make a designation, and we’ll move out smartly on that. In terms of being transparent and when the budget is released -- it’s our goal, it’s our desire, it’s our mandate to be as transparent with you as possible. Sen. Fischer: I would point out that one of my missions I’ve talked to you about, to all the service chiefs about, and to the joint chiefs about – is to be able to declassify much of the material that we see as members of Congress. I think there are ways to do that. We have to be able to do that so the people of this country understand the threats that we face. So that the people of this country, when they have that information and can review it themselves – they will support our national defense and our national security. And I feel that we have gone backwards here in making these classified documents and not being transparent. But if I could continue -- given the increasing cruise missile threat to the United States, again I think it’s important that we make this designation as it was in the 2017 NDAA, which was a long time ago. So I hope you step up and do this. Also, Secretary Austin, under this budget, the Air Force is divesting 369 aircraft this year and buying 87 – a net loss of 282. The five-year plan projects buying 467 aircraft and divesting 1,468 aircraft, a loss of 1,001 aircraft. And the Navy’s battle force shrinks as well under this budget, dropping from 298 ships today to 280 in FY 2027. I’m open to the concept of divesting from legacy platforms, but I think that is a dangerous way to put stress on the force that we have. So how are we planning to deal with that dilemma? Are we expecting operational demands to fall, and how realistic is that? Sec. Austin: First let me just affirm that there will be an unclassified version of the strategy that comes out later. In terms of divestment and investment, we are investing in those capabilities that will enable us to be decisive in the future fight. And those capabilities that are not survivable in that fight, we have to divest of them. And also because they are expensive to maintain. We can use those resources to invest in future capabilities, the kind that we need in the next fight. That’s our strategy. So as you match the budget to the strategy, you’ll find a direct match.  Sen. Fischer: Thank you – I hope you remember it has to be matched to the will of the American people as well. # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/fischer-on-biden-s-fy23-dod-budget-lack-of-transparency-missing-justification-details20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=DF8A7F7B-471E-4676-A37F-2B880C149F27,"WASHINGTON, DC. – U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, today participated in the committee’s hearing on petroleum markets and high gas prices. During her line of questioning, Sen. Fischer highlighted the harms that President Biden’s failed energy policies are having on consumers at the pump and the administration’s ongoing effort to shift blame for high gas prices to Vladimir Putin and the private sector. Sen. Fischer has cosponsored a bill to expand usage of American biofuels to tackle the energy crisis, as well as legislation to ban Russian petroleum imports. Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma was one of the witnesses for the committee hearing.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s questioning A transcript of Sen. Fischer’s line of questioning is below: Sen. Fischer: Thank you to the witnesses for being here today, but I am disappointed that we are taking valuable committee time to consider a matter that is not on solid jurisdictional footing.We certainly have jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, which in turn, has critical responsibilities to protect Americans from corporate practices that are unfair or deceptive. This includes: Fighting pandemic-related fraud, protecting children online, creating federal privacy protections to keep our personal data safe. These are just some of the key consumer harms that this committee can be overseeing, discussing, and advancing legislation for.Instead, today I guess we can discuss the harms that President Biden’s failed energy policies are having on consumers. The list of these failures is long. The president made his anti-American energy agenda clear on day one of his presidency.He revoked the Keystone XL pipeline’s permit and updated the “social cost of carbon” – estimates used to justify burdensome regulations, while rejecting infrastructure projects. During his second week in office, President Biden issued an executive order to ban new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior has yet to hold a lease sale following that executive order, despite being required to under current law.The administration has doubled down on blame-shifting, claiming that “the reason why the price of gas is going up is not because of steps the president has taken, they are because President Putin is invading Ukraine.” His press secretary said that.But Americans know that inflation was happening long before Putin invaded Ukraine. We are here to today not because of some plot by the energy companies: We are here because the President continues to shift the blame on high gas prices to anyone and everyone but himself.It has been disappointing to see this administration look to other countries to increase oil production instead of turning to domestic, American-made sources. We should be taking an all-of-the-above approach domestically to drive down the cost of gas for our rural families.Ms. Sgamma, would you please elaborate on the need for domestic production to be the focus of American energy security instead of relying on imports?Ms. Sgamma: Thank you for the question. In 2019, we were a net exporter of oil. We are down about 1.1 million barrels a day of American production. We would love to increase production and fill that void. That’s certainly a better option than just dispensing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We are ready and able. I represent small producers in the Rocky Mountain West, but all across the country American producers are ready and able to increase production. But we need policies that encourage that production. And we are not seeing that from this administration.Sen. Fischer: And what’s the biggest hindrance to increasing that production?Ms. Sgamma: Right now, it’s access to capital. There’s a specific movement afoot and it started several years ago with activist investors, but it has been encouraged by this administration and would be codified if the SEC rule is finalized.Sen. Fischer: You mentioned the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We’ve seen President Biden announce at the end of March the release of one million barrels of oil from that reserve per day for the next six months. This move comes only two weeks after the strategic petroleum reserves hit the lowest levels in decades. And, it wasn’t that long ago that Democrats celebrated blocking attempts to replenish the strategic reserve when oil prices were at near-record lows. The continued use of the strategic reserves to combat high gas prices is a weak, short-term solution that does not adequately address the issue. can you discuss what potential impacts could occur if the U.S. continues to empty the strategic petroleum reserves?Ms. Sgamma: Under the ground we’ve got reserves about one thousand-fold bigger than the SPR. It would be better for us to encourage that production of a million barrels a day than to drain down our petroleum reserve, which we have to at taxpayer expense fill back up again. Why not just encourage production from the American industry. We finance that, that’s private sector financing, not government spend.  # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/fischer-on-high-gas-prices-biden-s-anti-american-energy-agenda20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Don Bacon (NE-02) introduced the bill to honor Officer French last June, which passed the House of Representatives in February. Sen. Fischer introduced companion legislation in the Senate last July.French, who lived in Omaha for a big portion of his life, was a Navy mess attendant on the USS Gregory during World War II. In September 1942, when the Gregory was hit by Japanese naval gunfire near Guadalcanal, he helped 15 of his crewmates into a life raft and swam for nearly eight hours through nightfall and surrounding sharks in order to avoid being captured by the Japanese on shore. The men were later identified and rescued, and French received a letter of commendation from the then commander of the Southern Pacific Fleet for his valor. However, the survivors of the Gregory felt French deserved a much higher tribute, but he died without such a recognition.More information from the Omaha World-Herald about Officer French here.Click here to read the text of the legislation. # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/bill-to-honor-wwii-hero-moves-out-of-committee20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=80AF3DA1-0FA2-4D70-81D5-39689F7E5ACE,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Several national and Nebraska agriculture organizations have emphasized their support for U.S. Senator Deb Fischer’s (R-Neb.) updated Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act. Sen. Fischer, who is a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced the new version of the bill this week with Sens. Grassley (R-Iowa), Tester (D-Mont.), and Wyden (D-Ore.). “Thank you to Senators Fischer, Grassley, Tester, and Wyden for their relentless pursuit to advance legislation that strengthens the bottom line of the U.S. cattle producer. There has never been this much momentum for industry change, both in the countryside and in the Capitol. USCA stands with county, state, and national producer associations across the U.S. in supporting mandatory cash trade minimums – a concept that is also supported by the majority of Senate Agriculture Committee members…” said U.S. Cattlemen’s Association (USCA) President Brooke Miller.“Rampant consolidation in the cattle industry has made pricing in the cattle market increasingly opaque. Fair cand competitive markets rely on price discovery and transparency. For farmers and ranchers to bargain effectively with packers, they need access to reliable, accurate pricing information. This bill would shed light on the market and bring about greater fairness. NFU thanks Senators Tester, Grassley, Fischer, and Wyden for their continued leadership on this issue. The bill improves upon the version from November 2021, and we encourage swift action by the Senate and House on this legislation,” said National Farmers Union (NFU) President Rob Larew. “Nebraska Farm Bureau and the farm and ranch families we represent continue to thank Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer for her leadership in helping to provide needed reforms to Nebraska’s cattle industry. The complexities and controversies surrounding the way cattle are marketed within the United States cannot be understated. However, as with every issue she champions, Sen. Fischer remains steadfast in her commitment to do what’s right for farmers, ranchers, and all Nebraskans. NEFB remains committed to working with Senator Fischer to provide additional cattle market transparency and price discovery,” said Nebraska Farm Bureau (NEFB) President Mark McHargue.“Nebraska Farmers Union (NeFU) strongly supports Senators Fischer, Grassley, Tester, and Wyden’s updated Cattle Market Reform Bill. This negotiated bipartisan bill represents an historic opportunity to substantially improve and reform beef markets. It will increase beef market competition, transparency, the volume of mandatory price reporting data, cash market sales, penalties for packer violations, and establishes a cattle contract library. NeFU supports all those critical beef market reform provisions. We strongly urge the Senate Ag Committee and Congress to take full advantage of the bipartisan momentum that exists to restore competition in beef markets. The current non-competitive system is systematically squeezing multi-generational family businesses out of business. We thank Senator Fischer for her hard work, tenacity, and leadership. Beef production is the largest source of farm income in Nebraska, and is critical to the future of our state,” said Nebraska Farmers Union (NeFU) President John Hansen. ""Price discovery is a public good. Negotiated market participants invest time and resources to discover fed cattle prices for their respective regions and the entire industry. Until price discovery participation is better valued at all points in the supply chain, live cattle market price negotiation will continue to decrease until there is little to no negotiated trade left and outside markets will have to be relied upon for price determination. We thank Senator Fischer for her continued work and dedication to identifying resolutions to this complicated issue,” said Nebraska Cattlemen President Brenda Masek.  More information:The updated bill would:   Click here to read the amended bill text. Click here for an updated one-pager on the bill.  Click here for an updated section-by-section summary of the bill.  # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/continued-support-for-fischer-s-updated-cattle-market-reform-bill20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The senators first introduced the bill in November.“Our family farmers and ranchers have told us about the need for both robust price discovery and transparency in the cattle markets. The updates to our legislation incorporate a variety of stakeholder feedback to achieve our goal of ensuring more fairness in cattle markets. It’s encouraging to see our bill gain momentum and I am hopeful we will have a hearing on this important legislation in the Senate Agriculture Committee in the coming weeks,” said Senator Fischer, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.“I frequently hear from Iowa’s independent cattle producers about their struggle to get a fair price for their cattle while the nation’s four largest packers operate with record profits. I pushed for hearings in the Senate’s Agriculture and Judiciary committees to shine a light on these unfair market practices, and I’ve continued working with a bipartisan group of senators to develop a solution. Our latest proposal comes after months of working with staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to make technical changes that will allow them to best implement the bill. It takes several steps to improve cattle price transparency and will make much-needed market reforms to help independent producers in Iowa and across the country. This bipartisan bill is the best opportunity we have to make real reform in the cattle market this year, and I’ll continue to work with my colleagues to get this across the finish line,” said Senator Grassley, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  “For too long, large corporations have raised prices on working families while giving Montana ranchers the short end of the stick. Increasing price discovery will give producers more control and better information when they sell their livestock, and is a key step in making markets more competitive. Montana ranchers raise the best beef in the world, and it’s about time they got a fair cut for their premium product,” said Senator Tester.“Oregon’s ranchers shouldn’t face an unfairly tilted marketplace that favors corporate meat packers and undercuts their small family businesses from producing nationally renowned beef for consumers. This bipartisan legislation shows how both parties can come together to level the playing field by restoring market fairness, efficiency, and transparency for U.S. cattle ranchers,”said Senator Wyden, Chair of the Senate Finance Committee.The updated bill would: Click here to read the amended bill text. Click here for an updated one-pager on the bill. Click here for an updated section-by-section summary of the bill. ###Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/fischer-grassley-tester-wyden-unveil-updated-cattle-market-reform-bill20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Fischer discussed her bipartisan legislation to counter dark patterns online, and highlighted the need for such legislation given the current lack of guidance on ethics for designing technology that influences human behavior.Earlier this week, Senator Fischer, along with Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and John Thune (R-S.D.), reintroduced the Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction (DETOUR) Act. The bill would rein in the use of these dishonest user interfaces to protect children online and help the American people better protect their personal data.Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s questioning.An edited transcript of a key exchange is copied below.Excerpt from Senator Fischer’s exchange with Dr. Dean Eckles, Associate Professor of Marketing at MIT Sloan:Sen. Fischer: […] Yesterday, I was proud to re-introduce the DETOUR Act with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Thune, and Klobuchar. The Act would prohibit large online platforms from purposely using deceptive user interfaces – also known as dark patterns. Many of us can recognize the dark patterns we’ve personally experienced – where we’re trapped into clicking, clicking, clicking, clicking. Trapped into buying, or signing up for something you don’t really want because the user interface intentionally confuses the options. Our legislation would take an important step, I believe, to restore the hidden options and improve user autonomy. Dr. Eckles, I appreciated your technical perspective about how persuasive technologies are developed, as we seek to craft related policies. Do you think that we have enough debate and guidance on the ethics in designing technology that influences our behavior within the tech industry? Or in academia?Dr. Eckles: Thank you, Senator. I would like to see more discussion of these ethical issues in the tech sector and in the public as well. And especially not just from ex-tech insiders who now are repenting, but really drawing on kind of the rich expertise we have from ethicists and policymakers. In the way, that bioethicists have provided some guidance in the context of thinking about clinical trials, etc. I do think we want more guidance there. One of the things that I think of with the DETOUR Act, at least the last version I was familiar with, was that from my perspective it is very important to allow and encourage these platforms to continue to do A/B tests, continue to do randomized trials. That’s much of the evidence that I’ve drawn on. Whether published work by those platforms or leaked, is A/B tests by those platforms. So, while I hope that we can shut down some of these dark patterns that have to do with subscriptions services etc. etc...Sen. Fischer: Do you think that designers and developers right now are approaching or taking into consideration the ethical consequences here?Dr. Eckles: Thank you, Senator. I think that at firms that are established and have found themselves with a bit of a breathing room and a large staff with technical expertise, they are. I mean in some ways that’s part of what we’ve seen in the Facebook Files leaks. Is a huge amount of disagreement and debate about some of these issues. But a lot of times that happens only after some engineer quickly built something, it got big and now there’s a whole bunch of data scientists and researchers to clean up the mess. Sen. Fischer: So how do you get the ethical considerations at the front end of development? How do you incentivize or encourage, I’d rather go that route, to have designers really work, not just with government but with business and academia to be able to get that done? How do you do it?Dr. Eckles: Thanks, Senator. I think one way is to make the public and all these designers really aware of the long-term negative consequences of some of these choices. Right? Facebook’s reputation is still deeply hurting from some of these moves fast and break decisions they made years and years ago. So, that’s a consequence that they are living with that brand. Thinking about that as an entrepreneur is really important. From my perspective, I also think about that in the context of education. We’re burgeoning enrollment in computer science programs. Ethics, and these considerations, and social sciences have to be a part of the curriculum in some way. I know in some of my own teachings in analytics I try and bring that in. It’s also useful to draw on additional expertise. We’re trying to hire a philosopher of technology ethics at the moment at MIT, in order to help this be a part of the curriculum.Sen. Fischer: I think that it’s important that we bridge the technical consideration with the policy we seek to implement. And I appreciated your points about the value of A/B testing, which remains important if we’re going to have improved user experiences and distinct from the dark patterns that we are trying to address.More background on the DETOUR Act:The DETOUR Act aims to curb manipulative behavior by prohibiting the largest online platforms (those with over 100 million monthly active users) from relying on user interfaces that intentionally impair user autonomy, decision-making, or choice.

The CRA resolution passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 52-48. Senator Fischer was a co-sponsor of the resolution. “I have and continue to encourage Nebraskans to consider getting vaccinated. I hope more Americans will join me in choosing to get the vaccine – but that is their choice.  “There is no question that President Biden’s vaccine mandate on businesses is divisive, counterproductive, and raises constitutional concerns. Businesses across Nebraska have reached out to me about the considerable damage this mandate will do to their employees and companies.“There is simply no precedent for this type of intrusion into the American people’s private lives. The bipartisan challenge to this mandate underscores the administration’s unprecedented abuse of federal authority on this matter,” said Senator Fischer.In October, Senator Fischer urged President Biden to reconsider his vaccine mandate.Before the vote, Senator Fischer spoke on the Senate floor about her opposition to President Biden’s vaccine mandate on businesses.

During the hearing, Sen. Fischer discussed how shipping bottlenecks have hurt Nebraska businesses, including the agriculture export industry, and limited consumers’ access to important goods. Norm Krug, founder and CEO of Preferred Popcorn (Chapman, Nebraska) participated in the hearing. Click the image above to watch video of Sen. Fischer’s questioning. An edited transcript of key exchanges is copied below. A written copy of Sen. Fischer’s opening statement is also copied below.Key Excerpts from Senator Fischer’s Exchange with Norm Krug:On how traditional shipping times have skyrocketed, and the impact these delays are having on ag products: Sen.  Fischer: In a normal year, Norm, how long would it take for you to ship one container from your farm to an international partner?Norm Krug: […] Normally, for example, Chapman, Nebraska, to Tokyo, Japan, was 37 days. That’s pretty good when you think about the distance and we are able to do that quite efficiently and land products around the world and be competitive.Currently, there are two issues. One is the actual transit time -- now it would be 60-90 days to get that product shipped. But the bigger problem is that it takes two to three  months to get space on the ship… So, it’s that two months combined with the two months of shipping time that is often putting us four or five months late from when the customer would want it and longer than what we enjoyed in the past. The most extreme case, which is interesting and I appreciate this opportunity to share, would be where you have to remind everyone that popcorn along with many other foods is perishable. So, you’d ship a container and you’d think it was going to take 37 days. And at 90 days in Japan recently, they just said, “Take that back we don’t want that. We don’t want that popcorn.” That popcorn had made it all the way to the coast but they were concerned about the quality. So, we had to return, as painful as that was as you can imagine, those containers all the way back to Chapman to be unloaded and re-checked and all those things. So, the problem gets amplified even more when you’re talking about perishable goods. So a long answer to your question, but it went from a pretty dependable 37 days to four or five months.Sen. Fischer: And your business isn’t unique in this, right? I mean I’m hearing from ag producers all across Nebraska and all across this country. Who, first of all, are concerned they can’t get containers in order to even export their products… but then you add in the time involved and as you said these are perishable goods. It’s affecting all parts of agriculture; would you agree with that?Norm Krug: Yes, I definitely agree. Preferred Popcorn is just one of many, many companies that are impacted. Of course, in a lot of cases, there’s even larger amounts of grain and other ag products that are not being shipped. Then those sales are often lost forever because, like all of us, the end consumer is going to look elsewhere to get their product if they aren’t able to get it from us.--On how transportation issues are impacting prices for agricultural inputs:Sen. Fischer: You’re talking about delays you have in your business, but what about the delays in equipment, fertilizer? When you add in everything on these delays, how is that impacting not just you but obviously the entire economy there, the farm economy?Norm Krug: Yes, good question. Well as you probably heard the inputs for ‘22 are very high. Fertilizer prices are up not just percentage points, but about three times. As well as the costs of our pesticides that all farmers use. The most interesting thing in this year’s negotiations is we are talking about next year’s input costs. Where the co-ops are actually telling us, yes, you should buy ahead. Yes, you should lock the price in, and additionally, you should probably come and get it and store it on your farm, because it’s going to be such a tight supply. So, in ‘21 farmers did have adequate pesticides and fertilizers to produce their crops. It appears that it’s going to be ‘22, that it will be very impactful in the cost of production for farmers in the Midwest. So, I think we’ve only seen the beginning of the inflationary impact of these transportation issues. They aren’t going to go away as it’s been stated already. Personally, I think it’s going to increase more and more as we go into next year and the years following.  Text of Senator Fischer’s Opening Statement:Chairman Peters, thank you for holding this hearing on ocean shipping bottlenecks as we are in the midst of the holiday season.It would be an understatement to say that the past year and a half has been rough for many Americans.In addition to the public health crisis, our supply chain and transportation networks have experienced immense strains throughout the pandemic.Grocery stores are struggling to keep shelves stocked again with the current freight bottlenecks across the country.While we hoped these disruptions would be a temporary problem, it is clear that we will have to deal with this crisis for the foreseeable future.Industry experts believe the supply chain disruptions could persist into late 2022 or even 2023.Today’s hearing will highlight the impacts the port backlog is having on American businesses, including Preferred Popcorn, of Chapman, Nebraska.I am pleased to introduce my friend Norm Krug, who founded Preferred Popcorn in 1997. Fifty percent of Preferred Popcorn’s business is overseas, exporting to seventy countries around the world.While he was able to export 1,500 containers of popcorn last year, it should have been much more. Mr. Krug informed my office that over 900 of his containers were unable to be picked up for delivery. In other words, over one-third of Norm’s export business was not shipped due to the disruptions. This is unacceptable.Norm will be able to provide this committee with more insight of how the supply chain disruptions are affecting the agriculture export industry, and I look forward to hearing his testimony. Unfortunately, Norm is not the only Nebraska business leader who has reached out to my office about the supply chain disruptions.I have heard from individuals who have had to send employees home because their supply was stuck in a warehouse on the West Coast and they didn’t have work for them.Another business informed me they were having to start producing more products outside of U.S. facilities because the cost of exporting their products is becoming too expensive.Additionally, many Americans are concerned about being able to purchase goods ahead of the holiday season.Grocery stores across the country are struggling to maintain consistent inventory, and retail sector analysts are already warning that Christmas orders will likely be delayed.I was joined many of my Senate colleagues, including Chairman Peters, in supporting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was recently signed into law. While this legislation will provide historic investments into our nation’s freight system, this will not be a short-term fix.I hope this hearing will provide Congress with a better understanding of how these disruptions impact American businesses.Additionally, I hope we can have a productive conversation with the witnesses to discuss how shippers and carriers can work to alleviate bottlenecks across the supply chain. Finally, I believe this committee should have additional hearings on this topic to understand how transportation operators and the Administration are addressing the supply chain challenges we are discussing today.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. # # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/video-fischer-highlights-impact-of-supply-chain-crisis20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=0A65A055-1CBC-4069-AC0C-596C3A3E2CC0,"WASHINGTON, DC. – U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) recently cosponsored the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies (ACT) for ALS Act. This bipartisan legislation would create the infrastructure necessary to fund early access to promising investigational therapies for patients suffering from ALS and other fast-progressing rare neurodegenerative and terminal diseases. It would authorize $100 million annually to implement these priorities. The bill was introduced by Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).“ALS is a heartbreaking disease and unfortunately right now, far too few patients are able to access treatments to slow its progression. This bipartisan bill would help address that problem by bolstering research and development of new treatments. Let’s get this passed so we can help those suffering from ALS and eventually find a cure,” said Senator Fischer. “ALS is a devasting disease. There are currently no effective treatments and it’s 100% fatal. My father, Mark Lambrecht, passed away just 1 year after his ALS diagnosis. It was unbearable watching him lose his independence and wither away; unable to breathe without a ventilator, unable to swallow, talk, and eventually stand and walk on his own. He was denied access to groundbreaking clinical trials just like 80% of those suffering with ALS. The ACT for ALS will help patients, like my father, get access to potentially life-changing treatments that are stuck in clinical trials. It will offer hope to those in a truly hopeless situation. My family and I are incredibly grateful to have the support of Senator Deb Fischer on this issue. We look forward to seeing this bill go to a vote and pass before year's end,” said Laura Lambrecht of Omaha.BACKGROUND:  ALS affects 1 in 300 people, often leaving patients with no more than three years to live following their diagnosis. ACT for ALS authorizes new grants to support expanded access and research programs. ALS also disproportionately impacts U.S. military service members. This expansion will bring investigational treatments for rapidly progressing diseases beyond their ongoing clinical trials to patients with diseases for which effective therapies don’t already exist and allow for additional research into the effectiveness of those interventions. It also creates a new FDA Rare Neurodegenerative Disease Grant Program to support other research and development on ALS and other life-threatening or severely debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.# # #Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/fischer-joins-accelerating-access-to-critical-therapies-for-als-act20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

This bipartisan legislation we are introducing today would provide a permanent fix to ensure railroad workers receive the full benefits they deserve,” said Senator Fischer.More information:Due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, and a subsequent sequestration order to implement mandated spending cuts, railroad unemployment benefits have been reduced by a set percentage that is subject to revision at the beginning of each fiscal year. Currently, the sequester, as it relates to the RRB, continues until fiscal year 2030. Without this legislation, it is expected that the sequestration will result in a 5.7 percent reduction in railroad unemployment benefits through fiscal year 2030. Since most interstate railroad workers’ payroll taxes are diverted to the RRB, unemployed railroad workers are not eligible for federal unemployment insurance benefits, which was not subject to the sequester. This resulted in railroad workers taking a cut in expected benefits that the general public was not subject to.This is particularly concerning during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the RRB received 35,030 unemployment claims. As of September 2020, they have received 133,899 claims, nearly a fourfold increase.  Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/fischer-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-end-cut-to-railroad-unemployment-benefits20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=8F9FEDCD-39DE-49BC-A513-C3C54886D218,"Watch the video here.WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) spoke on the Senate floor to voice her opposition to the Democrats’ partisan $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. Senator Fischer explained how the package fails to target aid to those who need it, and called on Congress to work together in a bipartisan manner to deliver relief.Full Transcript of Senator Fischer’s Floor Speech:Mr. President, I come to the floor today because the Senate will likely vote soon on the Biden stimulus bill.I think all of us in this chamber agree that we want to get relief to the American people.That was our objective when we passed the CARES Act last year, which allocated $2.2 trillion to the relief effort.It was our objective when we passed four other COVID relief bills in 2020 – and these brought the total up to $4 trillion.All of these measures were the result of bipartisan cooperation and negotiations – Democrats and Republicans working together.But right now, the president and congressional Democrats are pushing a completely partisan product through a totally partisan process to promote their progressive agenda.They call it the “American Rescue Plan,” and the price tag is $1.9 trillion – more than double what we spent after the financial crisis starting in 2008.When combined with the five COVID packages we’ve already enacted, the total cost to American taxpayers would be close to $6 trillion – more than the GDP of every country other than China or the U.S.And as of the end of January, hundreds of billions of dollars from these bills had yet to be spent.December’s relief bill dedicated $284 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program, but only a quarter of those funds had been obligated.That same bill provided $20 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans – none of it had been spent by February 1st.The same is true of the CARES Act’s funding for community planning programs, for which hundreds of millions of dollars remained unspent.Over 90 percent of these bills’ combined funding for mental health programs was sitting idle as of late January as well.Mr. President, the White House calls this bill a QUOTE “emergency legislative package to fund vaccinations, provide immediate, direct relief to families bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis, and support struggling communities.” END QUOTEEach of these things is important, and support for them should absolutely be part of any package we pass.But when you look somewhere other than the White House website to find out what is actually in this bill, you see that many parts of it don’t belong in a package that’s meant to help us recover from our fight against this virus.Let’s start with what will make the biggest difference for working families: the direct payments to individual Americans.For months, I have supported sending these checks.I went on the record in December to say that people are hurting and that we should help them with more aid in the form of direct payments.I think these payments are a good idea.But they should be targeted to those who truly need them, not sent to people who haven’t been affected in the same way as the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs.If this once-in-a-century pandemic hasn’t put you out of work at one point or another, you’ve been lucky.But this plan would give you a check even if you never lost your job and struggled to pay your bills.That is not right.This administration had time to work with Republicans to make sure those who need help get it.They didn’t do that.Instead, people who never lost their job, get a check.People who were never furloughed get, a check.And financially stable families who earned as much as $200,000 last year – they still get a check, too. Mr. President, if so many Americans are hurting, as we all know they are, our only focus should be getting this aid into their hands, not using their insecurity as a chance to pass a bunch of wish list items from the progressive agenda.The White House wants Congress to spend billions of dollars on things no COVID aid bill should be addressing.Many other senators have expressed similar concerns.We believe that every cent of any COVID relief bill needs to go toward recovery from the effects of COVID on our families and our communities.The new administration has a chance to show that they really are interested in bipartisanship and unity, two words President Biden uses nearly every day.They could prove that today by reaching out to Republicans in good faith.But so far, any effort by the administration to do so has only been to provide an appearance of “working together,” not to make any actual progress on a bipartisan product.Instead, they are focused on filling this package with progressive priorities.Let’s take a look at some of the items on that list:Giving $30 billion to public transit authorities, even though President Biden only asked for $20 billion and several major agencies have said the December relief bill would get them through at least this summer;Spending $50 million on family planning programs that would not have Hyde protections, meaning that our tax dollars would pay for elective abortions;Allowing Planned Parenthood to receive small business funding from the Paycheck Protection Program;Dedicating another $50 million to the troublingly vague goal of QUOTE “combatting the climate crisis” END QUOTE;Sending $12 billion overseas in aid, which doesn’t belong in a domestic COVID response bill;And spending over $100 million on a subway system near Speaker Pelosi’s district in the Bay Area.I will leave it up to my Democratic colleagues to explain how expanding a subway in northern California would help all Americans “build back better” in this pandemic.So far, they are silent.This is supposed to be an emergency rescue plan for the Americans who have been hit hardest by COVID.But instead, the Biden stimulus plan doesn’t make any of the tough decisions we need to make and uses Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars as a blank check.This proposal also pays lip service to the importance of getting students back into the classroom while asking this body to vote for things that would do exactly the opposite.Even though almost $70 billion of the funds dedicated to schools in December’s relief bill still hasn’t been spent, this American Rescue Plan would give them nearly $170 billion more.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say this money is necessary for a majority of K-8 schools to safely reopen in the president’s first 100 days – but their bill would reserve 95% of that new money for 2022-2028. How does that help families today, who want their kids back in school now?This bill goes even further than that – it would treat schools that choose to open and schools that remain closed the same way, which does nothing to incentivize them to get kids back in classrooms.This plan would give $350 billion to states, cities, and localities.A big chunk of that money will be used to bail out states like New York and California, which have kept people away from their jobs and children out of schools for months on end.Even worse, this bill tallies states and localities’ level of funding based on raw unemployment numbers, not unemployment rate.That would punish both red and blue states that have handled the pandemic well.It leaves behind states like Nebraska, which has the lowest unemployment rate in the country because we have succeeded in balancing safety and reopening where other states have failed.It would also hurt Minnesota, Vermont, and New Hampshire, three blue states that have kept their unemployment numbers low.When you look under the hood, this bill is more about passing a partisan wish list than getting the United States through the worst public health crisis we’ve faced in over a century.At best, the name American Rescue Plan is misleading.At worst, it’s deceptive.I stand ready to work with the administration and my Democratic colleagues in Congress to address these issues, and to get Americans the help they need in a targeted, reasonable, and productive way.We did that with the CARES Act, and we could do it again if our colleagues on the other side are willing.That’s the way the Senate is supposed to work – in a bipartisan way.It’s how we reach consensus and deliver the policies the American people need and deserve.I know I share the sentiments of many of my colleagues when I say that I’m disappointed in how this process has been conducted.Without an effort to compromise and make major changes to this stimulus package, I will be voting no.Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Watch the video here.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/senator-fischer-to-oppose-democrats-1-9-trillion-stimulus-bill20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

But these pioneering men and women did not back down—they transformed our state into fertile farm and ranch land and thriving cities. Since then, Nebraska has become critical to feeding and fueling the rest of the world. Nebraskans today do not take that responsibility lightly.We take pride in our world-class beef and high-quality crops, which are exported across the United States and around the globe. We are leaders in agriculture.One in four jobs in our state is related to production agriculture.We are leaders in transportation.Our position in the middle of the country has helped make Nebraska a transportation hub where our roads and railways connect the coasts and everything in between.  We are leaders in business.As for our cities, Nebraska has become proudly home to many of the world’s most respected high-profile companies and innovative start-ups.We are the Cornhuskers. Our loyal fan base of Nebraskans never miss an opportunity to cheer Go Big Red.We aren’t afraid of hard work.It’s in our DNA to help our friends and neighbors.When crises arise, we face them together. That’s what we did during the severe weather of 2019, and it is what we are doing now as we respond to the coronavirus pandemic.Every day, I learn new heartwarming stories of how Nebraskans are helping one another get through these hard times.We may no longer be the pioneers in covered wagons, but we still have their grit and determination as we work to make Nebraska a better place for generations to come.Nebraska is my home and the state I love.To all my fellow Nebraskans, today is a day to celebrate all that our state is and all that we have achieved together. I want to thank you for the honor of representing you in the United States Senate.Happy Birthday, Nebraska.  Watch the video here. Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/senator-fischer-celebrates-nebraska-statehood-day20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The abduction was captured on the store’s security camera, leaving little doubt of the emergency nature of the circumstances. Four days after she disappeared, authorities were able to locate Kelsey’s body after her wireless provider released the “ping” or “call location” information from her cell phone. Providing this information as fast as possible is critical to ensure law enforcement officials can rescue victims in imminent danger of death or serious harm when every second counts.It also ensures that professional law enforcement officials in the field, not a phone company, are able to determine if an individual is in an emergency situation. This legislation includes checks to guard against government overreach, while also allowing law enforcement to act quickly to help individuals in grave danger. Kelsey Smith’s parents, Missey and Greg Smith, have fought to successfully pass this legislation in 27 states and are continuing to work to make it federal law.“Kelsey Smith’s tragic abduction sent shockwaves through the Overland Park community and the country,” said Sen. Moran. “In honor of their daughter and to aid law enforcement in rescuing kidnap victims, Greg and Missey Smith have worked tirelessly to support the passage of the Kelsey Smith Act in state legislatures around the country and here in Washington D.C. This legislation will make certain first responders have the tools they need to quickly locate people who have been abducted, and I urge my colleagues to support this sensible bill to help save lives.”  “The Smith family experienced a terrible tragedy that was made even more agonizing by the delay in finding their daughter, Kelsey,” said Sen. Blunt. “The Kelsey Smith Act will provide law enforcement an important tool in their efforts to find and save the lives of kidnapping victims. This bill, which takes a narrowly crafted approach to balancing law enforcement needs and privacy concerns, will bring federal law in line with the laws that are already on the books in Missouri and many other states. I urge my Senate colleagues to support us in honoring Kelsey by getting this bill to the president’s desk.”“When someone’s life is at risk, it is critical that law enforcement has the tools to respond as quickly as possible,” said Sen. Fischer. “By rapidly providing law enforcement with victims’ call location information, the Kelsey Smith Act will save the lives of innocent people while ensuring there is accountability for such requests.”“We would like to thank Senator Moran for taking the lead on the continued effort to pass the Kelsey Smith Act at the federal level,” said Greg and Missey Smith. “He has been a cosponsor since the beginning of this journey. We would be remiss to not thank Senator Roberts and his staff for all of their efforts and work and coordinating all of the alliances in support of this legislation. We continue to be hopeful that it will pass on the federal level as it has now passed in 27 states and is being worked in at least seven more this session.”""It is critical to public safety that law enforcement have the tools to swiftly access and collect digital evidence when a life is on the line,"" said Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. ""We're grateful to be working with Senator Moran on this legislation and look forward to getting it to the Senate floor.""Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/sens-moran-blunt-fischer-reintroduce-kelsey-smith-act-to-aid-law-enforcement-in-locating-kidnap-victims20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

U.S. Representatives Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) introduced the companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“Over the past year, we have relied on the essential service the trucking industry provides to transport critical resources to Kansas and across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen. Moran. “As the trucking industry continues to face a driver shortage, we must find new ways to recruit and retain drivers, including supporting women pursuing careers in trucking. This sensible and bipartisan legislation will lead to new job opportunities for women and promote equality for those who are currently working in the trucking industry.”“In Wisconsin, we make things, and we need to ensure we have a strong workforce to transport our goods to market,” said Sen. Baldwin. “Women currently make up less than 10 percent of the truck driving workforce, and removing the barriers that get in the way of women pursuing and retaining careers in trucking is key. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort with Senator Moran because more job opportunities for Wisconsin women will lead to more economic security for working families.”“Truckers are essential to keeping Nebraska’s economy running, but the industry is experiencing a shortage of drivers,” said Sen. Fischer. “Women currently make up only 6.6 percent of truck drivers and 12.5 percent of all truck transportation workers. Examining ways to encourage more women to enter the trucking industry is good policy and could connect more women with good jobs.”“Montana women represent a growing force in the transportation sector, but still face obstacles when it comes to careers in the trucking industry,” said Sen. Tester. “This bill is a hat-trick, ensuring we’re breaking down barriers for Montana women, bringing more good-paying jobs to the Treasure State, and strengthening our workforce so we can deliver more of our world-class products to market.”“Although women make up nearly half of our country’s workforce, they represent less than 10% of truck drivers across the country,” said Rep. Gallagher. “At a time when trucking companies are struggling to find and retain workers, it’s critical we find ways to address this problem and remove barriers to entry for women in this field. I’m proud to join this effort which takes steps to examine ways we can expand opportunities for women and strengthen the trucking industry’s workforce.”“Here in the Kansas City Metro – one of our nation’s biggest transportation and shipping hubs – we know how critical the trucking industry and truck drivers are to our economy,” said Rep. Davids. “At a time when trucking companies are struggling to find and retain workers, we must support and remove barriers to entry for women in this field. As the first woman to serve as vice chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I’m glad to work with my colleagues to provide economic opportunity and help ensure that the transportation sector looks more like the people it serves.”This legislation received wide-spread support from shipping and trucking organizations, including FedEx, American Trucking Associations, Women in Trucking Association and United Parcel Service (UPS).“Although women currently make up 47% of the United States’ labor force, they represent less than seven percent of truck drivers and only a quarter of all transportation and warehousing jobs in trucking,” said American Trucking Associations Senior Vice President Edwin Gilroy. “While the trucking industry has taken great strides over the last decade, growing the number of women truck drivers by 68% since 2010, the fact is that women remain underrepresented in the industry. We agree that more work needs to be done. The Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act represents a tangible step toward a stronger and more diverse trucking workforce.”“By creating an advisory board to utilize the expertise and resources of the Federal Motor Carrier Administration and the members of the board, we can increase the opportunities for women as drivers, technicians, owners, trainers and in other relevant career roles,” said Women in Trucking Association President and CEO Ellie Voie. “Although women have strengthened their presence in supply chain in the past few years, we know there are still issues that cause women to reject a transportation career. Our goal is to better identify these concerns and address them to create a more diverse industry. I look forward to working with you and your office in advancing this bill.”“Working with Congress to make careers in trucking appealing, sustainable and successful for anyone who wants to enter our industry is a priority for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association,” said Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association President Todd Spencer. “We support the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act because it will not only help more women begin careers in trucking, but will improve conditions for drivers currently behind the wheel. Some of the safest and most successful truckers on the road today are female members of OOIDA. We commend the sponsors of this legislation for ensuring their unique perspective and experience as small business owners will play an integral role in efforts to promote women in trucking.”The Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act would direct the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to establish a “Women of Trucking Advisory Board.” Under this bill, the board would identify barriers to entry for women in the trucking industry, work across organizations and companies to coordinate formal education and training programs and help identify and establish training and mentorship programs for women in the industry. The legislation also requires the FMCSA administrator to submit a report to Congress on the board’s findings and recommendations. Currently, women make up 47 percent of the United States’ labor force, yet represent 24 percent of America’s trucking workforce and only about 7 percent of drivers.Click here to view a summary of the legislation.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/sens-moran-baldwin-tester-fischer-reintroduce-legislation-to-support-women-in-trucking20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

This bipartisan legislation makes clear that our concerns about Beijing are serious, and that future trade negotiations must account for our national security.”“Promoting the security and integrity of global digital infrastructure should be among the most paramount digital trade objectives the U.S. pursues,” said Warner. “It is long past time to make this a key negotiating objective in order to promote a more long-term, multilateral strategy to safeguard the global telecommunications market from providers like Huawei that could pose a serious risk to digital infrastructure across the globe.” The Network Security Trade Act would amend the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority, which is in effect until July 1, 2021, to include a negotiating objective related to the security of communications networks. Today, one of the largest manufacturers of 5G equipment and telecommunications infrastructure is Huawei Technologies, which is supported by the Chinese Communist Party. While the bill does not name specific state-owned companies, it would direct the executive branch to ensure that the equipment and technology that are used to create the global communications infrastructure are not compromised. It would achieve that goal by addressing barriers to the security of communications networks and supply chains and unfair trade practices of state-owned or state-controlled communications equipment suppliers in new trade agreements. Confronting these issues, which this legislation requires, is critical as the United States considers formal trade talks with the United Kingdom and other allies.   Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/thune-stabenow-fischer-warner-reintroduce-bill-to-protect-u-s-from-digital-infrastructure-corruption20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

Oral arguments before the court are expected to take place sometime this spring.  - March 2020: Following the 10th circuit announcement, Senator Fischer led her colleagues in sending a letter to Wheeler urging adoption of court’s opinion.- January 2020: The Tenth Circuit vacated and remanded three EPA decisions granting SRE petitions for the 2016 and 2017 RFS compliance years which were issued in 2017 and 2018, holding that a small refinery’s petition can be granted only to refineries with existing exemptions. The EPA declined to take formal action on the matter and a petition for review of the circuit court’s order was filed in September. - June 2019: Senator Fischer introduced the bipartisan RFS Integrity Act with Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). The legislation would ensure the EPA properly accounts for exempted gallons and ensures that key information surrounding small refinery exemptions is made publicly available.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/fischer-applauds-epa-decision-to-protect-biofuels20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=D07D0CE5-DD67-4E90-8CEE-67956FA09CD3,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) introduced new legislation to help survivors of domestic violence and other crimes cut ties with their abusers and separate from shared wireless service plans, which can be exploited to monitor, stalk, or control victims.“Giving domestic violence abusers control over their victims’ cell phones is a terrifying reality for many survivors. Right now there is no easy way out for these victims – they’re trapped in by contracts and hefty fees. Our bill helps survivors get out of these shared plans and tries to find more ways to help victims stay connected with their families and support networks,” said Senator Schatz. “Victims of domestic violence often must share cell phone plans with their abusers. When these survivors are looking to escape, they struggle to fully separate from the abusers who can still control their communications lifeline. Our bipartisan bill would help keep survivors connected as they build a path toward independence,” said Senator Fischer.“No domestic violence survivor should have to worry that their vital lifeline to critical support services is controlled by their abuser. This bill targets one of the central ways domestic violence perpetrators exercise control and continue their abuse: by cutting off their victims’ ability to communicate and connect with family, friends, and support services. The Safe Connections Act protects the safety and privacy of domestic violence survivors, empowering them to separate from shared phone plans and providing confidentiality when they seek support,” said Senator Blumenthal.“I’m proud to join my colleagues to introduce the Safe Connections Act to protect domestic abuse survivors and help them cut ties with their abusers. These brave survivors have been through the unimaginable, and deserve the support and resources needed to safely move forward with their lives,” said Senator Scott.“There is an alarming rise in domestic violence cases in Nevada during the coronavirus pandemic and amid prolonged social isolation. According to the Northern Nevada Regional Intelligence Center, the number of domestic violence cases in the area in 2020 is four times higher than the last four year average,” said Senator Rosen. “This important legislation would require telecommunications services to implement safeguards, such as helping victims and survivors of domestic violence to separate from shared cell phone plans with their abusers. I will continue working in Congress to protect vulnerable Nevadans during this tumultuous time.”Survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault, and human trafficking often face challenges when establishing independence from an abuser. These include financial insecurity and limited access to the communications tools essential to maintaining connections with family, social safety networks, employers, and support services. As survivors seek help and stabilize their lives, the Safe Connections Act would help them stay safe and connected by: The Safe Connections Act is supported by Access Now, the Clinic to End Tech Abuse at Cornell University, the Hawai‘i State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the International Justice Mission, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Public Knowledge, RAINN, StrongHearts Helpline, Legal Momentum - the Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Network to End Domestic Violence.“The Hotline commends Sen. Schatz (D-HI) and Sen. Fischer (R-NE) for introducing the Safe Connections Act of 2021, a bill that, if passed, would make it safer for a survivor of domestic violence to leave an abusive partner. We hear from survivors on the lines every day devastating stories about their partners using their phones and other devices to monitor, intimidate, and stalk them. Digital abuse is an unfortunate reality for so many survivors, including tracking a survivors' movement through location tracking, monitoring call logs, and the difficult process of leaving a shared phone contract when your abusive partner is the primary authorized user. This bill would also allow survivors to safely and efficiently leave a shared phone contract and have access to the Lifeline program for six months, recognizing that survivors rely on their phones for safety but may not be able to afford a new phone line due to financial hardships,” said Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. “Our work with survivors reveals how crucial this bill would be, especially during a pandemic when survivors rely on communications technologies as a lifeline but when those same technologies can expose them to abuse. We gladly support this careful effort to respond to how phones play an essential but complicated role in survivors’ lives,” said Professor Thomas Kadri of the Clinic to End Tech Abuse at Cornell University.“The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately highlighted another persistent public health crisis -- domestic abuse. Victims of abuse experience significant financial hardship as they seek a way out of their horrific circumstances, often while facing the double threat of physical harm from their abusers in the process. We support this legislation because it protects victims by mitigating the risk of having their location tracked by their abuser, enabling them to separate their mobile service account from their abuser's account while also providing financial support through the Lifeline program to help victims stay connected to their communities,” said Greg Guice, Director of Government Affairs at Public Knowledge.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/1/schatz-leads-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-domestic-violence-survivors-cut-ties-with-abusers-separate-from-shared-wireless-service-plans-that-can-be-exploited-to-stalk-control-victims20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=A1C2937C-1277-40CD-87D4-7B33CD224076,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) led a letter with Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James Lankford (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Todd Young (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Marshall, MD (R-KS), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) urging President Biden to follow good government practices regarding late-term federal regulations put forward by President Trump’s administration, and reminding him that there are proper procedures in place to ensure both thoughtful rulemaking and oversight of those rules by Congress. Final rules that have completed the rulemaking process generally do not go into effect until at least 30 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, or, in the case of a “major rule” as designated by the Congressional Review Act, at least 60 days after publishing. In the event his administration seeks to delay some of these late-term federal regulations from going into effect, such a change would require notice-and-comment and the regular procedures should not be short-circuited in the interest of expediency. “Over the course of the campaign, and more recently post-election, some transition officials and congressional leadership have used rhetoric that raises concern with those of us committed to good government and the well-being of the American people.  It would be unwise to undo the achievements of the last several years with rushed actions that undermine the thoughtful regulatory reforms that have saved Americans $50 billion in regulatory costs…Absent action by Congress expressing its disapproval with any late-term rules issued by the outgoing administration, an incoming administration should carry out its duties and faithfully execute federal law—including by allowing lawfully issued final rules to go into effect,” said the senators.A copy of the letter is available here and text can be found below.Dear President Biden:                As you conduct the consequential work of setting up a new administration, we write to remind you of your obligations in so doing to both ensure a smooth transition and understand the weight of the Constitutional responsibilities you have assumed—namely, to “take [c]are that the [l]aws be faithfully executed.”[1]Over the course of the campaign, and more recently post-election, some transition officials and congressional leadership have used rhetoric that raises concern with those of us committed to good government and the well-being of the American people.  It would be unwise to undo the achievements of the last several years with rushed actions that undermine the thoughtful regulatory reforms that have saved Americans $50 billion in regulatory costs.We urge the incoming administration to place particular emphasis on thoughtful rulemaking, taking care to be attentive and responsive to the American public through the Administrative Procedure Act’s (“APA”) notice and comment rulemaking process.  The APA places appropriate safeguards on the rulemaking process to avoid unintentional or undue harm that may be caused by reactionary or hasty rulemaking, and also provides avenues for an administration to implement well-reasoned alternatives. Final rules that have completed the APA rulemaking process generally do not go into effect until at least 30 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, or, in the case of a “major rule” as designated by the Congressional Review Act (“CRA”), at least 60 days after publishing.  It is worth noting that the CRA passed the Senate by unanimous consent in 1996—while you served in the Senate.  The CRA’s waiting period generally gives “affected parties time to adjust their behavior before the final rule takes effect,” since “until the final rule is published, the public is not sure of what the rule will be or when the rule will actually be promulgated.”[2]  But a final rule is not “any less final” simply because it has not yet gone into effect.[3] As directed under the APA, a substantive amendment to a final rule—such as a delay of the rule’s effective date[4]—may not be undertaken without appropriate notice and comment.  We urge you not to tamper with rules promulgated through notice and comment simply because the effective date is a few weeks away, as proposed by White House Chief of Staff Ronald Klain on January 20, 2021.[5]  Such tampering would not only undermine the rulemaking process which, as described above, generally reflects our most thoughtful law-making, but—driven by a desire to erase the past several years—would undermine our democratic institutions.Congress has carefully considered the process it expects our agencies to follow in issuing agency rulemakings.  Through our adoption of the APA and CRA, we have crafted appropriate procedures that ensure careful and thoughtful rulemaking, as well as scrupulous oversight.  And, when necessary, Congress is the appropriate body to undertake such oversight.  In fact, Congress availed itself of the expedited procedures available under the CRA to revoke 14 final rules in the 16-week period following the issuance of 41 “economically significant” regulations in the final weeks of the Obama-Biden administration. Absent action by Congress expressing its disapproval with any late-term rules issued by the outgoing administration, an incoming administration should carry out its duties and faithfully execute federal law—including by allowing lawfully issued final rules to go into effect.  [1] U.S. Const. art.

I urge my Senate colleagues and the Biden administration not to punish hard-working Americans with these burdensome regulations,” said Senator Fischer.The full text of the resolution is available here.More information:In 2015, the Obama Administration finalized a rule that greatly expanded the definition of federally regulated Waters of the United States for Nebraska’s agriculture and business communities. Now, President Biden signed an executive order that would roll back the Trump Administration’s executive order which began the process of rescinding Obama’s WOTUS rule and could lead to the elimination of the Navigable Waters Protection Rule released in April of 2020.Senator Fischer has been a leader in efforts to stop the 2015 WOTUS rule and applauded the Trump Administration’s rescinding of the rule. After the Obama administration announced WOTUS, Senator Fischer chaired a field hearing by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in Lincoln regarding the rule. She also helped introduce the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, which would have required the Obama administration to consult states and stakeholders before imposing federal regulations on state-owned water resources, as well as the Defending Rivers from Overreaching Policies (DROP) Act. This bill targeted the flawed science used by the EPA to expand the definition of water. Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/1/senator-fischer-stands-up-for-trump-wotus-rule20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news?ID=F7F7977C-2DA5-4DD7-BBF6-1CB4AAB43F7A,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today reintroduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.The legislation would provide common-sense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization, a point at which there is significant scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on the unborn.Graham has introduced the Pain-Capable legislation the last four Congresses.“I am proud to once again introduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,” Graham said. “There are only seven countries that allow wholesale abortions at the 20-week period, including China and North Korea. The United States should not be in that club.”“I don’t believe abortion, five months into pregnancy, makes us a better nation,” said Graham. “America is at her best when she’s standing up for the least among us, and the sooner we pass this legislation into law, the better. We are on the right side of history.” The legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee), Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Mississippi), James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin), John Kennedy (R-Louisiana), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska), Rick Scott (R-Florida), Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), Richard Shelby (R-Alabama), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), John Thune (R-South Dakota), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania), Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), and Todd Young (R-Indiana).#####Statements from Cosponsors of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act“Congress must protect innocent human life. The science is clear - unborn babies feel pain. Congress must follow the science and our conscience and end late-term abortions.” – Senator John Barrasso“There should be no question as to whether pain-capable unborn children should be protected by federal law. The majority of Americans believe elective abortion after 20 weeks should be banned. And, our nation is one of only seven in the world to allow it, including China and North Korea. I will continue standing for life and giving a voice to the voiceless.” – Senator Roy Blunt“There is no clearer indication that America is in moral crisis than to understand that babies in the womb feel pain as early as 20 weeks old, yet are still allowed to be victims of gruesome abortion procedures that end their lives in agonizing fashion. Science and medical technology increasingly affirm this truth. It is past time for us to protect these innocent, vulnerable lives and spare them from that fate. I’m thankful my colleagues are standing together in support of this legislation that promotes the value and dignity of every human being.” – Senator John Boozman  “From the moment of conception until natural death, each human life is intrinsically unique and worth protecting. I am a proud cosponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which protects unborn children who are 20 weeks’ gestation and older. This bill is a positive step forward in promoting a culture of life.” – Senator Mike Braun ""Medical science increasingly confirms the common experience of parents and the religious and ethical belief of the ages: an unborn baby is just as much a person as each of us-only more innocent, more helpless, and therefore even more deserving of protection. I look forward to working with my colleagues to promote a culture of life and bring this legislation to the floor for a vote."" – Senator Tom Cotton“Late-term abortion is choosing to end the life of an unborn child who can feel pain just like anyone else. It has no place in a society which values life and should be banned, as our legislation dictates.” – Senator Kevin Cramer“Studies show that babies can feel pain by 20 weeks – and I believe it is unconscionable to subject a child, at any stage in their life, to such pain. These are precious lives that must be protected.” – Senator Steve Daines“Five months into pregnancy, we know that babies – like Micah Pickering of Iowa – are full of life: making faces, wiggling their toes and fingers, and feeling pain. The United States is only one of seven countries that permits abortions after five months, putting us in the company of Communist China and North Korea. This effort is about protecting our most vulnerable from painful death—a unifying cause that should meet the approval standard of all of my colleagues because supporting this bill means giving the Micah Pickerings of the world an equal fighting chance.” – Senator Joni Ernst “I am proud to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions at and beyond the point where the unborn would experience significant pain. Nebraska was the first state to pass such legislation, and I was proud to support it in the Nebraska Unicameral. This science-based bill represents a crucial defense of life.” – Senator Deb Fischer“Many Americans overwhelmingly support restrictions on late-term abortions. That’s for good reason. One Iowan, Micah Pickering, was born early at 20 weeks. Today, Micah is living proof that just 20 weeks can create a beautiful human life. It’s time for Congress to pass this bill and help ensure that other human lives also have a real chance.” – Senator Chuck Grassley “As a father of four, I understand the value of life, and I believe strongly in protecting our most vulnerable. Research shows that unborn children can feel pain at 20 weeks, and I’m joining Senator Graham’s legislation as an original co-sponsor to make this practice illegal.” – Senator Bill Hagerty“The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act aligns with not only North Dakota’s standards to protect the unborn, but with the vast majority of our global allies. Now more than ever, it’s important that we remain united in defending life, and I once again join my colleagues in cosponsoring this important legislation which garnered bipartisan support when it was considered in the Senate last Congress.” – Senator John Hoeven “Protecting the dignity of life extends to protecting the unborn, especially from the point at which the innocent child is capable of feeling pain. Mississippians support such protections, and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would correctly establish these standards on a nationwide level.” – Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith“By at least 20 weeks of age, babies can feel pain. Tragically, the United States is one of only seven countries that permits abortion after this point. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would ban abortions when a baby can feel pain and remove us from a list that includes China and North Korea—countries notorious for their human rights violations. We must continue to protect the sanctity of life, especially with this administration’s efforts to undo our progress at respecting the dignity of all life.” – Senator James Inhofe “The United States is one of a very few countries, including China and North Korea, that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. It has been scientifically proven that babies at this age can suck their thumbs, make faces, and yawn—they can also feel pain. We have an obligation to create laws that protect God-given life no matter how young a person is. Everyone with an ounce of compassion or common sense should be able to support this legislation.” – Senator John Kennedy“Every life is valuable—born or unborn. It shouldn’t be controversial to say that if a child survives an attempted abortion and is living outside his or her mother, that baby deserves to receive care. We should all agree that tax dollars should not fund abortion on demand in the United States or overseas. When science has shown a child can feel pain, they should not be subjected to a dismemberment abortion. And if a healthcare professional has a moral objection to participating in an abortion procedure, which by definition is the taking of life, they should not be forced by their employer to destroy the life they pledged to protect. Protecting life should not be a partisan issue; it should be an American issue. I am proud to speak up for the millions of children who cannot speak for themselves and honor their right to life.” – Senator James Lankford“I was proud to stand for the right to life as an elected official in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, and I’m proud to do so again in the Senate, with Senator Graham as he reintroduces the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This is a common-sense bill supported by the science and by the majority of Americans. It’s time we pass this bill into law.” – Senator Cynthia Lummis“Being pro-life is just part of who I am and there is no other alternative. As an obstetrician, it’s been a thrill of my life to get to bring thousands of babies into the world and now it’s a thrill of my life to be in the U.S. Senate and continue the fight for pro-life policies. While those on the far left including in the new Administration continue to advocate against human life, I will keep doing what Kansans sent me to Washington to do: continue my lifelong fight for the wellbeing of mothers and their babies and working to end the barbaric practice of abortion.” – Senator Roger Marshall “Every year, thousands of unborn children are aborted after 20 weeks gestation—a point where we know, based on science, those babies can feel pain. I will always vote to defend the sanctity of life and hope that one day we will become a society that protects our most vulnerable, instead of one that permits their destruction.” – Senator Jerry Moran“We must enact policies that protect the lives of our children, both born and unborn. I am proud to join my colleagues in reintroducing this legislation to prohibit abortions at 20 weeks, the point at which scientific evidence suggests an unborn child is able to feel pain.” – Senator Mitt Romney “It’s unconscionable that protecting the life of a newborn who survived a botched abortion is a partisan issue today, yet it speaks volumes about how radical extremism has become mainstream in today’s Democratic Party. Long gone are the days when Democrats preached that abortion should be ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ The Biden Administration believes American taxpayers should fund abortions in foreign nations, and the Democrat Party is supports legal infanticide. I will always be a champion of the right to life — the most sacred and fundamental of all human rights.” – Senator Marco Rubio“In the United States, we believe in the sanctity of life and the value that each child brings into this world. Although not yet born, these babies are capable of feeling pain, and we must work to protect their lives just the same. I hope all my colleagues join me in protecting life and pass this legislation quickly.” – Senator Rick Scott“It is unthinkable that we are killing babies who are so far advanced that it is possible for them to survive outside their mothers. This legislation would ban abortions 20 weeks into pregnancy – a point at which science has clearly demonstrated that the unborn child is able to feel pain.” – Senator John Thune Background on Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection ActAt the age of 20 weeks post-fertilization, scientific evidence tells us an unborn child can feel pain. Anesthesia is administered directly to the unborn child in second-trimester fetal surgery. The unborn child shows physical, chemical, brain and stress responses demonstrating pain at this stage of development. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is based in science, has overwhelming public support, and is necessary to protect unborn children from painful and untimely deaths.Highlights:Summary of Provisions:Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/1/graham-reintroduces-20-week-abortion-ban20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

I worked very hard with the Air Force to help realize this critical reconstruction project. After years of effort and cooperation, it’s wonderful to see this milestone bring us closer to completing a project that helps our military, Nebraska, and the nation. Thank you to the community in Lincoln for being such gracious hosts to our airmen during construction.”Since her first day in the U.S. Senate, Senator Fischer has worked to ensure that the Offutt runway reconstruction project could take place. In her position on the Senate Armed Services Committee, she worked diligently for eight years with the Air Force, military leaders, and Nebraskans to secure a commitment to this project and keep it on track. She made sure funding used by the Air Force to study and prepare for the project was authorized. Senator Fischer also helped include provisions in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act that encouraged the Air Force to swiftly complete the project and authorized the secretaries of all military departments to develop new technologies to extend the service lives of runways.The 55th Wing's fleet is expected to be fully relocated by March and will remain in Lincoln until September 2022.

I am grateful for the work of the bipartisan Senate IoT Working Group on this bill, and am pleased it has been included in the FY 2021 defense authorization. I look forward to seeing this bill become law, fostering public-private coordination to position the United States as a leader for a more connected future,” said Senator Fischer.Support for the DIGIT Act:“The Chamber applauds Senator Deb Fischer’s leadership to secure inclusion of the DIGIT Act in the National Defense Authorization Act, which would not have been possible without strong bipartisan support from Senators Gardner, Booker, and Schatz. As government looks to enhance and adopt digital infrastructure, this legislation is necessary to develop a strategy for promoting the use of Internet of Things technology that will connect billions of devices and lead to improvements in public health and safety,” said Tom Quaadman, Executive Vice President of the U.S. Chamber’s Technology Engagement Center. “Internet of Things technologies bring tremendous value to everything from healthcare to agriculture to cities and energy grids. The Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things (DIGIT) Act recognizes the importance of finding ways to facilitate IoT growth to harness the benefits to our economy and society. We appreciate the leadership of Senator Deb Fischer and Senator Brian Schatz,” said Intel Corporation. “Development of the Internet of Things is crucial for Lindsay to continue to lead in technological advances that accomplish our goals as a company. The more information Lindsay can provide to the producers who feed the world, the better they are able to maximize yields and manage precious natural resources. Lindsay has closely followed and supported Senator Fischer’s work on the DIGIT Act.  This bill will help coordination between the public and private sectors with respect to the Internet of Things.  We need leadership at the national level to continue to push IoT throughout the nation, and we are grateful that our home state senator is providing it,” said Randy Wood, Lindsay Corp COOa.“With the Internet of Things offering the potential to deliver substantial economic and social benefits across multiple sectors, including government, in the coming years, it is critical that policymakers understand how to promote and facilitate adoption of the technology. The DIGIT Act would bring together stakeholders across government and the private sector to offer important recommendations for how to proceed, including on spectrum, setting up the United States to remain a global leader in the successful adoption and use of the Internet of Things,” said Daniel Castro, Vice President, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.“We thank Senators Fischer, Gardner, Schatz and Booker for their work on the DIGIT Act, included in the National Defense Authorization Act, which brings together the expertise of the public and private sectors to research and report on the IoT policies that will best support our connected future,” said Kelly Cole, CTIA Senior Vice President of Government Affairs.“IoT systems will be more deeply embedded into our daily lives and people will interact with and depend on them more than any previous computer systems. Beyond basic security and privacy, research that seeks to make these systems more usable, manageable, understandable, and efficient is necessary. CRA is pleased that the DIGIT Act provides members of the academic research community a seat at the table to bring this viewpoint to the strategic planning process, and we are very pleased to see its inclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act,” said Peter Harsha, Director of Government Affairs, Computing Research Association. “Paige Wireless is laser-focused on bringing precision agriculture to Nebraska through our statewide LoRa WAN network.  It is the only way that our state’s number one industry will be able to compete on a global scale and continue to feed the world. We are thrilled that Senator Fischer continues to relentlessly pursue the development of IoT at the federal level and understands what it means for Nebraska.  The DIGIT Act is another step in the process and we commend her for pushing it towards the finish line,” said Julie Bushell, President of Paige Wireless.“I am very pleased Congress has included the DIGIT Act in the NDAA, which will support a digital future by utilizing the expertise of federal and industry stakeholders and evaluate spectrum needs for the Internet of Things.  Competitive carriers are on the forefront of next-generation technology deployments, and rural areas will greatly benefit from current and future IoT applications. Some of the most promising, significant economic impacts of new IoT technologies can be found in rural America, and sound policies are essential to ensuring that all Americans can participate in and benefit from these innovations.  I thank Congress for recognizing the importance and great potential that future technologies promise to the nation, and CCA looks forward to continued work to ensure all Americans can benefit from robust mobile broadband technology,” said Steven K. Berry, President and CEO, Competitive Carriers Association.“SIA has long supported the DIGIT Act, and we applaud Senator Fischer for her steadfast, bipartisan leadership in getting this vital legislation adopted through the NDAA. In part of the DIGIT Act’s intent, which is to promote U.S. innovation and leadership in the “internet of things,” SIA members stand ready to offer our expertise to ensure IoT security and resiliency measures are integrated into a national strategy,” said Don Erickson, CEO of the Security Industry Association.More information:The DIGIT Act was reintroduced last year by Senators Fischer, Schatz, Gardner, and Booker. It would convene a working group of federal entities and experts from the private and academic sectors tasked with providing recommendations to Congress on how to facilitate the growth of connected Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The group’s recommendations would focus on how to plan for, and encourage, the development and deployment of the IoT in the U.S.  Additionally, the DIGIT Act directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, to complete a report assessing spectrum needs to support the Internet of Things. The DIGIT Act is critical for the United States’ leadership on the Internet of Things, as other countries have moved to create national strategies around IoT in recent years. The IoT is estimated to have the potential to generate trillions of dollars in new economic activity across a range of sectors, including transportation, energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and health care.  The IoT will play a key role in delivering economic and societal benefits, such as in precision agriculture, telehealth, smart traffic and transit technologies, public safety, logistics and supply chains, sustainable infrastructure, and environmental monitoring.The bill passed the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation unanimously on July 10, 2019, and the full Senate on January 8, 2020. The bill’s passage follows the Senate-passed resolution on the Internet of Things in 2015 led by (Senator Fischer and) the Senate IoT Working Group, as well as a series of IoT reports requested from the Government Accountability Office.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/1/praise-for-senator-fischer-s-bipartisan-digit-act20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

I campaigned for him and worked closely with him on many significant accomplishments that have made our country more secure and more prosperous. I also share the concern of many Nebraskans about potential voting irregularities. Should there be investigations? Yes. Should states do more to secure their election procedures? Yes. We must have greater confidence that our elections are secure. “However, the president’s legal team failed to make the case in court to any judge, including some appointed by President Trump, or to criminal investigators, that widespread voter fraud existed sufficient to overturn election results in any state. Notably, many of the arguments proffered by the legal team on television were not made in the courtroom, in part or at all. Unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud are not enough to discard the election results of states where I may not like the outcome.“There are no do-overs; if a state’s results are not counted tomorrow, millions of voters across the country will be disenfranchised. Such an extreme action should only be taken with proof of widespread malfeasance. No such proof has been presented. Therefore, it would not be proper for Congress, an inherently political body, to substitute its judgment for the will of the people or for that of states that certified their results.“As a United States Senator, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. I will uphold my oath and vote to affirm the decision of the Electoral College. May God bless our great republic, and may He grant us the strength to unite in moving forward for the good of the nation,” said Senator Fischer.Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/1/i-will-uphold-my-oath20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

The AIR Act will provide airports with greater certainty in planning future infrastructure projects:“The outbreak of COVID-19 led to significantly fewer flights out of many Nebraska airports, which put them at risk of receiving far less federal infrastructure formula funding. As such, I am pleased that my AIR Act was included in the COVID relief package that recently passed Congress. It will provide Nebraska airports with the certainty they need to plan for future projects,” said Senator Fischer.“As airports in Nebraska continue to deal with the significant negative impact on aviation from the COVID-19 pandemic, this bill, including provisions from the AIR Act introduced by Senator Fischer, provides important stability for critical federal funding and welcome relief for airports, including Eppley Airfield, during this period of continued uncertainty,” said Dave Roth, Executive Director of the Omaha Airport Authority which oversees Eppley Airfield (OMA).“This legislation is vital to small airports across the county who depend on the million dollar AIP appropriation from the FAA.  This money allows Western Nebraska Regional Airport to continue to keep up with all the safety requirements required by the FAA for commercial service airports.  Without this money, airports like WNRA would not be able to continue the high level of safety that is key to the nationwide air transportation network.  Congratulations, Senator Fischer, on getting this legislation passed and thank you so much for all you do for WNRA and all the other airports in Nebraska.  We could not keep our current levels of service without all your efforts,” said Raul Aguallo, Director of the Western Nebraska Regional Airport in Scottsbluff.“The City of Kearney, similar to may airports has seen reduced passenger traffic and revenue related to the Covid pandemic and this important legislation provides much needed financial assistance moving forward to ensure airports are prepared for future increased passenger demand,” said Michael Morgan, City Manager of Kearney.“Airports continue to struggle as the Covid 19 virus persists.  Protecting our future Federal funding despite our historic low passenger levels is paramount.  Senator Fischer’s leadership in protecting future capital investments for Nebraska’s airports is very well received at the Central Nebraska Regional Airport.  Her proposed ‘Airport Infrastructure Readiness Act of 2020’  was included in the stimulus plan approved by congress last night.  We appreciate her leadership in protecting future federal grants for airports in Nebraska,” said Michael Olson, Executive Director of the Hall County Airport Authority in Grand Island.“Like so many businesses impacted by unprecedented declines in both demand and revenue as a result of COVID 19, the Lincoln Airport continues to look for ways to serve the needs of our patrons and community while simultaneously seeking to provide employment security for our team.  I sincerely appreciate Sen. Fischer’s efforts in helping to represent airports and the larger aviation community through the provision of vital revenue stability aimed at protecting both jobs and critical infrastructure,” said from David Haring, Executive Director of the Lincoln Airport Authority.More information:The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides funding to airports for projects related to aircraft operations, such as runways, taxiways, and project planning. AIP funding for primary airports is based on the total number of enplanements (also known as boardings) at the airport.The AIR Act will require FAA to calculate AIP funding for FY 2022 and FY 2023 based on either 2018 or 2019 enplanement numbers, rather than 2020 and 2021 enplanement numbers which are expected to be significantly lower because of COVID-19. This will provide stability to primary airports in Nebraska regarding what they can expect for AIP funding over the next couple of years as they plan projects. The AIR Act also waives the benefit cost analysis for airports with contract towers, like the Central Nebraska Regional Airport, for FY 2020 and FY 2021.The full text is available here. Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/senator-fischer-s-air-act-passes-congress-providing-relief-for-ne-airports20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"

This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would allow nonprofits to once again use forms that are less complex when they are issuing 0% interest loans. This will help ensure the organizations can continue to make these loans to borrowers.“Every family deserves a place to call home, and non-profits such as Habitat for Humanity provide a vital service helping to ensure that happens. Unfortunately, complicated mortgage loan forms have made doing so more difficult. The BUILD Act will enable groups like Habitat for Humanity to help even more Americans in need,” said Senator Fischer.   “Habitat for Humanity and other nonprofit organizations offer help when the need is dire and families are struggling to put a roof over their heads – especially in tough times like these. The BUILD Act will ensure groups like Habitat for Humanity are not constricted by overly burdensome regulations, so they can get help where it’s needed, fast. I’m glad to see the Senate pass our bipartisan legislation, and I hope the House will take action at once so these nonprofits are able to continue providing a vital service to families across Maryland and our country,” said Senator Van Hollen.“We are grateful for Senator Fischer for leading the way on the BUILD Act. She is a true partner to Habitat for Humanity.  Senator Fischer’s work has removed government barriers that aren’t applicable to non-profit organizations that provide loans to families who don’t fit into a traditional lending model,” said Amanda Brewer, Habitat for Humanity of Omaha CEO. More information on the BUILD Act:Rules require all mortgage lenders who make five or more loans per year to fill out complex and expensive disclosure forms designed to protect consumers. These forms replaced simpler ones that had existed for years. Habitat for Humanity (Habitat) issues 0% interest mortgages to its clients, who are often the families receiving Habitat homes. The goal of these loans is not just cost savings, it is to help families build credit and learn financial responsibility. Because the new forms are longer, more complicated, and expensive to complete, most volunteers are not able complete them.The BUILD Act would allow nonprofits to use the old forms when issuing 0% interest loans, even if they make more than 5 mortgages. Staff and volunteers are familiar with these forms and they still have the adequate consumer protections needed for non-interest-bearing loans. Click here to read bill text. Permalink: https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/bipartisan-build-act-passes-senate20 West 23rd StreetKearney, NE 68847Phone: (308) 234-2361Fax: (308) 234-3684120 East 16th StreetSuite 203Scottsbluff, NE 69361Phone: (308) 630-2329Fax: (308) 630-2321"
