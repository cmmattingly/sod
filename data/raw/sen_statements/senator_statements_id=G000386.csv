https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-rainbow-fentanyl-targets-kids,"Q&A: “Rainbow” Fentanyl Targets KidsWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What do parents need to know about “rainbow”
fentanyl? A: As
students headed back to school, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
issued an alert about candy-colored, “rainbow” fentanyl produced and marketed
by the drug cartels to entice young people. When parents across America
tuck their kids in at night, remember words matter. Don’t let the long day
behind you keep you from taking a moment to share a lifesaving lesson for the
day ahead. It’s more important than ever to teach the next generation about the
dangers of drugs. It truly will save lives. Overdose deaths are on the rise and
destroying tens of thousands of families across America. Last year, the U.S.
reached the highest overdose deaths on record, nearly 108,000 people died from
overdose in 2021. Two-thirds of those deaths are attributed to synthetic
opioids like fentanyl. Last year, Iowa set its own record: 470 Iowans died of a
drug overdose, and 44 people who died were younger than age 25. That means Iowa
had a 120 percent spike in overdose deaths in that age group. What’s happening?
Counterfeit pills are flooding into the U.S. from Mexican drug cartels. They
are manufacturing fake pills and marketing them as legitimate prescription
pills. Drug traffickers are taking advantage of the Biden administration’s
failure to secure the border to funnel illicit drugs into our communities.
Sophisticated crime rings are moving the highly potent pills around the country
through a network of couriers and dealers and profiteering to the tune of
billions of dollars. In Congress, I’m working to cut off the money laundering
pipeline, as well as the drug trafficking pipeline at the border. As co-chair of the Senate Caucus on International
Narcotics Control, and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I’m working
with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to root out the corruption and money laundering schemes drug
cartels use. They are profiting from immeasurable pain and suffering by
peddling illicit poison. Last year, the DEA seized enough fentanyl powder to
kill every American in the country. Disguised as prescription drugs, these
pills may contain fentanyl or methamphetamine, and individuals think they’re
taking a prescription opioid, such as oxycodone (Oxycontin®, Percocet®),
hydrocodone (Vicodin®) or alprazolam (Xanax®). Experts say just two milligrams
may be lethal – imagine just 10-15 grains of table salt – may cause overdose
symptoms within seconds of ingestion. Parents, policymakers, educators, health care
professionals and law enforcement officials must work together to protect the
next generation. I’m answering the call from Iowa law enforcement and pleas
from parents to do more at the policy table. I’m continuing to push the Biden
administration and Democrats in Congress to extend the Schedule 1 for fentanyl analogues. Law enforcement needs every tool available to stop these
dangerous drugs. I’ve also introduced the Stop Pills that Kill Act that
stiffen penalties for counterfeit pill production. Make it your business to get in your teenager’s business.
Be sure they understand a pill they think is harmless could kill them. Know who
they chat with online. Know they can buy deadly counterfeit pills on social
media or other online platforms. Talk to other parents and talk to your kids.
Educate yourself about fentanyl. Learn more and visit the DEA’s Fentanyl
Awareness page. Q: What’s Congress doing to crack down on criminal
violence sweeping across America? 
A: Calls
by certain misguided elected leaders to “Defund the Police” had serious
consequences. Americans are increasingly concerned about public safety as they
go about their daily lives. Fewer police on the beat make our streets less
safe. Lawlessness and reckless bail reforms in urban areas across the country
are leading to increasingly violent crime across America. Murders and carjackings
are on the rise. Demoralized law enforcement departments are struggling to
recruit and retain police officers. Local police departments need more
resources, not less funding to keep the peace and keep our communities safe.
Last year, I helped steer to the president’s desk three bipartisan
bills to boost support for local law enforcement. Earlier this
year, I shepherded the Invest to Protect
Act and the Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act through
the Senate to provide more resources for local police departments and set up
mental health resources for first responders. Momentum is building for my
bicameral bill the Combating Violent
and Dangerous Crime Act, to
strengthen laws on the books for violent offenses to help keep communities
safe, including bank robbery, kidnapping, murder and a ban on marketing
candy-flavored drugs to minors. I’m also working to renew the Project Safe
Neighborhoods grant program that for two decades has helped local law
enforcement fight crime through prevention and intervention in the
neighborhoods where families work, go to school and run a business. The federal
grant program is coordinated by the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in the 94 federal
judicial districts. Applications for Iowa’s Project
Safe Neighborhoods are due Sept. 28, 2022.nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-pact-act,"Q&A:
PACT ActWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What is the PACT Act? A: In August,
Congress passed the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive
Toxics (PACT) Act that provides eligibility for medical benefits to
3.5 million veterans sickened by toxin exposure during their military service
in the Gulf War, post-9/11 and Vietnam War eras. This bipartisan
legislation is overdue. And I’m glad to help get it across the finish line for
Iowa veterans and their loved ones who have been impacted by health problems
connected to the burn pits and other toxins, including Agent Orange. On their
behalf, I was proud to support this long-awaited law every step of the way. The
PACT Act adds more than 20 presumptive conditions for exposure to burn pits and
other toxic exposures for Gulf War and post-9/11 era veterans. Presumptive is
the term the VA uses for certain conditions that automatically presumes a
veteran’s service caused the health condition in question. For these
conditions, veterans don’t have to prove their military service caused the
illness for which they are seeking disability or health benefits.  Under the new law, veterans who served on active duty on
or after Aug. 2, 1990 in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Somalia, or the United Arab Emirates, as well as service members who served on
active duty on or after Sept. 11, 2001 in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, or Yemen are considered to have had exposure to
burn pits or other toxins – a presumption of exposure – and may apply for VA
benefits. Similarly, the presumptive medical conditions include certain
cancers, lung diseases and other respiratory conditions. Learn more here. The PACT Act also includes important updates for Vietnam
era veterans. Specifically, two new presumptive conditions and additional Agent
Orange and radiation presumptive locations are now covered. Veterans who may
have previously been denied benefits for these new presumptive conditions may
make a supplemental claim, a Vietnam veteran can refile a claim for
hypertension, for example. Note the PACT Act also extended and expanded eligibility
to enroll in VA health care for conditions related to active-duty service for
post-9/11 combat veterans for up to 10 years after a veteran’s most recent
discharge.  The effective date for certain presumptive conditions will
take effect immediately, others will be phased in starting in 2023. However,
veterans may apply now. Benefits may be backdated to the date of the PACT Act’s
enactment, Aug. 10, 2022.  Veterans may learn more about eligibility and
applying for benefits at https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits or
call (800) 698-2411. Iowans also have contacted my office about benefits for
service members exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune in North
Carolina. The PACT Act allows veterans who served at Camp Lejeune between
August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987 to bring action in U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of North Carolina against the Department of Defense.Q: What led to the PACT Act’s passage? A: Like
many bills that move through Congress, grassroots pressure and bipartisanship
help break gridlock. One month after the PACT Act was enacted, America observed
the 21stanniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It’s a moment in
our history we will never forget. Tens of thousands of Americans enlisted in
the U.S. Armed Forces to defend freedom and our way of life, putting their
lives on the line in service to our country. U.S. troops were exposed to toxic
contaminants when the U.S. military burned plastic, rubber, chemicals and other
waste. After returning from deployments, Gulf War and post-9/11 veterans
reported serious illnesses and difficulty breathing. With passage of the PACT
Act, the federal government is keeping its promise to our veterans.
Throughout my service in the
U.S. Senate, I’ve made it a priority to listen to veterans and advocate on
their behalf at the policymaking table and hold the federal bureaucracy
accountable. No matter the issue, from working to fix patient
wait times at the VA, to improving implementation of community
care services, cutting red tape for benefits and military service
medals, advocating for service members with brain
injury and PTSD, boosting
resources for providers and mental health services, strengthening suicide
prevention, and providing help for family
members who take care of injured veterans, I will continue working as
hard as ever to ensure the federal government keeps its promises to the men and
women who put their lives on the line in service to our country.nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-community-pharmacies,"Q&A:
Community PharmaciesWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: How do Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) inflate
prescription drug costs? A: When I
make my 99 county visits across Iowa, I hear from Iowans about the high costs
of prescription drugs and the sticker shock at the pharmacy counter. It turns
out that sticker shock is a two-way street for independent community
pharmacies. This summer, I visited a community pharmacy in Estherville and
discussed the financial hardship it faced with retroactive fees collected by
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). They are the third-party companies who manage
prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurers and employers. 
These retroactive fees are called Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR) and
underscore the complicated pricing structure for prescription drugs that hurt
community pharmacies and cost consumers more out of pocket. The secrecy
cloaking the true cost of prescription drugs allows prices to be inflated along
the murky supply chain before it reaches the consumer’s medicine cabinet. DIR
started out as a way to ensure rebates and price breaks from drug manufacturers
didn’t result in the government paying more for drugs.  However, between
2010 and 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported retroactive
DIR fees increased by a whopping 107,400%. The PBMs are collecting more than $9
billion a year from pharmacies. In some cases, PBMs claw back payments from
pharmacies even a year after the point of sale. As a result, Iowa pharmacists
tell me seniors are paying more than they need to at the pharmacy counter.
Another community pharmacist in Dubuque called into my teletown meeting in
September to weigh in on this issue. The community pharmacies are getting
squeezed by PBMs and it’s making it harder for them to stay in business. This
business model is unpredictable, unfair and unsustainable. In Iowa we have 300
independent pharmacists serving Iowans in local communities across the state.
If a community pharmacy closes its doors because it can no longer afford to
stay open, Iowans are left without convenient access to on-site medication
therapy management with a trusted local health professional.  Q: What are you doing to help local pharmacies and their
patients? 
A: First
of all, I wrote bipartisan legislation that would end DIR fee claw
backs. CMS issued a rule to end them and I pushed to get those regulations
in place. However, that’s just one piece of the problem. Big Pharma needs a
giant dose of sunshine to hold prices down and hold stakeholders along the
entire supply chain accountable. My Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction
Act would reform Medicare Part D to help lower drug costs $72 billion
for seniors and save the taxpayer $95 billion. It would cap out-of-pocket
expenses, eliminate the donut hole and cap rising drug prices at the inflation
price index. It also includes critical transparency and accountability measures
that were omitted in the partisan massive tax and spending bill. In
the last few years, I’ve helped enact a series of bills that will save taxpayer
dollars and lower costs for patients. The CREATES Act,
the Right
to Rebate Act and the Patient
Right to Know Drug Prices Act and other reforms enacted so far this
Congress will save $9.6 billion over the next decade.  Not only that, it
brings a dose of common sense to the pharmacy counter. For example, the Patient
Right to Know Drug Prices Act prohibits a health insurance plan or pharmacy
benefit manager from restricting a pharmacy from informing a patient about
differences between the out-of-pocket cost of a drug and the cost of the drug
without health insurance coverage. In other words, if a patient can pay less
for a drug out-of-pocket instead of using insurance, the consumer ought to be
told that information. I’m also pressing CMS
for answers on the implementation of a real-time benefit tool that empowers
seniors to know more about the true cost of their medications. In my years of
fighting corruption and wasteful spending, I’ve learned sunshine is truly the
best disinfectant. Transparency brings accountability. And that’s exactly what
I’m seeking to accomplish with my bipartisan PBM Transparency Act.
As consolidation shrunk the number of players in the pharmaceutical supply
chain, Americans saw drug prices go up. We’ve seen this happening in Big Tech
and Big Cattle and why I use my senior position on the Senate Judiciary to
strengthen enforcement of our antitrust laws. In this Congress, I’m building
bipartisan coalitions, holding hearings and getting bills passed through the
committees of jurisdiction. Sen. Maria Cantwell and I got our PBM Transparency
bill passed 19-9 out of committee. It would prohibit PBMs from engaging in
spread pricing. This is where PBMs charge an insurer more than they charge the
pharmacy, and then pocket the difference. Iowans call that gaming the system.
That’s why I’m working to restore competition and strengthen transparency.
Government price controls will unravel incentives that invest in lifesaving
cures and treatments. That’s certainly not what Iowans who have loved ones
fighting cancer, Alzheimer’s or other chronic diseases want. There’s a better
way and I’ll work with anyone to cut drug prices without cutting cures. nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/09/02/2022/qanda-99-county-meetings,"Q&A:
99 County MeetingsWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What’s on the minds of Iowans at your 99 county
meetings? A: In August,
I completed my annual 99 county meetings for the 42nd consecutive
year across the state.  When Iowans first elected me to the U.S. Senate, I
started this annual tradition and have kept it every year since. I hold an
hour-long Q&A with Iowans face-to-face to hear their ideas and listen to
their concerns. Iowans set the agenda and I go to various places in the
community to reach a cross-section of people. From local hospitals, schools, civic clubs, businesses, and factories, I understand
people can’t always take time off work to attend a town meeting. In
addition, touring manufacturing facilities gives me the opportunity to learn
about the innovation and productivity here in Iowa, and after a tour of the business,
employers often shut down the line to allow workers to ask questions. Across
Iowa, the number one concern from river to river was the high cost of living
and 40-year high inflation. Rural Iowans were especially hard hit by the
soaring price of gas as so many people drive 30- to 40- miles one way to school
or work. Farmers and truckers are feeling the pinch to pay $5/gallon for
diesel. The high energy prices account for the lion’s share of high food prices
at the grocery store. High energy costs make it more expensive to put
crops in the ground, harvest, process, and ship products to the consumer. I was
impressed by the resilience of our small businesses to survive the economy
shutting down during the pandemic and claw back from supply chain disruptions
and labor shortages. In Northwood, I was able to hear from LR Falk Construction, a
business that specializes in custom crushing and delivery of limestone products
for construction and farm applications. We discussed the benefits of the
infrastructure bill I supported that will strengthen Iowa’s economy and quality
of life for generations to come. In January, I started out the year meeting
with workers at Shell Rock Soy Processing in Butler County and wrapped up my 99th
county meeting in August with a town meeting in Bedford, in Taylor
County. For the rest of the year, I’ll continue meeting with Iowans to have
dialogue. Representative government is a two-way street and my county meetings
are one way I like to keep in touch, eyeball to eyeball, with Iowans. Q: What other issues are you hearing about from
Iowans? 
A: As a
lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I’m
looking ahead to the new five-year Farm Bill that will be written next year.
I’ve been gathering feedback from producers across the state to help inform my
work on behalf of the 87,000 farm families who have a direct stake in the next
farm bill, from conservation, to crop insurance, rural development, supports
for beginning farmers and protecting the family farm from foreign acquisition.
For nearly 90 years, the farm bill supports productivity and ensures U.S. food
security to provide an affordable, high-quality food supply to feed America.
Many people aren’t aware that roughly 80 percent of the spending in the farm
bill pays for nutrition programs to help lower-income Americans. In August, I
visited Capital City Fruit in
Norwalk. This family business started as a fruit stand and has grown into a
packing, warehousing and distribution operation for fresh produce from farm to
table. The company participated in the USDA food box program during the
pandemic and donates thousands of pounds of food every year to help reduce food
insecurity in the community. Recently, I’ve held a series of meetings with Iowa
farmers, livestock producers and biofuel producers so that I can gauge their
priorities for the new Farm Bill.  At the negotiating table, I’ll fight
for reasonable farm payment limits to protect the taxpayer and integrity of the
farm safety net. I often remind my colleagues in Congress that food doesn’t
grow in the grocery store. I’ll also work to strengthen agriculture research to
ensure farmers in the 21st century have the resiliency,
innovation and expertise to produce food, fuel and fiber in a sustainable way.
Farmers are stewards of the land, serving as temporary caretakers of the soil
and water. From one year to the next, the family farmer has a vested interest
to protect the environment and a covenant with posterity to leave it even
better for the next generation. As one of only two crop farmers in the U.S.
Senate, I’m proud to champion Rural America and fight for the two percent of
Americans who produce the food that feeds 98 percent of the population.nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-canceling-student-debt,"Q&A:
Canceling Student DebtWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q:  What’s your view on the Biden administration’s
move to cancel student debt? A: Last year,
even Speaker Pelosi said President Biden does not have the authority to
unilaterally wipe away student debt. His proposal would transfer up to $20,000
in debt for individuals making up to $125,000 (or married couples making up to
$250,000) from borrowers to the taxpayer, adding at least $320 billion and up
to $980 billion to the national debt over the next decade. On top of that, the
president extended the moratorium for restarting student debt payments, a pause
that’s already cost taxpayers $150 billion. With that money, we could have
doubled the Pell Grant, which helps low-income Americans afford college in the
first place. Don’t forget, the payment deferral was put in place to provide
relief during the pandemic when the government shut down the economy and tens
of millions of people lost their jobs. In 2022, the economy is running at full
employment, especially for those with a college degree. Studies show people
with college degrees have higher lifetime incomes. A bachelor’s degree raises
one’s lifetime earnings by an average of $2.8 million. And yet, the Biden
administration is putting the taxpayer on the hook for loans that Americans
with advanced degrees and higher earning potential took out to pay for their
higher education.  The policy also will fuel the fires of inflation in the
short-term. Fiscal policy 101: spend less, not more, to curb 40-year high
inflation. What’s more, Biden’s debt transfer takes America down a very
slippery slope in the future. It raises expectations of debt forgiveness,
encouraging borrowers to take out more loans with scant regard to repay them
and forces waitresses, farmers, roofers, janitors and truckers who may not have
attended college to pay the way for others who did. It’s unfair to those who
already paid off their students loans or worked, sacrificed and saved to pay
their own way. Wiping out student debt with the stroke of a presidential pen
sets a dangerous precedent that oversteps the constitutional authority of the legislative
branch that holds the power of the purse strings. In addition to the reckless
decision to wipe out such a sizeable swath of consumer debt, the executive
order ignores the underlying issue to make higher education more affordable,
not more expensive. Make no mistake. This policy will not cure rising tuition,
it will feed tuition growth. Guess what happened when Congress lifted the lid
on federal loans? It greased the wheels to borrow more, loosening the reins for
colleges to increase tuition. Q: What can be done to help lower college tuition? A: Big
spenders always think throwing more money at a problem will fix it. Consider
how expanding unemployment benefits, continuing rent moratoriums and extending
student loan pauses discourage people from reengaging in the workforce, earning
money to pay their bills and fulfill their debt obligations. Addressing college
affordability requires reforms that give students better value and better bang
for their buck. I’ve introduced a package
of bipartisan higher education bills to bring more transparency into
the student loan market and to empower students with financial literacy tools
to be smart borrowers. Specifically, students ought to know up front how much
they will pay and whether or not they are likely to be able to pay it back. My
bills would provide students and their families with better information about
the costs of college from the very start of the college search, through the
application process, and to the acceptance financial aid. My legislation would
cut red tape and tell students in plain language what the loan amounts are and
how that compares to their ability to repay. It would make a universal
financial aid tool easily available to students so they can compare financial
aid packages between schools. Transparency brings accountability and will help
give peace of mind to families and students who are making one of the most
consequential financial decisions of their lives. I’m also co-sponsoring the Stop
Reckless Student Loan Actions Act that would prohibit the president
from canceling student debt, stop the student loan payment pause and prevent a
unilateral moratorium in the future. Q:
What should borrowers do if they believe they may be eligible? A: Borrowers
should contact their student loan service provider to ensure their contact
information is up to date. The student loan service provider will have the best
information specific to an individual’s payment plan and type of loan. In the
meantime, borrowers should continue loan payments unless the service provider
has confirmed a change has been made. There’s a lot of uncertainty and many
details are still up in the air, including whether this executive action is
constitutional. 
At this time, we still do not
know exactly what loans will be eligible or how the process will work. Further,
this executive order is on shaky legal ground. President Biden is claiming
that, under a post-9/11 law to help service members with loans in times of war
or national emergency, he has the authority for a blanket transfer of debt due
to COVID-19. Many lawmakers and constitutional scholars are skeptical of that
argument. Ultimately, the president’s action to cancel student debt will likely
be litigated in the courts.nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

Beefing Up IRSWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What’s your beef with the Biden administration beefing
up the IRS? A: President
Biden will fatten up the IRS to the tune of $80 billion thanks to the so-called Inflation
Reduction Act that squeaked through Congress on a party-line vote. The
administration plans to double the size of the IRS workforce and beef up
enforcement to collect more revenue from the American taxpayer. No matter how
much money the IRS collects, big spenders in Washington will never have enough
revenue to satisfy their spending appetite. You can bet your boots the
tax-collecting agency is gearing up to conduct more audits. Contrary to what
the president promised, the IRS will hit small business and lower- and
middle-income Americans with more audits. While the legislation was being
debated, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that an amendment to
prevent the IRS from using the new funding to audit taxpayers with taxable
incomes below $400,000 would reduce government revenues by $20 billion. So,
just as 40-year high inflation is eating up the wages and paychecks of
hardworking Americans to pay rent, buy groceries and fill up the gas tank, the
Biden administration is beefing up the IRS by nearly six times its current
annual budget to help pay for its climate and social spending agenda. Make no
mistake. CBO assumes those making under $400,000 also will be targeted. Adding
an additional 87,000 IRS personnel will put more pressure on small business
people and their employees in pursuit of more tax dollars.  As former chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee, I’ve spent decades conducting oversight of the IRS to hold the
tax-collecting agency accountable to the taxpaying public. I’ve written a
series of bipartisan reforms to put the taxpayer first, including enacting the
Taxpayer Bill of Rights in 1988, amending it in 1996, and enacting the Taxpayer
First Act in 2019. I also served on the 17-member National Commission
on Restructuring the IRS and conducted a one-year audit of the operations and
services at the federal tax-collecting agency. We identified key structural
shortcomings, from antiquated computer systems to a culture of intimidation
versus customer service. Based on the findings of this working group, Sen. Bob
Kerrey and I secured bipartisan, landmark reforms that became law in 1998. The IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act sought to modernize its business
processes and information technology systems and refocus the primary mission of
the IRS on taxpayer service. Q: What are your concerns about boosting the IRS budget by
$80 billion? 
A: The
IRS has a track record of fiscal mismanagement, wasting billions of
taxpayer dollars to upgrade its computer systems and always asking for more
money to fix what’s not working. Wasteful spending and mismanagement have
spoiled my appetite to shovel more money at the IRS. Although taxpayers deserve
prompt, convenient services and protection from cyberattacks, Washington’s
answer to every problem is to throw more money at it. After sustaining a
self-inflicted black eye during the Obama administration for a political
targeting scandal, the IRS
still hasn’t come clean regarding apparent leaks of protected taxpayer
information. The apparent massive data breach or hack undermines the public
trust in our institutions of government. On top of that, the IRS continuously
underperforms its mission to serve the taxpayer. During the pandemic, its
customer service performance plummeted to new lows. The IRS only answered nine
percent of customer support calls. After filing their tax returns for 2021,
millions of Americans were still waiting for the IRS to process their tax
returns for 2020. Earlier this year, I called upon the Biden administration to
get the federal bureaucracy back
to in-person work. I also cosponsored an amendment during debate on the
spending bill that would have prevented the new IRS funding from being
used to hire any new IRS employees until after 90% of the IRS workforce was
back in the office. Recently, my staff that help Iowans with casework
calculated the average number of days to get assistance from a federal agency
had doubled to 335 days. My office is working to resolve scores of cases with
the IRS on behalf of Iowans. And yet, according to the Treasury Department, the
lion’s share of the new funding is for increasing enforcement and compliance.
Narrowing the tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and taxes collected,
is something all law-abiding taxpayers want. For years, I’ve championed protections
for IRS whistleblowers, to empower insiders who know something, to say
something. Blowing the whistle on tax cheats is a proven tool to make them pay
what they owe. This program has enabled the IRS to collect more than $6 billion
from wealthy individuals and businesses caught dodging taxes. What’s more, it
yields untold billions more through taxpayer compliance. I also spearheaded
another proven tool, the IRS
private debt collection program. Signed into law in 2015, the program has
collected more than $2 billion in unpaid taxes through fiscal year 2021. This
program brings in money without spending more money. The Biden administration
ought to be making better use of the private debt collection program rather
than spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to squeeze taxpayers and
small businesses in the hunt for more money. nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-student-loan-debt,"Q&A:
Student Loan DebtWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: Do you support President Biden’s plan to wipe away
student debt? A: When
something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Once again, the Biden
administration is operating under the false assumption that money grows on
trees. When the economy shut down in 2020, Congress passed a series of pandemic
relief programs to help American families, rural hospitals and small businesses
stay afloat. One of the financial lifelines was a pause on student loan
payments and interest. Despite the economy opening back up and unfilled jobs
holding back the recovery and forcing small businesses to cut back on services
and hours of operation, the Biden administration unilaterally extended the
deferral of payments to student borrowers repeatedly. This action pushes the
cost of the student loan payment pause up to $150 billion. By pressing the
pause button, President Biden is allowing high-earners with graduate degrees to
defer monthly payments for two years and counting. But even that’s still not
enough. Big spenders want President Biden to let student borrowers off the hook
and walk away scot-free from their debt obligations. Iowans know that debt
can’t be wiped away with a magic wand and vanish into thin air. I often say
Washington, D.C. is an island surrounded by reality. This proposal brings
Fantasy Island to the banks of the Potomac River. And the taxpayer will pick up
the tab. Make no mistake. Canceling student debt is a sharp slap in
the face for the generations of hard-working families and borrowers who saved,
sacrificed and worked their way through school to pay their own way. For the
millions of Americans who don’t attend college and carve out a career in the
trades or climb their way up the retail and hospitality industries, the Biden
administration would pick their pockets through higher taxes to pay off the
$1.75 trillion in outstanding student loans. It’s a regressive proposal that
most benefits people with advanced college degrees. They tend to have the
highest debt, as well as higher salaries and higher lifetime earnings. The
bottom line is, the president does not have unilateral authority to snap his
fingers and make a trillion dollars vanish. Congress holds the purse strings
for a reason. And I’ll continue keeping a tight-fisted grip on taxpayer
dollars. That’s why I recently joined Sen. John Thune on the Stop
Reckless Student Loan Actions Act. This bill would explicitly prevent
the president from unilaterally cancelling student debt, end the current
student loan pause, and ensure that a pause can’t go on forever like this in
the future. Q: What are your initiatives to help prevent borrowers
from getting in over their heads? 
A: First
off, let’s be clear why I oppose unilaterally canceling student debt. It’s a
slippery slope of no return. Once Uncle Sam starts handing out freebies and
erasing debts, the demand for get-out-of-debt giveaways would expand to car
loans, home mortgages, credit cards and more. It also fosters a disincentive
for families to save for their kids’ higher education. Canceling student debt
on today’s borrowers makes savers and borrowers who scrimped, saved and
sacrificed to pay their own way look like chumps. It also gives colleges and
universities the green light to keep raising tuition because Uncle Sam will
eventually forgive the loans. President Biden’s proposal does nothing to curb
runaway tuition costs. I’ve written
a trio of bills to help families and students navigate the true costs
of college before they shoulder a mountain of debt. My Know Before You Owe
Federal Student Loan Act would bring transparency into the
process and help students understand whether their borrowing is in line
with their likely income based on their degree so they fully factor in the cost
of college. This has the added benefit of injecting the free market into the
process to help bring down the price of higher education. It would also
require counseling to show students their student loan payments compared
to their likely projected income. The Understanding the True
Cost of College Act would create a universal financial aid award
letter so students could compare financial aid packages among schools. The Net
Price Calculator Improvement Act would provide students with
individualized estimates of higher education costs and financial aid options
before deciding where to apply. I’ve also introduced bipartisan
legislation with Sen. Joni Ernst that would address skyrocketing loans and
tuition by empowering students to understand up front the costs of what they
are borrowing. Our Student Transparency for Understanding Decisions in
Education Net Terms (STUDENT) Act would
provide student loan applicants with an estimate of the total amount of
interest they would pay based on a 10 year repayment plan during or
prior to accepting a loan. Students seeking to earn an advanced degree will
come out ahead if they’re smart about not getting in over their heads
under a mountain of debt in the first place.nav-mobile-modalsearch-mobile-modal"

https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/qanda-may-is-national-beef-month,"Q&A:
May is National Beef MonthWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What’s your beef with the meatpacking industry in
America? A: For years
I’ve been riding herd on anticompetitive practices in the livestock industry.
Our independent producers are getting the short end of the stick in today’s
marketplace. Only four meatpackers control 85 percent of the cattle slaughter.
They often enter into hidden contracts with large feedlots. So, when smaller,
independent producers have fat cattle ready for market, they become a residual
supplier for the packers. The current system allows packers to fatten their
profits at the expense of smaller beef producers and American
consumers. Consider one of the meat giants, Tyson Foods, recently reported
a 48 percent profit increase from last year. Another one, JBS recently settled
a $52 million beef price-fixing lawsuit. The jig is up and I’m fighting tooth
and nail to bring price discovery and transparency to these marketing
arrangements to give independent cattle producers a fair shake so they can get
a fair price for their high-quality beef. My bipartisan bills the Cattle
Price Discovery and Transparency Act and the Meat
and Poultry Special Investigator Act are gathering steam in the
U.S. Senate. Lawmakers from Georgia to New York and New Mexico are
co-sponsoring the bipartisan legislation I wrote with Sen. Deb Fischer of
Nebraska, Jon Tester of Montana and Ron Wyden of Oregon to tackle
anticompetitive practices in the beef industry. I know what we’re up against.
The packers wield beefy influence in Washington, D.C. They initially butchered
a mandatory price reporting bill I worked on years ago with then Sen. Tom
Daschle from neighboring South Dakota. Eventually we prevailed and the
Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act has been on the books since 1999 and
everyone today accepts it is helpful. Now, the packers want to put my beefed up
livestock marketing reforms on the chopping block. It’s an uphill battle, but
we’ve got momentum on our side and I’ll continue bringing Iowa cattle
producers’ voices to the table. I credit Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Sen. John
Boozman for holding a hearing to examine our bill in the Senate Agriculture
Committee. Concentration in the packing industry controls the meat
supply chain that brings beef, pork and poultry to kitchen tables across
America. While consumers benefit from efficiency, they also expect quality
product at affordable prices. The COVID-19 pandemic and a 2019 fire that
destroyed a beef packing plant in Kansas exposed vulnerabilities in the food
supply chain. These disruptions served as a wake-up call to strengthen
competition and the need to restore a level playing field to help ensure fair
prices across the board – from farm to fork. For two decades, we’ve seen
vertical integration scale up and take control of how livestock is raised,
marketed and processed in America. Alternative marketing arrangements have
gutted negotiated cash purchases and undermine a way of life and generational
family farming in America. At the Senate Agriculture Committee hearing in
April, the USDA confirmed Iowa producers supply “very high” quality cattle.
Iowa producers ought to rake in profits for producing high-quality beef, not
get raked over the coals by the packers. As Iowa’s senior U.S. Senator, you can
bet the farm I’ll keep working my tail off to get my bipartisan reforms across
the finish line so that cattle farmers in Iowa can get a fair price for their
high-quality beef. Family farmers get pennies on the dollar for what American
families spend at the grocery store. Packers in the middle are putting the
squeeze on the independent cattle producer and the American consumer. Q: How important is the beef industry to Iowa? A: Iowa
has a proud heritage of cattle, conservation and land stewardship. From cattle
feeders to cow-calf operators and dairy farmers, Iowa farm families produce high-quality,
corn-fed, marbled beef that makes mouths water across the country and the
entire world, especially as grilling season approaches. In February, the
University of Nebraska published a report that showed 94% of cattle in the
Iowa-Minnesota region grades over 80%. That makes cattle slaughtered in our
state the best quality in the country. According to a 2017 study by Iowa State
University (ISU), Iowa has the seventh largest cattle inventory in the U.S. and
ranks fourth in the country for cattle and calves on feed. Our bountiful grain
harvest, including dried distillers grains from ethanol production, ensures
Iowa beef adds value to the state’s economy and vitality to our rural
communities. According to the ISU study, our state has more than 28,000 cattle
operations, including more than 19,000 farms with beef cows, more than 6,000
feedlots and 1,340 dairy farms. In 2016, Iowa’s beef industry generated an
estimated $6.3 billion in economic activity. The lack of processing capacity in
Iowa that started decades ago was exacerbated when COVID-19 disrupted food
supply chains and sidelined members of the workforce. Efforts are underway in
our state to add beef processing capacity. This is good news that will help
address distortions and disruptions in the marketplace, boost farm income and
increase competition. I’ll keep working at the policymaking tables to ensure
our cattle producers can continue raising high-quality beef for generations to
come that American families can enjoy at their kitchen tables at prices they
can afford.

Veterans Honor FlightsWith U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley Q: What are Veterans Honor Flights? A: Across the
United States, a network of local organizations raises money to provide
expense-free trips to the nation’s capital for veterans to spend a day in
remembrance and celebration of their military service to America. Thanks to
generous donors and an army of local volunteers, tens of thousands of veterans
who served during the eras spanning World War II and the Korean and Vietnam
Wars have made the once-in-a-lifetime trip since 2005. Veterans with a terminal
illness from any period of service are given priority in the application
process. The full-day excursion allows veterans to share their stories with one
another and bear witness to the memorials and monuments in Washington, D.C.
built in honor of their service and sacrifice for America. Veterans typically
receive an early morning bon voyage at their local airport followed by a hero’s
homecoming at the end of a long and meaningful day. Their loved ones and
members of the local community come to express their appreciation and gratitude
for the patriotism and service of their local hometown heroes who served in
uniform to defend our freedoms at home and abroad. The Honor Flight Network has
expanded to 128 hubs located across the country. For the last two decades, a
dedicated and generous corps of donors, guardians and volunteers organize, plan
and pay for the Honor Flights to make the magic happen. During the month of
May, the Honor Flight Network will celebrate an extraordinary milestone of
bringing a quarter-million veterans on these missions of tribute in
heartwarming salute to their service. It is an extraordinary honor for me and
members of my staff to meet up with veterans from Iowa who join the Honor
Flights to our nation’s capital. In April, my staff welcomed nearly 90 veterans
on the first flight of the year from the Eastern Iowa Honor Flight in Cedar
Rapids while I was holding county meetings in Iowa. We look forward to
welcoming many more veterans to Washington, D.C. in the coming year and
beyond.   Q: What are some ways you keep in touch with veterans
in Iowa? A: Several
years ago, I expanded my office’s outreach to keep in touch with Iowa’s veteran
community by creating a Veterans Fellow position on my staff. I wanted to bring
on board a military veteran who works in Iowa and has boots on the ground as a
community outreach officer for veterans and their families. My Veterans Fellow
helps solve problems and cut red tape veterans may experience to obtain health
care, housing or employment in their local communities. Having an ambassador
solely focused on connecting with Iowa veterans and their families and to
liaison with veterans service organizations, health care providers and
employers helps make sure we’re doing everything we can to solve problems,
address concerns and celebrate the successes of our hometown heroes. Harrison
Swift currently serves as Veterans Fellow in my Des Moines office. A veteran of
the United States Marine Corps, he served in Afghanistan during his military
service. On May 4, my Veterans Fellow will hold a listening post in Missouri
Valley from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the Rand Center, 100 S. 4th St.
Local veterans and their families are encouraged to attend to share their
experiences and concerns.
A few years ago, my office
started organizing interviews around the state to help preserve the stories of
Iowa veterans for the Veterans History Project administered by the Library of
Congress. Held the Friday before Veterans Day, we record stories from local
veterans so their service and sacrifice aren’t lost to history. Since 2018, we
have interviewed more than 50 veterans around the state, including the Gold
Star Museum in Johnston, the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, the Veterans
Post in Waverly, and the 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux
City. In November, we’ve scheduled our fifth annual event to record interviews
for the Veterans History Project to take place at the Sullivan Brothers Iowa
Veterans Museum in Waterloo. Veterans interested in participating may send an
