https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/blackburn-colleagues-introduce-effort-to-preserve-servicemember-readiness-amid-termination-threats-over-covid-vaccine,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) introduced new legislation to preserve the readiness of the Armed Forces by limiting separations based on COVID–19 vaccination status until recruiting benchmarks are met and ensuring continued pay and benefits for servicemembers while religious and health accommodations are pending.This legislation continues Senator Blackburn’s work to protect U.S. servicemembers from being terminated because of President Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate.  “Joe Biden announced the ‘pandemic is over,’ and therefore has no reason to continue to fire our servicemembers using his politically-motivated vaccine mandate. America’s national readiness should not be jeopardized because this White House is hellbent on preserving their forever pandemic. My legislation continues my work to strengthen our armed forces and prevent yet another unconstitutional power grab from the Biden administration,” said Senator Blackburn. “President Biden is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. There’s no reason to quibble over the vaccination status of healthy men and women when the president can’t even fill the recruitment quotas we need in the first place. Our bill would end this absurd practice,” said Senator Cotton. “As we face recruitment challenges in our armed services, it just doesn’t make sense to kick healthy men and women out for religious or health objections to taking a COVID vaccine, especially now that even President Biden has acknowledged the pandemic is over,” said Senator Braun.“We need to be working to strengthen our Armed Forces and support the brave men and women in uniform, especially with recruitment numbers down,” said Senator Hoeven. “Continuing to put punitive COVID-19 mandates in place is the wrong approach. It’s long past time that the Biden administration ends their COVID mandates and we’ll continue working to block federal overreach like this that hinders our active duty, Guard and Reserve members.”“Defending our nation and its interests represents our primary constitutional duty.  President Biden’s unwillingness to give up his COVID vaccine mandates and penalties is hurting U.S. military retention and recruitment, which affects national security,” Senator Hyde-Smith said. “Senator Blackburn’s commonsense legislation to correct this situation deserves consideration, passage, and enactment.” This legislation prohibits involuntary separation of a servicemember for refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine until each Service achieves its authorized end strength. As the military faces recruiting and retention deficits, it is not in the interest of national security to separate otherwise ready servicemembers solely for vaccine refusal.It also requires the National Guard and Reserve to maintain servicemember access to pay and benefits while a request for a religious or health accommodation is pending. This would ensure continuation of Guard and Reserve policy in line with active duty and prohibit what is essentially adverse action prior to a determination.Read the text of the bill here. RELATED:"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/blackburn-padilla-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ensure-artists-are-paid-for-their-music-across-all-platforms,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced the bipartisan American Music Fairness Act to ensure artists and music creators receive fair compensation for the use of their songs on AM/FM radio. This legislation will bring corporate radio broadcasters in line with all other music streaming platforms, which already pay artists for their music. Identical legislation (H.R. 4130) has already been introduced and received a hearing in the House, setting Congress up for action this fall. “From Beale Street to Music Row to the hills of East Tennessee, the Volunteer State’s songwriters have undeniably made their mark. However, while broadcasters demand compensation for the content they create and distribute, they don’t apply this view to the songwriters, artists, and musicians whose music they play on the radio without paying royalties. Tennessee’s creators deserve to be compensated for their work. This legislation will ensure that they receive fair payment and can keep the great hits coming,” said Senator Blackburn. “For too long, our laws have unfairly denied artists the right to receive fair compensation for their hard work and talent on AM/FM broadcasts,” said Senator Padilla. “California’s artists have played a pivotal role in enriching and diversifying our country’s music scene. That is why passing the American Music Fairness Act is so important. It’s time we treat our musical artists with the dignity and respect they deserve for the music they produce and we enjoy every day.” “The American Music Fairness Act is gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, and we look forward to progress in the months ahead. Big Radio has used an antiquated loophole to deny payments to artists for decades, but with the help of Senator Blackburn, Senator Padilla and other allies in Congress, this is the year we will finally end this injustice,” said Congressman Joe Crowley, Chairman of the musicFIRST Coalition. “Senators Blackburn and Padilla have the appreciation and respect of the music industry for leading the fight on behalf of the thousands of American artists and creators who deserve to be paid fairly when their work is played on AM/FM radio.” “The American Music Fairness Act is a vital step towards bringing the U.S. music industry into the 21st Century,” said Michael Huppe, President and CEO of SoundExchange. “It ends the injustice of denying music creators payment for their work, levels the playing field between traditional broadcasts and streaming platforms, and caps the royalties that small and community AM/FM radio stations pay at just $500 a year. This is a common-sense – and long overdue -- blueprint for a healthier and fairer music industry.” “Music creators have been fighting this battle for decades, so the introduction of the American Music Fairness Act in the Senate is an important step forward in the fight to ensure artists are paid when their music is played on broadcast radio,” said Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. “It’s time for artists to be compensated for their creative work that keeps AM/FM radio thriving. We’re thankful to our many Academy members for their continued advocacy, and to Senators Padilla and Blackburn for hearing our collective voice and pushing this legislation forward. We’re hopeful that we’re nearing the finish line to end this inequity that has disadvantaged music people for far too long.” “The introduction of the AMFA bill in the Senate is an important step forward for music artists' rights,” said Fran Drescher, President of SAG-AFTRA. “I am grateful to Senator Padilla and Senator Blackburn and implore every Congressional member to support AMFA and close up the loophole that allows businesses to exploit workers without pay. Broadcast companies profit from advertising sales because of the creative content musicians and singers record. It stands to reason that the performers who create the content deserve to be compensated just as songwriters are now. The reason it’s called the American Music Fairness Act is because the current situation is wholly unfair and it’s up to Congress to make it fair NOW!” “By introducing the American Music Fairness Act today, Senators Padilla and Blackburn are standing on the side of musicians and small independent record labels who for too long have seen enormous national radio conglomerates make billions of dollars without paying a cent for the sound recordings that draw in their listeners,” said Dr. Richard James Burgess, President and CEO of the American Association of Independent Music. “That’s just not fair, and the status quo should be an insult to all content creators, including broadcasters themselves. The bill has the most generous exception ever for truly small community broadcasters, so the time is now to enact it into law.” “For far too long, our broken and unfair system has let AM/FM radio stations — many of which are owned by just a few massive media corporations — get away with refusing to pay artists when they play their music. While these big corporate broadcast companies gobble up billions upon billions in advertising dollars, the session and background musicians, whose work make all of it possible, receive no compensation whatsoever for their creations. It’s time to right this wrong, and the American Music Fairness Act aims to do just that,” said Ray Hair, International President of the American Federation of Musicians. “It's vital that Congress protects the livelihoods of those who create the music we know and love. We commend Senator Blackburn, Senator Padilla and our other allies in Congress for championing this cause.” “The American Music Fairness Act takes a smart, calibrated approach towards solving a decades old problem in the radio industry,” said Mitch Glazier, Chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America. “It will finally ensure that recording artists and copyright owners are paid fairly for their work regardless of the technology used to broadcast it while carefully protecting small and noncommercial stations to preserve truly local radio our communities depend upon.” Currently, the United States is the only democratic country in the world in which artists are not compensated for the use of their music on AM/FM radio. By requiring broadcast radio corporations to pay performance royalties to creators for AM/FM radio plays, the American Music Fairness Act would close an antiquated loophole that has allowed corporate broadcasters to forgo compensating artists for the use of their music for decades. In recognition of the important role of locally owned radio stations in communities across the U.S., the American Music Fairness Act also includes strong protections for small, college, and non-commercial stations.The Blackburn-Padilla bill is identical to companion legislation (H.R. 4130) introduced in 2021 in the House of Representatives, which received a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee in February and is currently working its way through the committee process. This legislation will positively impact artists and the music industry at large by:  The American Music Fairness Act is endorsed by: the AFL-CIO, the American Association of Independent Music (A2IM), the American Federation of Musicians, the Recording Academy, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), SAG-AFTRA and SoundExchange. Full text of the bill is available here.  ###"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/law-enforcement-victims-advocates-across-america-back-the-restoring-law-and-order-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) announced growing support for their Restoring Law and Order Act introduced last week. The legislation will increase resources for law enforcement by establishing a federal grant program to target violent crime and improve the processing of rape kits. Law enforcement and victims’ advocates are praising the push to keep violent criminals off the streets and put rapists behind bars faster: Sheriff Eddie Farris, Putnam County, Tennessee, “Across certain areas of the country, crime has gotten out of control due to some crime prosecutors, judges, and calls to defund the police. Tennesseans back the blue and we must increase the resources law enforcement has in order to pursue violent criminals. I appreciate Senators Blackburn and Hagerty for introducing this legislation which will increase the resources my office has to pursue violent criminals, illegal immigrants committing crimes and help keep our citizens safer.”  Sheriff John Fuson, Montgomery County, Tennessee, “Across the country law enforcement are increasingly responding to overwhelming numbers of drug overdoses; mostly due to access to the extremely potent and deadly drug fentanyl being mixed with other illegal narcotics. We are fighting this issue on multiple fronts now – the negative impact to our death investigation caseloads from drug overdose deaths and crime spawning out of thefts, burglaries, and violent assaults perpetrated by criminals either seeking or selling these vile drugs in our communities; their just two of those fronts we combat daily. Law enforcement, now more than ever, need continued support to insure we have the latest and most advanced technology and equipment, used by the most highly-trained and well-staffed force of sheriff’s deputies and police officers in the world. I commend our Tennessee Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty for introducing legislation that will keep our communities safe. I also commend their continued fight on the Federal level to secure our U.S. southern border, keeping the flood of violent criminal activity from entering our state and local communities in the first place.” Brandon Judd, President, National Border Patrol Council, ""The ongoing security and human catastrophe created by the Biden Administration at our Southern Border is beyond anything this country has ever seen. Because of Biden Administration policies, huge areas along our border have no Border Patrol Agents patrolling far too frequently. We need all the help we can get to detain and deport individuals who enter our country illegally. Thank you to Senators Blackburn and Hagerty for their continued leadership and their work to provide law enforcement the resources needed to keep America safe."" Sheriff Mark Lamb, Pinal County, Arizona, “Under President Biden, there have been nearly 3.6 million attempts to illegally cross our southern border and 78 suspected terrorists have been caught crossing just in 2022. Senator Blackburn and Hagerty’s legislation will help law enforcement across the country by increasing resources to combat violent crime and illegal immigrants. From departments that are forced to deal with the effects of Biden’s border crisis like mine in Pinal County, to those in big cities that deal with inner city crime. We need to be supporting police and keeping criminals in jail. I appreciate the Senators strong leadership and commitment to keeping Americans safe.” Jennifer Harrison, Victims Rights NY, “The depraved indifference towards human life sweeping across our nation and amongst elected officials is unconscionable.  While people are losing their lives and are victimized daily as a direct result many of our so-called leaders want to still decrease support for police and release more violent criminals. Any act to increase support for law enforcement restoring law and order will help stop the bloodshed and prevent victimization. We welcome the Restoring Law and Order Act and thank Senators Blackburn and Hagerty for introducing it.” Sheriff Jim Skinner, Collin County, Texas, Chairman National Sheriffs Association, Government Affairs Committee, “This bill is truly needed, especially given that crime rates are skyrocketing and many of our cities are in complete chaos.  Americans want their families to be safe and supporting law enforcement with this type of legislation is essential to accomplishing that objective.” Sgt. Betsy Smith (ret.), Spokesperson National Police Association, “The left’s push to end cash bail and defund the police have made communities more dangerous. Violent criminals should be locked up behind bars, and police departments need a surge in funding to hire more officers focused on pursuing violent criminals. I appreciate Senators Blackburn and Hagerty for standing with our brave men and women in blue.”RELATED### "

Tennesseans are shocked by what they have seen and are appalled by medical professionals touting the mutilation of minor children. “Using children for profit and political gain is deeply disturbing. Experts agree that there have not been enough clinical trials conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of using these drugs on kids,” said Senator Blackburn. “These drugs have not been approved for treating children experiencing gender dysphoria, but the left insists on experimenting on these children anyway.” You can read Senator Blackburn’s letter to the FDA here.###"

Senator Blackburn met with local leaders including law enforcement officers, manufacturers, small business owners, school officials, and community advocates to discuss the important issues facing the Volunteer State and the dangers posed by Joe Biden’s socialist agenda.“Each year, I visit with local leaders, business owners, farmers, and families in every single one of our 95 counties. One thing is clear — they do not want the socialist agenda that Joe Biden is selling. Inflation has reached a historic 40-year high and families are struggling to put food on the table. Tennesseans want less government control, lower taxes, a strong military, safe communities, and a secure southern border. It is an honor to represent the Volunteer State and fight back against the socialist radical left,” said Senator Blackburn.  RELATED:###"

These policies prevent law enforcement officials from cooperating with federal immigration officials and allow dangerous, violent criminal aliens to walk free without fear of deportation.” The senators continued, “This issue is as important as ever given the ongoing surge of illegal immigrants arriving at our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had nearly 3.5 million encounters with illegal immigrants crossing our southern border. Meanwhile, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz recently announced that agents caught ten illegal immigrant sex offenders, four gang members, and a murderer in just three days. In those same three days, agents seized one hundred fentanyl pills and seventy-one pounds of methamphetamine.” “We are deeply concerned that sanctuary jurisdictions are serving as a pull factor for illegal immigrants and for criminal aliens. This failure to comply with federal law creates an incentive for illegal immigrants to travel to the United States and avoid accountability by moving to sanctuary jurisdictions,” the senators concluded. Read the full letter here. ###"

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/blackburn-cruz-introduce-bill-to-combat-racist-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-in-d-c-schools,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill that will protect students in Washington, D.C. public schools from the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) also joined them. The D.C. school vaccine mandate would prohibit unvaccinated schoolkids from 12 to 15 years of age from attending school in person. The mandate is particularly harmful to black students, who are vaccinated at a lower rate than other students. D.C.’s vaccine mandate comes on the heels of two years of school shutdowns and remote learning – which led to substantial learning loss, particularly for students who were already struggling in school. If the D.C. vaccine mandate is enforced, many D.C. students may fall even further behind in school.“Right now, any news organization worth its subscription fee is running story after story with evidence that the left’s forever pandemic is destroying the mental and emotional well-being of children. Yet somehow, right here in our nation’s capital, leaders are depriving students of a basic education if they don’t comply with the District’s highly-politicized vaccine mandate. Getting vaccinated should be a decision between a patient, parent, and doctor – not politicians pressured by big teachers’ unions and radical activists,” said Senator Blackburn. “D.C. public schools are blatantly discriminating against black students in our nation’s capital. The rate of vaccination for black students between the ages of 12 and 15 in Washington, D.C. is 60 percent – far lower than the city average. D.C. schools has already postponed enforcement of this racist policy until 2023 and they should simply scrap it. Until they do, I will fight for the students of D.C. and work to end this mandate,” said Senator Cruz. Read the bill here.###"

Representatives Scott Fitzgerald and Jim Banks have introduced a version of this bill in the House of Representatives.  “Over the past few years, teachers’ unions have demonstrated they will put their political priorities ahead of student wellbeing every chance they get,” said Senator Blackburn. “The NEA is by all accounts a political organization and should not be rewarded for their left-wing activism with a federal charter.” “The National Education Association used to stand up for students. Unfortunately, it is now a federally chartered fundraising group for the Democratic National Committee. Students and parents in Wyoming deserve better than the NEA having a congressional seal of approval for its political efforts. Every other special interest group operates without a federal charter, and the NEA should be no different. Thank you to Senator Blackburn for leading this effort,” said Senator Lummis. “The NEA is basically a partisan lobbying arm for the DNC that irreparably harmed students during the COVID pandemic and continues to push anti-American ideologies in classrooms. Congress shouldn’t condone its misbehavior. I’d like to thanks Senator Blackburn for leading Rep. Fitzgerald’s and my initiative in the Senate,” Representative Jim Banks.  “The National Education Association has strayed far from its original mission. Rather than supporting students, the NEA consistently put the interests of progressive teachers’ unions over the learning of students. It is time for Congress to say enough is enough and revoke the NEA’s federal charter. I support Senator Blackburn’s companion legislation and appreciate her dedication to putting students first,” said Representative Scott Fitzgerald. BACKGROUND:     ### "

Compared to mid-2019, America’s largest cities have seen a 50% increase in homicides and a 36% increase in aggravated assaults. In Tennessee, Memphis has experienced a series of shockingly, violent crimes. “We need to increase funding for law enforcement, root out weak on crime prosecutors and judges, and keep violent criminals locked up,” said Senator Blackburn. “Senator Hagerty and I are introducing the Restoring Law and Order Act to ensure state and local law enforcement agencies have the resources needed to combat violent crime and improve the processing of DNA evidence such as rape kits. It is sad that in Washington, Democrats have made heroes out of criminals and turned police officers into villains. The defund the police movement is demanding compassion for criminals, but not their innocent victims. Senator Hagerty and I believe we must fund, not defund, the police and are proud to Back the Blue. This legislation will provide much-needed resources to our brave law enforcement officers so they can hunt down violent criminals and keep Tennesseans safe.” “Violent crime has become an epidemic in this country.  As a direct consequence, American communities need more police officers and prosecutors—not more IRS agents,” said Senator Hagerty. “President Biden, Vice-President Harris and congressional Democrats encouraged the defund-the-police movement, which predictably led to less policing and soft-on-crime policies across America.  Now the tragic results of this approach are on full display, with American cities and towns far less safe.  Yet, instead of addressing this obvious crisis in order to save lives, President Biden and Democrats just spent $80 billion to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to target hard-working Americans. Our legislation will rescind this wasteful, intrusive spending and give it to state and local law enforcement agencies to protect Americans from violent crime. Government’s basic job is to keep its citizens safe—not snoop on them—and this bill addresses this urgent need.”    The Restoring Law and Order Act Will Increase Resources for Law Enforcement by Establishing A Federal Grant Program To:  The Restoring Law and Order Act Will Improve the Processing of Rape Kits By: RELATED ###"

Blackburn crime wave will 'get worse' before better’Julia JohnsonWashington Examiner A former FBI special agent is warning that the policing crisis and crime scourge across America will ""get worse before they get better.""Joining Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) Wednesday, former Supervisory Special Agent James A. Gagliano explained that ""we're making a huge mistake"" when it comes to policing. ""It takes a while for the pendulum to course correct,"" he added. Blackburn asked Gagliano how criminal justice policies touted on the Left have contributed to the crime problem. He explained the severity of the harm caused by President Joe Biden's decision to ""play footsy with the people that believe that defunding the police is the answer."" He acknowledged an effort from Biden to denounce defunding the police but said the harm has already been done. ""That's not what he did in 2020,"" the former agent added. ""The fact that we are demonizing the police — we are de-policing. We're looking at decarceration, which means emptying the prisons out, and we're reimagining public safety,"" he continued.The senator shared that law enforcement officers in her home state of Tennessee are increasingly concerned by what they're hearing. ""They talk about how the rhetoric on the national scale — where people are turning on their TVs and hearing this 'defund the police' rhetoric — affects the police in your community, because it emboldens people that want to strike out or lash out at the police,"" she said. Gagliano then detailed the real effect of rhetoric commonly used on the Left against law enforcement. ""We are seeing retirements at the law enforcement level that we have not seen since the 60s and the 70s,"" he explained. ""What's going on now is causing people not to want to come into the profession."" He further claimed that ""good"" officers are becoming harder to retain and they are retiring ""in droves."" ""Who possibly would want to tell their children right now, 'Go into the FBI, go into law enforcement'? No one's gonna do that, because they know that the government writ large doesn't have their backs."" Gagliano, who retired in 2016, is now a doctoral candidate in homeland security at St. John’s University. In August, overall index crime was up in New York City by 26%, compared to the same period in 2021. According to the city, the increase is driven by jumps in robberies, grand larceny, and burglaries, which rose by 38%, 34.7%, and 31.1%, respectively. Despite lockdowns being lifted and pandemic worries dying down, crime rates have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association's midyear report, ""Compared to 2019 midyear figures, MCCA member cities have experienced a 50% increase in homicides and a roughly 36% increase in aggravated assaults."" In a statement to Axios, National Association of Chiefs of Police Senior Vice President Brian C. Smith stressed that cities are having difficulties with staffing. ""We have shortages everywhere,"" he said. RELATED: ### "

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/blackburn-durbin-bill-to-support-survivors-of-child-sex-abuse-headed-to-president-s-desk,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. House of Representatives passed S.3103, the Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act of 2021, a bipartisan bill first introduced in the Senate by U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Democratic Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The bill now heads to the President’s desk. “The statute of limitations for sexual abuse offenses should never prohibit young survivors from getting the justice they deserve,” Blackburn said. “The bipartisan effort to eliminate the civil child sexual abuse statute of limitations is a critical step to guarantee survivors their day in court."" “The science of trauma is clear: it often takes years for victims to come forward,” Durbin said. “Our bipartisan bill honors the basic notions of justice for survivors, and I was proud to work with Senator Blackburn and our colleagues in the House to lead it across the finish line. By signing this legislation into law, we can finally help survivors have their day in court and a moment of healing—when they are ready.” On September 15, 2021, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing entitled “Dereliction of Duty: Examining the Inspector General’s Report on the FBI’s Handling of the Larry Nassar Investigation.” This hearing was convened in light of an Inspector General report documenting the FBI’s failure to properly investigate allegations that Larry Nassar was assaulting young athletes, which enabled the continued abuse of dozens of additional victims. According to CHILD USA, the National Think Tank for Child Protection, data suggests that 86 percent of child sexual abuse goes unreported. For victims who do report their abuse, “delayed disclosure,” or the tendency of survivors of child sex abuse to wait for years before disclosing abuse to others, is common. One study of more than 1,000 survivors found that the average age of survivors at the time of disclosure was about 52 years old. Historically, delayed disclosure has impacted survivors’ path to justice. Survivors often were barred from civil and criminal remedies at the time they disclosed their abuse due to statutes of limitations (SOLs) that did not take into account evidence regarding delayed disclosure. In recent years, however, many states have expanded opportunities for victims to access justice by lengthening SOLs. Since 2002, 48 states and Washington D.C. have amended their child sex abuse laws to expand or eliminate SOLs in varying degrees. Under current federal law, no statute of limitations bars the prosecution of criminal offenses involving child sex abuse anytime while the child victim is alive or 10 years after the offense, whichever is later. However, statutes of limitations remain an obstacle for survivors under the federal civil remedy statute. While Congress in 2018 lengthened the SOL for federal civil child sex abuse claims until the victim reached age 28 or until 10 years from the discovery of the violation or injury, this SOL still does not reflect the current state of research on delayed disclosure. Under the bill that now heads to the President’s desk, statutes of limitation will no longer serve as a bar to claims brought by survivors of child sex abuse under the federal civil remedy statute. Durbin and Blackburn’s bill unanimously passed the Senate in March of this year. Full text of the Blackburn-Durbin bill is available here. ###"

Weak on crime prosecutors, relaxed sentencing, and anti-police protests have made upholding justice all the more difficult for the brave men and women in law enforcement. Americans don’t want the Democrats’ ‘Defund the Police’ agenda; they want criminals behind bars and police officers on the streets,” said Senator Blackburn. ###"

The Senators demand immediate action to ensure safe and secure communities across the country and to put an end to the war on law enforcement officers. “We write regarding the recent shocking and tragic episodes of violent crime in Memphis, which are symptomatic of a rise in violent crime across the country that demands decisive federal law enforcement action. The most basic, important duty of government is to protect the life and liberty of its citizens, and substantially more resources must be put toward protecting innocent life,” the Senators wrote. “We must do whatever it takes to stop the escalation of violent crime across our nation. The cost of failing to do so has become tragically clear in our state. We would welcome the opportunity to work together to address this critical and worsening threat,” the Senators concluded. Read the letter here. "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/9/blackburn-colleagues-express-concern-on-proposed-title-ix-rule,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), along with Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Roger Marshall, M.D., (R-Kan.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and U.S. Representative Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) filed a public comment on the Department of Education’s newly proposed rule concerning Title IX compliance in schools and demanded Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona reconsider the rule due to its infringement on the right to equal opportunity for biological women and diminishment of a level playing field in women’s sports. The members write in their letter, “Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule.” Read the letter here or below: Secretary Cardona, We write to express our grave concern with the intent and implications of the US Department of Education’s Proposed Rule: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, 87 Fed. Reg. 41390, RIN 1870-AA16 (Proposed Rule), and urge the Administration to immediately withdraw the rule. Among other harmful changes, the Proposed Rule expands the scope of Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” Congress enacted Title IX 50 years ago to provide women with equal opportunities in educational programs and activities. The Proposed Rule’s interpretation of Title IX runs afoul of the clear parameters of the statute, as well as Congressional intent. In fact, if finalized, it would actually have the opposite effect of the law’s intent and further erode women’s equality, privacy and safety. As Members of Congress, we have a constitutional obligation to weigh in to ensure that any rulemaking issued by agencies is consistent with the underlying statute, which this proposal certainly is not. Further, we have a significant and unique interest in representing the well-being and safety of our constituents, particularly women and children, who are put at risk by the regulations in the Proposed Rule. 1.     The Proposed Rule is inconsistent with the law, and is the latest attempt to erode the Congressional intent and statutory text of Title IX. On June 23, 1972, after in depth Congressional consideration and subsequent agreement, President Richard Nixon signed Title IX into law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives either direct or indirect federal funding. Title IX ensures women and girls are given the same opportunities in school afforded to men and boys. Unfortunately, over the past decade, two Administrations have attempted to undercut the statutory purpose of the law and to use it as a way to promote progressive gender ideology. In 2010 and 2011, the Obama Administration sent multiple Dear Colleague letters to every public school and university in the country to expand policies related to campus assault and harassment. Since it was merely a Dear Colleague letter and not a rule, these “regulations” were implemented outside of the formal federal rulemaking process, clearly in order to bypass such process. The Departments of Education and Justice subsequently sent another Dear Colleague letter in 2016, again to all public schools and universities in the country, claiming that, “[a]s a condition of receiving Federal funds,” schools must “treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX.” As a result, schools were prohibited from maintaining separate locker rooms, shower facilities, and restrooms for male and female students based on their biological differences. Because the letters lacked foundation in Title IX’s statutory text, and it attempted to create federal policy outside of the public rulemaking process, they did not carry the force of law, and created a lack of clarity around the scope, application and enforcement of Title IX. The policies pushed in the letters caused mass confusion among states, schools, parents and children. Thankfully, both letters were swiftly revoked in 2017. Further, the Trump Administration issued a rule to prevent and respond to instances of sexual harassment and assault. Among other things, the rule respected Title IX’s statutory text and Congressional intent; it protected both victims and the accused, while also taking important steps to ensure that religious freedom protected by clarifying what institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX. The current Administration has seized our nation’s primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, to enact political, social and cultural change, with no regard for the harmful repercussions or the rule of law.  On his first day in office, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. Contrary to the protections Congress afforded to women and girls under Title IX, this Executive Order unfairly called for the elimination of equal opportunity for girls in sports and dangerously suggested that children in schools should not have access to sex-specific bathrooms, locker rooms and other private spaces. As if that wasn’t enough, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a memorandum in March 2021 that further misinterpreted Title IX.  As a legal foundation for its misapplication of the law, DOJ cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that “an employer who fires someone simply for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual ‘because of such individual’s sex.’” Notably, the opinion in Bostock explicitly stated that it applies only to hiring and firing decisions under Title VII, leaving other issues and other laws for another day. The Department of Education followed DOJ’s lead by publishing a notice of interpretation to assert that Title IX’s protections extend to claims based on “sexual orientation and gender identity.” This interpretation, which rewrites the plain meaning of sex, is now in the Proposed Rule. The Proposed Rule would radically redefine discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity (both of which are left without clear definitions), sex stereotypes, (defined as “fixed or generalized expectations regarding a person’s aptitudes, behavior, self-presentation, or other attributes based on sex”), and sex characteristics, (which includes “a person’s physiological sex characteristics and other inherently sex-based traits,” or “intersex traits”). The Proposed Rule claim that because the statute does not explicitly define sex as biological, “the Department does not construe the term ‘sex’ to necessarily be limited to a single component of an individual's anatomy or physiology.” To be clear, sex is biological. Unlike the assertions in the Proposed Rule, “sex” does not “encompass many traits.” Sex is not one’s self-asserted belief about himself or herself based on emotions, preference, self-presentation or behavior. Sex is binary. People are either male or female as demonstrated by their DNA, reproductive biology and other immutable characteristics. The proposed rule’s attempt to expand the definition of sex, while simultaneously neglecting to clearly define what the Department means by such an expansive definition, demonstrates that it is more focused on pushing an ideology rather than protecting individuals from discrimination. There is no question that this expansion of the meaning of sex goes far beyond the statute, Congressional intent, and Supreme Court opinions. Indeed, while the Proposed Rule attempts to find its footing in the holding of Bostock, the Court’s decision is based on the reality that sex refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female.” It’s clear that regardless of Title IX’s statutory text and the requirements of the rulemaking process, the Department of Education is pushing schools to apply Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to sexual orientation and gender identity. This is antithetical to the statutory text and congressional intent of Title IX and should not be finalized. 2.     The Proposed Rule undercuts equal opportunities and neglects the safety and privacy rights of women and girls in education. By passing Title IX, Congress recognized the need for explicit laws to protect women and girls and promote a level playing field for equal opportunities within education.In addition to its dissonance with the law, the Proposed Rule will disadvantage and harm women and girls, as we have already seen a number of times where similar policies have been in place. The Proposed Rule says that “preventing any person from participating in an education program or activity consistent with their gender identity would subject them to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex and therefore be prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by Title IX or the regulations.” This scope reaches far and wide with little guardrails to protect women. Under the Proposed Rule, sex-specific spaces, including housing, bathrooms and locker rooms, at primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions will be based on undefined “gender identity.” The Proposed Rule rewrites the intent of Title IX in such a way that it could, and will, be used by those who desire to cause harm. The Proposed Rule will only make it harder for school officials to protect children, as child predators and those who are intending to cause harm to children could use these policies to gain access to private spaces such as bathrooms or locker rooms. The Proposed Rule should be clear that under Title IX, sex is biological and binary. A.    The Proposed Rule ignores First Amendment free speech and religious freedom protections and parental rights. Policies included in the Proposed Rule could require teachers, administrators, contractors and grantees to undergo training to “affirm” students’ sexual identities. This is a clear violation of the free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment. Such policies could also purportedly compel teachers and school personnel to participate in teaching gender ideology in the classroom, including using preferred pronouns and names. Children and educators would be forced to learn and accept curriculum that affirms a progressive and baseless ideology with contrary opinions shared because of the threat of such dissent being considered discriminatory. For example, in Virginia, a French teacher was fired for refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns. The 2020 Title IX rule made clear that the Title IX does not restrict any rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, so it would not limit free speech or the free exercise of religion. The Department should similarly ensure that the Proposed Rule will not limit these Constitutional protections, especially for people of faith, at Title IX entities. Without such clarifications, it is possible that the Proposed Rule would have a chilling effect for people and groups of faith or those who hold prolife views, who will be afraid to speak about their beliefs at risk of being unjustly accused of harassment. Similarly, as the Proposed Rule promotes the affirmation of gender ideology and abortion, the Department should make clear that no student, teacher, administrator or employee of a Title IX covered entity will be compelled to affirm, teach or promote gender ideology in or out of the classroom. Neither the federal government nor any school, is in a position to govern the conscience and beliefs of students, parents, teachers or administrators. Traditional beliefs about gender, sex and marriage should be honored and respected in the public square, including schools. Our Constitution distinctly protects free speech and religious freedom. As such, the Department of Education must ensure these rights are afforded equal protection and respect. Further, parental rights must be foundational. Yet, the Proposed Rule seems to forget them. The Department should make clear that any attempt by a school to “affirm” a student’s gender identity that is incongruent with the child’s biological sex must be made known to the child’s parents, including anything related to social or medical transition. Schools and the government have never been and will never be a substitute for parents. All gender alterations – whether social or medical – could present serious, long-lasting physical, emotional and relational harm to children, such as infertility, bone development, brain development, and more. As such, schools should never hide such information from parents. B.    The Proposed Rule will harm women’s and girls’ athletic opportunities. The Proposed Rule claims to remain silent on the application of its policies to athletics, with the announcement of a separate, forthcoming rule. However, the policies outlined in the Proposed Rule have already and will continue to be a detriment to ensuring an equal playing field for women and girls in sports. The Department purports to claim that the Proposed Rule does not address women’s and girls’ athletics. Instead, the Department of Education said it “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.” But nothing in the text of the proposed regulations state that the prohibition against limiting participation based on gender identity does not apply. It is obvious that the Proposed Rule, as written, will disadvantage women and girls in sports, regardless of future rulemaking specific to athletics. The Proposed Rule explicitly states that a “recipient's education program or activity would also include all of its academic and other classes, extracurricular activities, athletics programs (emphasis added), and other aspects of the recipient's education program or activity.” The Department claimed to remain silent on the issue of sports, but they ignore the plain text of the Proposed Rule, which will quickly erode the integrity of athletics by requiring biological males who identify as transgender to compete on girls and women’s teams. By doing this, the Department is putting women at a disadvantage. Both the law and public opinion are clear; women and girls should be afforded equal opportunities to men and boys, and should not be forced to compete against males in athletics.  The effects of the Proposed Rule will eliminate women's athletics by allowing individuals to compete based on definition-less gender identity. Despite 50 years of progress toward achieving equal opportunities for women and girls in education, this Proposed Rule will force women to sacrifice, by allowing men to take, athletic opportunities, team participation, trophies, awards, scholarships and more on the altar of progressive gender ideology. For example, high school girl track athletes were disadvantaged in Connecticut after the state’s unfair, gender identity policies permitted two biological males to compete in, and subsequently win a combined fifteen girl’s track championship titles previously held by nine women. One of these participants set a first-place record for the girl’s track event. The males’ participating and success prevented the girls from advancing to regional meets, taking away an opportunity for the girls to compete in front of college scouts. Men and women are biologically and physiologically different, which is why there are different men’s and women’s sports in the first place. It is self-evident and a scientific fact. It is also important to note that it is not discriminatory to acknowledge the difference between men and women. Disregarding it would, in many instances, such as athletics and physical capability, subject women to unfair standards and limit their ability to fully participate in educational opportunities. The Department has an obligation to ensure that any policy it puts forward, including this Proposed Rule, does not discriminate against women. This Proposed Rule completely misses that mark. 3.     The Proposed Rule should explicitly affirm the previous rule’s clarification on religious freedom. Religious freedom is fundamental to society, including education. Since our nation’s founding, our laws have reiterated the importance of protecting, upholding and advancing religious freedom. In addition to both the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, Congress has enacted laws such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that the government cannot substantially burden religious exercise without a compelling government interest. Congress explicitly included language in Title IX to ensure that no part of the law would require religious institutions to forfeit their sincerely held religious beliefs in order to partner with the government or provide educational opportunities to students, regardless of whether the students share those religious beliefs. The law states that Title IX “shall not apply to an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the application of this subsection would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.” As such, religious educational institutions are exempt from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the organization, even if the educational institution receives Federal financial assistance. Unfortunately, under the Obama Administration, religious schools were unfairly targeted. Schools were publicly shamed for living out their faith. They were also required to seek permission from the government to be exempt from Title IX. No law or policy should ever require religious organizations to seek permission from the government to live out their faith, nor should policies unjustly target or discriminate against schools based on religious status. The Proposed Rule should ensure that the integrity of the statutory exemption is upheld, and that the Department will not retaliate against schools that are exempt from Title IX by creating a public list, which will shame schools for living out the principles of their faith. When the current rule was proposed and finalized, it rightly clarified that Title IX applies only to recipients of Federal financial assistance. It expressly exempted educational institutions controlled by religious organizations from compliance with Title IX to the extent that compliance with Title IX is inconsistent with the religious tenets of the religious organization even if the educational institution does receive Federal financial assistance. It ensured that instead of actively having to seek an exemption that bureaucrats at the Department of Education get to evaluate, institutions can simply claim an exemption. The statute does not require schools to ask permission to live out their faith, so neither did the existing rule. It is notable that the Department does not address religious liberty in this rule, despite the fact that the “Religious Liberty and Free Inquiry Rule” is simultaneously pending with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). To the extent that the Department intends to propose changes in the Free Inquiry Rule that will impact the scope of which organizations qualify for religious exemptions under Title IX, the Free Inquiry Rule should be considered in conjunction with this Proposed Rule to ensure commenters and stakeholders have a fair opportunity to engage and comment. Further, we strongly encourage the Department to expressly maintain all of the protections afforded to religious institutions by the underlying statute and made clear by the 2020 regulation. 4.     The Proposed Rule neglects to explicitly include and apply the abortion neutrality language in Title IX. In 1988, Congress amended Title IX to include abortion neutrality language to make clear that it does not confer a right to abortion. Congress clearly and deliberately, said that “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require … any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion.” Not surprisingly, the Administration is using this Proposed Rule, based in a law from 1972, to promote its pro-abortion agenda in the wake of the repeal of Roe v. Wade. We are concerned that the Proposed Rule’s definition of “discrimination on the basis of sex” includes “pregnancy or related conditions,” which is defined as ""(1) Pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; (2) Medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or lactation; or (3) Recovery from pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, lactation, or their related medical conditions""). This definition disregards the abortion neutrality language and attempts to use Title IX to promote, and confer a right to, abortion. Notably, the Proposed Rule makes no mention of the existing, statutory abortion neutrality language. Further, the proposed rule expands the scope of pregnancy discrimination to apply to all education programs and activities, rather than just admissions. While we agree that no woman should be punished or discriminated against on account of her pregnancy, it is concerning that the Department goes as far as redefining sex discrimination to include “termination of pregnancy,” essentially equating abortion to pregnancy and childbearing. As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, there is no federal right to abortion. That includes Title IX. The inclusion of this language in the proposed rule raises a number of unanswered questions, including whether educational institutions that refuse to provide access to abortion or abortion counseling will be deemed discriminatory. While we maintain that the Proposed Rule as a whole should be withdrawn, at a minimum, the Department must clearly define in the regulation that schools will not be compelled to promote abortion, and that speech, organizations, events and speakers that promote the sanctity of human life beginning at conception will not be considered to be in violation of Title IX. Further, regarding curriculum pertaining to reproductive health and sex education in schools, the Department must clarify that schools are not directed to promote abortion, including abortion counselling or referrals. While we oppose the inclusion of termination of pregnancy as part of the definition of sex, it is important to ensure that women are not prevented from equally participating in education programs or activities based on pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation. We maintain that the proposed rule should be withdrawn, but affirm the inclusion of lactation in this context. Schools should be required to reasonably accommodate pregnant and lactating women in accordance with Title IX to ensure that no woman is ever forced to choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy or her education. The Department should take all steps necessary to ensure that its policies promote life and that no woman is ever pressured or compelled to seek an abortion by her educational institution. Notably, such action would explicitly be discrimination based on sex, as childbearing, childbirth and lactation are inherent, biological capabilities of women. 5.     The Proposed Rule purports to preempt state law. Of additional concern due to the underlying policies, the Proposed Rule broadly defines any Program or activity under Title IX to mean all of the operations of (1) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or local government; or (II) The entity of a State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government. Further “recipient” is defined to mean, among other things, “any State or political subdivision thereof.” Regardless, Title IX does not give the Department the authority to compel states to disregard their own laws related to protecting children from harmful gender ideology, ensuring equal opportunities for women, and upholding the sanctity of human life. The Proposed Rule should make clear that no part of the regulation would preempt state laws that are contrary to the far-reaching and unsubstantiated attempts of the Proposed Rule to indoctrinate students. The Proposed Rule should explicitly acknowledge that no schools, students, teachers, parents, or states would be subjected to unfair or discriminatory practices or actions by the Department on the basis that such individual or entity understands sex to be binary and based in biology, or upholds equality for women in sports by ensuring that biological males are not allowed to compete against women and girls in female athletics. Similarly, the Proposed Rule should also ensure that those individuals and states that affirm protection of all life, including the lives of the unborn, do not face discrimination. The Department must make clear that Title IX does not preempt prolife state laws by encouraging and facilitating abortion tourism through enabling students to access abortion regardless of school policies, under the guise of Title IX protections. 6.     The Proposed Rule will have a far-reaching, negative impact beyond education. As drafted, the Proposed Rule will have ripple effects in other nondiscrimination laws written by Congress, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, Food and Nutrition Services and more. We have already seen the harms causes by such policies, including compelling doctors to perform harmful, irreversible and experimental gender alteration procedures on minors, and strong-arming schools into adopting progressive policies by tying such policies to school lunch programs. The broad, harmful, and lasting impact that this Proposed Rule would have on other agency programs is just one reason that the Department should withdraw it. If the Department moves forward with the Proposed Rule, it must consider the impact in such areas and explicitly state that such regulation does not apply to these or any other area of law that is not clearly addressed in the Proposed Rule. 7.     Conclusion The Proposed Rule seeks to unilaterally expand the scope of the law contrary to the text of Title IX and Congressional intent. The proposal would harm women and girls, violate First Amendment free speech, religious freedom and parental rights, and promotes abortion. The Department of Education should promptly withdraw the rule and instead focus on upholding existing law and regulations consistent with our law. Sincerely, ### "

Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.” The senators continued, “The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of ‘gotaways’ entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies.” The senators concluded, “Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies. Speaking before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that some cities are releasing illegal immigrants, ‘even if those individuals pose a public safety threat,’ and that, ‘the public’s safety, the public’s well-being . . . is I think at issue.’ In light of this public safety risk, Secretary Mayorkas indicated he would be going to municipal leaders and ‘asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation . . .” Read the letter here or below. Dear Director Davis, We write to you today regarding reports that the United States Marshals Service (USMS) is considering a new policy to permit the release of dangerous, criminal aliens before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is able to apprehend these illegal immigrants. According to a recent report, USMS has drafted a new policy that would require the release of detained illegal immigrants even if ICE has issued a detainer request asking the USMS to hold these illegal immigrants until ICE is able to apprehend them. We are deeply concerned to learn that USMS is even considering adopting a policy where it fails to cooperate with a fellow federal law enforcement entity. The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy. For years, cities and states across the country have pursued sanctuary city policies where they will refuse to cooperate with ICE. These sanctuary jurisdictions ignore ICE-issued detainer requests, and instead release potentially dangerous illegal immigrants into our communities. The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of “gotaways” entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies. While the number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border is shocking, there are also serious concerns about the number of these illegal immigrants with criminal records, gang affiliations, or terrorist records. So far in FY22, CBP has apprehended over 9,000 criminal aliens, including 53 for homicide or manslaughter, 283 for sex crimes, and almost 900 for assault, battery, and domestic violence. CBP also apprehended along the southern border 126 individuals on the terror watch list and 627 known gang members. Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies. Speaking before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that some cities are releasing illegal immigrants, “even if those individuals pose a public safety threat,” and that, “the public’s safety, the public’s wellbeing . . . is I think at issue.” In light of this public safety risk, Secretary Mayorkas indicated he would be going to municipal leaders and “asking you to reconsider your position of noncooperation . . .” In light of the overwhelming number of illegal immigrants entering through our southern border, the number of dangerous, criminal aliens being encountered, and even a warning from Secretary Mayorkas regarding the dangers of sanctuary city policies, we are deeply concerned about the proposed change in policies at USMS. As a matter of public safety and public policy, we request answers to the following questions by September 27, 2022: (1) What specific changes to USMS policy are being considered regarding ICE detainer requests?(2) Are you, in fact, contemplating a policy by which USMS would end cooperation with ICE and embrace sanctuary policies?(3) Who at your agency, or any other federal agency, directed the review of this policy?(4) Has there been consultation between USMS and its federal law enforcement partners at DHS and ICE? Do DHS and ICE support the proposed policy to no longer honor detainer requests? Why or why not?(5) Have you collected data to justify this sanctuary policy? What information did you rely upon, and in what ways did you consider public safety and national security? Sanctuary policies pose a serious threat to our communities and to our country. We look forward to learning more about the proposed sanctuary policy at USMS, and hope you and agency leadership will reconsider this policy change. ###"

Officials in the United States and Europe are wringing their hands over collapsed food and energy supply chains even as they deny that the standard diplomatic template has empowered our adversaries. Now, Xi Jinping is exploiting this weakness against Taiwan. The Chinese Communist Party insists their aggression is a proportionate response to Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to the island, and many of those same strategists who blame Zelenskyy for Putin’s crimes have lined up to blame anyone but Xi for the missiles flying toward Taiwan’s coast.  For decades, global leaders and pundits have enabled this insanity, some to avoid rocking the diplomatic boat, others to gain access to the goldmine that is the Chinese market. The COVID-19 pandemic finally exposed how economic entanglement and outsourced supply chains have made the United States vulnerable to CCP influence, yet in more than two years we’ve seen no sincere attempt to change the status quo. Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and the Democratic rank and file are backed into a corner and have made themselves comfortable there. In the summer of 2020, my legislation dedicated to securing critical supply chains earned bipartisan support because everyone understood the danger we were in. This month, the Democrats’ best attempt at a “China competitiveness bill” ended in a multi hundred-billion-dollar boondoggle that does more to subsidize the environmental lobby than it does to unravel semiconductor manufacturers from Chinese suppliers. The White House’s embarrassing reaction to Pelosi’s visit stemmed not from any real fear for her safety, but from their collective panic at the prospect of confronting Xi. This isn’t responsible diplomacy—it’s a hostage situation, and the American people are saddled with leaders too weak-kneed to save us. I am on the ground in Taipei this week because we can no longer afford to let the Chinese Communist Party write our foreign policy. For decades, any nation with enough power to challenge Beijing has begged others to speak up. These reactions are divorced from reality. The world has spent a solid half century fleeing moral clarity in favor of appeasement, and what has that gotten us? Concentration camps, atrocities, missiles in the sky, and a dangerously entangled economy. The only way we will stop and reverse Beijing’s quest for global dominance is by demonstrating our resolve to ensure they fail. Silence is no longer an option—we need to get in their way. This means defending the Uyghurs and the dissidents, repatriating our supply chains and helping our allies do the same, sending Taiwan the supplies and training they need to defend themselves, strengthening our presence in the Indo-Pacific, and—at the very least—not turning the plane around when Xi Jinping objects to our travel plans. ###"

INCREASING SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN Something we focus on in the Senate Armed Services Committee is modernizing the American military and preparing our troops for the future fight, as opposed to the fight we wish we were facing. I know that Taiwan is in the middle of its own debate over military modernization, and that President Tsai is pushing for a much-needed shift toward an asymmetric strategy… China’s continued aggression in and around Taiwan’s territory is just one example of why a defense-focused force is so critical to maintaining the safety and security of the region. Xi Jinping and his military leaders are not prone to making spur of the moment decisions; they planned for this moment, and they were just waiting for an excuse to bully Taiwan. They are clearly testing Taiwan’s resolve, and the rest of the world’s tolerance for even more imperialist violence. Most of you probably know that in May, President Biden signed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act into law, which gave him the authority to provide defense aid to Kyiv and other governments in Eastern Europe. At the end of July, I introduced similar bicameral and bipartisan legislation which would allow a U.S. President to expedite similar types of military aid to Taipei. In addition to providing those defense articles, this legislation would strategize U.S. defense policy in support of Taiwan, require comprehensive reporting on what Taiwan needs to defend itself, and give us a clearer picture of what the threat from the PLA actually appears to be.  DEFENDING OUR PARTNERS AND STANDING WITH TAIWAN One of the reasons I’ve come to Taipei to have these conversations with Taiwan’s leaders is because we can’t afford to let the Chinese Communist Party write the world’s foreign policy. For decades, any nation with enough power to challenge Beijing has begged somebody else to jump in and help do that job… The only way we can stop and reverse the rise of authoritarianism around the globe is to do everything we possibly can to make sure the authoritarians fail.###"

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/8/senator-blackburn-commissioner-carr-call-to-protect-children-online,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr are calling to better protect children online. Due to the pandemic, many students were issued taxpayer-funded computers and tablets when schools shifted online. Yet, many schools did not implement basic protections to keep children safe online from predators and big tech companies.In an op-ed published in The Hill, they wrote about the importance of ensuring that devices are compliant with the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA). The op-ed comes after they both sent a letter to the organization used by the FCC to administer the taxpayer-funded devices.You can read the op-ed by Senator Blackburn and Commissioner Carr here or below.Protecting students from exposure to harmful online contentSenator Marsha Blackburn and Commissioner Brendan CarrThe HillMost of the discussion over virtual schooling has focused on the irreparable damage that isolation inflicted on an entire generation of students; but it also exposed deep vulnerabilities in the barriers we’ve constructed between children and the darkest corners of the Internet.Indeed, over the past two years, school districts have sent kids home with laptops and tablets in unprecedented numbers. Thousands of these devices and the internet connections that power them have been purchased through two federal subsidy programs overseen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) known as E-Rate and the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF). Giving students these devices has led to a dramatic increase in screen time and made it more difficult for parents to protect their children from exposure to objectively harmful online content. Congress and regulators have worked overtime trying to place guardrails around Big Tech that at once empower parents and stop the online predators that target children. But the success or failure of these efforts will depend largely upon the willingness of regulators to enforce the safeguards that Congress has put in place.On the issues of online privacy and data security, we are charting new territory with legislation now pending in Congress; but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of tech usage by minors, we began laying a protective legal foundation decades ago, starting with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). The law requires school districts that take advantage of E-Rate or ECF dollars to follow internet safety policies and implement technology protection measures that block students from accessing pornography and other types of obscene material on school-issued devices. The FCC has rules requiring school districts to certify that the E-Rate and ECF devices they’re putting in kids’ hands are CIPA compliant.CIPA compliance represents the lowest of low regulatory bars. And yet evidence has surfaced suggesting that some school districts are not complying with the law—leaving children exposed to the worst, most predatory parts of the internet. A 2021 survey revealed that only 71% of teachers polled could confirm that their districts had installed the type of online protection measures CIPA requires. While it is true that not all school-issued devices must comply with CIPA, we do know that they all end up in the hands of kids who don’t yet understand how dangerous the virtual world can be.So what is going on with these federal programs? Has the law failed to keep up with technological change or do we need the FCC and school districts to step up their compliance efforts in light of this surge in new devices?With respect to the law, CIPA itself is a narrow statute, and there is no reason why it should have failed the test of time and changed circumstances. Money flows to schools that need it, but that money is conditioned on compliance with a simple rule: keep the kids safe. The past 22 years of paradigm-shifting innovation since Congress passed CIPA have changed the world, but not that standard.What has changed is the sophistication behind the threat. Algorithms piloted by Facebook, Tik Tok, and other digital platforms incentivize young users to document shocking—and unsettlingly adult—behavior, even as experts and Congressional panels expose the havoc that content wreaks. Human traffickers, pedophiles, and drug dealers take advantage of their vulnerability with heartbreaking results. It’s a nightmare for parents, kids, and teachers alike, but remember—that nightmare lives on a screen. At least when it comes to federally funded devices, we can and should control whose eyeballs come under assault.Contrary to what fearmongers in Washington say, CIPA does not require or authorize anyone to surveil students, and we have never suggested that this is the answer to keeping young people safe online. In fact, we have said the exact opposite because full surveillance would do more harm than good. But we owe it to parents and their kids to ensure that these covered laptops and tablets live up to the commonsense protections already enshrined in law while anticipating how threats will evolve with technology.Last week we sent a letter to the organization the FCC uses to administer the E-Rate and ECF programs to ensure that every covered device that a school district puts in a student’s hand is CIPA compliant. School districts must also step up their efforts to ensure that students remain safe online. While some districts are exercising diligence with tech usage, others are taking a far too reckless approach to student safety.But it’s important to remember that policymakers and educators can only do so much. The people closest to children have the most influence over their behavior, and it is their job to keep an eye on those screens—school-provided or not—to make sure the people on the other end of the connection have their children’s best interests at heart.###"

We know that thousands of vulnerable women and girls have fallen victim to these criminals, yet the Biden White House has done nothing to stop it. Joe Biden’s taxpayer-funded welcome package already includes a free phone, free plane ticket, and free baby formula – this legislation will stop the administration from adding free abortions to the list,” said Senator Blackburn.“No American’s tax dollars should pay for any illegal alien’s abortion, just like they should not pay for any American citizen’s abortion. Deportations are the only form of government-funded travel ICE should be providing to illegal immigrants. Additionally, with a major strain on resources and manpower on the southern border, we should be prioritizing activities performed by ICE and HHS that keep Americans safe,” said Senator Marshall. “We’ve seen President Biden and his cabinet secretaries repeatedly abuse their power to enact a radical agenda that is failing the American people. The deterioration of our country will not stop unless Congress acts to put a check on this far left administration.”“American taxpayer dollar should never go to fund abortion, and definitely should never be spent on transporting illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions,” said Senator Braun.“Rather than getting control of the southern border crisis President Biden created, he wants to ship illegal immigrants across the country to get taxpayer funded abortions. This is a gross abuse of Montanans’ taxpayer dollars and should never be allowed,” said Senator Daines.“The Biden administration’s willingness to act outside the law makes this legislation necessary. The Hyde Amendment restricts the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Whether it be ICE personnel or any other executive branch employee, spending American tax dollars to escort illegal immigrants across state lines for abortions is a clear violation of the law. It must be stopped,” said Senator Hyde-Smith.“The Biden administration continues to push their liberal agenda on hardworking Americans and it has to stop,” said Senator Inhofe. “As if trying to use taxpayer dollars to fund American citizens’ abortions was not enough, the Biden administration now wants to use taxpayer dollars to fund illegal migrants’ abortions. To protect our nation’s integrity and safety, we must ensure that ICE and HHS cannot sponsor transportation for illegal immigrants to obtain an abortion.”“In a new low, even for the most pro-abortion President in US history, President Biden apparently only wants pregnant women, including minors, who illegally cross our southern border to be placed in states where they can get an abortion,” said Senator Lankford. “His priority seems to be increasing abortions in America, rather than stopping illegal immigration or protecting the lives of children.”Senator Scott said, “Taxpayers should never be on the hook to pay for abortions, and the thought of forcing Americans to foot the bill for transportation so illegal immigrants can get abortions is horrific. Just when you think that the Biden administration couldn’t get any more radical, it doubles down by pairing its failed open borders policies with its extreme anti-life agenda. I’m proud to join Senator Marshall and our colleagues in introducing this good bill to protect the unborn and prevent this gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.”“Abortion is wrong, and American taxpayers should never have to pay for it, whether for citizens or illegal immigrants,” said Senator Wicker. “I am proud to stand with my fellow pro-life legislators to protect the sanctity of all human life.”This legislation:Click here to read the No Taxpayer Funds for Illegal Alien Abortions Act.###"

Wade.  When The Left Doesn’t Get Their Way, They Use the Media to Attack The Courts “We have to protect the institutions…this is what the Democrats do when they do not get their way. They go to the media. They would coach the witnesses because they want things to go their way. If they can't get it done legislatively, and if they are not going to get it done in the Court, they attack the courts.” Democrats Want To Protect “Women’s Rights” But Can’t Define “Woman”“They have said a ‘woman's right to choose,’ even though bear in mind two weeks ago, they couldn't define ‘woman.’ Today, they're out there and they're saying, ‘no, it is a woman's right to choose.’ This lawsuit, this argument before the Supreme Court, was not to outlaw abortion, it was just to say the proper place for these decisions is at the state level. And thereby the states should have the ability to make the decision as to how they're going to move forward. Now, that is federalism 101. Things that are not enumerated in the Constitution, they go to the states, and the states make the decisions. That's why you have the state legislatures that are in charge of elections. It's why state legislatures set their rates of local and state taxations. It is why state legislatures take a lead on issue after issue like schools and school boards and curriculum, because that is federalism. The left is wrong to go after saying this would outlaw abortion because that is inaccurate.” We Must Defend The Integrity Of The Court From The Left’s Radical Attacks “I have to tell you quite honestly, that the American people are sick of all of the fighting that left is doing regularly—just going after issue, after issue, taking to the streets, all of the protesting and the unrest. What they would like to see is some civility. What we have to do is realize this is up to Chief Justice Roberts, to assemble the Justices to find out what happened to meet with the clerk. There's a very small circle of people that would have access to a draft opinion. So, they are going to get to the bottom of this. We need to support the Chief Justice and the integrity of the Court as they go through this process.” Democrats Won’t Stop Until They Legalize Abortion On Demand ""I'm the only pro-life female on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-luj-n-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-develop-next-generation-of-tech-leaders-and-entrepreneurs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) introduced the Leveraging our National Laboratories to Develop Tomorrow’s Technology Leaders Act to empower our National Laboratories to support the next generation of science and tech entrepreneurs. This bipartisan innovation legislation authorizes $125 million over five years for the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). LEEP is a proven model to provide financial support, training, laboratory access, and research collaboration opportunities to early-career scientists and engineers to scale-up companies using their inventions and discoveries in energy, bioscience, advanced materials, and information technology. LEEP programs create a pipeline between the DOE’s cutting-edge research and U.S. commercial markets, promoting innovation and economic growth. “Tennessee’s national laboratories are responsible for keeping America on the cutting edge,” said Senator Blackburn. “The scientists, engineers, and researchers at Oak Ridge are innovators. This bipartisan legislation will support their critical research while fostering economic development and expanding the skilled workforce.”  “National Laboratories in New Mexico and across America are leading the way in developing cutting-edge technologies and maintaining our national security and global competitiveness. Our Labs are critical learning hubs for developing the next generation of tech leaders and entrepreneurs who are tackling our nation’s greatest scientific challenges while creating skilled jobs,” said Senator Luján. “As Members of Congress negotiate bipartisan innovation and competition legislation, I will continue working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to harness the full potential of our Labs to support our innovation ecosystem and workforce.” “Through LEEP, Oak Ridge National Laboratory was able to establish Innovation Crossroads in 2017 with the program’s first cohort of innovators,” ORNL Director Thomas Zacharia said. “Five years later, and Innovation Crossroads has supported 26 startups, many of which are now fully established in the Oak Ridge Corridor—creating highly skilled jobs and economic growth for the region. LEEP has provided the funding for ORNL to grow Innovation Crossroads and to support these entrepreneurs as they move their innovative technologies into the marketplace.” “LEEP is a proven way to support some of America’s most creative and ambitious climate-tech entrepreneurs. By combining the ideas and energy of these entrepreneurs with the unparalleled resources of DOE’s national laboratories, LEEP enhances the odds that their start-up companies will successfully traverse the proverbial ‘valley of death.’ LEEP deserves the whole-hearted support of Congress and DOE,” said David M. Hart, Director of the Center for Clean Energy Innovation at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF). “BPC Action commend Sens. Lujan (D-NM) and Blackburn (R-TN) for introducing the Leveraging our National Labs to Develop Tomorrow’s Technology Leaders Act. Developing new energy technologies is crucial for mitigating climate change, increasing economic growth, and securing energy independence.  By authorizing the Department of Energy’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP), this bill secures a bright future for a program that supports our most promising entrepreneurial talent as they work on next generation technologies to move clean energy forward,” said Michele Stockwell, Executive Director of BPC Action. Full text of the legislation can be found HERE."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-leads-legislation-to-stop-biden-from-crushing-american-innovation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) introduced legislation to stop the Biden administration from compromising the intellectual property rights of vaccine manufacturers through Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waivers. Senator Blackburn was joined by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tommy Tuberville (R- Ala.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah). “President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed proved the life-saving capabilities of the private sector, but for some reason the Democrats are on a mission to stop this innovation in its tracks,” said Senator Blackburn. “I am leading the charge to stop Joe Biden’s plan to waive the intellectual property rights of vaccine manufacturers. Without the power of free market innovation, we will lose any chance we have at successfully managing another global public health crisis.” “The Biden Administration’s disastrous decision to support a TRIPS waiver will destroy American jobs and companies by giving away valuable intellectual property. I will continue to push the Administration to reverse course on this decision that will do nothing to end the pandemic or increase vaccination rates, and I’ll work with my colleagues to get this bill passed into law,” said Senator Tillis. “The power of American ingenuity produced three life-saving COVID vaccines in record time – that is something to be proud of,” said Senator Tuberville. “Private industry should have a say if their coveted vaccine formulas are exported to other countries and their cutting-edge technology is copied. Additionally, allowing for a TRIPS waiver would increase the likelihood that this sought-after technology would make it into the hands of bad actors like China and Russia, who could use it to advance their malign agendas. Global industry has the means to produce billions of vaccine doses and they should do so on their own terms, but waiving global intellectual property protections simply undermines American innovation.” “Ingenuity is a key aspect of the American dream. The Biden Administration’s efforts to undermine intellectual property protections when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines discourages the very medical breakthroughs of President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed and threatens future discoveries, as well as our ability to prepare for the next pandemic. The No Free TRIPS Act adds a necessary check on the Biden Administration and prevents them from entering into agreements which waive global intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics,” said Senator Cramer. “Beginning with the Trump Administration’s successful Operation Warp Speed, the United States has led the world in COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic innovation and exports since the onset of the pandemic,” said Senator Hagerty. “We must not allow any feckless agreements by the Biden Administration that would freely and unconditionally hand other nations American taxpayer-subsidized research and development at no cost, thereby undermining American innovation and potentially allowing our adversaries to capitalize on our COVID-19-related intellectual property. I’m pleased to co-sponsor this legislation that will hold the Administration accountable for any decisions that jeopardize our nation’s property and innovation.” “The United States is an innovation power house. We produce some of the most advanced medical technology in the world, and it is shocking to me that President Biden would suggest that we give away any of our advantages when it comes to the developments we have made in those technologies. We need to focus on protecting intellectual property and incentivizing the development of other life-saving treatments to provide to other nations. Thank you to Senator Blackburn for proposing this important legislation,” said Senator Lummis. “American companies worked at lightning speed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines,” Senator Rubio said. “A TRIPS waiver would strip incentives for American drug manufacturers to step up when we need them to. This bill would protect the intellectual property of American companies and ensure that neither China nor Russia can claim American vaccines as their own."" “With the support of decades of research and development, voluntary technology transfers, and hundreds of partnerships, biopharmaceutical manufacturers are producing the COVID-19 vaccines we need to vaccinate the world,” said Stephen J. Ubl, president and CEO of PhRMA. “Efforts to undermine intellectual property protections are unnecessary and harmful to our collective work to end the pandemic and respond to future public health threats. The No Free TRIPS Act would help ensure the U.S. does not surrender the American intellectual property that’s been critical to fighting COVID-19.” “Intellectual property waiver proposals distract from the real issues preventing more shots in arms, such as logistical hurdles, supply chain bottlenecks, and vaccine hesitancy. Business is delivering on the promise to manufacture safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the whole world. Vaccine production is estimated to reach over 20 billion doses this year, enough for everyone. As of March 2022, over 65% of the global population has received at least one dose, and this number is growing every day. The dismantling of IP rights threatens the licensing arrangements that are enabling rapid global production and technology transfer. The Chamber applauds these Members of Congress for introducing this important legislation and strongly supports the No Free TRIPS Act and the Protecting American Innovation Act,” said Neil L. Bradley, Executive Vice President, Chief Policy Officer, and Head of Strategic Advocacy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. BACKGROUND:  "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-colleagues-increase-pressure-on-fda-to-issue-final-rule-on-over-the-counter-hearing-aids,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced new legislation that would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a final rule regarding access to over-the-counter hearing aids. This legislation follows up on a proposed rule the FDA issued in October 2021, more than a year after the statutory deadline set in 2017 by the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act. This bill would require the agency to issue a final rule within 30 days following enactment of the bill. “Since President Trump signed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act in 2017, the FDA has done little to expand hearing aid access for the more than 38 million Americans struggling with hearing loss,” said Senator Blackburn. “I’ve been fighting to make affordable, accessible over-the-counter hearing aids a reality since I served in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation will pressure the FDA to finish the work we started almost five years ago and ensure that regulatory red tape doesn’t stop Tennesseans from getting access to the treatment they deserve.” “Almost five years ago, Senator Chuck Grassley and I passed our bipartisan bill to allow hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, but the FDA has yet to finalize the rule to implement it. This rule is long overdue, and the FDA needs to act with urgency – not buckle to the pressure of entrenched corporate interests – to finalize a strong rule that will increase competition, lower costs for consumers, and ensure that people can finally buy hearing aids right off the shelf,"" said Senator Warren. “I hear from Iowans all the time about the high cost of hearing aids – sometimes as high as $10,000. These prices are often shocking for seniors on a fixed income. Our bipartisan proposal will build on the important work we’ve already done to ensure that 38 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss have access to high-quality, affordable hearing aids,” Grassley said. BACKGROUND:    "

We fully agree with the need for comprehensive privacy legislation and have been actively discussing this with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. However, it misses the mark to say we can’t have both consumer privacy and competition in the app marketplace. As passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Open App Markets Act acknowledges this balance.

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-protect-walking-horse-industry-from-stifling-regulations-while-optimizing-horse-health,"NASHVILLE, TENN. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) along with U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) introduced the Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022, which would end the harmful practice of soring in show horses while preventing inhibitory bureaucratic overregulation to preserve the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. The industry is vital for America’s agriculture economy, providing billions of dollars in economic impact across several states and employing over 20,000 people. “The Volunteer State has a rich history with Tennessee Walking Horses,” said Senator Blackburn. ""Bad actors are using caustic chemicals, pressure shoeing, and other harmful practices to undermine the prestige of the industry. The Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022 will stop these bad actors and ensure that this Volunteer State tradition continues for years to come.”  “The Tennessee Walking Horse industry is steeped in rich tradition dating back to 1886, and every year thousands of enthusiasts gather in Shelbyville, Tennessee, for the celebration of this great animal,” said Senator Hagerty. “I am pleased to introduce legislation that will support this important industry by bringing regulatory certainty that is objective and scientifically based while protecting horses, breeders, and competitors moving forward.”  Specifically, the Protecting Horses from Soring Act of 2022 would give state officials and industry and equine experts with extensive experience the authority to ensure consistent oversight of inspections related to horse soring. It would also require objective scientific testing, prevent conflicts of interest, and suspend horses from shows if they are found to be sore. Background:   "

A nuclear-armed Iran would have major negative regional implications. It would put at risk the existence of the State of Israel and the governments of our Arab allies, destroy America’s position in the Middle East, and ultimately threaten the U.S. homeland. A course-correction is necessary.” “We therefore urge your administration to take immediate action to provide Israel with the military capabilities it needs to defend itself from Iran,” the senators continued. The letter is supported by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), Christians United for Israel (CUFI), Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), and the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA). Text of the letter may be found here and below. President Joseph R. BidenThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden, We write to urge you to provide Israel with the military capabilities it needs to defend itself and prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear-weapons capability. As you know, Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, its support for terrorism, and its other destabilizing activities pose grave threats to the United States and our allies and partners in the Middle East. The Iranian regime arms the Houthis in Yemen with the missiles and drones that they use to attack civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Iran equips Hezbollah and Hamas with tens of thousands of rockets, including the more than 4,000 rockets which Hamas fired at Israeli civilians last May. Last month, Iran escalated its attacks against Americans in Iraq, firing a dozen ballistic missiles from Iranian soil at the U.S. consulate in Erbil. Meanwhile, your administration appears intent on striking a new nuclear deal with Iran that will provide the regime with a pathway to nuclear weapons. A nuclear-armed Iran would have major negative regional implications. It would put at risk the existence of the State of Israel and the governments of our Arab allies, destroy America’s position in the Middle East, and ultimately threaten the U.S. homeland. A course-correction is necessary. We therefore urge your administration to take immediate action to provide Israel with the military capabilities it needs to defend itself from Iran. Most importantly, since the purchase has already been approved, your administration must expedite the delivery of KC-46A aerial refueling tankers to Israel as rapidly as possible without interrupting deliveries to our own Air Force. Accelerating delivery of tactical aircraft like the F-35I and F-15I and helicopters like the CH-53K would continue to bolster Israel’s ability to defend itself. While providing improved tactical aircraft is vital, your administration must also ensure that Israel retains adequate stockpiles of U.S.-made precision guided munitions. Finally, you must ensure that Israel possesses robust, multi-layered air defenses to mitigate attacks by Iran and its proxies, to include continued support for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow systems. Your administration must urgently fulfill America’s obligation to help Israel defend itself by giving it the tools it needs to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran."

The damage done by the Biden Administration’s failed border policies have served to draw more illegal immigrants to our border with false promises of amnesty,” the senators concluded. Read the full letter here."

It is concerning to me that taxpayer dollars may be funding research on and housing for gender non-binary individuals instead of finding new ways to secure our country. After this hearing, I have no confidence that the Biden White House is willing to put safety above their radical woke priorities.” View the questioning here. Partial Transcript: SENATOR BLACKBURN: Secretary Austin, earlier this year, there was a report that said the Department of Defense is studying the issue of allowing gender non-binary people to serve in the military. Is that true? SECRETARY AUSTIN: I am supportive of allowing any person that's eligible and can meet the qualifications to serve their country. SENATOR BLACKBURN: Who is involved in the study? Are uniformed military personnel involved? SECRETARY AUSTIN: I can't speak to, at this point, who's involved in any of the studies that we have ongoing just off the top of my head, but I'll certainly take the question for review. SENATOR BLACKBURN: And what will the living arrangements be made for non-binary service members? Are you all going to come back to us and ask for an appropriation for housing? SECRETARY AUSTIN: Senator, any study that we do, it will make certainly be transparent and make it available to you. SENATOR BLACKBURN: And what about gender fluid individuals? How will you handle a service member who identifies as male on some days and female on other days or poly-gender individuals? SECRETARY AUSTIN: I don't care to speculate on you know, what we're going to ask you for or how we're going to qualify people. Again, some of this is in litigation in various states and, you know, I think it's best to take your question for the record.  "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-colleagues-demand-investigation-into-deaths-of-five-babies-aborted-in-dc,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and James Lankford (R- Okla.) sent a bicameral letter to Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Chief of the DC Metropolitan Police Department Robert Contee, and US Attorney General Merrick Garland after a truly gut-wrenching and gruesome report of five babies whose lives were taken through late-term abortion in Washington, DC, last week. Senators Blackburn and Lankford were joined by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Representatives Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), and Chris Smith (R-N.J.). The letter demands an investigation into the deaths of the babies, including an autopsy since evidence suggests one or more of them may have lost their life through an illegal partial-birth abortion or may have been born alive and later killed. The Members wrote in their letter, “Last week, DC Metropolitan Police recovered the remains of five preborn children apparently from the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, DC, a facility operated by the late-term abortionist Dr. Cesare Santangelo. Instead of ensuring that the horrific deaths of these children were properly investigated, Metropolitan Police made the assumption that each child died as the result of a legal abortion. It is our understanding that Metropolitan Police made this assumption without conducting any medical evaluations. We also understand from press reports that the DC medical examiner does not plan to perform autopsies on the children. This is completely unacceptable.” The Members continued, “These five children, like all children, have inherent value and deserved better than abortion—they deserved life. But at a minimum, they deserve to have their deaths investigated to ensure that no DC or federal laws were broken. In light of this information, we demand that a thorough investigation is conducted into the death of each child. In order to accomplish such investigation, we request and fully expect the city to conduct autopsies on the children and preserve all collected evidence. Finally, at the conclusion of such examinations, we urge the city to properly and respectfully bury the babies.” Groups supporting the Members’ letter include: Live Action, Catholic Vote, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, March for Life, Students for Life Action, Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, National Right to Life, and Americans United for Life. You can view the full text of the letter HERE and below: Dear Mayor Bowser and Chief Contee: As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to conduct oversight over the District of Columbia (DC), to ensure DC upholds laws enacted by Congress, particularly those enacted to protect and uphold the sanctity of human life. Last week, DC Metropolitan Police recovered the remains of five preborn children apparently from the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, DC, a facility operated by the late-term abortionist Dr. Cesare Santangelo. Instead of ensuring that the horrific deaths of these children were properly investigated, Metropolitan Police made the assumption that each child died as the result of a legal abortion. It is our understanding that the Metropolitan Police made this assumption without conducting any medical evaluations. We also understand from press reports that the D.C. medical examiner does not plan to perform autopsies on the children. This is completely unacceptable. While other horrific methods of abortion unfortunately remain legal for the time being, killing a child through a partial-birth abortion is a crime under federal law. Under the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, a partial-birth abortion occurs when a physician partially delivers a living child for the purpose of performing an overt act that intentionally takes the life of the child. The US Supreme Court upheld the federal ban on partial-birth abortions in Gonzales v. Carhart in 2007. Additionally, Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act to provide equal protections for children who are born alive during an abortion. If the bodies of other babies who were not aborted were recovered in a similar fashion, it would be hard to imagine the Metropolitan Police declining to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of each child. Based on evidence collected at the time of recovery and photos that have been publicly shared, all five of these children appear to have developed well past the point of viability, and likely suffered severely painful abortion procedures, though without an autopsy, it is not known how each child died. For example, one baby girl has significant damage to her head, with deep lacerations at the back of the neck, and may have been victim of an illegal partial birth abortion. Another baby was found in its amniotic sac and could have been born alive.  These five children, like all children, have inherent value and deserved better than abortion – they deserved life. But at a minimum, they deserve to have their deaths investigated to ensure that no DC or federal laws were broken. In light of this information, we demand that a thorough investigation is conducted into the death of each child. In order to accomplish such investigation, we request and fully expect the city to conduct autopsies on the children and preserve all collected evidence. Finally, at the conclusion of such examinations, we urge the city to properly and respectfully bury the babies. Please respond to the following questions by close of business on Wednesday, April 6, 2022. 1.      As you are aware partial-birth abortion, as defined in 18 US Code § 1531 is illegal and punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. How did the Metropolitan Police reach the conclusion while recovering the remains of each child that all of the children died as the result of a legal abortion?2.      In order to ensure that no child was subjected to a partial birth abortion and that no child was born alive and left to die, will you commit to conducting a thorough investigation of the death of each child?3.      As part of such investigation, will you commit to ensuring the preservation of each child’s remains for appropriate examination during the investigation?4.      Will you direct the Chief Medical Examiner to perform an autopsy on each child to determine the method and cause of death in accordance with § 5–1405 of DC Code?5.      Will you direct a subsequent autopsy to be completed by an independent, licensed pathologist to confirm the findings of the Chief Medical Examiner?6.      If an autopsy suggests any of the children were victims of criminal activity, will you immediately refer the evidence to both the Department of Justice and the Attorney General for the District of Columbia for criminal prosecution?7.      Will you commit to properly and respectfully burying each child? Sincerely, CC: Attorney General Merrick Garland"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/top-biden-defense-officials-admit-administration-was-wrong-to-share-intelligence-with-chinese,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – During questioning from Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, top Biden defense officials Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley admitted it was a poor decision for the Biden administration to share U.S. intelligence about Russia with the Chinese.  These revelations come after a bombshell report that the Biden administration met with Chinese officials and shared intelligence on Russian troop movements, which Beijing then passed to Moscow. After the hearing, Senator Blackburn stated, “It is astonishing that neither General Milley nor Secretary Austin were aware of a widely reported story that the Biden administration shared intelligence with Chinese officials. DNI Director Avril Haines, NSA Advisor Jake Sullivan, and CIA Director William Burns need to come before this Committee and explain why they thought it was appropriate to give our intelligence to the Chinese, who then gave it to the Russians. We should not be giving American secrets to Beijing or helping Putin commit war crimes.” View the questioning here. Partial Transcript:SENATOR BLACKBURN: Would you agree that giving our adversaries access to our intel reports is a poor decision? SECRETARY AUSTIN: Exactly. I think that's something that we absolutely work to avoid. BLACKBURN: Okay. And so then, and why did senior Biden officials hold nearly half a dozen meetings with top Chinese officials to give them information on Russian troop movements? AUSTIN: I don't know of… I don't have insights on any occurrences like that. BLACKBURN: Okay. It seems the Chinese called up their comrades in Russia and sent Moscow the intel that Biden staffers provided them. And it appears that U.S. officials knew Beijing gave the intel to Moscow. So, I would imagine you do not support giving Russia our intelligence. AUSTIN: I am unfamiliar with the issue that you raised, but you are right. I do not support giving our adversaries…BLACKBURN: Alright. General Milley, under what circumstances, if any, have you advised intelligence sharing with Beijing?GENERAL MILLEY: Zero. Never. BLACKBURN: Thank you. Given what we know now about how that subsequently shared information, this intelligence went to Moscow, what would you advise for similar scenarios going forward? MILLEY: I don't think you should give intelligence to your adversary – period. "

The Protect America’s Innovation and Economic Security from CCP Act will reinstate efforts to investigate and prevent spying by the Chinese Communist Party on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and counter threats to U.S. national security. Senator Marsha Blackburn said, “The Biden administration’s policies have reversed President Trump’s America first agenda to actively enable the New Axis of Evil – Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. Instead of continuing the China Initiative – an important program which identified and prosecuted those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage – Biden is choosing to make the United States less secure. This legislation will continue a vital program to keep America safe by stopping the Chinese Communist Party from undermining our economic stability and national security.” Senator Rick Scott said, “We know that the Communist Party of China will stop at nothing in its mission for global dominance – and the Biden administration cannot afford to be naïve to the national security threats we face. It is unconscionable that the Biden administration ended the DOJ’s efforts to hold Communist China accountable for U.S. trade secret theft and economic espionage. I’m proud to lead this bill to reestablish the CCP Initiative, which will again be dedicated to protecting the United States’ intellectual property and our academic institutions from spying and interference by one of our greatest adversaries. Communist China has started the new Cold War with the United States – it’s our duty to protect our critical infrastructure and private sector, and take action to counter Communist China’s economic warfare.” Senator Bill Hagerty said, “America remains the most innovative country in the world, but the Chinese Communist Party is relentlessly trying to cheat American businesses by stealing their information and technology to fuel its repressive regime and compete against us. FBI Director Wray tells us that the Bureau opens a new Chinese spying case every 12 hours, and yet the Biden Administration is ending the Department of Justice initiative focusing on this unparalleled threat to our national and economic security. This legislation would prevent this misguided decision and ensure that combatting CCP espionage remains a top priority.” Senator Marco Rubio said, “The Department of Justice canceled the China Initiative because a band of woke activists smeared it as racist and xenophobic. In the meantime, the espionage and influence campaign of the Chinese Communist Party continues to permeate our nation’s leading research institutions, exploiting our openness to steal our brightest ideas and most valuable technology. The Chinese Communist Party is the single greatest threat to our national security, and it was a foolish decision to divert resources from confronting this threat. We need to restart this important national security initiative right away.” Senator Mike Braun said, “To continue to be the most innovative country in the world, we must take action to protect our intellectual property from the Chinese Communist Party, which has shown time and again they don’t play by the rules.”  Senator Ron Johnson said, “The Biden administration ended the CCP Initiative which the Justice Department used to investigate how China steals our intellectual property through universities. It's outrageous. President Biden’s continued display of weakness to the world is tempting our adversaries to take advantage of the moment. We must protect American technology and innovation and hold the Communist Party of China accountable for any attempt at theft. I am happy to support this bill that will reestablish the CCP Initiative in order to protect American institutions and intellectual property from this threat to our national and economic security.” "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/blackburn-to-oppose-judge-jackson-s-nomination-to-the-supreme-court,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the following statement regarding her opposition to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. “As part of my constitutional duty to provide advice and consent to the President on his nominees, I closely examined Judge Jackson’s writings and rulings,” said Senator Blackburn. “Throughout this process, it became clear that I could not support this nominee. The role of a Supreme Court justice is to interpret the law, not to take up arms in a culture war. I have serious concerns that Judge Jackson’s ideology may influence her jurisprudence. A justice’s primary commitment must always be to the Constitution—not to woke progressivism or results-based judicial activism. Throughout her career, Judge Jackson evaded this duty, with terrible results. She consistently handed down lenient sentences to child predators, and even granted a convicted cop killer compassionate release from prison. I cannot in good conscience support her confirmation to the highest court in the land.” RELATED "

I'm not sure who they think they'll persuade with these unhinged attacks, but what I do know is that the subtext has come through loud and clear for Tennesseans. It is ‘sit down, shut up, stop questioning authority, and if you don't abide by our rules we're going to get you.’ That's what these headlines are basically saying. Last night, I hosted a telephone town hall with more than 30,000 people across middle and east Tennessee and they have rejected the message that they're seeing in these headlines. It's simple for them: the harder the media tries to silence them, the more they crave accountability. This is especially true when it comes to protecting the future for their children and their grandchildren.”  No Amount Of Damage Control Can Fix Judge Jackson’s Inability To Define “Woman” “Now, as I am sure many people will recall, during a line of questioning in Judge Jackson's Confirmation Hearing, I asked her a very simple question. All I wanted her to do was define the word ‘woman.’ She told me she couldn't answer the question because she wasn't a biologist…[Her answer] was a deliberate signal to a specific group of individuals, our friends in the media flew into damage control mode and went to great lengths to refute a simple fact that every single American learned in their grade school science class. Judge Jackson's answer and the media's panicked defense of it were both completely divorced from reality.”  Families Feel Like They’re Fighting A Losing Battle Against The Erosion Of Our Basic Values  “What worries me even more is her refusal to acknowledge that when it comes to law, not everything can or should be up for debate because political activists demand it. Our legal system is built on a foundation of definitions and rules, which are two equally important components. In this case, if we concede that the definition of a woman is too controversial to nail down, how can we demand equal justice under the law for victims of sex discrimination? Furthermore, how could the Supreme Court determine standing for any case regarding a gender based rule? To take it even further, if words no longer matter, are the definitions of other protected classes up for debate? If so, which ones? And if not, then why not? Whose standard are we using here? Think about that. Each day, I hear from Tennesseans who feel like they're fighting a losing battle against the erosion of our basic values.”  The Left Has Waged A Culture War Against Parents And Their Children “Slowly, but surely, activists are forcing themselves between parents and their children, stripping words and institutions of their meaning, and using their power to eliminate dissent. It's no way to run a classroom and it's no way to run a country. But right now, parents I'm talking to are looking at Washington and seeing the left use these same tactics to convince whoever gives credence to these unhinged headlines that reality is somehow up for debate. Mr. President, they're not going to tolerate it anymore. Not from Congress, not from the White House, and certainly not from the Supreme Court. I think it bears repeating that the purpose of the Supreme Court is to interpret the law, not to take up arms in a culture war. I cannot in good conscience, give my endorsement to a Supreme Court nominee whose first instinct was to chip away at the very foundation of the law, rather than challenge the expectations of radical political activists.”"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/4/icymi-blackburn-talks-with-ncaa-championship-swimmer-about-the-future-of-women-and-girls-in-sports,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – On the Facebook Live Show Unmuted with Marsha, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) spoke with Kentucky swimmer, Riley Gaines, about the future of women and girls in sports after competing against transgender athlete, Lia Thomas.  Kentucky swimmer who tied with Lia Thomas says majority of women not okay with 'trajectory' of female sportsKyle MorrisFox News Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who tied with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas for fifth place in the 200-yard freestyle NCAA swimming championships, says the ""majority"" of females are ""not okay with the trajectory"" that female sports are taking. Gaines's remarks came during an interview on the ""Unmuted with Marsha"" podcast hosted by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. ""The majority of us female athletes, or females in general, really, are not okay with this, and they're not okay with the trajectory of this and how this is going and how it could end up in a few years,"" Gaines said, referring to the NCAA's unwillingness to change the rules in an effort to protect female competitive sports. Gaines said she knows several women who feel the same way she does, but they're ""scared"" to speak out against transgender females participating in women's sports because of today's culture, and ""they don't want to risk their future."" The University of Kentucky swimmer, who told Blackburn she has been taking part in swimming competitions since the age of 10, outlined her emotions and afterthoughts when she realized she had tied with Thomas and did not receive a trophy at the competition. ""I touched the wall and saw there was a five by my name indicating that I got fifth … I also looked up, and I saw the number five by Lia's name and so, in that moment, I realized we tied,"" Gaines told Blackburn. ""It was kind of like a flood of emotions. I was extremely happy for the girls above me who conquered what was seemingly impossible by beating Lia."" ""I was shocked, really,"" Gaines added. Gaines walked away from the competition that day without a trophy for her placement, but Thomas did not. ""I walked back [to get my trophy] and the NCAA official came up to me, and he said, ‘Hey, that was a great swim. We only have one fifth place trophy,’ which I understood, I get how that works. But he said, ‘We’re gonna have to give the trophy to Lia. Yours will be coming in the mail. Great job.'"" ""I was kind of taken aback, and I don't think he necessarily expected me to really question it,"" Gaines said. The Kentucky swimmer told Blackburn that the official explained to her that the trophies were given out in chronological order, but Gaines said she was left confused seeing as how she tied with Thomas. ""I don't think they handled this properly, but I don't think they were prepared, you know, to handle this kind of situation, and so they were faced with something they were unsure what to do with,"" Gaines said. ""I looked at him and I said, ‘This is the women’s 200-yard freestyle, and Lia won a national title last night, and I have worked every day for the past four years for this,'"" Gaines recalled, discussing how significant it is for her and those she is competing against to make it to that point. ""I don't think a lot of people realize, but only the top 1% of, you know, female college athletes make it to this meet. That, in and of itself, is a huge deal, but you have to fight for every point there, and I was kind of just frustrated with how it was handled and how they kind of addressed me."""
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/icymi-dr-alveda-king-and-senator-blackburn-honor-the-life-and-legacy-of-dr-martin-luther-king-jr,"NASHVILLE, TENN. – Dr. Alveda King, niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), joined U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on Unmuted with Marsha to honor the legacy of MLK.  MLK Day preview: Alveda King tells Sen. Marsha Blackburn, 'We must be kind'Maureen Mackey Fox NewsAhead of the national day of remembrance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 2022, mother, grandmother, author, pastor, and niece of MLK Jr., evangelist Alveda C. King, spoke with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for the senator's program, ""Unmuted with Marsha."" Fox News Digital was given an exclusive preview of the video ahead of its air date.  Alveda King is a daughter of civil rights activist A.D. King and Naomi Ruth Barber King. She is chairman of the Center for the American Dream with the America First Policy Institute. During the conversation with Sen. Blackburn, Alveda King shared that her uncle's ""I have a dream"" message is ""deeply rooted in the American dream. And it's important today, here in the 21st century, in this New Year of 2022, for us to reexamine what the American dream is,"" she noted. ""We know that we are one human race,"" Alveda King told the senator. ""We're not even separate races … Science has shown that.""  ""We can see that when we read the Bible in Acts 17:26, that we are one blood, one human race."" She was referring to this biblical passage: ""From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.""  She added, ""[So] what does that mean in 2022, as we celebrate the birthday of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?"" Alveda King noted that today, even though we have different skin colors — ""and that is ethnicity, not race — we must come together as brothers and sisters and respect human dignity.""  She spoke of her parents and of her extended family: ""We grew up in a time — and I'm still living in this time and teaching this to my children and grandchildren — that we have to love [one another] and [promote] human dignity.""  This was a difficult realization for her as a young person, she suggested, after her uncle and others within her family were targeted or murdered for their views. Alveda King said that after those experiences, she wanted to hate somebody. (Her uncle was assassinated in April 1968; her father, A.D. King, died the year after, in July 1969.)  But she said her beloved father told her, shortly after MLK Jr. was killed, ""Alveda, you can't hate white people. White people live with us. White people march with us … White people pray with us. White people die with us. The devil killed my brother. The devil killed your uncle.""  ""So I was brought up my whole life … to forgive … and to love,"" said Alveda King.  ""Martin Luther King said, ‘I’ve decided to stick with love' … He said that hate [was] too difficult a burden to bear."" She stressed that we are ""one nation under God,"" and — remembering that — we need ""to work together … and to love each other and regard human dignity, from the womb to the tomb.""  ""This is a 365-day"" imperative, added Alveda King — not a once-a-year event or action. ""As we continue to love and regard and communicate [with each other] — and not hate — we will see that people will listen and respond accordingly."" She also told Sen. Blackburn during the illuminating conversation, ""I pray that everyone who sees this show will remember, in 2022, to be kind."" Sen. Blackburn's entire video episode, ""Unmuted with Marsha: Alveda King,"" will be available on YouTube beginning Monday, Jan. 17, 2022, as the nation honors and remembers Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his contributions to our country."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/blackburn-rubio-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-sanction-beijing-for-continued-obstruction-of-covid-origins-investigation,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) along with Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), James Lankford (R- Okla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and John Kennedy (R-La.) introduced the Coronavirus Origin Validation, Investigation, and Determination (COVID) Act of 2022. The bill would authorize sanctions if, 90 days after enactment, the Chinese Communist Party fails to allow for a credible and comprehensive international investigation into the origins of COVID-19 at laboratories in Wuhan that engaged in risky research involving bat coronaviruses. Specifically, the bill would sanction the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and its affiliated institutes and laboratories, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The COVID Act would also suspend federal research funding across all academic fields for studies that involve the CAS, and impose a prohibition on gain-of-function virus research cooperation between any individual or institution based in the United States that receives federal funding and any PRC-based individual or institution.   “The Chinese Communist Party's deception on COVID origins has come at the expense of American lives,” Blackburn said. “In no way should the United States enable or encourage the dangerous and deceptive practices of these Chinese-state labs, and this legislation will expand on our existing work by formally levying long overdue sanctions against the Chinese Academy of Sciences.” “For two years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has stonewalled all efforts to uncover the true origins of COVID-19,” Rubio said. “We know the virus originated in China, however, the CCP’s attempts to obfuscate the truth has led to countless deaths and needless suffering worldwide. It is clear that Beijing will only respond to concerted pressure from the United States and the international community. My bill will force the CCP to the table.”  “Again and again, General Secretary Xi and his underlings in the Chinese Communist Party have blocked attempts to find the truth by lying about COVID’s transmission, censoring doctors and shifting blame,” R. Scott said. “It’s time for Communist China to come clean and answer for its lies and cover-up on the origins of COVID-19. I’m proud to join Senator Rubio and our colleagues in leading this important bill to hold Communist China accountable.” “Congress should not have to threaten sanctions to get transparency from the Chinese Communist Party on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Cramer said. “This bill will finally provide answers the American people and the world deserve.”  “China lied and Americans died,” Daines said. “We must hold China accountable for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic and conduct a thorough, credible investigation into the origins of COVID-19.” “COVID-19 has taken the lives of over 800,000 people in the United States so far. Families who’ve lost loved ones to this devastating virus deserve answers – especially if the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for either unleashing this virus or covering it up,” Grassley said. “Our bill requires an investigation into COVID-19’s origins and holds China accountable by sanctioning those who’ve stonewalled independent investigations. We ought to make sure there are harsh consequences for any individual or organization that played a part in starting or perpetuating this pandemic.”  “Americans rightly want to know the origins of the virus that has impacted every family in America one way or another,” Lankford said. “My Republican colleagues and I are leading the effort to push for a real investigation in China to discover the actual origins of the COVID-19 virus. We will impose sanctions on anyone who tries to obstruct those investigations.”  “The CCP lied about COVID-19, hiding their case numbers from the rest of the world,” Sasse said. “Two years into the pandemic we’re still looking for answers. After years of suffering, the American people deserve truth.”  “The Chinese Communist Party's inexcusable roadblocks to legitimate scientific investigations of the coronavirus deserve a strong response by the United States and other world leaders,” Hyde-Smith said. “The sanctions outlined in this legislation could finally prompt the CCP to help us understand the origins of a health pandemic that started in China and that continues its global rampage today.”   “The United States must lead the world in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for repeatedly blocking international investigations into origins of the COVID-19 virus that first appeared in Wuhan,” Hagerty said. “The CCP’s stonewalling on these inquiries poses a threat to the national security, economic security, and the public health of the United States, our allies, and other nations. The Americans whose lives and livelihoods suffered due to the pandemic deserve the unvarnished truth about the pandemic’s origins.” “Two years into this pandemic, China is still gaslighting the world about the origin of the coronavirus and the Communist Party’s role in covering it up,” Kennedy said. “We must pursue the truth with strength. That’s what Beijing understands, that’s the clear-eyed leadership America needs, and that’s what this bill does.”"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/icymi-blackburn-identified-the-u-s-olympic-committee-s-complicity-in-beijing-s-human-rights-abuse,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following their letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee raising concerns over the 2022 Beijing Olympics, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) identified the Olympic Committee’s complicity in Beijing’s human rights abuse.  Olympic committee says no to GOP athlete boycott demands: ‘No diplomatic benefit’Caitlin McFallFox News The Olympic committee made clear its position on Friday following GOP calls for an athlete boycott in the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, telling lawmakers it has historically made ""no diplomatic benefit."" In a letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, Susanne Lyons, chair of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) board of directors, detailed why the ban would only serve to hurt athletes.  ""An athlete boycott of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is not the solution to human rights or geopolitical issues,"" she wrote. ""The USOPC is opposed to athlete boycotts because they have been shown to negatively impact athletes while not effectively addressing global issues."" Lyons pointed to previous athlete bans by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1980s at the height of the Cold War that she said proved ineffective. In 1980, the U.S. led a multination boycott and barred its athletes from attending the Moscow Summer Olympic Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Some 65 nations participated in what would become the largest Olympic boycott to date. ""As a result, 461 American athletes – the balance of them teenagers and college students representing almost every U.S. state – qualified to compete in Moscow only to have the opportunity taken from them,"" Lyons said. ""Many never had the chance to compete at the Olympic Games again.  ""To make matters worse, their sacrifice had arguably no diplomatic benefit: The Soviet Union stayed in Afghanistan for another decade,"" she argued.  Lyons' letter was in response to GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who called for an athlete ban in the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics in protest of human rights abuses in China.  Lawmakers have argued the ban would serve as a statement that the U.S. does not take lightly genocide being committed against the Uyghur populations in Xinjiang, along with other abuses in Tibet, Hong Kong and other parts of China.  ""The Department of State annual Report on Human Rights Practices identified a peak in human rights abuses around the 2008 Olympic Games,"" the senators argued in a November letter.  The State Department reportedly found that the 2008 Summer Games in China prompted abuses like ""forced relocations linked to Olympic infrastructure construction,"" house arrests for political adversaries, increased civilian surveillance and forced social and political ""guardrails"" at schools and universities.  But the USOPC chair argued the Games can raise awareness of an issue.She instead pointed to another moment in history when a sporting event was used to garner positive attention surrounding a geopolitical issue and has become one of ""the most celebrated moments in our nation’s sporting history."" The U.S. hockey team defeated the Soviet Union during a tense 1980 Winter Olympic match, just months prior to the summer athlete boycott, when it hit the ice in New York in what would become one of the great upsets in sporting history – known as the ""Miracle on Ice."" ""That competition and the American victory inspired our nation and stood as testament to the power of democracy and freedom,"" Lyons said.  But the senators have also argued that athlete safety remains a risk, particularly following the November disappearance of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai after she accused a government official of sexually assaulting her. She reappeared a month later in a video denying she ever made the claim. Lyons said the USPOC takes athlete safety ""seriously"" and said it will be working with relevant U.S. agencies to safeguard American athletes. But the lawmakers remain unconvinced. ""The U.S. Olympic Committee’s dismissal of our concerns is a tacit endorsement of communist China’s behavior,"" Blackburn told Fox News. ""We have no assurances that our athletes will be safe at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and have no reason to believe that the Chinese Communist Party will not leverage their position to weaponize its new digital currency and national security law to target U.S. athletes."" Cotton echoed these sentiments and told Fox News ""the U.S. Olympic Committee is putting our athletes in undue peril."" ""The Biden administration and the international Olympic movement are failing America’s athletes by allowing the Olympic games to take place in China,"" he said. ""The security concerns for our athletes in China are simply too great, and President Biden hasn’t taken the appropriate steps to guarantee Americans’ safety."" There have been six Olympic athlete boycotts since the U.S. entered the international games in 1896."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/blackburn-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-honor-the-contributions-of-service-animals,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) along with Representatives Susan Wild (D-Penn.) and Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced the National Service Animals Memorial Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation to honor and recognize the contributions of service animals and their handlers to the public wellbeing, safety, and independence of Americans throughout our history.? “Service animals are trained to strengthen public safety, bolster national security, and provide medical independence in ways humans cannot. Their unique abilities are more than an additional asset—they are essential,” said Senator Blackburn. “The National Service Animals Memorial Act formally recognizes their contributions and brings awareness to their invaluable service.”   “Homage is long overdue—expressed by this bipartisan bill—to brave service animals and handlers who have put their lives on the line, and sometimes sacrificed them,” said Senator Blumenthal. “They’ve helped protect our troops from deadly danger, and supported Americans unstintingly. Their life-changing service to disabled Americans, and veterans recovering from wounds of war, is legendary and should be celebrated—as this memorial would eloquently do. I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle for joining this historic cause.” ""As a dog owner, I've seen the healing powers of animals in my personal life, and I am continually amazed by all the ways service animals and their handlers help Americans, whether it be a person with a disability, a police officer, or a service member,"" said Representative Wild. ""Animals have been helping humans for millions of years, and it's beyond time to start memorializing their contributions. I'm proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to honor all the ways that the human-animal bond has improved our lives."" “As a dog owner myself, I have personally experienced what a special place these loving creatures hold in our hearts. Service animals lift the lives and spirits of military members, police officers, and those with disabilities every day,” said Representative Mace. “This bill commemorates the bond between animal and handler, and recognizes the life saving and life sustaining service they so generously provide to our communities.” Formalized service animal work dates to 1929 with the first guide dog training at the Eustice School, though animals have served alongside humans for much longer. Service animals are trained to provide medical assistance, aid law enforcement, and support military efforts. This bill would authorize the creation of a memorial in the Greater Washington, D.C. area under the Commemorative Works Act to show gratitude for service animals and their handlers and serve as a place of introspection about their contributions. The memorial will be fully paid for by a partnering organization, and no taxpayer dollars will be used. The National Service Animals Memorial Act is endorsed by Humane Society Legislative Fund, Humane Society of the United States, and the National Service Animals Monument Corporation."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/senators-blackburn-braun-lead-gop-colleagues-in-opposition-to-biden-vaccine-mandate-in-upcoming-scotus-case,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – United States Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) joined Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and most GOP colleagues in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in the upcoming case considering the Biden Administration’s top-down Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) requiring private employers with over 100 employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing. The brief argues that Congress did not give OSHA the authority to impose a vaccine mandate and urges SCOTUS to stay the mandate.  In the brief, the members write: “Congressional members have an interest in the powers they delegate to agencies not being abused—the legislative authority vested in the federal government belongs to Congress, not the Executive branch. In this case, the promulgation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of a sweeping, nationwide vaccine mandate on businesses intrudes into an area of legislative concern far beyond the authority of the agency. And it does so with a Mandate enacted through OSHA’s seldom-used ‘emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) provision that allows for bypass of notice and comment rulemaking under certain circumstances. That OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the ETS Mandate is not a ‘particularly hard’ question.” The members continue: “Moreover, congressional members—as representatives of the people of their States and districts—have an interest in the citizens they represent being able to craft local solutions to problems facing their States and districts. Federalism concerns should be addressed before requiring federally-imposed solutions. And this is especially true when the question at issue involves an area typically reserved to the States (such as vaccine mandates). At the least, Congress should be forced to make clear any delegations of authority into areas of State control.”  Read the full text of the brief here.   Along with Senators Blackburn and Braun, the brief was signed by:  Senators John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, John Boozman, Richard Burr, Shelley Moore Capito, Bill Cassidy, Tom Cotton, John Cornyn, Kevin Cramer, Mike Crapo, Ted Cruz, Steven Daines, Joni Ernst, Deb Fischer, Lindsey O.

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/blackburn-peters-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-streamline-federal-manufacturing-support-programs,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced bipartisan legislation to streamline federal efforts to boost domestic manufacturers and support workers. The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act would assess the U.S. Department of Commerce’s efforts to support manufacturers and suggest solutions to improve the Department’s manufacturing programs to better serve manufacturers – many of which are small businesses. This bill comes as the U.S. works to mitigate global supply chain issues caused by the pandemic that have hurt workers and disrupted industries nationwide. “The global supply chain crisis resulting from our dependence on Communist China underscored the importance of strengthening American manufacturing,” said Senator Blackburn. “The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act will streamline programs run by the Department of Commerce to eliminate government waste and improve efficiency. This legislation will benefit the manufacturing community based in Tennessee and across the U.S.” “You can’t be a great country if you don’t make things – and in Michigan, manufacturing has been a core part of our state’s economy. It is essential we have a streamlined federal manufacturing strategy that can support businesses, create good-paying jobs, and secure our economic competitiveness on the world stage,” said Senator Peters. “However, for too long our country has lacked a coherent, national manufacturing strategy like our foreign competitors – particularly the Chinese government. Additionally, federal support for manufacturers is often fractured, uncoordinated and difficult to navigate. That’s why I was proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to generate a more efficient, unified approach to federal manufacturing policy, and ensure we remain a global manufacturing leader for generations.”  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in 2017 identifying 58 programs across 11 different federal agencies that serve U.S. manufacturing, several of which are housed within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The vast number of programs may complicate their administration and presents a barrier to manufacturers knowing about and accessing valuable resources. The Strengthening Support for American Manufacturing Act would address these issues by identifying ways to improve the Commerce Department’s management of these programs, and putting forth legislative recommendations to create a single agency responsible for administering them."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2022/1/blackburn-bipartisan-bill-to-strengthen-domestic-semiconductor-manufacturing-advances-in-senate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved a bipartisan bill introduced by U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) to strengthen federal efforts to expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2021 would direct the U.S. Department of Commerce’s SelectUSA program – in collaboration with federal agencies and state economic development organizations – to develop strategies to attract investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturers and supply chains. The bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration. “Tennessee manufacturers rely on semiconductors to support local and global supply chains. The semiconductor shortages made it abundantly clear that we cannot continue to depend on Communist China for critical materials for manufacturing and producing American products,” said Senator Blackburn. “This legislation with Senator Peters will encourage economic development with local leaders to identify resource gaps and address challenges faced by Tennessee businesses in meeting their bottom line.” “The ongoing semiconductor shortage has caused major disruptions for Michigan’s manufacturers and automakers, and exposed an overreliance on foreign producers that threatens our economic and national security,” said Senator Peters. “This bill will shore up our domestic supply chains by boosting our semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and driving investments in American manufacturing. This is particularly critical for our economic competitiveness on the global stage, as others such as the Chinese government continue to invest in research and development of new technologies. I’m pleased that the bill advanced in the Senate, and I’ll continue working to ensure it’s passed into law.” “Commerce Committee passage of the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act today is great news and an important step toward fixing America’s chip shortage that has had negative impacts on families, businesses and our national security,” said Senator Scott. “As Communist China’s aggression grows in this industry, the United States must become more competitive on a global scale and I thank my colleagues for their support of this important bill.” BACKGROUND:  The SelectUSA program was established in 2011 to improve federal efforts that attract job-creating business investments in the United States and support U.S. firms. This bill comes amid a report issued in June by the Biden Administration, which emphasized that the SelectUSA program could be leveraged to strengthen private sector investments across the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain. The Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2021 would direct the SelectUSA program to engage with state-level economic development organizations about how they are attracting foreign direct investment to onshore activities related to semiconductor manufacturing, and identify what resource gaps or other challenges they face in achieving that goal. SelectUSA would then be required to develop strategies to increase investments in semiconductor manufacturing."

Marsha Blackburn called on the Department of Commerce Wednesday to blacklist five Chinese companies suspected of aiding the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in its suppression and surveillance of the Uyghur minority group. In a letter obtained by Fox News to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Blackburn and 10 other Senate Republicans listed five entities with connections to the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation. The senators urged the U.S. agency to blacklist companies that have developed software, like biometrics and gait analysis used to enhance CCP surveillance over its own citizens, particularly among ethnic Muslim groups, including the Uyghurs. Vistek Co. Ltd., Beijing IrisKing Co. Ltd., IriStar Technology Co. Ltd., Watrix.ai and Beijing ViSystem Corporation Ltd. were listed as the five companies that lawmakers want the Commerce Department to add to the U.S. ""entity list"" and restrict all future trade with. ""The human rights abuses at the hands of the CCP are evident in the Xinjiang region where Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious groups are targeted and punished,"" the senators wrote Wednesday. ""Elements of the surveillance and control tactics utilized in Xinjiang are also evident in the regions of Tibet and Inner Mongolia, and even against dissidents in major metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai."" The lawmakers accused the CCP of weaponizing software developed by these companies and violating human rights, particularly amongst minority populations.  Blackburn said that it is increasingly important that any company doing business with the U.S. is ""thoroughly vetted"" to preserve U.S. national security and ""emphasize that we do not condone the immoral behavior of the CCP."" The letter to Raimondo comes just one week after the Biden administration said it would not be attending the Winter Olympics in Beijing as part of a diplomatic boycott over China’s human rights abuses.  China has condemned the move and accused the U.S. of stirring up trouble. Despite numerous reports of human rights abuses, forced sterilization, forced labor and other atrocities described by the U.S. as a genocide against the Uyghur populations in Xinjiang, China has repeatedly denied any such abuses. Fox News could not immediately reach the Commerce Department for comment. "

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/12/icymi-blackburn-pushes-for-more-resources-for-tennessee-servicemembers-and-their-families,"NASHVILLE, TENN. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, pushed for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include major wins for Tennessee including raises for military servicemembers, access to additional resources for military families, and strengthened national defense capabilities.   What the $770B defense bill means for TennesseeVivian JonesMain Street Nashville A $770 billion defense spending bill now headed to President Joe Biden’s desk includes significant funding for military projects in Tennessee. The National Defense Authorization Act, which received final approval from the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, provides a 2.7% pay raise and improved health benefits for military service members, as well as significant funding for nuclear modernization and military equipment at Tennessee facilities. A controversial measure to require women aged 18 to 25 to register for the selective service alongside men was not included in the final bill. U.S. senators, including Tennessee Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, approved the bill in an 89-10 vote on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the bill cleared the House of Representatives in a vote of 363 to 70. “Every step we take with every taxpayer dollar that is designated in this legislation is going to help hold our adversaries to account on many different fronts,” Blackburn told Main Street Nashville in an interview. “We fully realize that China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are the new axis of evil, and showing that we consider them our adversaries and that we intend to hold them to account for their actions is important for the safety and security of this nation.” What it means for Tennessee service members Significantly, the bill includes a 2.7% pay increase for military service members and improvements in military health care. It also provides funding for a pilot program championed by Blackburn to ensure military spouses whose jobs require state-specific licensure, such as those in health care or education careers, secure reciprocal licensure in Tennessee when their spouse’s military service prompts a move. “This would cover individuals that are required by law to have a license in one state for Tennessee to recognize that license when they move to Tennessee,” Blackburn said. “This has been a very successful pilot project that I had started by working with the secretary of the Army. We’re continuing that.” A significant reform is included regarding how accusations of sexual harassment are handled under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For the first time, the bill designates sexual harassment as a crime and requires allegations of sexual harassment to be handled by an independent investigator outside the chain of command. In 2018, a Pentagon survey on sexual assault in the military found an estimated 20,500 instances of unwanted sexual contact, a more than 25% increase over the last major survey in 2016. Funding for Tennessee military installments Funding is included for military facilities, research and equipment in Tennessee. The bill includes $436 million for nuclear modernization projects and decontamination projects at the Y-12 National Security Complex and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Several nuclear modernization programs are authorized, including the reestablishment of domestic uranium enrichment in Tennessee. The bill includes funding for materials, uranium and lithium, and nonproliferation expertise for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “The Oak Ridge National Lab and Y-12 Complex is being utilized more — whether it comes to quantum computing, our uranium enrichment and lithium processing ... these are all going to be important,” Blackburn said.Nearly $20 million is authorized for military construction projects at Memphis International Airport and Arnold Air Force Base, expanding Arnold Air Force Base’s ability to execute test programs for technology including hypersonic munitions and future strike aircraft. “You’re going to see more attention there for hypersonics,” Blackburn said. “You’ve got the Space Force going in at Huntsville, which is just a stone’s throw away from Tullahoma. So we feel very good about the research work that’s going to take place there.” The bill includes funding to provide additional UH-60 helicopters for the Tennessee Army National Guard, and it prohibits reduction of KC-135 aircraft for the Air National Guard. “Not only does this legislation include a pay raise for our men and women in uniform, invest in their families, and strengthen our national defense, but it includes significant investments in the Volunteer State that I strongly advocated for in order to keep Tennessee a leader in protecting our homeland,” Hagerty said in a statement. Deterring US adversaries The bill establishes a commission to examine the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. Blackburn says that provision is aimed at bringing accountability for the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in August. “How is it that our intel did not pick up that Taliban had positioned people in different agencies and that Kabul would fall so quickly? Why did we leave those billions of dollars of equipment there? Why did we not get Americans out before we turned over the keys to the Taliban?” Blackburn said. “So we are going to have a commission that will look at that.” The bill also includes a requirement that the Department of Defense assess how respiratory diseases are being weaponized, and it requires the department to increase reporting to Congress on plant-directed research and biological weapons production labs."

On Tuesday morning, the Department of Labor announced that wholesale prices have increased a record-setting 9.6% in year-over-year average. “Tennesseans cannot afford the left’s endless spending spree,” Blackburn said in a statement. “Joe Biden’s radical economic agenda has resulted in decades-high inflation, and in return, the White House and Congressional Democrats have refused to slow their spending. The Stop The Inflationary Spending Spree Act will force them to work on bipartisan solutions instead of forcing through increased spending that will hurt our economy.” The act would specifically “amend Senate Rule XXII to increase the voting threshold to two-thirds to invoke cloture on general appropriations bills during periods that the Consumer Price Index sits above 4.0%.” Last week, several economists — including President Barack Obama’s advisor and President Bill Clinton’s for Treasury Secretary Larry Summers — warned that inflation was here to stay and that American consumers could expect to see rising costs over the next couple of years due in part to Biden’s proposed Build Back Better plan: When asked during the interview if Biden’s multi-trillion-dollar leftist spending bill would worsen inflation, Summers responded, “I think the inflation rate would be slightly higher in 2022 and 2023 with the Build Back Better than it would be without the Build Back Better.” Summers said that the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), which was 6.8%, “confirmed” that the inflation that has erupted under Biden is “not transitory,” like the administration has tried to claim. “And I think everybody recognizes now with the statements from Chairman Powell, with the statements from Secretary Yellen, that this isn’t going to just go away of its own accord,” Summers warned. “That the Fed’s going to have to take substantial action to control inflation … we put in motion for the first time in 40 years, excessive inflation, caused by overheating of the economy, and that’s going to have to be worked out of the system and that’s probably not going to be such an easy thing.” According to Blackburn’s office, the Tennessee senator will be “joined on this legislation by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Rick Scott (R-FL).” To that extent, Marshall issued a statement in the release in part saying: “Inflation hurts everyone but none more than our seniors and young hard-working families living paycheck to paycheck. I’m proud to partner with my colleagues to introduce this legislation to halt Democrats’ out-of-control spending and restore a flourishing free market economy for the American people.” Ernst of Iowa noted that the proposed bill would “force Congress to work together—across party lines—to rein in its out of control spending and address the rising costs that continue to punish hardworking families.” Likewise, Scott added that “Congress should not pass laws that fuel inflation and raise prices on hardworking families.” It is expected that the Stop The Inflationary Spending Spree Act will be introduced Tuesday afternoon."

The Entity List imposes restrictions on companies with actions counter to the U.S. government’s national security or foreign policy interests, and following research published by the Hoover Institution last week, Senator Blackburn led Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on this letter.The Chinese Communist Party’s Genocide Is Evident “The human rights abuses at the hands of the CCP are evident in the Xinjiang region where Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious groups are targeted and punished. The party-state’s denunciation of said groups leads to ‘pre-criminal’ profiling; coerced collections of biometric and genetic data; rape and forced sterilization of women; and mass internment. Elements of the surveillance and control tactics utilized in Xinjiang are also evident in the regions of Tibet and Inner Mongolia, and even against dissidents in major metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.” The U.S. Government Cannot Enable The CCP “While the U.S. government has made strides towards restricting business with some PRC entities, efforts are still inadequate with respect to PRC research institutions and their affiliates in light of their contributions to the mass weaponization of surveillance functions.Potential partners must be thoroughly vetted to maintain our own national security and to outwardly emphasize that we do not condone the immoral behavior of the CCP.” Read full letter here or below. Dear Secretary Raimondo, We write to express our concern with the harmful efforts of several firms connected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation that are working to weaponize surveillance functions on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As such, we request that the Department of Commerce intervene to defend American interests and add these companies to its “Entity List.” The Department of Commerce plays a critical role in preserving U.S. values and promoting national security, especially when protecting the United States from malign interference by the CCP. The CCP is known to blur the facts of activities within state-controlled research institutions, promote unofficial transfers of intellectual property, and participate in activities that damage the moral framework surrounding human rights and scientific research. These alarming discoveries solidify the importance of further vetting for Chinese state-affiliated entities whose activities oppose American ethics at their core. The human rights abuses at the hands of the CCP are evident in the Xinjiang region where Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious groups are targeted and punished. The party-state’s denunciation of said groups leads to “pre-criminal” profiling; coerced collections of biometric and genetic data; rape and forced sterilization of women; and mass internment. Elements of the surveillance and control tactics utilized in Xinjiang are also evident in the regions of Tibet and Inner Mongolia, and even against dissidents in major metropolitan cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It is for these reasons that we implore the Department of Commerce to restrict trade with entities in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) whose products and services support egregious crimes against civilians. While the U.S. government has made strides towards restricting business with some PRC entities, efforts are still inadequate with respect to PRC research institutions and their affiliates in light of their contributions to the mass weaponization of surveillance functions. Potential partners must be thoroughly vetted to maintain our own national security and to outwardly emphasize that we do not condone the immoral behavior of the CCP. We strongly urge you to add these additional entities to your agency’s “Entity List” to preserve U.S. values and national security during business ventures and trade negotiations. We look forward to your response."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/12/blackburn-braun-young-hagerty-inhofe-romney-introduce-legislation-to-empower-state-innovation-within-medicaid-program,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Todd Young (Ind.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) introduced the Let States Innovate Under Medicaid Act. This legislation authorizes a framework to allow innovation under Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration project waivers. Specifically, it would include “work or community engagement requirements” as an acceptable practice that furthers the objectives of the Medicaid program, thereby prohibiting the CMS administrator from denying a 1115 waiver on the basis that work or community engagement requirements do not further the objectives of the Medicaid program. “The Biden administration’s policies are driven by top-down federal government overreach, and their approach to Medicaid will only further this agenda. Their policies will result in less flexibility for states like Tennessee to care for the most vulnerable populations including the poor and people with disabilities.""—Senator Marsha Blackburn  “States should be able to set standards for their Medicaid programs, as they know how to best tailor programs for their constituents. This commonsense policy allows the Hoosier State to design programs that provide Medicaid enrollees with community engagement activities that can improve health outcomes and reduce dependence on medical assistance. Additionally, my legislation will prevent the Biden Administration from recklessly revoking approved state waivers, and prevent them from taking power away from local and state elected leaders only to further concentrate such power with Washington bureaucrats.”—Senator Mike Braun “Medicaid should ideally be available as a temporary option, with a goal of preparing individuals for a life of dignity in the workforce. Work and community engagement activities, such as those that Indiana previously had in place, are designed to improve quality of life over the long term and help individuals transition to full employment. CMS’s decision earlier this year to revoke Indiana’s ability to set these expectations for some Medicaid recipients treats work as a punishment and discourages efforts to transition to self-reliance. That’s why I joined my colleagues to introduce the Let States Innovate Under Medicaid Act to allow states the opportunity to innovate under the Medicaid program, with the objective of preparing individuals for a life of independence in the workforce.”—Senator Todd Young “This legislation will give states like Utah more freedom and flexibility to best manage their Medicaid program, help people seek opportunities for community engagement, and continue to provide health coverage to those who depend on it.”—Senator Mitt Romney “This legislation would allow Tennessee the opportunity to innovate and adapt Medicaid to further protect this program and the vulnerable populations it serves. Giving states the freedom to choose what works best for their needs is what makes America such a great nation. I’m pleased to join Senator Braun in introducing this important legislation.”—Senator Bill Hagerty “Over the past year, Republican states have proven they do a fantastic job at getting people back to work—17 of the top 20 states for jobs recovered since the coronavirus pandemic began are led by Republican governors, but the Biden administration continues to try and derail these efforts. Their latest scheme? Preventing states from continuing to serve Medicaid patients through 1115 waivers if they implement common sense work requirements. Hardworking Oklahomans agree: if you get federal benefits like Medicaid, you need to work or participate in community engagement. I’m pleased to join Sen. Braun in introducing legislation that will protect Oklahoma’s and other states’ ability to manage their Medicaid programs.”—Senator Jim Inhofe  BACKGROUND  In February 2021, at the direction of the Biden Administration, CMS began efforts to withdraw work requirement waiver authorities in several states that had either been previously approved, or had a pending application, to implement work requirements. CMS is continuing to review some states’ work requirement waivers, but has already been successful in officially withdrawing waiver authorities in 9 States—Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. Additionally, other states have voluntarily withdrawn work requirements from their waiver applications or have postponed the implementation of work requirements because of the uncertainty concerning Medicaid work and community engagement programs. CMS based its decision to withdraw waiver authorities in the 9 states on the basis that “work or community engagement requirements” do not further the objectives of the Medicaid program. "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/3/blackburn-demands-answers-on-chinese-sister-cities,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R–Tenn.) introduced legislation along with Senators Josh Hawley (R–Mo.), Kevin Cramer (R–N.D.), Thom Tillis (R–N.C.), Marco Rubio (R–Fla.), and Roger Marshall (R–Kans.) to shed light on the 157 sister city partnerships between U.S. and Chinese communities. Congressman Chip Roy (R–Tex.) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“Sister cities are strategic partnerships that Beijing brokers to create a foothold in American communities,” said Senator Blackburn. “These partnerships are yet another tool in Beijing’s campaign to infiltrate our culture to achieve their economic ends. In the past, China has used a sister city partnership to force a local government to abide by Chinese policies or face economic retaliation. It is imperative we shed light on these partnerships to determine whether they leave American communities vulnerable to foreign espionage and ideological coercion.” “Right now sister city partnerships can too easily be abused by the Chinese Communist Party, a regime intent on spying on Americans, stealing American ideas, and targeting Americans for propaganda,” Senator Hawley said. “The Sister City Transparency Act addresses this threat by demanding transparency from sister city partnerships and identifying best practices for ensuring Beijing can’t use these relationships to advance its own malign agenda.”“The Chinese Communist Party regularly exploits its sister city partnerships around the world to aggressively advance its own agenda,” said Senator Cramer. “Our bill would give us a better understanding of China’s reach into the United States and allow us to address that accordingly.”“As China becomes a larger threat to the United States, we must have proper oversight and review of practices over sister city partnerships,” said Senator Tillis. “With proper insight, we can see the true nature of these partnerships and mitigate the risk of any corruption or destructive activity. I am proud to work with my colleagues on this legislation to protect our cities from any potential threat of espionage the Chinese Communist Party may impose.”“Beijing has a history of conducting its malign activities by exploiting cultural and economic partnerships,” Senator Rubio said. “This means that sister city partnerships require further scrutiny. It’s in our national and economic security interest to better understand, and counter, China’s growing malign influence at the state and local level. I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to pass this bill, which will provide greater transparency on the CCP’s on-going efforts to conduct influence operations in the U.S.”“The Chinese Communist Party is a direct, existential threat to America's national security and the way of life that we hold dear,” said Congressman Roy. “At the very least, we must ensure that our own American cities are not supporting a regime that wants to destroy us while leaving us vulnerable to foreign espionage and influence.”“There must be a bipartisan push for transparency regarding these sister city relationships in the U.S. Addressing the threat that the CCP poses using those platforms is part of protecting Uyghurs and others targeted by the Chinese regime,” said the Campaign for Uyghurs. “The Chinese regime has openly stated that sister cities are a means to push the Belt and Road Initiative, one of the primary reasons for the genocide of Uyghurs, among other human rights abuses.”BACKGROUNDThe Sister City Transparency Act would create a GAO report on sister city partnerships operating within the U.S. More specifically, the bill would direct the Comptroller General to conduct a study on such partnerships involving foreign communities in countries with significant public sector corruption – e.g., the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation.

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/3/blackburn-what-deal-did-the-nba-cut-with-communist-china,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn is demanding answers from the NBA about its return to China Central Television (CCTV). Communist China banned NBA broadcasts following outspoken support within the league for the Hong Kong freedom fighters.Senator Blackburn also questioned if the NBA’s large donation of PPE played a role in its return to Chinese airwaves:According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in XUAR produced medical grade PPE before the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2020, the number of PPE-producing companies quickly rose to 51 and at least 17 of those 51 companies used enslaved Uyghurs. Some of this slave-labor PPE ended up in the United States.Read the full text of the letter here or below: Dear Commissioner Silver,Congratulations on a successful beginning to the 75th National Basketball Association’s (NBA) season and the upcoming 67th All-Star Game approaching on March 7th. Basketball fans around the world are energized and excited. I write in regards to the NBA’s new agreement with state-controlled China Central Television (CCTV) following a broadcasting ban during the 2019-20 season. Recent media reporting highlighted that this weekend’s All-Star Game will commence the full-time return of CCTV airing NBA games.While investigations into the origin of COVID-19 continue in Wuhan, the NBA seems solely focused on mending its relationship with CCTV even though it’s clear Communist China will distort, censor or terminate any CCTV broadcast that is seen as a threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Multiple sources report that China hoarded protective equipment, destroyed test samples, silenced doctors and lied about the risk of human-to-human transmission. Recently, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that we must have data that is “free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government.” So far, this has not been the case.Furthermore, a New York Times article highlighted a scathing video investigation which disclosed companies affiliated with the CCP using Uyghurs, a predominately Muslim ethnic group, as forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) to increase production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). In the XUAR, more than one million Uyghurs and other ethnic groups reside in internment camps, suffering atrocious treatment and enduring horrific crimes including forced abortions and sterilizations.According to China’s National Medical Products Administration, only four companies in XUAR produced medical grade PPE before the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2020, the number of PPE-producing companies quickly rose to 51 and at least 17 of those 51 companies used enslaved Uyghurs. Some of this slave-labor PPE ended up in the United States. Furthermore, China has a vile history of violating the religious freedom and autonomy of Tibetans and Christians. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled Communist China’s treatment of Muslim Uyghurs as genocide.In addition, China continues to renege on commitments to democracy under its treaty with Britain regarding the governance of Hong Kong, a CCP political sensitivity with which the NBA has become well acquainted. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted that Beijing continues to threaten Hong Kongers with life-sentences in prison in an attempt to cripple the fight for democracy and freedom.China has punished the NBA since the Daryl Morey tweet supporting freedom in Hong Kong, which Commissioner Silver admitted cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars.On October 9, 2020 (almost a year to the exact day of Morey’s tweet), the NBA stated that the return to CCTV was a result of the continuous goodwill expressed by the NBA towards China’s communist government. It is safe to assume that “goodwill” included the $1 million in medical supplies the NBA sent to the CCP. China dominates PPE production worldwide, so it is deeply troubling that the NBA would send this aid, especially after witnessing the lack of transparency shown by the CCP throughout the entire pandemic and their continued grave human rights violations.As the All-Star game draws near, it is imperative that Congress receive further details on the NBA’s relationship with China.

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/3/blackburn-urges-biden-to-investigate-the-who-investigators,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn is urging President Biden to ensure the team of investigators sent from the World Health Organization to Wuhan, China, is free from conflict after serious ethical concerns were raised.In the letter, Senator Blackburn highlighted the lack of transparency, writing:Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency of the events that took place at the time the outbreak started in Wuhan, China. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding the manner in which World Health Organization investigators were chosen to study the outbreak and some of the conflicts of interest that exist in those investigators.Senator Blackburn also urged President Biden to ensure the ongoing WHO investigation is free from any conflicts of interest:In light of that, I respectfully request you use your leadership to ensure the ongoing investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic origin be free from conflict of interest. WHO should be required to have independent investigators to conduct this study.Read the full text of the letter here or below:Dear President Biden:The COVID 19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on American life as well as the U.S. economy. Test kits, antibody therapies, and vaccine development have occurred in record time due to Operation Warp Speed and the ingenuity of the private sector. However, the investigation into the origins of the pandemic are not complete.Without this knowledge, it will be difficult to prevent a future, similar pandemic. I urge you to use your leadership to ensure investigations by the World Health Organization (WHO) are free from conflicts of interest. Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency of the events that took place at the time the outbreak started in Wuhan, China. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding the manner in which World Health Organization investigators were chosen to study the outbreak and some of the conflicts of interest that exist in those investigators.Following the 2014 breakdown of security measures that resulted in cross contamination with a dangerous bird flu strain and the accidental mailing of live anthrax spores from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to other labs, Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC under president Obama testified “We also need to encourage a culture of openness and effective reporting of past or future incidents – since a key aspect of effective response is to support rapid reporting of problems.”On February 13, 2021, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said, “We have deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them. It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government.”Transparency is an issue upon which we can agree. In light of that, I respectfully request you use your leadership to ensure the ongoing investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic origin be free from conflict of interest. WHO should be required to have independent investigators to conduct this study. WHO should not include researchers with conflicts of interest or with a lack of experience in forensic investigation. We owe this to the over 500,000 Americans who have died from this disease, to their families, and to future Americans who face possible pandemics.                                                                                Sincerely,                                                                             Marsha BlackburnStates Senator "
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/blackburn-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-end-china-s-access-to-multi-year-visas,"Washington, D.C. – Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) introduced the Visa Security Act to end China’s access to 10-year multi-entry visas. Senator Blackburn advocated for a similar provision in her recently released white paper, “Pandemic-Era Policymaking And The Future Of United States-China Relations.”“Until the Chinese Communist Party ends its systematic violations of human rights and religious freedom, the United States cannot remain complicit by offering 10-year multi-entry visas to Chinese nationals.  The Visa Security Act will stop the revolving door the CCP has used for half a decade and instead demand accountability in the global human rights effort,” said Blackburn.“Since 2014, the Chinese Communist Party has had access to 10-year business and tourist visas, which allow Chinese citizens to enter and exit the United States as they please. In issuing these visas, the U.S. has welcomed the CCP, its intelligence agencies, and those they have coopted with open arms. This was a bad decision in 2014 and it’s time we fixed this error,” said Cotton.“The Obama/Biden appeasement of Communist China did nothing but bolster General Secretary Xi’s power. We know Communist China will stop at nothing to steal American technology and intellectual property in an attempt to dominate the world. There is no reason Communist China should have been given preferential visa treatment, and I’m proud to work with my colleagues to continue to hold them accountable,” said Scott.“China poses the single greatest geopolitical threat to the United States. The Chinese Communist Party engages in propaganda and censorship to control what Americans see, hear, and ultimately think about China. It’s long past time to end the Chinese Communist Party’s abuse of our visa system. This bill counters China’s aggression and advances American security,” said Cruz.“It is long overdue for the United States to fully address the imbalances in our relationship with China and stop the Chinese Communist Party from exploiting our programs and openness. Rubio said. Terminating China’s access to 10-year multi-entry visas is a logical step in overturning bad policy by the Obama Administration. China should not be given special treatment that is out of step with our relationship, the abuses they are committing, and its malign activities in the U.S.,” said Rubio.BILL SUMMARY: "

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/senator-blackburn-reintroduces-end-child-exploitation-act,"Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Maggie Hassan (D—N.H.), and Josh Hawley (R—Mo.) along with Representatives Anthony Gonzalez (OH-16), Annie Kuster (NH-02), Guy Reschenthaler (PA-14) and Lucy McBath (GA-06) reintroduced the END Child Exploitation Act legislation designed to extend the period of time that technology companies are required to preserve information about child sexual abuse images they report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).   “Children are increasingly living their lives behind screens, and the jarring reality is this leaves more innocent kids at risk of online exploitation,” said Senator Blackburn. “We need to give law enforcement the tools to investigate these crimes and collect the evidence needed to hunt down online predators.”“Since my time as Nevada’s Attorney General, I have worked to strengthen laws to protect survivors of child trafficking,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “The legislation we’re introducing today will provide our law enforcement with the authority they need to better investigate online exploitation and hold perpetrators accountable. I’ll always stand up for Nevada’s children, and I look forward to continuing my work with our law enforcement community to protect children from traffickers.”  “Criminals who abuse and exploit children must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law, and this bill will help give law enforcement additional time to investigate these crimes,” said Senator Hassan. “Especially given that reports of child abuse online have gone up during the pandemic, we must move forward with this bipartisan bill to help crack down on sex trafficking and protect children.” ""This bill will help law enforcement and tech companies effectively combat the scourge of child exploitation content online,” said Senator Hawley. “In a season when millions of Americans are reliant on the internet for so many of their daily needs, safeguards like this one could not be more timely.""“The spread of child sexual abuse material online is heinous and cannot be tolerated in our society,” Rep. Gonzalez said. “As technology continues to advance, law enforcement needs the investigative tools to adequately respond. The END Child Exploitation Act will aid law enforcement by providing them more time to work with data being gathered by technology companies. I thank my colleagues for joining me in introducing this bill and addressing this issue that effects every single community in our country. We must do more to prevent the spread of this material online, and the END Child Exploitation Act is a simple legislative fix that can help keep our communities safe.”“Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of children in New Hampshire and across the country is one of my top priorities, and we must do more to safeguard them from exploitation online,” said Rep. Kuster. “I am proud to help reintroduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to help law enforcement and technology companies respond to child sexual abuse images, hold perpetrators accountable, and protect Granite State children and communities.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has increasingly intertwined our daily lives with technology, making it more important than ever before to protect children from the growing prevalence of online child exploitation in our nation,” said Rep. Reschenthaler. “The END Child Exploitation Act will provide law enforcement more time to identify predators and hold them accountable for their heinous crimes. I am proud to join with Representatives Gonzalez, Kuster, and McBath and Senators Blackburn and Cortez Masto to stop these perpetrators, protect our nation’s children, and keep our communities safe.”“As lawmakers, we must do more to protect our children and provide parents and law enforcement the necessary tools to stop child abuse and exploitation,"" said Rep. McBath. ""Online risks are a dangerous and evolving threat to our children, which is why I am honored to join my colleagues on this important bill to provide more resources to keep kids safe, hold perpetrators accountable, and protect families in Georgia and across the United States.”“The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) commends Representatives Gonzalez, Kuster, Reschenthaler, and McBath for introducing the Eliminate Network Distribution of Child Exploitation Act. This Act will expand the amount of time electronic service providers must retain material relating to child sexual exploitation reports submitted to NCMEC’s CyberTipline, allowing more time for NCMEC to analyze, and law enforcement to investigate, these reports. The Act also provides technology companies with the enhanced ability to develop more sophisticated tools to respond to and reduce this terrible crime. Since 1998, NCMEC’s CyberTipline has received over 84 million reports relating to online child sexual abuse content from members of the public and technology companies, including more than 21 million reports just last year. We support this legislation to help enable more time for the efficient and effective review and investigation of CyberTipline reports. NCMEC commends the sponsors of this Act for introducing this bill and for their dedication to the safety of our nation’s children.”""There are certain crimes that strike at the core of who we are as a society. Online sexual exploitation of children is one of the most repulsive criminal trends that plague our country,"" said Patrick Yoes, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. ""The bill introduced by Representative Gonzalez will double the amount of time that the information sent to the CyberTipline is preserved for investigatory purposes, allowing more time for law enforcement to conduct these time-consuming investigations and to help children who are victimized and exploited online.""BackgroundThe END Child Exploitation Act was first introduced in December 2019 following the release of a New York Times investigative report highlighting disturbing growth in online child exploitation across the country. The report found that technology companies reported more than 69 million images and videos depicting abuse in 2019. Currently, these companies are required to retain information on these images for 90 days after reporting the material to NCMEC, however, this time is often not enough for habitually under-resourced law enforcement to conduct the necessary investigative process. The END Child Exploitation Act doubles this time frame to 180 days and ensures these companies are legally able to retain the material longer if needed to prevent the proliferation or spread of child exploitation material."
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/blackburn-the-paris-climate-accord-is-destroying-american-jobs,"Today, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R—Tenn.) spoke on the Senate floor to criticize the effort to re-join the Paris Climate Accords. *Click the photo above or watch the clip here* Partial Transcript Below:“When former President Trump formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Accords in 2019, economists, business owners, and budget watchdogs all breathed a sigh of relief because they knew that adherence to the Paris Climate Accords would put the United States at a competitive disadvantage. This wasn't a partisan debate, mind you. This was US-based companies. US-based companies that were saying thank you for withdrawing because adhering to this when other countries who were our competitor will not adhere puts us at a disadvantage. Now, with the Climate Accords, by 2035, we would have seen hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs, household electric bills go up as much as 20%, and an aggregate GDP freefall of $2.5 trillion. That is the cost. That is the cost of my way or the highway. That is the cost of putting other countries and their agenda ahead of us, the cost of their non-compliance.”— Senator Marsha Blackburn (R—Tenn.)"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/daines-blackburn-push-back-on-the-job-killing-paris-climate-agreement,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marsha Blackburn (R—Tenn.) and Steve Daines (R— Mont.) introduced legislation to prohibit U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Agreement. They also introduced a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to submit the Paris Agreement to the Senate for review as required under the Constitution. “By rejoining the Paris Climate Accords, the Biden administration prioritized leftist goals of foreign countries above the needs of the American people,” said Senator Blackburn. ""The Biden administration has shown an incredible penchant for putting hard-working Americans out of work during an unprecedented pandemic. This Executive Order has the potential of killing another 400,000 jobs and lead our country away from energy independence."" “President Biden violated the Constitution when he chose to rejoin the poorly negotiated and deeply flawed Paris Climate Agreement—a deal that’s horrible for America and good for China,” Senator Daines stated. “This deal will do nothing except cause more hard-working Americans to lose their jobs and burden American families with higher energy prices. We must ensure not a single penny of taxpayer dollars are used to implement this disastrous deal.” WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: “The Paris Agreement is a bad deal for America and a bad deal for Kansas. The deal will kill jobs and raise the price of energy, hurting Americans when many are struggling to stay on their feet. It will punish American energy providers with expensive regulations, dole out U.S. taxpayer money to foreign countries, and let China off the hook for their role as the world’s largest polluter,” said Senator Marshall. “This bill and resolution will ensure not a single dime of American’s hard-earned money goes toward the Paris Climate Agreement.” “President Biden has again ignored the Senate’s Constitutional duty to advise and consent, unilaterally forcing America back into the Paris climate treaty,” said Senator Lummis. “This treaty fails to hold other countries accountable for polluting actions and instead punishes American workers, particularly those in Wyoming and other states driving America’s energy independence. President Biden’s actions on Paris are short-sighted, and I’m proud to work with Steve Daines and Marsha Blackburn to try and stop them.” “The Paris Climate Agreement is built on the idea that America is the culprit. In reality, we are the leading driver of innovation to address climate change,” said Barrasso. “Returning to the Paris climate agreement will raise Americans’ energy costs and won’t solve climate change. The Biden administration will set unworkable targets for the United States while China and Russia can continue with business as usual.”  BACKGROUND In 2019, Heritage Foundation analysts studied what would happen if the United States stayed in the Paris Agreement and found there would be an overall loss of nearly 400,000 jobs, half of which would be in manufacturing. The Heritage analysis also found the Paris Agreement would result in an average total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four; and an aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion. Senator Blackburn’s legislation, No Taxpayer Funding for Paris Climate Agreement Act, is sponsored by John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Tommy Tuberville (R- Ala.). Senator Daines’ Paris Climate Agreement Resolution is sponsored by Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.)."

https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/blackburn-and-colleagues-call-for-investigation-into-gov-andrew-cuomo-s-covid-19-cover-up,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In light of new reports alleging New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff engaged in a cover-up of New York's nursing home COVID-19 death toll, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R—Tenn.) along with Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today sent a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling for the Committee to investigate Cuomo's COVID-19 cover-up. She was joined by members of the Committee; Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C). “Governor Andrew Cuomo’s role in the coverup of nursing home deaths is extremely concerning,” said Senator Blackburn. “As facts continue to unravel, it is clear Cuomo is not the leader the media has made him out to be. The American people deserve answers.” In the letter, the senators outlined their expectation for Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden's nominee for Attorney General, to commit to investigating Cuomo's COVID-19 cover-up: ""When Judge Garland testifies before this Committee, we expect him to commit the Department of Justice to fully investigating this cover-up to determine whether any criminal laws were violated and to prosecute any violations. We will also ask him whether he has the resources he needs to fully pursue an investigation, not only into the deaths that occurred in New York but the deaths that occurred in other states that adopted similar directives leading to the admission of COVID-19 infected persons into elder care facilities."" They continued, urging Sen. Durbin to open an investigation and schedule hearings into Cuomo's COVID-19 cover-up: ""But an investigation by the Department of Justice is rightly conducted behind closed doors and will not provide timely and public accountability for those who played politics with COVID-19 at the expense of the lives of American senior citizens. ""That is why we ask you to open an investigation and schedule hearings on this critical issue. The American people deserve to know the extent to which Governor Cuomo and his senior staff violated the civil rights of New York seniors, lied to the Department of Justice about their actions, and violated federal civil and criminal laws in the process."" Read the full text of the letter here and below:February 17, 2021 The Honorable Dick DurbinChairman, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary224 Dirksen Senate Office BuildingWashington D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Durbin, Last week, the New York Post reported that Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, told a group of state lawmakers that Governor Cuomo and his senior staff engaged in a deliberate cover-up regarding New York's nursing home COVID-19 death toll. In a shockingly candid confession, she stated: ""We were in a position where we weren't sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what we start saying, was going to be used against us while we weren't sure if there was going to be an investigation."" According to The New York Times, this confession is the latest instance in Governor Cuomo's almost year-long attempt to brush away criticisms that his ""policies had allowed thousands of nursing home residents to die of the virus"" because such criticisms would undermine ""his national image[.]"" In the early stages of the pandemic, Governor Cuomo's administration issued a March 25, 2020 directive that likely inhibited the ability of elder care facilities to protect their vulnerable residents by halting or reducing the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to their facilities. While the Cuomo administration has reported these facilities had admitted nearly 6,000 COVID-19 patients directly from hospitals, we now know the Cuomo administration actively concealed the level of admissions and intentionally underreported these admissions in a way that callously and recklessly put facility residents in danger and resulted in an unknown number of deaths. The Associated Press now reports that the number of admissions was greater than 9,000 COVID-19 patients-""40% higher than what the state health department previously released[.]"" Governor Cuomo's attempt at damage control was dealt a further blow in a report by New York State attorney general Letitia James. The report stated that the number of COVID-19-related nursing home deaths had been undercounted by as much as 50%, resulting in thousands of COVID-19-related nursing home deaths not being reported properly. Such underreporting hid the truth from the public and policymakers of the dangers posed to elder home residents and, therefore, prevented the kinds of changes in policy that should have been adopted to save lives. That so many people needlessly lost their lives because of the failed policies of Governor Cuomo's administration-an administration that many have lauded over the past year-is tragic and deserves a full investigation and accounting. These new revelations, however, that Governor Cuomo's administration withheld information from the Department of Justice and intentionally misled federal officials to avoid political accountability is more than irresponsible: it is very possibly criminal. Those who deliberately withheld-or directed others to withhold-material information from the Department of Justice may be guilty of obstruction of justice, violating the False Claims Act, and numerous other criminal violations. When Judge Garland testifies before this Committee, we expect him to commit the Department of Justice to fully investigating this cover-up to determine whether any criminal laws were violated and to prosecute any violations. We will also ask him whether he has the resources he needs to fully pursue an investigation, not only into the deaths that occurred in New York but the deaths that occurred in other states that adopted similar directives leading to the admission of COVID-19 infected persons into elder care facilities. But an investigation by the Department of Justice is rightly conducted behind closed doors and will not provide timely and public accountability for those who played politics with COVID-19 at the expense of the lives of American senior citizens. That is why we ask you to open an investigation and schedule hearings on this critical issue. The American people deserve to know the extent to which Governor Cuomo and his senior staff violated the civil rights of New York seniors, lied to the Department of Justice about their actions, and violated federal civil and criminal laws in the process. Moreover, hearings will allow this Committee to ensure that the Department of Justice has all the tools and funding that it needs to investigate and prosecute to the extent necessary this tragedy and subsequent cover-up. For example, hearings can help ensure that a qualified professional like Toni Bacon-the acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, a career Department of Justice employee and former Elder Justice coordinator-runs this politically sensitive investigation, not an individual with ties to the Cuomo Administration and state party politics, like Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and mother-in-law of Ms. DeRosa. As you have stated before, the Senate Judiciary Committee through its history has played a critical role in investigating violations of civil rights and overseeing the Department of Justice. Holding hearings on potential federal criminal activity related to the reckless endangerment of American seniors in a global pandemic would send a strong signal that you take Department of Justice oversight and the lives and rights of American seniors seriously. Sincerely, /s/"
https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2021/2/senator-blackburn-calls-on-va-secretary-to-conduct-inter-agency-collaboration-to-provide-care-for-k2-veterans,"WASHINGTON – Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) along with U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) urged Secretary Denis McDonough to work with Congress, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to find solutions for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their service.During the 116th Congress, key provisions from Sen. Blackburn’s K2 Veterans Toxic Exposure Accountability Act included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 and Sen. Sullivan’s legislation, the K2 Veterans Advocacy Act, were signed into law to collect more research regarding the long-term health of servicemembers who were stationed at Camp Stronghold Freedom at Karshi-Khanabad Airbase (K2) in Uzbekistan. This research will help better determine how to provide proper care for these veterans, who are suffering from cancer and other health consequences related to toxic exposure.“Each agency’s role in this research is crucial; plans to initiate studies and coordination across federal agencies need to start immediately,” the senators wrote. “Because these efforts all seek to address different aspects of the same problem, the VA, DOD, and CDC must work together to make certain that their work is complementary to one another and adds value to the overall effort. As the foremost senior government official tasked with caring for veterans, we will rely on you to be responsible for this coordination.”The full letter can be found here or below.Dear Mr. Secretary:We write to request your cooperation in finding answers and ensuring proper care for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances at Camp Stronghold Freedom at Karshi-Khanabad Airbase (K2) in Uzbekistan at the start of Operation Enduring Freedom. K2 was a former Soviet military base used by the U.S. military to launch operations into Afghanistan during the critical early years of the Global War on Terrorism. In the years since their deployments, veterans who served at K2 have encountered disturbingly high rates of rare cancers and other negative health consequences. Because of recent legislative enactments, this issue requires the attention of the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DOD), as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Your leadership is crucial to ensure effective coordination and implementation of laws designed to help these veterans in need.During the 116th Congress, the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs (SVAC) worked hard to address the needs of K2 veterans who are experiencing negative health outcomes due to toxic exposure. Specifically, in the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act, now Public Law 116-315, Congress mandated that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs enter into an agreement with the CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to complete a study that will analyze the incidence of cancer within the K2 cohort, all the toxic substances and hazards they may have encountered at K2, and any associated health consequences. Furthermore, this legislation directs the inclusion of Uzbekistan in the list of deployment locations eligible for the VA’s Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry and ensures that all K2 veterans are covered by the Joint DOD/VA Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program.In addition, the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 116-283) contains provisions relating to veterans who served at K2. Specifically, section 751 directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on exposure to toxic substances by those deployed to K2, including identification of all substances present, an epidemiological study of the health outcomes of the K2 cohort, and any association between identified exposures and observed health outcomes.These laws, coupled with Executive Order No. 13892 signed on January 19, 20211, which mandates a detailed assessment by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, of the conditions at K2 between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, including identification of any toxic substances contaminating K2 during such period, shows the commitment across our government to take care of the veterans who served at K2. Each agency’s role in this research is crucial; plans to initiate studies and coordination across federal agencies need to start immediately. Because these efforts all seek to address different aspects of the same problem, the VA, DOD, and CDC must work together to make certain that their work is complementary to one another and adds value to the overall effort. As the foremost senior government official tasked with caring for veterans we will rely on you to be responsible for this coordination.With regard to the administration of these laws, we urge you to provide periodic public updates and conduct regular outreach directly to K2 veterans who have filed claims. Keeping K2 veterans, their families, and their survivors fully informed is imperative throughout this process and going forward as we learn more about K2 veterans’ health challenges and associated care needs.
