https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-statement-on-the-continuing-appropriations-and-ukraine-supplemental-appropriations-act-of-2023-,"Today, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 6833, and take up a substitute amendment containing a continuing resolution to fund the federal government through December 16.  I will vote to invoke cloture and move the process forward.  I urge my colleagues to do the same. Funding the federal government is the most basic responsibility of Congress.  The continuing resolution before the Senate today will keep vital services running for the American people through December 16, provide critical support for Ukraine, secure the LIHEAP safety net ahead of winter, and provide emergency relief to communities recovering from natural disasters around the country. However, let me be clear, this is only a temporary measure.  As the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am committed to completing the work of the Appropriations Committee before the end of this Congress.  In a time of rising inflation, when everything costs more – energy, food, fuel, housing – we must respond accordingly.  Running on autopilot after December would be irresponsible, and the American people deserve more.  Our federal agencies run thousands of programs every day that benefit working families.  From nutrition programs to small business loans and grants; from affordable housing to health care for our nation’s veterans; from childcare services to our nation’s schools, the federal government provides services that impact nearly every aspect of Americans’ lives.  At a time of rising inflation, we cannot fund these critical programs at last year’s levels without cutting services or underfunding needs.  It’s simple math.  Enacting full year appropriations bills into law must be our top priority.  We owe it to the American people who sent us here.  This bill addresses several urgent and pressing issues that cannot wait.  The third hottest summer on record has strained one of our most successful safety nets – the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) – as families’ energy costs went up with the record setting temperatures.  This bill contains $1 billion to bolster LIHEAP ahead of the winter, where Putin’s war on Ukraine and inflation are expected to drive energy costs even higher.  No family should have to choose between heating their home or buying food, not in Vermont, and not in any community across the country.  I am glad that we were able to secure these needed resources.  The bill includes $12.35 billion dollars in emergency assistance for Ukraine, further demonstrating our resolve to stand with the people of Ukraine against President Putin’s illegal, brutal war on their country.  These funds will provide much-needed training, equipment, logistical support, supplies, and weapons to the military and national security forces of Ukraine at this pivotal point in the war.  These funds will also be used to provide direct assistance to Ukraine to help its government maintain day-to-day operations while it fights to repel Russia’s invasion.  And it provides funding to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment that have been provided to the government of Ukraine and to other countries in support of the cause.The bill provides $2.5 billion to support recovery efforts following the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire in New Mexico.  The largest fire in New Mexico’s history has scorched hundreds of thousands of acres, destroyed homes, displaced thousands, and sparked a fresh water crisis in the community of Las Vegas, New Mexico.  This is not an issue of Red States or Blue States, we are the United States, and we must stand with communities in crisis wherever they may be.The bill also includes $2 billion in Community Development Block Grants to help address unmet recovery needs in communities experiencing major disasters in 2021 and 2022, such as Kentucky, Missouri, and Puerto Rico.  And with Hurricane Ian advancing in the Gulf, the CR also includes an additional $18.8 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund.  We must ensure FEMA has the resources to meet this challenge, and this bill provides those resources. I am disappointed that due to Republican opposition, there is no additional funding to combat COVID-19 or Monkeypox.  Reductions in the current infection levels for COVID-19 are a direct result of the investments we have made in vaccines, therapeutics, and testing over the past two years.  If we hope to avoid a surge this winter, we need the resources to continue that effort.  And we should be investing now to get ahead of Monkeypox before it continues to spread both in the United States and overseas. Not providing these resources is short-sighted, and I will continue to fight for the necessary funding to continue to combat these terrible diseases.  Now Congress must do its job and complete the appropriations process before the end of the year.  I look forward to working with Vice Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger to get this done. # # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-secures-1-billion-for-liheap-in-the-continuing-resolution,"WASHINGTON (Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2022) – Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Tuesday announced that $1 billion in new funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) was included in the Continuing Resolution.Leahy said: “No family should have to choose between ‘heat or eat’ in Vermont or in any community across the country.  The third hottest summer on record had already put a strain on LIHEAP funding, so I am glad that we were able to secure these new resources before the cold of winter sets in.”Leahy was the leading advocate for securing new funding for the popular program in the continuing resolution, which is estimated to deliver $5.7 million in support for Vermonters.  More than 6 million low-income households rely on LIHEAP to defray their home energy costs, nation-wide. LIHEAP has proven to be one of the most effective safety net programs, successfully leveraging investments from all stakeholders in keeping families safe and healthy.  The funding arrives ahead of a winter heating season where inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are expected to further strain families’ pocket books to heat their homes. # # # # #"

Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.In order to bolster support for Ukraine and defend against efforts to force Ukraine to give up its sovereign territory, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) led bipartisan colleagues in introducing the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act. The bill would require U.S. policy to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine.Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Cornyn (R-TX), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO) are cosponsors of the legislation. ###"

Wednesday praised the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) publication of six reports tracking the implementation of Congressionally Directed Spending and Community Project Funding in the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  The reports were published at the direction of the Chairman under new rules to increase transparency and accountability on the process commonly referred to “earmarking” in fiscal year 2022.Leahy said: “It is Congress that holds the power of the purse.  Congressionally Directed Spending allows Members to place this power in the hands of community leaders across the country so that federal resources can be directed to where they are most needed and to where they will do the most good.  Done transparently and with accountability, Congressionally Directed Spending can be a powerful tool to revitalize our communities and spur economic growth.  I am glad to see that GAO has followed through with our direction to track and audit this spending so that the American people can see where their tax dollars are being put to work.”In additional to the existing requirements on Congressionally Directed Spending under Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, new reforms established by Leahy include:You can read more about these reforms here, and can find the first of an anticipated 18 reports published by GAO to track Congressionally Directed Spending and Community Project Funding here.# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/yarmuth-bacon-leahy-and-collins-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-to-help-runaway-and-homeless-youth,"WASHINGTON  (WEDNESDAY, Sept. 21, 2022) -- Representatives John Yarmuth (D-KY) and Don Bacon (R-NE) and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) Wednesday introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act.  The legislation will reauthorize key federal grant programs to provide states with funding to help thousands of homeless young people nationwideThe landmark Runaway and Homeless Youth Act was first passed by Congress in 1974, providing nationwide support to address youth and young adult homelessness. This reauthorization would expand protections to youths who are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and would authorize funding for state and local programs to help provide transitional housing, street outreach, and crisis intervention programs to address the needs of homeless and runaway youth.  The legislation raises the authorization of appropriations to $300 million and doubles the minimum grant allocation provided to small states, from $100,000 to $200,000. The reauthorization also creates a new Prevention Services Program that would make additional resources available to organizations providing counseling, mediation, and other services aimed at preventing youth from running away or becoming homeless.“We must uphold our nation’s responsibility to combat youth homelessness in every way possible and ensure that our young people always have access to a safe and secure place to call home,” said Representative Yarmuth. “I was proud to lead the effort to reauthorize this critical program back in 2008 and it is my hope that we can reauthorize it once again this Congress. These vulnerable and at-risk youth need our help, as well as the families and communities impacted by our homelessness crisis.”“The pandemic increased the number of homeless and runaway youths, who have become more susceptible to trafficking, so we need to increase our federal efforts to assist them,” said Representative Bacon. “Our bill will provide agencies with the means to support youth who are in vulnerable positions and give them resources to address these problems.”“Every child has a basic right to feel safe and secure, and reducing youth homelessness is a key part of that equation,” said Senator Leahy. “The Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act reauthorizes vital grant programs that communities across the country rely on to prevent and respond to youth homelessness. These programs fund incredibly important work and save lives.  As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee I have prioritized addressing youth homelessness, and I hope we can unanimously reauthorize this legislation.”“Our bipartisan bill would support those young people who run away, are forced out of their homes, or are disconnected from their families,” said Senator Collins. “A caring and safe place to sleep, eat, grow, study, and develop is critical for all young people. The programs reauthorized and modernized through this legislation help extend those basic services to the most vulnerable youth in our communities.”The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act would:The legislation is supported by youth advocacy organizations including the National Network for Youth, which has supported the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act since it was first enacted in 1974. # # # # #  "

The EDA investment will be matched with $1.5 million in state and local funds and is expected to create 362 jobs and generate $15 million in private investment, according to grantee estimates.  “The Biden Administration is committed to creating new opportunities for workers throughout the United States,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This EDA investment will provide the water and sewer system capacity that businesses in Franklin County need to grow and create new jobs in the region.” “The Economic Development Administration is pleased to support Franklin County as it works to diversify and grow the region’s economy,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “This project will provide critical infrastructure upgrades that are needed to spur business growth and job creation in Vermont.”“Investing in water and sewer infrastructure has been a top priority for my Administration with funds received from the American Rescue Plan Act,” said Governor Phil Scott. “That’s because it unlocks many economic opportunities and other benefits. These fund for the Franklin County State Airport will be incredibly beneficial, opening up prospects for further investment and job growth in the region. I want to thank Secretary Raimondo, the Biden Administration, our congressional delegation and our many state and local partners for their contributions to these efforts.”“I am very pleased to see Highgate and Swanton receive this funding,” said Senator Patrick Leahy. “Access to water and to appropriate wastewater treatment are keys that unlock economic development.  Together with the improvements at the Franklin County Airport, this project will provide both communities with the ability to support new businesses, especially when combined with workforce training and development that will take place right in Highgate.”“Expanding water and sewer capacity is key to helping preserve and create local jobs, while also protecting our watershed and natural resources,” said Senator Bernie Sanders. “This federal grant funding for the communities of Highgate and Swanton will mean more Vermonters will be able to live, work, and train closer to home without compromising the safety of their drinking water or creating financial hardship for these rural towns.”“This project is a boost for Vermonters in Franklin County and beyond,” said Congressman Peter Welch (VT-01). “By investing in local water and sewer service, we can create jobs, improve local infrastructure, and help our economy. That’s huge for our communities and for Vermont’s future. I’d like to thank the EDA and local officials in Franklin County for all the work they’ve done to bring this critical funding to Vermont.”About the U.S. Economic Development Administration (www.eda.gov) The mission of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) is to lead the federal economic development agenda by promoting competitiveness and preparing the nation’s regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy.

Welch. “This grant will ensure Shelburne Farms can continue their important work and help preserve the unique cultural and historical significance of the Coach Barn for generations to come.” # # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-shireen-abu-akleh,"Mr. LEAHY.  On May 19th, I echoed Secretary of State Blinken’s call for an “independent, credible investigation” of the violent death of widely respected Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.  At that time, several Members of Congress called for the FBI to be involved, as did I.  That would be customary and appropriate after a tragedy like this involving a prominent American killed overseas under questionable circumstances.Secretary Blinken later said, and I agree, that “[w]hen that investigation happens, we will follow the facts, wherever they lead.  It's as straightforward as that.”Unfortunately, there has been no independent, credible investigation.  Two weeks ago, without providing any details, the Israeli government, after first blaming the Palestinians for Ms. Abu Akleh’s death, stated that she was likely shot, by mistake, by an unnamed Israeli soldier.  The State Department has concluded that gunfire from Israeli Defense Force (IDF) positions was likely responsible, but that there was “no evidence to indicate her killing was intentional.”  The Department acknowledges that conclusion was not the result of an investigation, but rather a review of information provided by the IDF and the Palestinian Authority (PA).  We are told that “the Administration continues to believe that cooperation among Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC) is the best path to support a thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation.”   No one can credibly think that the PA, which does not have access to the IDF soldier who likely fired the bullet that killed Ms. Abu Akleh or to other IDF personnel who may have information about it, or Israel which has a history of investigations of shootings by IDF soldiers that rarely result in accountability, can be completely relied on to determine and make public all the facts of what happened in this case.  The USSC, echoing the conclusion of the IDF, apparently did not interview any of the IDF soldiers or any other witnesses.  To say that fatally shooting an unarmed person, and in this case one with PRESS written in bold letters on her clothing, was not intentional, without providing any evidence to support that conclusion, calls into question the State Department’s commitment to an independent, credible investigation and to “follow the facts”. More than three months later, key questions remain unanswered:Other than reviewing the investigations conducted by the IDF and the PA, did the USSC review any of the evidence collected from other investigations, including those conducted by The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, the Associated Press, or the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights? If so, which of those other investigations did the USSC review and what conclusions, if any, did the USSC reach with respect to those investigations?What specific evidence led to the USSC’s conclusion “that there is no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances?”What were the “tragic circumstances” the USSC was referring to?If the soldier who fired the fatal shot did not intend to kill Ms. Abu Akleh, what did he intend? If, as the Israeli authorities appear to be saying, the soldier missed who he was aiming at and hit Ms. Abu Akleh by mistake, who was he aiming at?  What evidence is there, if any, that anyone in the immediate vicinity of where Ms. Abu Akleh was shot was firing at the IDF soldier who killed her?What steps will the State Department take to ensure the independent, credible investigation the Secretary, and many others, have called for?What steps has the State Department taken to determine whether the Leahy Law applies in this case?On July 5th, the Department spokesperson said “we would want to see accountability in any case of a wrongful death. That would especially – and is especially the case in the wrongful death of an American citizen, as was Shireen Abu Akleh.”  What steps does the Department plan to take to ensure such accountability?I have also urged Israeli authorities to discipline those who were responsible for, and participated in, the chaos that erupted during Ms. Abu Akleh’s funeral procession, when Israeli police needlessly beat mourners with batons, including the pallbearers, causing them to momentarily drop one end of the casket.  Has anything been done?   There is an increasing foreboding that, as in so many other cases and like the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, there will never be the independent, credible investigation and accountability that Ms. Abu Akleh’s family, the Secretary of State, I, and others have called for.  That would further jeopardize the safety of journalists everywhere who courageously risk their lives to inform the public.  An independent, credible investigation – meaning not by the IDF and not by the PA – but with their full cooperation, must be conducted and the findings made public.  Whether her killing was intentional, reckless, or a tragic mistake, there must be accountability.  And if it was intentional, and if no one is held accountable, then the Leahy Law must be applied.# # # # #"

I applaud efforts by the Biden administration, our Quad partners, and the IMF in providing critical humanitarian and economic assistance, and affirm my commitment to continue to work with my colleagues to advance stability and prosperity in Sri Lanka and the broader region.”“After decades of conflict, political mismanagement, and unaddressed inequalities, the Sri Lankan people have made it clear they aspire for something better,” Senator Durbin said.  “Introduction of today’s resolution shows that the U.S. Senate stands with peaceful democratic efforts to address these long neglected challenges.”“The Rajapaksa family enriched themselves at the expense of the Sri Lankan people, ruthlessly silencing their opponents, inciting ethnic tensions, and leaving the country an economic shambles,” Senator Leahy said. “After years of civil war and government mismanagement and abuse, Sri Lanka needs a government that is committed to ethnic tolerance, equitable economic development, human rights, and justice.  That should also be the focus of U.S. policy.”“The Sri Lankan people have sent a firm message that they want their government to address the dire economic and humanitarian crises that are afflicting their country,” Senator Booker said. “I stand with the Sri Lankan people and support their peaceful efforts to address their needs. Furthermore, the international community must continue to push for justice, transparency, and accountability for human rights violations committed during the civil war to help the people of Sri Lanka move forward.”While commending the Biden administration and other Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) members’ support for Sri Lanka, the resolution calls on the UN Human Rights Council to extend its war crimes accountability resolution; urges Sri Lankan security forces to respect Sri Lankans’ rights to protest peacefully; and presses President Ranil Wickremesinghe to work with opposition parties and ethnic minority groups in efforts to address the crisis.Find a copy of the resolution HERE.###"

Thursday introduced the Nulhegan River and Paul Stream Wild and Scenic River Study Act to begin the process of possibly designating segments of these waterways as part of the National Wild and Scenic River system. Vermont Congressman Peter Welch (D-Vt.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The Wild and Scenic Rivers System, overseen by the National Park Service, preserves rivers with outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational values for future and present generations.  The National Park Service works with local partners to study the river and if a river is designated, the Park Service provides annual federal funding for river restoration, recreation enhancements, and community projects. The “study” bill will authorize the National Park Service to work with local landowners and community members to assess the condition of the river, how it is used and the possible benefits of a Wild and Scenic designation.  Once completed, designation would be possible through future legislation.     In 2007, Leahy, Sanders and Welch worked together to designate the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers in Vermont as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and earlier this year co-sponsored a study bill, led by Senator Markey, for a segment of the Deerfield River in southern Vermont and Massachusetts.   Leahy said:  “The Nulhegan River is a gem of the Northeast Kingdom.  Through this legislation I am asking the National Park service to support the efforts of local partners, land owners and communities to study the possible benefits of joining the National Wild and Scenic river system.”Welch said:  “Vermont’s wild places are essential to the ecology, history, and economy of our region. They must be protected. This legislation asks that local communities and the National Park Service work together to consider the benefits of joining the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Together, we can find the best way to protect natural spaces like the Nulhegan River for generations to come.”Sanders said:  “We must protect the Nulhegan River.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to add the river to the Wild and Scenic River system so that it can be preserved for our children and grandchildren.”Legislative text for the Nulhegan River and Paul Stream Wild and Scenic River Study Act is available HERE. # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-of-senator-leahy-hearing-on-oversight-of-the-us-copyright-office,"Billions of people around the world are inspired daily by art—music, film, photography, theater, books, and more.  Art can make us laugh and cry, entertain us, and reflect the human condition.  Art can rouse us to take action against injustice and cause us to acknowledge our shared humanity.  It can be powerful, beautiful, and enlightening.From the very beginning of the Republic, our Founders anticipated the importance of rewarding artists for their hard work.  The Constitution, our foundational document, includes an intellectual property clause to make certain that artists and creators can reap the benefits of their creations and make a living from their work.  Without their work, life would be barren and dry.  We need art.  Throughout my 48 years in the Senate, I have kept a steadfast focus on copyright law for just this reason.  Those 48 years have been exciting and fulfilling.  Working together—Congress, the Copyright Office, creators, and the public—we have found incredible success.  We set the fundamental copyright rules of the road for the internet in the late 1990’s with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  A decade later, we created the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator to empower an expert to address copyright theft and have support from within the White House.  And in the years since, we have worked closely with the Copyright Office to address copyright issues large and small.The rise of the internet in the last few decades has led to unprecedented opportunities for creators to achieve recognition; some of their art may have never been discovered but for the internet. And the internet has allowed consumers to consume art that they want—not what is filtered or curated for them by middlemen who may not share their preferences. In that sense, the internet has deeply enriched our country and our artistic world.  Unfortunately, the internet has also brought fundamental new challenges for creators.  Copyright theft and even large-scale piracy online is quick, easy, and rampant.  This theft threatens an untold number of artists and serves as a deterrent to those who want to share their art with the world. That means we are not achieving our artistic potential as a nation.Register Perlmutter, thank you for coming today, and congratulations on your appointment to lead the Copyright Office and your work so far.  I look forward to this hearing, the first oversight hearing of the Copyright Office since 2019.  I have enjoyed working with you and look forward to continuing our work to protect American creators.  This Congress, Ranking Member Tillis and I have kept a sharp eye on online copyright theft and on ways to address it. This Congress, we have overseen the implementation of the CASE Act, a bill I cosponsored in 2020 that allows creators to inexpensively file and resolve small copyright infringement claims in front of the experts at the Copyright Claims Board.  Now that the Copyright Claims Board is open for business, I am excited to help the process reach its full potential in protecting American creators.We have also worked with your office to update the Digital Millennium Copyright Act so we can address online copyright theft.  We want platforms that allow users to share copyrighted material to take basic steps, ensuring that creators are getting paid when their material is distributed.  That means implementing technical measures like fingerprinting to flag copyrighted material.  I very much appreciate your work with the copyright community to find ways to make sure platforms are adopting reasonable technical solutions, and I want your office to have the appropriate resources, including a Chief Technology Officer, to research and understand the technological complexity involved.  I am excited to work with your office and the public to ensure that these solutions get adopted.Beyond these important efforts, there is more work to be done.  Ranking Member Tillis and I continue to work with the public to figure out solutions to online piracy problems.  I want to especially thank Ranking Member Tillis and his staff for their tireless work on the issue.  I also want to pass our PEACE Through Music Diplomacy Act, which formalizes a program to support music-related exchange programs.  Diplomacy through music is yet another way that artists support the rest of us, and we should support them.  And we continue to work with your office and the public to make sure royalties set by the Copyright Royalty Board are fair to everyone involved.  I have always supported fair royalties for musicians and artists whose works are played publicly, and that important work continues.As I reflect upon my tenure in the Senate, one of the most important causes I have taken up is protecting the rights of artists who make our world a richer, more humane place. Collaboration between Congress, the Copyright Office, creators, and the rest of the public is essential to making sure the copyright system works for both creators and consumers.  I hope that collaboration continues long beyond my time here in the Senate.  Thank you for your collaboration over the last few years, Register Perlmutter.  I look forward to working with you today and the rest of this year, and I eagerly anticipate seeing you carry this important work forward in the coming years.  I look forward to your testimony.# # # # #"

And below that is Leahy’s prepared text. VIDEO LINK:  https://www.youtube.com/StateDeptSenator Patrick Leahy Remarks Department of State 2022 Leahy Law ConferenceSeptember 6, 2022  Thank you Wendy, and thank you to the Department of State for convening this discussion. The fact that we are doing this is significant in and of itself.  Twenty-five years ago, when I wrote what later become known as the Leahy Law, I don’t think anyone expected that it would attract so much interest and attention – not just in this country but around the world.  Back then, as many of you know, there were provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act that cut off aid to countries where there was a “consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights.” But those laws, although still on the books, have not been enforced.  Not by Democratic or Republican administrations.  Instead, successive U.S. governments were financing military death squads in Latin America that routinely captured, tortured, and killed critics of the government, whether members of opposition political parties, journalists, social activists, academics, or priests.Latin America was not an aberration.  The security forces of many countries, including some of our allies and partners, and UN peacekeepers, have long committed abuses with impunity.The Leahy Law – and as you know there is a State Department version and a Defense Department version – is designed with two purposes in mind:  to help prevent U.S. complicity in human rights abuses by foreign security forces, and to encourage accountability when abuses occur.    Consider the alternative:   Providing guns, bullets, uniforms, and other equipment and training, paid for by American taxpayers, to foreign military and police forces who commit the worst crimes, even though their governments are doing nothing about it, or actively covering it up.Even critics of the Leahy Law acknowledge that is unacceptable. The challenge has always been how to apply the law to achieve what some may regard as competing or even incompatible national interests, but which I believe are complementary. If we rightly condemn ISIS for summarily executing prisoners, should we not also condemn the Iraqi military, which we support, when its soldiers brutally torture prisoners? It is a crime when Islamic Jihad targets civilians, but not when Egyptian soldiers shoot unarmed protesters?I think the answer is obvious.When we partner with foreign security forces we automatically become involved in the internal affairs of their countries.  The way those forces act and are perceived by their own people reflects – positively, or negatively – on us.  When our partners, trained or equipped by us, commit abuses, we are complicit – or we are perceived to be complicit – in the predatory and abusive acts that erode the legitimacy of those forces.I think most people understand this. To accomplish what we intend, the Leahy Law has been amended multiple times.  One example was just two years ago, when I learned that the State Department was essentially not applying the Law to governments that are among the largest recipients of U.S. military aid.  We were providing weapons, ammunition, armored personnel carriers, and other items in bulk, without knowing which units would receive them. If you don’t know which units receive the equipment, how do you know if they are eligible – or ineligible – under the Leahy Law?  It created a gaping loophole in the Law. There are many other examples, when different administrations have tried to circumvent or minimize the application of the Law, like when the term “assistance” was, for years, construed by the State and Defense Departments to only mean training, not equipment.  That was a clear violation of the letter and spirit of the Law, and it was necessary to amend it to make clear what should never have been in doubt.Another example is defining which factors should be considered when determining whether information is “credible”, for purposes of the Law.  For example, we learned of cases when the fact that a source of information had been critical of U.S. policy was used as the sole reason to reject the information as not credible. Or instances when the fact that the Administration was not able to independently verify the information was the sole reason for rejecting it.  Nowhere does the Law say this, nor would it logically be interpreted that way by someone genuinely interested in enforcing the Law.  So we are amending it, once again, to clarify what should never have been in doubt. # # # # # The Leahy Law intends to make clear that the United States will not tolerate or support foreign partners who violate the personal integrity, dignity, or rights of their citizens.  People who order, commit, or cover up such crimes should be prosecuted and punished. The Law also intends that those who use torture or shoot prisoners for reasons of political expediency, or because local justice systems are slow or inefficient, will not receive U.S. support.That is what the Law requires when a foreign government rejects the need to hold perpetrators accountable. But that is not the result we want.  We want to help build professional, disciplined, transparent, and accountable security forces who are suitable partners for the United States. We can do that not by treating them as if they are above the law – as we too often have done – but by providing an incentive to be accountable to the law. We need military partners who are both capable and accountable – who respect the rule of law, defend the rights of citizens, and build stability in their countries. That is why the Leahy Law is not in conflict with the strategic, security goal of “building partner capacity”.  To the contrary – the Law represents a convergence of our respect for human rights and the rule of law, and our other national security interests.  As a former prosecutor, I know the importance of accountability.  If our partners want to stop extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, and forced disappearances – which are crimes in virtually every country, they need to demonstrate that perpetrators will be punished.That often requires fundamental reform of judicial procedures and institutions, which takes time.  The Law does not prescribe how accountability should be administered in every case, nor do we have unrealistic expectations for countries where the judicial system barely functions.  We are looking for the political will to stop impunity, provide the right incentives, and by doing so send a positive message to the citizens of those countries.Disciplinary procedures and credible justice systems distinguish professional soldiers and police from criminals.  Accountability builds the public trust and support that security forces need to counter terrorism and prevent other violent crimes. # # # # # That is why the Leahy Law emphasizes remediation.  U.S. officials – civilian and military – in Washington, at our embassies, and at the combatant commands, should look for opportunities to assist their foreign partners in remediating units of security forces that have violated human rights.Unfortunately, this is another area where, for the most part, successive U.S. administrations have failed to apply the Leahy Law as intended.  With rare exceptions, if a unit is deemed ineligible under the Law, that is the end of the discussion.  The foreign government may not even be told why.  There has rarely been a sustained effort to encourage accountability, or to assist in that process, even though the Law explicitly requires the Secretary of State to assist governments in taking such steps.The law requires active diplomacy – “Leahy Law diplomacy.”  Civilian and military officials at foreign posts should regularly discuss with their partners when and why units have been deemed ineligible through the vetting process, and what steps the foreign government can and should take to remediate.  These are not often easy conversations, but they are necessary.I am in the final months before I retire from the Senate.  The Leahy Law is one of the things I am proudest of.  But I also know too well that laws are only words on paper.  What really matters is how they are interpreted and enforced. Despite the occasional naysayer who wants to waive the Leahy Law, or to make exceptions when the facts do not support it, or who thinks certain allies are beyond reproach, more and more people recognize that the Law is less about making accusations than about defending human rights wherever they are violated, and building lasting partnerships we can be proud of.A quarter of a century later, and thanks in part to many of you here, the Leahy Law is being applied far more effectively today than in the early years after I wrote it.  But it remains a work in progress, and your discussions here are part of that process. One issue that I hope you will consider is whether and how to extend the Leahy Law – either in statute or as a matter of policy – to units of foreign security forces that purchase training and equipment from the United States, not only to those that receive grant assistance.  There is no logical reason why the same human rights standard should not apply, whether a foreign government pays, or U.S. taxpayers pay.  # # # # # Despite the occasional bureaucratic inertia and resistance, I am confident the Leahy Law is here to stay.  More and more people recognize that it is less about pointing fingers than about building partnerships that are consistent with our values and our goals.They recognize that the alternative is indefensible – supporting abusive security forces that commit atrocities with impunity. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, and thank you for helping make the Leahy Law something we can all be proud of.                               # #

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-sanders-welch-and-scott-announce-58-million-in-northern-border-regional-commission-grants-for-14-vermont-communities,"(WEDNESDAY, Aug. 24, 2022) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) together with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Congressman Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Governor Phil Scott, and the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), announced Wednesday that 14 Vermont communities will be receiving a combined $5.8 million from NBRC’s State Economic and Infrastructure Development program.Leahy, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has long championed funding for the NBRC, securing funding increases in each of the past five fiscal years.  The NBRC supports economic development in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Maine.Leahy said:  “This current round of grants will once again bring federal dollars to help address real problems, including the need for housing and childcare.  These funds will build infrastructure to support future development, as well as workforce development and training.  This round of grants is an investment in our present and our future.”Sanders said:  “It is no secret that we are living in difficult times.  That is why it is especially important today to invest in our communities and ensure that Vermonters receive the resources they need.  This federal funding – the largest investment ever made in community-based projects – will do just that.  It will, among many things, expand health centers, create affordable housing, improve public lands and outdoor recreation trails, provide job training in critical fields like early childhood education and health care, and increase child care center capacity.  Simply, it will improve the lives of Vermonters all across our state, which is precisely what the federal government should be doing.”Welch said:  “From renovating a beloved community health center in Wells River to revitalizing local infrastructure in Winooski, this round of State Economic and Infrastructure Development awards invests in our communities at a record level.  I’m glad to have played a part in securing this essential funding with Senators Leahy and Sanders during the appropriations process.  And I’m grateful to the staff at the Northern Border Regional Commission for their leadership and to the Vermonters spearheading these important projects.  Together, we can keep working to expand economic opportunity, improve local infrastructure, and build healthier communities across Vermont.”Scott said:  “Vermont’s 2022 slate includes investments into 11 counties, the most geographically varied line-up in years.   These awards deploy millions to support economic and Infrastructure development — which are priorities for my Administration.  We look forward to the transformational impacts these investments will deliver in the coming years, and I thank Senator Leahy and our entire congressional delegation for their advocacy in Washington.”“This year’s State Economic and Infrastructure Development awards build upon the natural strengths of our region by investing a record $24.2 million dollars in community-centered projects across the Commission’s four states.  With investments in new trails and outdoor recreation infrastructure, workforce development and entrepreneurship programs, and basic water and wastewater infrastructure, these resources will grow economic opportunities for residents of the region” said NBRC Federal Co-Chair Chris Saunders.  “The Commission is particularly proud that this year’s slate of projects reach some of the smallest and most rural areas in New York and New England.”One of the recipients, Otter Creek Child Center, will receive $350,000 as part of an $829,000 renovation and expansion project. “Upon completion, the Community Childcare Expansion Project will increase childcare capacity in rural Addison County by adding 77 childcare slots in a modern, ADA-compliant facility,” said Linda January, executive director of Otter Creek Child Center.  “It is our hope that this project will galvanize the corporate, higher education, and non-profit sectors to collaborate in new and creative ways to create a model for the rest of the state of Vermont to address the chronic problem of child care capacity that impacts each sector.”A $460,020 grant to the Town of Hinesburg will help to pay for a $911,000 expansion of the town’s drinking water system, resulting in an 87 percent increase in capacity and allowing for the construction of 66 permanently affordable homes.  “The NBRC award will result in numerous benefits in Hinesburg and the region.  Locally, it will enable the town to double its drinking water capacity at a lower cost to its users.  Regionally, that additional capacity will help address the housing shortage because the significant amount of planned housing development in Hinesburg requires it,” said Hinesburg Town Manager Todd Odit.The remaining awards are:Bennington County Industrial Corporation - $350,000: Supports construction of 92,000 square feet of mixed use, energy efficient building, providing space for Southwestern Vermont Health Care (SVHC), retail spaces, and the creation of 63 new downtown households.

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-president-bidens-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-announcement,"(WEDNESDAY, Aug. 24, 2022) -- Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) released the following comments on the President’s announcement Wednesday on student loan debt forgiveness:“I commend the President for proposing a way to help people with student debt.  At home in Vermont, UVM for instance has recognized these challenges and refrained from tuition increases for the last four years while our state colleges strive to provide affordable access to higher education for Vermont’s students.  The cost of higher education has become unsustainable for most Americans.  Many find themselves saddled with high amounts of student loan debt.  Too often I hear from Vermonters who have taken out a second mortgage on their house or who are working at a second or third job to pay off their student loans.  I know that many have been working for years – and even decades – only to make a dent in the principal amount owed due to high interest rates.  It is heartbreaking to hear the stories of those who have put off important life decisions, such as having a child, because of their student loan debt.  This is a pervasive and unacceptable experience that Americans face in this country.”According to the White House, their three step plan for decreasing student debt for Americans is:“As a strong supporter of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, I am pleased to hear that the administration has revamped the PSLF program, which has already identified more than 100,000 borrowers eligible for $6.4 billion in loan relief.  Additionally, DOE is providing $7.8 billion in relief for more than 400,000 borrowers who have permanent disabilities and approving $2 billion in borrower defense claims to approximately 107,000 borrowers.  These changes also include approving $1.26 billion in closed school discharges for students of several colleges and universities that are now defunct.  Along with many, many Vermonters, I am encouraged by these changes and I believe that we must act to help address student debt in this country, and in a significant way.” # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/delegation-hails-increased-affordable-housing-production-resulting-from-new-biden-administration-guidance,"(THURSDAY, Aug. 11, 2022) - Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Representative Peter Welch (D-VT) applauded the Biden Administration’s announcement that it removed barriers to states and localities investing American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) dollars in new housing.The new guidance will make it easier to build affordable housing by allowing states and local governments to make long-term housing loans with ARPA funds. This change opens up access to Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, a key source of funding for affordable housing production. The change reflects the intent of the bi-partisan, bi-cameral LIFELINE Act introduced by Senators Leahy and Sanders in the Senate and cosponsored by Representative Welch in the House.Leahy, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said: “When Vermont’s affordable housing partners said there were significant barriers to using ARPA dollars for housing production, I knew something needed to change. Too many Vermonters struggle to find a home in their community that is safe and affordable. Allowing ARPA dollars to flow into building affordable housing as long-term loans will simplify the financing of affordable housing production and ultimately result in more homes for more Vermonters.”“Today, in Vermont and across the country, we are facing nothing short of a crisis in affordable housing,” said Sen. Sanders. “Parents can’t find an affordable place to raise their kids. Working people, older Vermonters, and people living on fixed incomes know they simply cannot afford food, heat, transportation, health care, prescription drugs, education, child care, and other basic human necessities when more than half of their income is going to pay rent or the mortgage. As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I was proud to pass the American Rescue Plan – one of the most significant pieces of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country – and to ensure that the U.S. Department of the Treasury released the funds from that law into our local communities as quickly and effectively as possible. It is great news that after a year of hard work, Treasury is taking new steps to enable these funds to be used for long-term loans for the construction of new affordable housing. This important change will go a long way in improving and creating new housing stock, which is absolutely critical if we are going to be successful in ensuring that every Vermonter has a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable place to call home.”Representative Welch said: “Far too many families in our state have struggled to find secure and affordable housing. This new guidance from Treasury will allow our state to use American Rescue Plan funding to build more affordable housing units across the state, making it easier for families to find housing that meets their needs, and curbing the affordable housing crisis. This is a critical step for folks in Vermont and across the United States. “  Nationwide, states and local governments have budgeted $4.2 billion through the ARPA State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund for affordable housing production and preservation. Vermont plans to invest $119 million in federal dollars received through APRA to build homes for Vermonters shut out of the state’s increasingly tight housing market. By loosening restrictions and allowing ARPA dollars to leverage tax credits, the new guidance will help to attract 30% more equity into affordable housing production resulting in over 150 additional homes produced for vulnerable Vermonters. Nationwide, this change, led by Vermont advocates and the State’s congressional delegation, will increase the number of homes built helping communities recover from pandemic shortages.  Gus Seelig, Executive Director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board that oversees the investment of the federal housing dollars, said: “Vermont and affordable housing developers across the country owe a great thanks to our congressional delegation for introducing the LIFELINE Act and working effectively with the Treasury to revise guidance to allow the efficient use of ARPA funds with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.  Vermont faces the most severe shortage of housing it has seen in the last 40 years. The additional capital raised will free up essential funding to build homes in communities across the state.”The LIFELINE Act (LIHTC Financing Enabling Long-term Investments in Neighborhood Excellence) was introduced in May by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Angus King (I-Maine), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). The bi-partisan, bi- cameral bill was introduced in the House by Alma Adams (D-NC-12) and David Rouzer (R-NC-7) and cosponsored by Representative Welch. The legislation was drafted in coordination with the Treasury Department and supported by ninety-seven housing stakeholders nationwide.

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-sanders-and-welch-applaud-over-34-million-in-us-dot-investments-in-three-vermont-infrastructure-projects,"(WEDNESDAY, Aug. 10, 2022) -- Senator Patrick Leahy (D), Senator Bernie Sanders (I), Representative Peter Welch (D) and state and local officials announced Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has awarded Vermont three Rebuilding American Infrastructure With Sustainability And Equity (RAISE) grants totaling $34,624,624 for Fiscal Year 2022.  The grants will support three projects in Vermont: replacing the Winooski River Bridge; construction of the Federal Street Multi-Modal Connector in St. Albans; and a planning grant to improve public transit in Northwestern Vermont. Senator Leahy said:  “These projects will help improve the daily lives of tens of thousands Vermonters.  It will make their commutes easier and make the roads safer as well as more bike-friendly. The infrastructure law provides rural communities like those in Vermont with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild and repair their roads and bridges.  Without these RAISE funds, it would take years, if not decades, for the State and localities to secure the funds necessary to move forward with these proposals.  I am delighted that these projects received Federal support and funding from the Department of Transportation.”Senator Sanders said: “It is good news that Vermont is receiving over $34 million for transportation projects statewide. Through upgrades to public transit, sidewalks, bike lanes, and our overall infrastructure, this funding will help Vermonters meet basic needs by improving their ability to travel to work and school, buy groceries, and access health care.”Congressman Welch said:  “These grants will fund essential projects across Vermont to alleviate congestion and create new opportunities for folks to bike and walk. That’s good for our environment, our health, and the wellbeing of our communities. I’m grateful to the folks at VTrans, local officials and advocates, and my fellow members of the Vermont Congressional delegation, whose hard work has helped bring this critical funding to Vermont and move these important projects forward.”Governor Phil Scott said: “RAISE grants play an important role in improving our state’s infrastructure and enhancing its resiliency. I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch for their advocacy on behalf of Vermont and their strong partnerships with the Vermont Agency of Transportation. These significant grants will go a long way for our state.”Vermont Secretary of Transportation Joe Flynn said: “The Vermont Agency of Transportation is excited to receive this RAISE grant for the replacement of the Winooski River Bridge between Winooski and Burlington. This grant will help to upgrade this critical connection, between two major cities, and provide much-needed multi-modal transportation infrastructure. We are grateful for our congressional delegation’s support of this project.”Winooski City Manager Elaine Wang said: “Winooski is thrilled to have this opportunity to improve the safety of this very important structure for our region.”St. Albans City Manager Dominic Cloud said: “This project has been over 20 years in the making. We’re delighted to have federal support to launch it from the drawing board onto the ground.”Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission Executive Director Charlie Baker said: “We are thankful to the delegation and USDOT for supporting smart growth development in Vermont. This effort will provide housing and transportation options, address climate change, and improve equity in our communities.”The RAISE grant for the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) will provide $24,800,000 to build the Winooski River Bridge, which connects the cities of Winooski and Burlington.  The project would replace the existing Main Street Bridge, which was built in 1929 and carries a daily average of 25,000 vehicles.  Currently, the narrow bridge is a major congestion point with inadequate sidewalks and no bike facilities.  The new, wider Winooski River Bridge would have barrier-separated, multi-use paths on both sides including bike lanes.  This new bridge will allow residents the choice of active, fuel-free, lower-cost and on-demand transportation, contributing to improved health and environmental outcomes.  The RAISE grant for the City of St. Albans will provide $7,724,624 to build the Federal Street Multi-Modal Connector. This project includes constructing a new roadway to improve connections between the Federal Street corridor and Interstate 89, as well as upgrading existing streets and making necessary traffic and multi-modal improvements.  This regional transportation project has been in the planning stages for decades. The RAISE Planning grant for the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission will provide $2,100,000 to develop a comprehensive plan for transit-oriented development for 12 communities across a five-county region in Northwest Vermont: Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Rutland, and Washington Counties.  The project will also support plans for improved bus services and/or commuter rail in the five-county region.The Vermont Congressional Delegation submitted letters of support for the VTrans’ RAISE Grant project and the City of St. Albans’ RAISE Grant project in April, 2022, which are available here and here.# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-passage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act,"“The Senate’s historic vote today represents a stark choice between two divergent views.  The first, that we must do all we can to help American families, our seniors, and our economy.  The second, that we should ignore the soaring costs of healthcare – and of particular prescription drugs – and the existential threats of climate change.  The choice could not be clearer, and yet it is mired in partisan politics.“Today the Senate advanced a once-in-a-generation bill to meaningfully address the real threats of climate change.  It addresses the exorbitant price of prescription drugs.  And, despite claims to the contrary, it is poised to reduce the deficit.  Does this bill address every crisis facing our country?  No.  Does it take substantial steps forward in meeting the greatest threat to future generations in climate change?  Yes.“Vermonters, and the American people, are tired of hearing ‘no, we can’t.’  Families today face real problems, real concerns, real questions.  In a democracy, the people govern.  And Vermonters, and the American people, want their government to work for them, not a government that remains gridlocked.  They want their government to be willing to face the real problems before us, not one that fails to address them.  They want a government that works, where positive change happens, steadily.  To do nothing means maintaining the status quo, rather than standing up to meet the real, and pressing, needs of American families today.“After a month away, I was proud to return to the United States Senate this weekend and cast many votes in support of the Inflation Reduction Act, and to vote for final passage.  It is time to say yes, and actually do something essential for the American people.  The time for speeches, pontificating, and showmanship is over.  It is time for action.  The Inflation Reduction Act is real action.  And action that is long overdue.” # # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-colombias-next-government-,"Mr. LEAHY.  On August 7, Colombia’s newly elected President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Marquez will begin their four year term.  Their election represents a sharp break from the past.The new government is inheriting every imaginable problem.  Regrettably, the country has made minimal progress since the signing of the 2016 Peace Accord that ended five decades of armed conflict with the FARC, and in some parts of the country narcotics-related violence is worse.  The previous government failed to make a dent in the number of assassinations of social leaders, or to hold members of the armed forces and police accountable for past atrocities.  Compounded by the public health and economic shocks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and a flood of Venezuelan refugees, Colombia remains a highly polarized society, divided between urban elites and the impoverished countryside.  It will take many years to reverse decades of deeply rooted neglect, discrimination, poverty, and lawlessness.Since 2020, the United States has invested more than $11 billion in a counter-drug strategy in Colombia that was never sustainable and has largely failed, as it has failed in Mexico and Central America.  As long as the demand for illegal drugs in this country remains high, the only solution in source countries like Colombia is a strategy based on sustainable social and economic development, a professional, accountable police force, and a judiciary that is independent, accessible, and that the people trust.Colombia has the advantage of being a democracy with exceptionally talented people and extraordinary geographic and biological diversity.  But if the underlying causes of conflict and poverty are not addressed, the country’s future stability is far from assured.  I urge the White House, the State Department, and the Defense Department against pursuing the same old failed strategies.  With a new government in Bogota, there is the chance to avoid repeating past mistakes and to measure progress not in the short term by the amount of money spent or the number of hectares of coca destroyed, but by long term investments in institutions and local communities.  The people of rural Colombia need our support, but not in the form of myopic approaches that have consistently failed to get at the root of the injustice, impunity, and inequality they have been struggling with for generations.The U.S. Congress will do its part to support a strategy designed by the Colombians that is not just more of the same, that is consistent with the Peace Accord, that has the support of civil society, and, most importantly, that has the support of rural Colombians who have paid the highest price of past policies that have failed them.   # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-need-for-peace-and-democracy-in-south-sudan,"Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Need for Peace and Democracy in South Sudan Congressional RecordAugust 6, 2022Mr. LEAHY. I have spoken twice this year about the despair and insecurity that are a daily reality for the people of South Sudan, despite independence eleven years ago that held so much promise and hope for that country.On January 6 and 31, I noted that the country’s independence was a result of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which took years of negotiations facilitated in part by the United States, Norway, and the United Kingdom. It provided a roadmap for political stability, economic development, respect for human rights, and justice. I further noted that since then, two former warlords, President Kiir and First Vice President Machar – who were never elected – have dominated the political landscape. It is they, throughout these formative years, who have had the executive power, and the responsibility, to turn the aspirations of independence into meaningful improvements in the lives of their people.Eleven years later the country is in a state of political paralysis and its people are coping with a widening humanitarian crisis, brought on by violence instigated by government security forces, severe flooding, skyrocketing fuel costs, and acute food shortages compounded by the war in Ukraine which was a major source of grain imports for South Sudan. Millions of people have been displaced from their homes by the fighting, flooding, and hunger.I will not take time today to recount the litany of failures of the Kiir-Machar government which I enumerated in January, and which have only worsened since then. Rather, I want to call the Senate’s attention to a Vatican mission of peace, unity, and reconciliationto South Sudan in early July. The visit by Cardinal Pietro Parolin came at a time when the country’s leaders are apparently, though not surprisingly, seeking to evade elections and extend their stay in office illegitimately, even though the peace agreement mandated that elections be held this December.Kiir and Machar have now proposed extending their unpopular authoritarian rule for three years without the consent of the people of South Sudan. The parliamentary faction of President Kiir has passed a political parties bill in which they have changed political parties’ registration requirements in order to limit those who could pose a serious challenge to their continued hold on power. The text of the bill that was negotiated and agreed to by the parties was changed by Kiir’s parliamentary caucus and rammed through the parliament despite boycott and serious objections from the other parties. All these actions provide sufficient evidence to suggest that President Kiir and Machar are determined to cling to power by any means necessary.It is no secret that President Kiir and his Deputy Machar have made the conditions for holding free and fair elections impossible, for all the reasons noted earlier. The country’s leaders have done nothing to prepare for elections, preferring instead to retain power by default. By fomenting civil unrest and violence and threatening and arresting their critics, they have transformed the peace agreement into a meaningless document. Rather than peace and prosperity, it has brought dictatorship, corruption, violence, and misery.As I said on January 31,The sad reality is that while the South Sudanese people won their independence from Sudan, they remain captives of the same ruthless and corrupt warlords who created so much ethnic conflict, bloodshed, and misery during the civil war and who have not been held accountable.They simply reinvented themselves as political leaders, with a stamp of legitimacy from the international community, while continuing to act like the warlords they are and always were.They have shown no interest in implementing the R-ARCSS or any other peace agreement.They have shown no interest in the welfare of their people.They have shown no interest in anything except holding onto power, avoiding justice, and enriching themselves.Real peace requires justice, and it requires respect for fundamental rights regardless of ethnicity, race, or religion. It requires free and fair elections, and equitable economic development. Cardinal Pietro Parolin conveyed a clear message to President Kiir and Vice President Machar. Their churches played an indispensable role in the international effort that culminated in the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and they too have a stake in its success. Above all, President Kiir and Vice President Machar should know that the world is watching.The ethnic and political violence, displacements, and destruction of villages and food stocks perpetrated against South Sudanese civilians in different parts of the country, including by forces loyal to them, must stop.The arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults and rape, forced disappearance, and killings of religious, civil society, and political leaders must stop, and justice done for the victims.Those currently detained arbitrarily must be released, including Kuel Aguer Kuel, the former Governor of Northern Bahr El-Ghazal,and Pastor Abraham Chol Maketh.The daily corruption in South Sudan, including illegal loans and growing debt burden that has impoverished the current and future generations, must end, and South Sudan must begin to feed and care for its own people from its existing resources, which are sufficient if used prudently.President Kiir and Riek Machar are responsible for the chronic hunger, insecurity, economic, and political crises in the country, and they have the power to bring peace and stability to South Sudan, which is a matter of urgent priority.But the country is certain to disintegrate further if Kiir and Machar continue to hold it hostage to their individual interests at the expense of the lives and livelihoods of the South Sudanese people. They must prepare to step down and allow the country to recover and rebuild from the ruins of their policies.I commend South Sudanese civil society and pro-democracy movements, such as the People’s Coalition for Civic Action (PCCA), for their efforts in creating awareness about the plight of the people of South Sudan and for their non-violent campaign for freedom and democracy. They have our support.Finally, I want to again urge the Biden Administration to listen to the people of South Sudan. I commend recent steps by the State Department to recognize the fallacy of continuing to support a failed peace agreement that South Sudan’s own leaders do not support, and I urge the European Union and Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) countries to take similar action. There is no point in admonishing two failed leaders to implement a peace agreement they have no intention of implementing. That is not a policy. It is a dead end.Instead, the Administration should join with other key governments and stakeholders in exploring the possibility of recreating a new political forum for South Sudan to address the challenge of the looming end of the transitional government, and the reality of the impracticality of conducting democratic elections in the current environment. Given the failure of the leaders of the current transitional government, it is unacceptable to extend its mandate. It should be brought to an end. I also urge the IGAD governments, particularly President Museveni of Uganda and President Uhuru Kenya of Kenya, and the other regional leaders, to face the fact that the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) they helped mediate has been sabotaged by South Sudan’s leaders. The time has come to do what is needed to help the South Sudanese people get back on a path to achieve their democratic aspirations and freedoms.South Sudan needs a new broad-based political dialogue that is inclusive of all political forces and civil society. This political dialogue, which many political parties and organizations have endorsed, should focus on peace and stability in South Sudan beyond the confines of power sharing, taking into account key provisions of the R-ARCSS, combined with the outcomes of the South Sudan National Dialogue. Such a broad-based political dialogue should aim at reaffirming a shared vision for South Sudan, and building consensus on political and constitutional matters, ending violence, saving lives, uniting the nation, and preparing for elections.The dialogue process should culminate in the establishment of an interim administration led by persons of consensus, technocrats, and individuals not politically aligned with the warring parties and not entangled in corruption and political violence. Such an administration should have a limited mandate to further political dialogue, rebuild public trust in government, strengthen the unified forces, deliver the Constitution, return the IDPs and refugees, conduct a census, and culminate in free and fair elections.The Biden Administration should articulate a new policy that reinvigorates U.S. engagement and supports peace, stability, and democracy in South Sudan. No one should be under any illusion that this can achieved quickly or easily. But without a competent or credible government to engage with, we must shift our focus to providing strong support to pro-democracy, non-violent organizations to create the grassroots pressure necessary for a genuine political dialogue to take place and build the foundation for a better future.# # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/tillis-and-leahy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-improve-patent-quality,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the Patent Examination and Quality Improvement Act of 2022, legislation to evaluate and improve the patent examination process and the overall quality of patents issued by the USPTO.This legislation would evaluate prior and current initiatives and pilot programs relating to the quality of patents. It would evaluate the need for greater clarity in terms of what constitutes patent quality, the setting of patent quality metrics, and how the quality of work product performed by patent examiners is measured within the office. The bill would evaluate the need for recording examiner interviews via audio files or automated transcriptions, how the assignment of patent applications to examiners is undertaken, and the creation of a group that looks at real-world circumstances and uses that information to perform targeted review of certain patent applications. Furthermore, the bill would also study any evidence of fraud in the patent application process and suggest avenues to address such fraud. “If the United States is going to continue to be the world’s leading innovation economy, then we have to first make sure our patent system is strong and instills confidence,” said Senator Tillis. “We only have strong patents when those patents are of the highest quality and meet all the requirements of patentability. I’m proud to introduce this measure with my good friend Senator Leahy to improve the quality of patent examinations and ensure that the USPTO issues strong patents. This legislation is a step further in continuing our work to strengthen our intellectual property rights.”“I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense legislation with Ranking Member Tillis,” said Senator Leahy. “This bill follows up on our hearing last year on patent quality, which put a spotlight on the fact that many U.S. patents represent brilliant inventions and drive our economy.  Unfortunately though, some are issued by mistake and can cause great expense for unsuspecting Americans and small businesses.  I look forward to advancing legislative solutions that will help make sure that the patents that are issued are valid and to continuing my work supporting American creators and innovators.” Background:For decades there has not been a major change to the time afforded to patent examiners for the examination of patent application, yet the nature of the technology from which these patent applications are derived and the complexity of this technology have only increased. In addition, the proliferation of prior art, which patent examiners must search for and review in order to make patentability determinations, has only increased and it has done so at a rapid pace. This complexity can and does lead to the necessity for patent examiners to raise more complex prior art rejections. And because of this patent examiners must be afforded the necessary amount of time so as to generate quality work products. This bill would require that not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act the Comptroller General of the U.S. submit to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and House the Committee on the Judiciary a report detailing this evaluation on patent examination improvement. Not later than 1 year after the date on which the Comptroller General of the U.S. submits their report the USPTO Director shall develop guidance for patent examiners focused on patent examination improvement. Finally, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act the USPTO Director, after soliciting public comment, shall submit to Congress a report that includes how the Office will improve the technical training of patent examiners with respect to emerging areas of technology, the status of office IT systems, a 5-year IT modernization plan, an accounting of the use by the office of advanced data science analytics and a 5-year modernization plan regarding advanced data science analytics, and finally how the result of the application of advanced data science analytics can be regularly shared with the public. ###  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/durbin-colleagues-continue-to-press-ice-on-overdose-of-solitary-confinement,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Alex Padilla (D-CA) today sent a second letter to Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tae D. Johnson regarding ICE’s overuse of solitary confinement in detention facilities. Today’s letter follows Acting Director Johnson’s response to the Senators’ February letter that sought answers on ICE’s use of solitary confinement, its failure to conduct adequate oversight, and the consequences for the health and safety of detainees.“[In February] We asked several questions related to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that identified widespread deficiencies in ICE’s oversight of the use of solitary confinement in its detention facilities.  Your response raises additional questions about ICE’s adherence to internal policies and apparent overuse of solitary confinement,” the Senators wrote.Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report on ICE’s use of solitary confinement. The OIG investigation exposed serious deficiencies in ICE’s oversight and adherence to internal policies, and revealed information suggesting that facilities excessively rely on the dangerous detention practice, which involves placing detainees in isolated holding cells for as long as 22 to 24 hours a day with limited human contact.In today’s letter, the Senators note that Acting Director Johnson’s response to their first letter failed to allay their concerns. They then continue to press Acting Director Johnson about the decision-making behind placing a detainee in solitary confinement and request additional information about ICE’s views on alternatives to solitary confinement.“Your letter described how ICE uses a record-keeping system to track the usage of solitary confinement for a subset of detainees once they are placed in solitary confinement but does not explain what, if anything, ICE does to consider alternatives ahead of time. You also promised a policy update that will better ensure that ICE’s record-keeping system tracks all detainees placed in solitary confinement, but you have not explained how ICE plans to ensure that alternatives to solitary confinement are in fact considered or what those alternatives are,” the Senators wrote.The Senators continued, “In response to our questions, your answers largely restate ICE’s pre-existing processes and reference the forthcoming policy update, which, to our knowledge, has still not been issued. Nor have you provided an adequate explanation of what steps ICE has taken or plans to take in order to address OIG’s findings.”The Senators ended their letter by requesting answers to questions on alternatives to solitary confinement, the impact solitary confinement has on detainees’ health, and what standards will be instituted to prevent the continued overuse of solitary confinement.Full text of today’s letter is available here and below: August 1, 2022Dear Acting Director Johnson:            We write regarding your March 21 response to our February 11 letter expressing concerns with the use of solitary confinement at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. We asked several questions related to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that identified widespread deficiencies in ICE’s oversight of the use of solitary confinement in its detention facilities.[1] Your response raises additional questions about ICE’s adherence to internal policies and apparent overuse of solitary confinement.             One of the most troubling aspects of OIG’s report was its inability to confirm—for a majority of cases—whether ICE considered alternatives to solitary confinement, even though ICE’s own policies make clear that placing detainees in solitary confinement “requires careful consideration of alternatives” and “should occur only when necessary.”[2] Your letter described how ICE uses a record-keeping system to track the usage of solitary confinement for a subset of detainees once they are placed in solitary confinement but does not explain what, if anything, ICE does to consider alternatives ahead of time.

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/durbin-warnock-senate-democrats-call-on-biden-administration-to-increase-the-rate-of-refugee-admissions,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA) today led 28 of their Senate Democratic colleagues in calling on the Biden Administration to work urgently to increase the rate of refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. In a letter to President Joe Biden, the Senators further urge the President to maintain or increase the target of 125,000 refugee admissions in FY 2023 and take meaningful steps to meet this target.“According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a record high of more than 89.3 million people, 42 percent of whom are children, were displaced at the end of 2021. The displaced population includes 27.1 million refugees,” the Senators wrote. “UNHCR estimates that in 2023 over two million refugees will need to be resettled. In our own region, Central America faces a growing refugee crisis, with more than 800,000 people who have sought refuge in neighboring nations or have been internally displaced… We urge your Administration to ensure that the United States scales up capacity to process refugees in these regions and across all nationalities with protection needs, particularly those who have been languishing in precarious situations awaiting resettlement, such as family reunification cases.”Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States resettled an average of more than 80,000 refugees per year, until the Trump Administration slashed the refugee admissions ceiling each year it was in office, ending at an historic low of just 15,000 for FY 2021. These drastic cuts have hobbled the resettlement infrastructure in this nation and made it difficult to quickly rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The U.S. resettled 11,411 refugees last fiscal year, the lowest figure since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.The Senators continued, “We commend you for recommitting the United States to its historic role as a global leader in refugee resettlement by setting a ceiling of 125,000 for FY 2022. However, we are deeply concerned that as of June 30, 2022, the United States has only resettled 15,100 refugees this fiscal year. Despite the challenges of rebuilding the USRAP that your Administration inherited, we can and must do better. The dismantling of programs by the Trump Administration has hindered our efforts to resettle more refugees, and as such, your Administration must take the necessary steps to promptly ensure the United States has a robust, functioning, durable refugee resettlement system.”The Senators concluded, “The success of [Operation Allies Welcome] and Uniting for Ukraine have proven that, under your leadership, our country is fully capable of bringing vulnerable displaced people to safety in the United States when you commit the government to doing so. We urge you to expeditiously and safely admit all qualified refugees who are waiting to be resettled. Additionally, we urge you to set a robust target for USRAP in FY2023 as soon as possible and devote sufficient resources to meet this target.”In addition to Durbin and Warnock, the letter was signed by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Angus King (I-ME), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tom Carper (D-DE), Tina Smith (D-MN), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Coons (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Michael Bennet (D-CO).The full text of the letter to President Biden is available here and below. August 1, 2022 Dear President Biden:We respectfully ask that you work urgently to increase the rate of refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. Furthermore, we urge you to maintain or increase the target of 125,000 refugee admissions in FY 2023 and take meaningful steps to meet this target.We applaud your Administration’s work to expeditiously bring to the United States 85,000 Afghan nationals, U.S. citizens, and lawful permanent residents through Operation Allies Welcome (OAW). Similarly, we commend your support for those displaced by Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine through the Uniting for Ukraine parole program, which has allowed Americans to welcome and support more than 20,000 people in just the first three months of its operation. The success of these initiatives demonstrates our government’s capacity to swiftly offer protection to vulnerable people fleeing war and persecution.According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a record high of more than 89.3 million people, 42 percent of whom are children, were displaced at the end of 2021. The displaced population includes 27.1 million refugees. UNHCR estimates that in 2023 over two million refugees will need to be resettled. In our own region, Central America faces a growing refugee crisis, with more than 800,000 people who have sought refuge in neighboring nations or have been internally displaced. Haiti is also facing a rapid decline in internal security and a compounding political, environmental, and humanitarian emergency. In West Africa, amidst an ongoing civil war, Cameroon is facing high levels of internal displacement, as well as receiving thousands of foreign refugees. These are just a few examples of the current refugee challenges around the world. We urge your Administration to ensure that the United States scales up capacity to process refugees in these regions and across all nationalities with protection needs, particularly those who have been languishing in precarious situations awaiting resettlement, such as family reunification cases.Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States resettled an average of more than 80,000 refugees per year, until the Trump Administration slashed the refugee admissions ceiling each year it was in office, ending at an historic low of just 15,000 for FY 2021. We understand that the Trump Administration’s drastic cuts to refugee admissions also hobbled the resettlement infrastructure in United States, with many refugee resettlement organizations closing offices and laying off employees.Combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing vacancies resulting from a yearlong hiring freeze at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services imposed by the previous Administration, these cuts have made it difficult to quickly rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Although you raised the refugee ceiling to 65,000 for FY 2021, the United States only resettled 11,411 refugees last fiscal year, the lowest figure since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.We commend you for recommitting the United States to its historic role as a global leader in refugee resettlement by setting a ceiling of 125,000 for FY 2022. However, we are deeply concerned that as of June 30, 2022, the United States has only resettled 15,100 refugees this fiscal year. Despite the challenges of rebuilding the USRAP that your Administration inherited, we can and must do better. The dismantling of programs by the Trump Administration has hindered our efforts to resettle more refugees, and as such, your Administration must take the necessary steps to promptly ensure the United States has a robust, functioning, durable refugee resettlement system.It is imperative that your Administration continue to invest in the sustainability of the refugee resettlement program. We appreciate the steps that your Administration has taken this fiscal year to rebuild the overseas and domestic infrastructure to ready the USRAP for higher arrival numbers. However, more work needs to be done so that we can restore and expand our nation’s capacity to welcome the most vulnerable refugees from around the world.The success of OAW and Uniting for Ukraine have proven that, under your leadership, our country is fully capable of bringing vulnerable displaced people to safety in the United States when you commit the government to doing so. We urge you to expeditiously and safely admit all qualified refugees who are waiting to be resettled. Additionally, we urge you to set a robust target for USRAP in FY2023 as soon as possible and devote sufficient resources to meet this target.Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your response.Sincerely,"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-announces-farm-to-school-funding-for-nofa-vt,"(MONDAY, Aug. 1, 2022) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt, Monday announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded $395,201 to the Vermont Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont (NOFA-VT) to support Farm to School initiatives across the state, including those getting local foods to childcare centers and preschools.“Feeding nutritious, local foods to our children has obvious benefits for both children and farmers,” said Leahy, chair of the Senate Appropriations and a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  “That is why I led the creation of the national Farm to School program. As is often the case, I was following where Vermonters were already leading the way.”Leahy authored the Farm to School program as part of the 2010 Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act, and has introduced legislation to reauthorize the program.“NOFA-VT will put this money to good use working with farmers to get the foods they are growing onto the breakfast and lunch trays of Vermont children of all ages,” Leahy added.""The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont is honored to be a recipient of an FY 2022 USDA Farm to School Grant,” said Helen Rortvedt Farm to School and Local Food Access Director for NOFA-VT.  “As we continue to grapple with the changing educational landscape and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, there is an emerging need to refocus and adapt certain Farm to School and early childhood activities across Vermont and the Northeast to better integrate and serve our farmers and producers.  With this grant, NOFA-VT, along with our project partners, will work to strengthen the effectiveness and impact of several timely initiatives in Vermont and the Northeast to get more local food into schools, strengthen market opportunities for local producers, such local food purchasing incentive programs, and get more kids out on farms.”NOFA-VT will use the funding to provide technical assistance to both farms and schools through the Local Food Purchasing Initiative.  NOFA-VT will also bring together groups doing similar work in New York and New England to share expertise.# # # # #     "

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-murray-coons-introduce-21-billion-emergency-supplemental-appropriations-bill-to-address-the-ongoing-covid-crisis-and-other-emerging-diseases,"WASHINGTON (Thursday, July 28, 2022) – Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Chairman Christopher Coons (D-Del.) Thursday introduced a $21 billion emergency supplemental funding bill to provide the necessary resources to prepare for the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to address other emerging diseases that pose a significant threat to public health.Leahy said: “For months, the alarm has been raised that we are insufficiently prepared for the next phase of this pandemic.  We lack the necessary resources to support testing, sustain supplies of therapeutics, and procure the next generation of vaccines that will be vital to finally ending this pandemic.  Our efforts to stop this disease abroad to protect us here at home are quickly running out of funding, and we are running out of time to act.  The need is urgent, and this emergency supplemental funding bill provides the necessary resources to prepare for the current and anticipated surge in cases this fall and winter, save lives, and support our efforts to stamp out this virus here and abroad.”Murray said: “It is so painfully clear that our nation, and our families, cannot afford for us to fall behind when it comes to fighting this pandemic. We have to make the investments needed to keep us ready, and keep us ahead of the challenges, surges, and variants we know are coming. This emergency funding will do just that by helping us get our communities more tests, treatments, and vaccines to fight this virus—and better ones that are more effective against new variants, easier to use, store, transport, and more. It will also support the global COVID response so our partners across the world can beat this virus abroad and keep it from spreading, mutating, and threatening families here at home. I have been making clear how important this is for months: our communities need this funding now—so let’s get it done.”Coons said: “Americans may want to be done with this virus, but it is clear that it isn’t done with us as COVID-19 hospitalizations rise once again. Until we get serious about fighting this disease not just here at home, but around the world, the pandemic will continue to destroy lives and livelihoods. This bill represents another crucial step forward in our efforts to fight COVID-19 so we can put this pandemic behind us and ensure we have the tools and resources needed to stop the next one before it starts.”The bill provides $16 billion in emergency funding through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF), including: The bill also provides $5 billion in emergency funding to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.For months, scientists, medical professionals, and global health experts have been sounding the alarm that without additional funding the United States will be woefully unprepared for an anticipated surge in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and potential death this fall and winter.  Some projections estimate that as many as 100 million Americans – nearly 1 in 3 – will be infected or re-infected in the coming months. Current vaccine supplies will only provide doses for 100 million Americans in the fall.  The Administration lacks sufficient funding to support the development and purchase of next-generation vaccines, which have the potential to offer broader protection against new and emerging variants and ultimately replace the need to develop new vaccines.  Supplies of monoclonal antibody treatments are expected to be exhausted within a month, and testing supplies have dwindled to little more than 300 million tests – far below the anticipated need of 1 billion to meet the demand as children return to school in the fall. Insufficient vaccination efforts abroad will only allow new variants to emerge and pose new threats to us here at home.  The U.S. Agency for International Development, which manages our global response to the COVID pandemic, will soon have no choice but to shut down vaccine delivery operations due to insufficient funding.  This would be a disastrous outcome as only 19 percent of people in low-income countries have received a single COVID-19 vaccine dose.  Inequities between lower and higher-income countries continue to cost lives and prolong the pandemic by increasing the threat posed by the emergence of new, potentially more dangerous, variants of the virus.The emergency funding provided in the bill will allow the Administration to procure the necessary tests, treatments and vaccines for the anticipated fall surge; invest in and purchase the next generation of vaccines and treatments; and support a global response to the pandemic that will keep us safer here at home. You can find Chairman Leahy’s last statement calling for new resources to respond to the pandemic here. # # # # #    "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/chairman-leahy-releases-fiscal-year-2023-senate-appropriations-bills,"WASHINGTON (Thursday, July 28, 2022) – Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Thursday released the Chairman’s mark of the 12 senate appropriations bills.  The nearly $1.7 trillion fiscal year 2023 appropriations package includes $653 billion in non-defense discretionary spending, a 10.1 percent increase over fiscal year 2022; $850 billion in defense discretionary spending, an 8.7 percent increase over fiscal year 2022 and consistent with the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed by the House; and $118.7 billion for VA medical care, a 22 percent increase over fiscal year 2022.  The package also includes $21 billion in emergency supplemental funding to provide the necessary resources to prepare for the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to address other emerging diseases that pose a significant threat to public health.Leahy said: “These bills are an investment in the American people that promote affordable housing, help families put food on the table, support the education and care of our children and young people, combat climate change, improve health care access, and invest in our communities.  It is my hope that by releasing these bills, and making clear what the priorities of Senate Democrats are, we can take a step closer toward reaching a bipartisan compromise after months of stalled negotiations.  The stakes of inaction are too high to not complete our work.  The burden of inflation would make a long-term continuing resolution untenable with grave consequences for communities and families across the country and for our national security.  It is my goal to finish our work before the end of the 117th Congress to avoid these consequences.  I look forward to continuing to work with my dear friend, Vice Chairman Shelby, and I encourage good faith, bipartisan negotiations on toplines to resume with the urgency that this moment requires.”Brief highlights of the package include:These investments and others advance important policy priorities and help American families with rising costs of living as a result of inflation.  It helps families put food on the table, make rent and mortgage payments, and reduces the cost of childcare and higher education.Enacting full year bills as soon as possible is imperative.  A long-term continuing resolution, which continues prior fiscal year funding levels, during the record inflationary pressures the country is currently experiencing would result in devastating cuts to programs that the American people rely on and for our national security.  For example, cost increases have decreased the purchasing power of LIHEAP and increased the cost burden on low-income families of heating and cooling their homes.  Food price increases have strained senior nutrition programs, which were already struggling under increased demand in the wake of the pandemic.  And the rise in the cost of labor and building materials reduced the purchasing power of HOME funds by an estimated 2,500 housing units.  Passing a continuing resolution does nothing to address these and other critical shortfalls.  The 12 bills released today meet these needs.A topline summary of all 12 bills prepared by the office of Chairman Leahy is available HERE.A summary of the emergency COVID supplemental is available HERE.Below are links to the legislative text, explanatory statement, and a summary for each of the Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations bills: Agriculture:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill Summary Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryDefense:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryEnergy and Water Development:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill Summary Financial Services and General Government:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryHomeland Security:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill Summary Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryLegislative Branch:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryMilitary Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill Summary State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill SummaryTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies:Bill Text Explanatory Statement Bill Summary# # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/adams-collins-leahy-maloney-rouzer-celebrate-8-billion-victory-for-affordable-housing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Alma Adams (D-NC), Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Susan Collins (R-ME), and Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) and David Rouzer (R-NC) announced their legislation, the LIFELINE Act, led to the publication of revised guidance by the Treasury Department that will unlock an additional $8 billion for affordable housing from the American Rescue Plan Act’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund.“Too many families in Charlotte, North Carolina, and across the country are suffering due to the housing crisis. The $8 billion in already-appropriated funds that this decision unlocks for affordable housing will be a lifeline for American families,” said Congresswoman Adams. “I want to thank our bipartisan co-leads for joining me on the LIFELINE Act and spurring the Treasury Department into action. This is a major win our community, for increasing housing stock and lowering the cost of housing for thousands of Americans and for our collective efforts to address the affordable housing crisis.” “Increasing the nation’s housing supply is essential to lowering shelter costs over the long-term,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Treasury continues to strongly encourage state and local governments to dedicate a portion of the historic funding available through President Biden’s American Rescue Plan toward building and rehabilitating affordable housing in their communities and the actions being announced today will make it even easier for them to do so. Treasury appreciates the partnership with housing advocates and Members of Congress, including those who co-sponsored the LINELINE Act, whose advocacy helped inform today’s announcement.”“A lack of affordable housing in many communities in Maine and across the country is causing significant hardships for countless families. Low Income Housing Tax Credits can be an important part of the solution by leveraging private investments to significantly expand the supply of affordable rental units,” said Senator Collins, Ranking Member of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee. “I am pleased that, following the introduction of our bill to remove red tape created by the American Rescue Plan and allow state and local governments to tap into the potential of this tax credit, Treasury has taken action to help more families find safe, affordable housing.” “In Vermont, there is simply not enough housing, and during the pandemic, we saw how this shortage has a detrimental impact on the lives of too many Vermonters. That is why we introduced the LIFELINE Act, to unlock the full potential of ARPA dollars to create much-needed housing. I applaud Treasury for implementing the changes proposed in LIFELINE.  Its new guidance, the result of a close partnership with Congress and housing practitioners, will direct additional dollars toward needed housing production and help ensure that families across Vermont and the country can live and thrive in safe, decent and affordable homes,” said Senator Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.“Families across New York and the country are feeling the ramifications of the housing crisis due to sky rocketing rents, limited affordable housing stock, and exorbitant housing related costs. The LIFELINE Act will provide a much needed $8 billion for affordable housing,” said Congresswoman Maloney, Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. “I am thrilled that - along with our bipartisan co-leads - we were successful in putting the necessary pressure on the Treasury Department to unlock these funds, which will serve as a lifeline for Americans who are struggling to get by as a result of the high cost of housing.""“Communities in Southeastern North Carolina, like many others around the country, are facing an affordable housing crisis. Rather than let unspent COVID-19 dollars languish in bureaucratic red-tape, I’m pleased the Treasury Department will implement common-sense provisions included in the bipartisan LIFELINE Act to allow cities, counties, and states to utilize funds that have already been allocated by Congress to support affordable housing developments across the country,” said Rep. Rouzer.“Representatives Adams, Maloney, and Rouzer’s and Senators Collins and Leahy’s tenacious leadership will get more affordable housing built in North Carolina and many other states,” said Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. “Treasury’s announcement today of a policy based on her legislation is indeed a lifeline for countless working families who will have more stable and affordable homes.”Additionally, the NCSHA wrote today, “The bipartisan leadership of Senators Leahy (D-VT) and Collins (R-ME) and Representatives Adams (D-NC) and Rouzer (R-NC) was also instrumental in the development of Treasury’s policy. NCSHA commends them for their sponsorship of the LIFELINE Act, which led to this game-changing announcement.”BackgroundEarlier this year, the Treasury Department issued a Final Rule pertaining to the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF), which was created by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). Per that rule, SLFRF dollars must be obligated by December 31, 2024 and expended by December 31, 2026.In February, the National Council of State Housing Agencies and other stakeholders wrote a “four corners” letter in which they remarked, “As of this month, approximately half of states and countless local governments have chosen or proposed to dedicate a portion of their SLFRF to affordable housing uses, including as a supplemental financing source in Housing Credit developments. We estimate current commitments to represent as much as $8 billion in potential affordable housing investment, and maybe more.”As a result of present economic conditions, the cost of developing housing units has risen significantly. Over 20 states have declared their intention to use SLFRF dollars to offset those costs and ensure that the pipeline of affordable housing units will remain robust; however, Treasury's original Final Rule presented an immediate and insurmountable barrier for states and localities wishing to do so. Because funds must be expended by 2026, states cannot continue to make LIHTC payments for the duration of previously negotiated contracts; nor can these funds be given immediately as grants without reducing the cost basis for developers and disincentivizing construction.In March, Adams, Rouzer, and Maloney introduced H.R. 7078, the LIHTC Financing Enabling Long-term Investment in Neighborhood Excellence Act or LIFELINE Act in the United States House of Representatives. The LIFELINE Act would make American Rescue Plan funds available for affordable housing developments receiving low-income housing tax credits. The LIFELINE Act, drafted in consultation with the Treasury Department, the authorizing committees for SLFRF, and housing stakeholders, provided the legislative solution required by deeming SLFRF dollars put towards housing credit development as considered expended in compliance with statutory requirements.The language inspired today’s guidance from the Treasury Department.In the House, the LIFELINE Act is cosponsored by Representatives Rouzer, Carolyn Maloney, Kildee, Pingree, Budd, Pappas, Dean, Stansbury, Lawson, Kuster, Cicilline, Omar, Carson, Norton, Krishnamoorthi, Cherfilus-McCormick, Clarke, Titus, Cole, Welch, Evans, Manning, Ross, Blunt Rochester, Torres, Cleaver, Williams, Sherman, Lynch, Auchincloss, Butterfield, Brown, Lee, Stanton, Bonamici, Fitzpatrick, Green, Lee, Langevin, O’Halleran, and Hudson.In the Senate, S.4181, the LIFELINE Act, is cosponsored by Senators Collins, Wyden, Bennet, Cortez Masto, King, Hassan, Padilla, Reed, Sanders, and Whitehouse.LIFELINE is endorsed by organizations including Ability Housing, Inc, Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition, Applegate & Thorne-Thomsen, AURA Development & Advisory, LLC, Beacon Hill Capital, BRIDGE Housing, CAHEC, California Council for Affordable Housing, CCIM Institute, Centrant Community Capital, Cinnaire, CohnReznick, Community Revitalization and Development Corporation, Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, Council of Development Finance Agencies, Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, Council of State Community Development Agencies, CREA, LLC, CSH, Dauby O'Connor & Zaleski, LLC, Denton Housing Authority, DreamKey Partners, Eden Housing, Enterprise Community Partners, Evernorth, First Community Housing, Greystone Affordable Development, Hawaii Housing Finance, LLC, HDC MidAtlantic, Holland & Knight LLP, Housing Advisory Group, Housing Partnership Network, Illinois Housing Council, Impact Development Partners LLC, Institute of Real Estate Management, Iowa Housing Partnership, KCG Companies, LLC, Kittle Property Group, Inc., Kutak Rock LLP, Lincoln Avenue Capital, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, Low Income Investment Fund, Marble Cliff Capital, Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation, Merchants Capital, Merritt Community Capital Corporation, Midwest Housing Equity Group, Mills Property Development, LLC, Mountain Plains Equity Group, National Apartment Association, National Association for County Community and Economic Development, National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, National Association of Counties, National Association of Home Builders, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, National Association of REALTORS®, National Association of State and Local Equity Funds, National Community Renaissance, National Council of State Housing Agencies, National Equity Fund, National Housing & Rehabilitation Association, National Housing Conference, National Housing Trust, National League of Cities, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Multifamily Housing Council, National Neighborworks Association, Nevada HAND, Inc, Nixon Peabody LLP, Novogradac, Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing, Pennrose, LLC, Pennsylvania Developers Council, Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, R4 Capital LLC, RBC Community Investments, LLC, Roof Above, St. Louis Equity Fund, Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future, Stonehenge Capital, The Community Builders Inc., The Michaels Organization, The NHP Foundation, United States Conference of Mayors, VCDC, and Wallick Communities.### "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-tenth-anniversary-of-the-massacre-at-ahuas-honduras,"Mr. LEAHY.  Ten years ago today a joint counter-narcotics team of Honduran security agents and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers opened fire on a water taxi as it approached Ahuas, a small town located in the remote Mosquitia region of northeastern Honduras.  The canoe-like taxi was carrying families traveling between the indigenous Miskito villages that populate the shores of the Patuca River when it was shot at repeatedly by the counter-narcotics officers, leaving two women, a teen-age boy and a 21 year-old man dead, and several other passengers injured.  While the Honduran police announced that a “successful” drug interdiction mission had taken place, journalists and human rights advocates reported the victims were unarmed and had no known links to drug trafficking. Instead of taking responsibility, assessing their mistakes, and examining their methods and partnerships with Honduran security forces, DEA and State Department officials obstructed U.S. and Honduran investigations of the incident and falsely reported to Members of Congress, including my staff, that the boat’s passengers had fired on security forces.  They also insisted that the DEA bore no responsibility for the discharging of weapons and had only played a supportive and advisory role during the mission.  After the horrifying events of May 11, 2012, the DEA continued joint operations using battlefield tactics in the area that resulted in two more fatal shootings.  Following one of these incidents, the Honduran police team leader was reported to have been instructed by his superiors to plant a weapon into evidence.It was only thanks to a joint Department of Justice and Department of State Inspector General Investigation report -- published five years ago -- that Congress was able to learn the truth about Ahuas and the two other fatal shootings.  DEA agents had in fact played a central, leading role in the lethal operation.  They had ordered a Honduran machine gunner to open fire on the water taxi and never verified whether DEA weapons had been discharged.  The DEA’s repeated assertions that someone on the boat had fired a weapon were found to not be credible.  As senior DEA officials obstructed the work of the Inspector Generals, it was not until five years after the Ahuas shooting that the victims were finally cleared of any wrongdoing.  But justice for the victims and their families remains elusive. Though the lives of those left behind have been shattered, some by debilitating injuries and others by the loss of parents and breadwinners, they have not received fair compensation and they have languished in dire poverty.  The wrongful actions that resulted in their injuries or the death of their loved ones have not been punished in any way.  Those who misled Congress, willfully concealing their agencies’ deadly errors, were not disciplined at all, and one senior official even received a promotion.  The U.S. Embassy and the DEA coordinated this operation with the Honduras’ National Police Director Juan Carlos Bonilla.  Today Bonilla is in custody after being extradited to the U.S., charged with ordering assassinations in support of drug traffickers protected by former President Juan Orlando Hernandez.In honor of these and other victims of deadly errors committed by U.S. counter-narcotics agents abroad, it is imperative that we hold ourselves and our institutions accountable, and that we recognize our mistakes and correct them.  If we claim to believe in justice and the rule of law, we cannnot allow Federal officials to misrepresent the facts and cover up their wrongdoing when reporting to Congress.   We must also provide support to victims of the so-called drug war, not stigmatize and slander them, and examine the impact that our approach to drug interdiction has on areas like the Moskitia.  It was obvious soon after the massacre that those who had directed and carried it out had minimal knowledge of the people and communities of that isolated area.  They rushed to judgment, assuming that anyone traveling that river, no matter how impoverished, must be in some way involved in trafficking drugs and therefore a legitimate target of lethal force.  Those who pay the price for militarized policing, and for the corruption and violence drug trafficking organizations use to protect their activities, are the most vulnerable: indigenous communities like Ahuas and the human rights activists who defend the rights of those caught in the crossfire. I wish I could say that the DEA and the State Department have learned the lessons of Ahuas.  But that will not be possible until those who fired on those innocent people and lied about it are brought to justice, and until the victims are properly compensated and cared for.  That is the shared responsibility of the U.S. and Honduran governments.# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/comment-on-the-womens-health-protection-act,"This is a debate about the Women’s Health Protection Act.  Protecting women’s health.  Protecting half America’s population in their right to seek the health care they require.  Protecting their ability, half of America, to make decisions about their own bodies.  How is this a question even up for debate?Today the Senate considers the Women’s Health Protection Act.  A woman’s right to make choices about her own body is a constitutional right.  It was affirmed by the Supreme Court nearly 50 years ago.  Polling – as if that should be the benchmark by which we legislate – shows that nearly two-out-of-three Americans believe the fundamental right established in 1973’s Roe vs. Wade should be upheld.  Yet here we are today – a body of 100, 76 percent of which are male – making decisions about the private lives of the nearly 168 million women in this country.  That’s ludicrous.The right of any woman to receive the health care they choose and seek should be important to each and every one of us.  Women – our mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, friends – they know what is best for them in their own lives.  How patronizing to suggest otherwise.  How patriarchal.  How insulting.  How dangerous.I am the dean of the Senate – I am the longest serving member of this body today.  I have worked for decades to support legislation that affirms a woman’s right to access comprehensive health care from a trusted provider without interference.  The right to comprehensive family planning resources – whatever those resources may be – is not only a fundamental right to privacy for these women, but it is an important public health policy as well.In 2019, the Vermont House and Senate by wide margins approved The Freedom of Choice Act, which guarantees the right to access safe abortion care in Vermont.  Governor Scott – a Republican – signed that bill into law in June 2019.  If the Court does overturn Roe, the Freedom of Choice Act would protect this health care right in Vermont, just as the Supreme Court case that was ahead of Roe vs. Wade, Beecher vs. Leahy, does the same. Once again, Vermont is a leader on an issue of national significance. The unfortunate reality is that 26 other states stand ready to ban abortion rights in the absence of Roe.  What are the women of these states to do?  And prominent Republican voices in the Senate even now say they would not rule out the possibility that a future Senate and Congress would overrule such state laws in Vermont and elsewhere, and impose a national ban on women’s choice.  And what laws are these states prepared to pass – what resources are they prepared to provide – to support these women, and the children they will bear?  The answer we know, and I fear, is none. States will determine what you do, but they won’t do anything to help you afterward.The implications of the Supreme Court’s opinion, should a final decision mirror the leaked draft, go far beyond reproductive rights.  For decades, the Supreme Court has stood as an independent arbiter in this country.  Striking down a constitutional right that has supported millions of Americans, not just women, will cause many to lose confidence in the integrity of our judicial system.  Worse still, it could threaten the rights protected under the precedent set by Roe and affirmed in other cases.  I acknowledge the fear that many are feeling right now about that possibility.  Certainly I hear it in my office. And that is why we need to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.What would the suffragists say of us today?  What would the icons of the civil rights movement say of us today?  A vote against the Women’s Health Protection Act is a vote against equality.  It’s a vote against women, plain and simple.  It’s a vote against the progress we have made to right the wrongs of inequality.  And it is at odds with what an overwhelming majority of the American public believes. It says in many states in this country, women will be treated differently than men.You know, my sons and grandsons can travel anywhere in the United States knowing the law is the same for them. My daughter and granddaughters, under this, would know they could not be treated the same as they travelled around the country. What does that say about America, that our sons and our grandsons will be treated differently than our daughters and our granddaughters? Our daughters and our granddaughters will be told by some states, you have less rights than your brothers or your fathers or your uncles.Shame on this Senate today.  I stand with women – my wife, my daughter, my granddaughters – when I say that I trust them to make the health decisions that are best for them.  And I will fight against any effort to erode those fundamental, constitutional rights. That’s what the Senate should do; that’s what we should do if we truly are going to be the conscience of the Nation.  That’s what this Vermonter intends to do. # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/reax-on-house-passage-of-the-emergency-supplemental-for-ukraine-and-global-food-aid,"After weeks of negotiations, I am glad that tonight the House passed the emergency supplemental funding bill to provide emergency humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.  Importantly, this supplemental also begins to address the escalating global hunger crisis that is trailing in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war.The bill provides $40.1 billion – $7.1 billion more than what the Administration requested – in critical military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.  This includes $8.5 billion in additional drawdown authority to continue to supply the Ukrainians with the necessary tools they need to defend themselves and more than $5 billion in global food aid.Although the horror being inflicted within Ukraine’s borders cannot be understated, this conflict will spark a far-ranging humanitarian crisis.  Tens of millions of tons of wheat, barley, maize and vegetable oil produced by Ukraine – one of the region’s breadbaskets – remains trapped in ports.  This will lead to rising prices and exacerbating an already escalating global hunger crisis.  This bill will go far in addressing these urgent needs.I am disappointed that the bill does not include desperately needed funding to address the ongoing COVID pandemic.  Without new funding, the Administration has repeatedly warned that we will not have the necessary vaccines, therapeutics, and tests to prepare for a surge in cases in the fall and into the winter.  Nor does it include essential assistance to provide vaccines and therapeutics to other countries.  We cannot allow complacency to be the enemy of progress in defeating this virus, and as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee I will continue to fight for these urgently needed resources in the coming weeks.However, the crisis in Ukraine needs our support without delay, and I strongly urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill as soon as possible. # # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/bipartisan-nopec-bill-backed-by-leahy-is-okd-by-the-senate-judiciary-committee,"WASHINGTON (THURSDAY, May 5, 2022) – Bipartisan legislation backed by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) to crack down on anticompetitive behavior by foreign oil producing nations advanced Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The bill now goes to the full Senate.The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, will let the federal government take action against price fixing by OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its partner nations. The bill is sponsored by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and cosponsored by Leahy and by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).  Their bill was approved in a strong vote of 17 to 4.  Leahy, a former chair and ranking member of the committee, led in developing and introducing earlier versions of the bill.Leahy said:  “This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that I have supported for years that would introduce much-needed competition into global energy markets and help keep energy prices in check for Americans.  The fact is, anticompetitive conduct by foreign oil-producing countries and organizations negatively impacts the daily lives of millions of Americans.  We need to combat that cartel behavior, and this bill would provide us with the tools to do so.  I am proud to again cosponsor this legislation, and that we have successfully advanced it out of the Judiciary Committee today.”NOPEC explicitly authorizes the Justice Department to bring lawsuits against oil cartel members for antitrust violations.  It would clarify that neither sovereign immunity nor the “Act of State” doctrine prevents a court from ruling on antitrust charges brought against foreign governments for engaging in illegal pricing, production and distribution of petroleum products.NOPEC has enjoyed the support across party lines, including then-Senator Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.  Grassley, Klobuchar, Lee and Leahy reintroduced NOPEC in 2021.Full text of the legislation is available HERE.# # # # #"

Governor Molly Gray (D), for the first such assembly since before the pandemic, to surprise U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) with an official resolution and to warmly express recognition of all he has done for Vermont during his 48 years of service in the U.S. Senate. Leahy late last year announced that this will be his last term, which ends next January.During his tenure, he may often have been physically in the Nation’s Capital, but “his heart was in Vermont,” said Scott, addressing the joint assembly.Scott’s remarks followed the unanimous adoption by the Vermont House of a resolution in Leahy’s honor.  A standing ovation followed the vote.  It was the first of many.Scott was followed to the podium by Gray, Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Becca Balint and House Speaker Jill Krowinski. They spoke of Leahy’s many accomplishments for the state, but also his kindness and compassion.Listing just some of the areas in which Vermont’s senior U.S. Senator has created programs that have benefited Vermont or brought needed funding to the state, including agriculture, clean water and transportation, Scott said, “The list of ways he has improved the state just goes on and on.”During the drafting of federal COVID-19 relief legislation, Leahy added a small state minimum that is bringing $2.5 billion dollars to the state, one billion of which is still to come. This has allowed the state to not only provide unprecedented assistance to Vermonters during the crisis, but also to make once in a generation investments in the state’s future.“It’s thanks to him we’re in a position to come out of this pandemic stronger than before,” Scott said.Scott, a Republican, said the greatly appreciates his friendship with Leahy, a Democrat, and mentioned their frequent conversations during the height of the pandemic.“Vermont would not be anywhere near what we are here today without Senator Leahy,” Scott said.Gray, who once interned for Leahy, spoke of his small acts of kindness and great acts of leadership.“He’s been there when we needed him most,” she said, pointing to the days and months following 9-11, Tropical Storm Irene and the pandemic. “My fellow Vermonters, where would we be today without the small-state minimum? Where would we be without $2.7 billion in federal funding? Where would we be today without Senator Leahy?”“The arms of the Leahy family reach not only across the state and country, but around the world,” Gray said, calling the Senator a global leader on human rights.Balint said that one of the Senator’s most important contributions is that “Senator Leahy really sees us as Vermonters and what we do and how we struggle.”When her wife was diagnosed with a form of cancer similar to what Leahy’s wife, Marcelle, has experienced, Balint said the Senator called to offer his support and share his experience.Leahy has sent thousands of personal notes to Vermonters over the years and called countless Vermonters experiencing grief or hardship.During discussion of immigration reform, Leahy pushed for recognition of same sex couples and allowing partners of gay and lesbian immigrants to join them in the U.S. “That means a lot, Senator,” Balint said. “That means a lot.”“Time and time again, Senator Leahy has seen us and stood up for us,” she said.Speaker Krowinski mentioned a little known part of Leahy’s public service, his time as an aide to a legislative draftsman for the General Assembly in 1965.Since then, she told the Senator, “You have blazed a trail.”That trail, she said, included restored buildings and revitalized downtowns.But he also showed Vermonters how to lead. “It’s about building relationships and being true to your values,” she said. “Senator Leahy always shows up when it really matters.”Krowinski also noted that Leahy’s work on behalf of Vermont would not have been possible without the support of Marcelle, long one of the state’s most beloved figures, bringing the assembly to its feet in recognition of her work on Vermont’s behalf.Taking the podium, Leahy spoke first of Marcelle, who knew of the planned event but kept it secret from him. They will celebrate their sixtieth anniversary later this year, and, he said, have few secrets from one another, but “she kept this one.”Having grown up in Montpelier he has a long connection to the State House itself. “Marcelle and I had our first date right across the street,” he said.As a youngster he would play in the State House, and he and a friend once careened into the governor’s office, where the governor gave them candy and sent them on their way.“I think of Vermont as a place where you can develop your conscience. I think of the Senate as a place that should be the conscience of the nation and sometimes is,” Leahy said. “I followed my conscience.”Even when that conscience led him to oppose the war in Vietnam, which at the time still had broad support in Vermont. Leahy voted against funding for the war in the House Armed Services Committee, trusting, he said, his fellow Vermonters.Visibly moved by the events of the day, Leahy’s voice broke as he concluded his remarks, saying, “This is one of the greatest thrills of my life. Thank you.”# # # # #   "

I have worked with Steve. He has an extraordinary set of skills and experiences that will allow him to excel as the Director of the ATF. Steve spent seven years as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, a position to which he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. He has proven in his 30-year career that he is a principled law enforcement official who knows how to tackle the toughest issues confronting the communities he is responsible for protecting.  The ATF is the federal law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing our nation’s gun laws, and it has had only one permanent director since 2006.  As we continue to deal with high levels of gun violence across the country, it is critical that the ATF have the leadership it needs to counteract gun violence and the illegal use and trafficking of firearms.I know from direct experience how qualified Steve is for this difficult assignment. He served on my Judiciary Committee staff as a detailee from the Department of Justice. In that capacity he provided  me with invaluable counsel on a wide range of criminal justice and law enforcement issues.I am confident that Steve will be an effective and fair-minded ATF Director who can offer the leadership that ATF needs and that our country deserves. I look forward to supporting his nomination in the Senate, and I will urge my fellow Senators to do the same. # # # # #"

In their letter, the Senators also push the Biden Administration to outline detailed steps the U.S. agency will take to support anticorruption efforts in Honduras.“As the Department of State plans for a U.S.-Honduras Strategic Dialogue, we write to express our support for U.S. efforts to engage with President Xiomara Castro’s administration on the importance of tackling endemic corruption in Honduras,” the Senators wrote. “In particular, we urge you to press the new Honduran government to take the concrete steps needed to restore Hondurans’ faith in their government.”Transparency International ranked Honduras 157 out of 180 countries on its 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index. For years, corruption in Honduras has led to increased irregular migration to the U.S. and a weakened economic environment that stalls the country’s potential for growth. In February 2022, President Xiomara Castro requested United Nations (UN) assistance to create the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH), an independent entity to combat corruption in Honduras — but more must be done.“In particular, we ask that the Department of State urge the Castro Administration, the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and the Honduran Congress to ensure the Commission has a strong mandate to root out corruption and impunity, receives the necessary funding to achieve its mission, endures beyond the current administration, and sufficiently consults with Honduran civil society organizations, who are key stakeholders in fighting corruption,” the Senators continued. “We also request your advocacy with the Honduran government to ensure the selection of an independent and well-qualified Commissioner. While President Castro’s request to the UN is an overall positive step, we recognize that significant and sustained efforts by her administration and the Honduran Congress will be critical to standing up the Commission and ensuring its long-term success.”As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Kaine has been deeply committed to cooperating with allies in Latin America to uphold the rule of law, address the root causes of migration, and enhance our partnerships in the region. In November 2021, Chairman Kaine held a SFRC subcommittee hearing on providing vaccines to Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the importance of U.S. engagement in the region. Additionally, Chairman Kaine and Ranking Member Rubio urged the Biden Administration to strongly advocate for a free, fair, and peaceful electoral process ahead of Honduras’ general election.The full text of the letter can be found here and below: Dear Secretary Blinken:As the Department of State plans for a U.S.-Honduras Strategic Dialogue, we write to express our support for U.S. efforts to engage with President Xiomara Castro’s administration on the importance of tackling endemic corruption in Honduras. In particular, we urge you to press the new Honduran government to take the concrete steps needed to restore Hondurans’ faith in their government.Transparency International recently ranked Honduras 157th out of 180 countries on its Corruption Perceptions Index. Corruption in Honduras has led to increased irregular migration to the United States, lack of accountability for violence committed against ordinary Hondurans, and a weakened economic environment that stalls Honduras’ potential for growth. Congress continues to provide robust assistance for Central America, including for anticorruption efforts, and we are pleased that the Biden Administration is prioritizing this issue with President Castro. Vice President Harris’s January visit to Honduras was President Castro’s first meeting with a foreign leader following her inauguration, and the Biden Administration’s announcement of over $1 billion in private sector investment in Honduras and the Central America region demonstrates U.S. commitment to the Honduran people.We welcome President Castro’s formal request to the United Nations in February 2022 calling for assistance to create the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH). We also recognize the Honduran Congress’s March 1 repeal of the Ley de Secretos, or State Secrets Law, which is an important step to promoting transparency within the Honduran government.We also applaud the Honduran government’s separate arrests of ex-President Juan Orlando Hernandez and former police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares for extradition to face drug trafficking charges here in the U.S. As you are well aware, strengthening the rule of law in Honduras, including by supporting an independent judiciary free from political influence, is important to ensuring that citizens have confidence in their government and that businesses can compete on a level playing field.We strongly urge you to work closely with the Castro Administration to ensure the incorporation of lessons learned from prior commissions. In particular, we ask that the Department of State urge the Castro Administration, the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and the Honduran Congress to ensure the Commission has a strong mandate to root out corruption and impunity, receives the necessary funding to achieve its mission, endures beyond the current administration, and sufficiently consults with Honduran civil society organizations, who are key stakeholders in fighting corruption. We also request your advocacy with the Honduran government to ensure the selection of an independent and well-qualified Commissioner. While President Castro’s request to the UN is an overall positive step, we recognize that significant and sustained efforts by her administration and the Honduran Congress will be critical to standing up the Commission and ensuring its long-term success.Establishing the necessary legislative framework to create and sustain the Commission and protecting the independence of key Honduran investigators, prosecutors, and judges will not be easy. Nonetheless, these steps are vital to empowering the Commission to confront the entrenched interests of corrupt actors backed by drug traffickers and criminal organizations. Given that the Commission’s activities are likely to elicit backlash and retribution, our collective support is imperative, especially when the Commission begins making substantive progress. Given the importance of these efforts, we request that the Department provide our offices with a briefing regarding specific actions the Biden Administration will take to sustain anticorruption efforts in Honduras following the Strategic Dialogue.Over the years, the United States has supported efforts to mitigate factors driving irregular migration from Honduras to the U.S., including through predecessor organizations such as the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, whose work led to the indictment of over 100 corrupt officials and the creation of anti-corruption courts that have strengthened the rule of law in Honduras. Today, we express our support for this new entity and urge the Department to help ensure that critical foundational steps are taken to guarantee its independence and effectiveness, especially ahead of next year’s Supreme Court and Attorney General selection processes. Each of these will be fundamental to promoting the rule of law and helping Honduran citizens find safety and opportunity in Honduras.Rampant corruption has been a longtime scourge in Honduras, holding back the dynamism of the Honduran people and impeding the country’s social, economic, and political development. We must seize this window of opportunity to make overdue progress on this critical issue.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely, ### "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-russian-landmines,"Mr. LEAHY.  Among the many barbaric atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine where civilian infrastructure including hospitals, schools, and apartment buildings have been repeatedly bombed and shelled and countless civilians have been summarily executed in the streets, The New York Times reports today that the Russians are using a new kind of landmine.This mine, called the POM-3, is inherently indiscriminate like other mines in that it cannot distinguish between a civilian and a combatant, and it is apparently equipped with a sensor that triggers the explosive when a person approaches.  With a kill radius of 50 feet, it is even more deadly than a typical anti-personnel mine.  And, unlike typical landmines, it cannot be disarmed by a human deminer because anyone who approaches it is likely to become a victim before reaching it.  So it will be necessary to use robots to clear these mines, at great additional time and expense.  As in other countries affected by armed conflict, it will be many years, and almost certainly decades after the fighting ends, before the people of Ukraine can walk safely without fear of mines and other unexploded ordnance.Human beings seem to have an unlimited capacity to devise new ways of destroying the lives of others.  Landmines are especially insidious, because they maim or kill whoever comes into contact with them, or, in the case of the POM-3, whosever’s footsteps it detects.  It could be anyone, including a young child. No matter how “sophisticated” the technology, mines are an exceedingly primitive weapon because they are designed to be indiscriminate in an age of so-called “precision” munitions.  Mines are the opposite.  While landmines are so easy to make that it will never be possible to completely eliminate them, in 1997 the international community took an historic step, thanks in large part to the leadership of former Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and the tireless advocacy of the International Campaign to Ban landmines. In December of that year, countries came together to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known informally as the Ottawa Treaty or the Mine Ban Treaty.  Today, the treaty has 164 states parties.  But one of the reasons anti-personnel mines have yet to be universally stigmatized is because key countries including Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and the United States have not joined the treaty. Of course, when one country joins a treaty it does not guarantee that others will.  But the more countries that do, the harder it is for others to fail to do so, as they become the outliers, the pariahs.  So if the United States, which has not used anti-personnel mines since 1991, were to join the treaty it would not guarantee that Russia would.  But it would greatly enhance our credibility to call out their use of mines, their devastating effects on innocent civilians, and the need to universalize the treaty. In 1994, President Clinton, at the United Nations, called for ridding the world of anti-personnel mines.  He also directed the Pentagon to develop alternatives.  They never did.  While we can drive a robot on Mars 100 million miles away, our own military continues to stockpile landmines that are triggered by the victim.  Whether a U.S. soldier or a child, our landmines, like Russian landmines, cannot tell the difference. If anything good can come of this catastrophic and senseless war in Ukraine, it would be for the international community to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes, and for the United States to once and for all renounce the use of anti-personnel landmines.  These are not weapons that belong in the arsenals of civilized nations, and certainly not in the arsenal of the most powerful, modern military on Earth.  Let us be the country that not only denounces their use in Ukraine, but denounces and renounces their use everywhere.  What a gift to the world that would be.I ask unanimous consent that The New York Times article entitled “New Russian Land Mine Poses Special Risk in Ukraine” be printed in the Record.# # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-confirmation-of-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-be-a-justice-of-the-united-states-supreme-court,"Today is an historic one.  Today, each member of the Senate will have the opportunity to cast a vote on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  Throughout our Nation’s history, only 115 people have served on the Supreme Court.  Until now, only five of them were women.  Only two of them have been Black.  And none of them has been a Black woman.History indeed.  And long overdue.But I will not cast my vote in support of Judge Jackson’s confirmation because she is a woman, or because she is Black.  I will cast that vote because she is eminently qualified to serve in the position to which she has been nominated.  Her nomination should not just be welcomed — it should be celebrated.  It is a major step forward for our democracy, further widening the lens to help make our Nation more inclusive and more representative with each passing generation.   She is one of the most qualified nominees to the Supreme Court that I have ever considered. A graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School.  A judicial clerk at the district, circuit and Supreme Court levels.  A Federal appellate judge, a Federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice.  And she will be the first ever Justice who has served as a public defender, bringing that much needed perspective to the Court.  No one — no one — can argue that Judge Jackson is not objectively qualified to be confirmed.The manufactured accusations that were thrown at her by some on our Committee during our hearings not only fell flat, but have been refuted and debunked by serious voices across the political spectrum.  They hold no water.  They serve only to showcase the vitriol, and contempt, with which some members of this body approach their sacred constitutional role of “advice and consent.”  I said it during the hearings, and I will say it again: it is distressing.  It is disheartening.  And as the Dean of the Senate, it is saddening.And yet, I find hope in the fact that Judge Jackson’s confirmation to our highest court will have the bipartisan support it deserves — that it commands.  I commend the Republican Senators who have lauded her qualifications and staked their support of her nomination. Judge Jackson has earned the President’s nomination.  And she has earned confirmation from the Senate.  Each and every day, millions of American families are living their lives.  And how they live those lives — from the salaries they make to the education their children receive and scores of issues in between — is directly impacted by the decisions made at the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court — and all of our courts — cannot be ivory towers, accessible only to, and bending to the will of, a select few in our society.  They must be accountable to all Americans.  And to do so, they must reflect the diversity of our nation — the diversity that is at the foundation of our democracy.  Diversity of gender, race, creed, education, and history. Diversity of thought and life experiences.  Judge Jackson brings that, and more, to the bench.I am the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and a former Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  I voted for the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court.  I voted for the first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.  I have voted on thousands of judicial nominations – nominees of both Republican and Democratic Presidents.  I have voted for nominees to the Supreme Court who were put forward by Republican Presidents.I have long lamented the increasing political gamesmanship that has infected our current confirmation process.  I have long warned about the dire consequences — for our courts, for our democracy — of converting our confirmation process into a zero sum game where one party wins and one party loses.  But to change that gamesmanship requires that we have some adults in the room.  That we all come here, to the floor of the United States Senate, not to score a headline or a trending tweet, but to simply do our jobs.  Who will do that today?I have taken a clear look at Judge Jackson’s record.  I heard her testimony two weeks ago.  I met with her.  I read opinions that she has written. I saw her intellect, humility, and temperament on full display.  She is the Justice we need now.  For Americans today, for the generations to come, for all of us — I will cast my vote to confirm Judge Jackson. I hope the Senate can rise to this moment, and be the deliberative body the Founders envisioned when they conceived of this great experiment.  Our independent judiciary and our democracy demand it of us.  And history will remember the votes cast here today. I will, proudly vote aye.# # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-landmine-awareness-day,"Mr. LEAHY.  Sixteen years ago the United Nations General Assembly designated April 4th as the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action.  Today I am introducing a Senate Resolution recognizing that designation and reaffirming United States leadership in eliminating landmines and unexploded ordnance.As we read the reports of withdrawing Russian troops leaving landmines to terrorize, maim, and kill Ukrainian civilians, we are reminded of the necessity to redouble our efforts to ban these insidious weapons once and for all.  The mines in Ukraine will remain a deadly hazard there long after the fighting ends, whenever that time comes.Landmines and other unexploded ordnance cause death and terrible injuries to people in dozens of countries – mostly places where the ability to provide life-saving medical care and long-term rehabilitation and vocational support is lacking or far from adequate.The United States continues to provide the largest share of demining assistance, and we spend many millions of dollars annually helping the survivors.  That is something we can be proud of. But in some countries, like Laos, the millions of cluster munitions that failed to detonate on contact were manufactured in the United States and dropped by American aircraft.  Fifty years later they continue to destroy innocent lives. So while the number of landmine and UXO casualties has fallen significantly since I and others first took on this issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we are not where we hoped to be back then.First, the Biden Administration needs to restore the policy on landmines that was put in place during the Obama Administration.  The White House said they would but it has not happened yet.  There is no excuse for delaying. Second, we need to continue to provide the funding for humanitarian demining and survivors assistance.  Fortunately, this is not a partisan issue.  It is simply a matter of continuing to treat it as a priority.And third, this is my last year in the Senate and while I will do everything I can while I am here, we need others to continue to advocate for the United States to sign the international treaties banning anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions.  It should have happened already, and we have to keep working until it does. I have seen first-hand the effects of landmines and other unexploded munitions.  It is horrific, especially when it’s a young child with a leg or an arm missing.  Or a parent blinded and crippled by a landmine, being led around by a child.   We should be the country that leads the world in ending not only the carnage of landmines and UXO left behind, but the production, export, use and stockpiling of these indiscriminate weapons that don’t belong in the arsenals of civilized nations.  # # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-bipartisan-agreement-for-additional-covid-aid,"I am glad that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to provide $10 billion in desperately needed funding to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Through great personal sacrifice by the American people, in particular our many brave healthcare workers, and an unprecedented mobilization of federal resources, we are slowly returning to a sense of “normal.”  But this pandemic is far from over.  This needed funding will allow us to purchase additional vaccines, testing, therapeutics and treatments like monoclonal antibodies as we brace for a potential surge in the coming months. However, I am deeply disappointed that this agreement does not provide any funding – none – to support a global vaccination campaign.  This virus originated half way around the world and it does not recognize national borders.  We ignore that fact at our peril.  In many countries the vaccination rate is under 15 percent, and the virus is running rampant.  In Europe, we are already seeing a surge from the even more contagious subvariant of Omicron, known as BA.2, which is now the dominant strain among new U.S. cases.  Doing nothing to slow the global spread of COVID-19 is foolhardy.  As the virus continues to mutate and wreak havoc overseas, more Americans will become sick and die.  In the coming weeks, I and others will be advocating for additional emergency funding to support our efforts abroad to end this pandemic and to address the looming food security crisis that is threatening the lives of millions of people in Afghanistan and multiple other countries.  I hope our Republican colleagues will join us.In the meantime, I strongly support this bipartisan agreement and urge its passage as soon as possible.# # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-senate-judiciary-committee-vote-to-advance-judge-ketanji-brown-jacksons-nomination-to-the-united-states-supreme-court,"Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee will undertake one of its most consequential duties: to consider and vote whether to advance a nominee to the United States Supreme Court.  Before us is a nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who embodies the highest ideals of our judiciary and the legal profession.  During the confirmation proceedings, she put on a master class about what it means to be an independent, fair-minded Justice.  Her grace, intellect, temperament and wit are exactly what Americans want — and deserve — on our nation’s highest court.  I will proudly and confidently vote aye to advance her historic nomination to the Senate Floor.This is my 21st Supreme Court confirmation process.  I have voted to confirm Supreme Court nominees appointed by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike.  I have voted across party lines, even when it was not popular to do so.  And I have always approached the consideration of Supreme Court nominees in the same manner: with an open and objective mind, giving weight to the qualifications, temperament, and record of the individual who has been nominated.  That is because I have always believed — and still do — that our independent judiciary is bigger than partisan politics.  When I say Judge Jackson is one of the most objectively well-qualified Supreme Court nominees I have ever considered, it is rooted in decades of experience in evaluating these nominees.I know that will fall on deaf ears with certain members of this Committee.  Members who unfortunately cared more about seeing their soundbites on their social media feeds than on seriously and respectfully questioning the nominee.  Members who badgered Judge Jackson, refused to let her answer questions, and even refused to respect basic rules and decorum of the Committee, and of the Senate.  That Judge Jackson maintained a calm demeanor and confidence in the face of such disrespectful behavior underscored her remarkable temperament — an attribute we need on our nation’s highest court. But I hope there are other Senators — those to whom I give great credit for asking serious questions and treating the nominee with respect — who will see this historic moment for what it is. A chance to unite across party lines around one of the most brilliant legal minds in our country, just like we did three times before on her previous confirmations.  A chance to elevate the first ever Black woman to the Supreme Court, widening the lens of our Supreme Court’s representation, ensuring that our democracy’s institutions become ever more inclusive and representative with each generation.  And a chance to show Americans that the independence and integrity of our judiciary is something that we need, and that we value, more than our party affiliations.What a reaffirming signal it would send to the American people if we break free from the politics of the moment and unite behind Judge Jackson.  What a refreshing departure that would be from the tired tribalism that has infected virtually every corner of our political system.Judge Jackson has given me every reason to be hopeful — for our Court, and for our country.  Judge Jackson, just in being nominated, has already helped move our country forward.  Millions of people across the country tuned into her hearings and saw themselves as part of our democratic process like they never had before.  That is something we should all be proud of — and something we should always strive for — in our system of self-government.As a former chair of this Committee, and now as President Pro Tem, I continue to hope that we will be an aspirational Committee. And that the Senate can still serve as the conscience of the Nation, as we have often been before at key moments.  Let us put partisanship and pettiness aside, and vote to advance this extraordinary nominee, Judge Jackson, to the Senate Floor, and vote aye in ultimately confirming her to the United States Supreme Court.  There is no question we are in the midst of an historic moment, and the history books will be taking notes.  The only question is whether we will rise to meet this moment.    # # # # #  "

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/senator-leahy-applauds-change-in-organic-origin-of-livestock-rule,"(TUESDAY, March 29, 2022) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Tuesday thanked USDA for making a key change in the rules for organic livestock, long requested by small dairy producers.Leahy said:  “For far too long, large producers have been able to skirt the rules regarding organic livestock, ‘transitioning’ livestock to organic every year after raising them conventionally.  This rule will end that practice and help level the playing field between large and small organic producers.”When a farm converts from conventional to organic production, it is allowed to transition its existing livestock to organic, adopting organic practices for the care and feeding of those animals.  Implicit in the rules was the assumption that subsequent generations of livestock would be raised organic, not transitioned.  But there was a loophole, of which some farmers have taken advantage.Provisions of the new rule include:“I thank USDA for making this change,” Leahy said.  “We must remain vigilant in protecting organic standards.  This will help ensure that large producers are not abusing a loophole to give themselves an unfair advantage.""As part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2022 passed by Congress and signed into law earlier this month, Leahy, as chair of the Appropriations Committee, included language which encourages USDA to provide the National Organics Program with all the necessary resources for enforcement of the organics standards, including pasture rules for livestock. # # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/remarks-at-organic-trade-associations-organic-week-conference,"Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is recognized as the ‘father’ of the national organic standards and labeling program, as author and chief sponsor of the federal law that created the system in 1990.  This charter and its rules and the organic label, which are followed by farmers and trusted by consumers, have led to what is now the multi-billion-dollar organic foods industry.  It is another of the ‘born in Vermont’ ideas that Leahy has taken to Capitol Hill to then expand to the rest of the nation.The Organic Trade Association is meeting today in Washington.  Below is the text and video of Leahy’s recorded remarks for the conference --YouTube video LINK:      https://youtu.be/ot6NAwVCUAk Video Recorded Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) For The Organic Trade Association’s Organic Week Conference Washington, D.C. Tuesday, March 29, 2022 It was over 30 years ago that we made history with the enactment of the Organic Foods Production Act.  That law, established within the 1990 Farm Bill when I was Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, spurred what has become a multi-billion dollar industry.  Based on strong roots and vibrant advocacy in my home state of Vermont, it is the cornerstone of the organic movement.  It is also one of the legislative achievements of which I am most proud. The establishment of a voluntary USDA label with clear standards and full transparency was very much a ‘born in Vermont’ idea.Vermont’s organic farmers, pioneers in the field and the marketplace, saw the potential for this approach to level the playing field, give consumers a trusted label, and create opportunities for future generations to steward our working landscape. There was one problem: in 1989, most members of the Senate Agriculture Committee had no idea what organic farming was or what it looked like.No one could make a better case than the Vermonters who were putting in the work on their farms every day, and so I brought the Senate Agriculture Committee to Vermont.  Hearing firsthand from organic farmers in Vermont set the Committee – and then the Congress – on the path to pass the “Organic Farm Bill.”  The rest, as they say, is history.While we remember, celebrate, and commemorate those early victories, we cannot lose sight of the future of organic.  The organic consumer market has, unfortunately but predictably, attracted those who prefer to erode the standards rather than meet them.  Those who would bend the rules to fit their industrial-scale approach to agriculture in pursuit of short-term profits.  For years, we have fought against organic import fraud, and loopholes in the origin of livestock, and animal welfare standards, and for adequate enforcement of the pasture rule. We cannot let up.  American consumers have come to trust the organic label, and the organic industry is producing the products these consumers want for their families.I am proud of the work we have done to establish, develop and grow the organics industry.  I remain a partner in the fight to protect the label, and strengthen the standards.  But it is each of you who are the on the front lines, talking daily to the farmers and producers who are meeting the demands of the market.  Thank you for your vigilance and commitment to the industry, and the farmers who make it possible.  I am so pleased to be able to share these words with you this week, and hope your annual conference is a successful exchange of ideas for the future. # # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-president-bidens-budget-proposal,"Earlier this month, President Biden laid out his vision for our country at the State of the Union by prioritizing investments in education, health care, growing the workforce, and building our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.  He rejected isolationism, and called for rebuilding partnerships with foreign allies and partners and projecting U.S. global leadership consistent with our values. Today’s budget is a reflection of those priorities.  It makes investments in supporting our communities, addressing the climate crisis, combating COVID and preparing for future pandemics, caring for our veterans, and provides the funding for the defense, diplomacy, and humanitarian aid that are needed to address Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the abuses of other authoritarian regimes.   In the coming weeks, it is essential that Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, work with the President to negotiate budget toplines so that we can commence the appropriations process for the fiscal year that begins on October 1.  I look forward to working with the President, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro, and Ranking Member Granger to realize these needed investments in the American people.# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/sanders-leahy-welch-call-on-sciolex-ceo-to-engage-fairly-with-workers-at-vermont-service-center-for-citizenship-and-immigration,"(MONDAY, March 21, 2022) – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), on Monday wrote to Kevin Miller, CEO of the Sciolex Corporation, to express concern over the treatment of Sciolex workers at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Vermont Service Center (VSC). Formerly based in St. Albans, the VSC, now located in Essex Junction, is one of five USCIS service centers in the country that collectively handle between eight and ten million immigration cases per year – performing the essential work of preparing and processing immigration benefits applications and petitions.In the letter, the Vermont Congressional delegation called on Sciolex to engage fairly with the workers and their union, the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (UE) Local 208. Sanders, Leahy, and Welch wrote, “After speaking with your workers, we have heard troubling reports that you have implemented unilateral changes to benefits and COVID policies and refused to bargain in good faith with the union. Further, it has been reported to us that you have threatened, punished, and intimidated workers in retaliation for their participation in the union and protected concerted activity.”In the letter, the Vermont lawmakers described worker reports that Sciolex violated the “No Strike No Lockout” provision of their collective bargaining agreement and fired UE Local 208 of the St. Albans, Vermont chapter, President Christine Brown, for her participation in a rally that took place on March 2, 2022, on her own time. President Brown had worked at the VSC since 1995.“Mr. Miller, our message to you is simple: treat your workers with dignity and engage in good faith with them and their union,” wrote the delegation. “These jobs are not only important to Vermont, but to individuals, families, and communities across the country. Workers at the VSC deserve safe working conditions, fair benefits, and respect for their legal right to organize and be represented by a union.”Read the full letter, here.  ###"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/opening-statement-on-confirmation-hearing-of-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-be-an-associate-justice-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states,"Welcome, Judge Jackson.Today and throughout this week, the Committee, and the country, will hear from Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who has been nominated to be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  Any nomination to the Court is historic; there have been only 115 Justices in our Nation’s history.  Judge Jackson’s nomination is historic in more ways than one.  Her nomination, pending a confirmation by the Senate, will bring us one step closer to having a Supreme Court that is more reflective of the Nation.  One where diversity of race, gender, background, education and experience allow all Americans to look to their Court and see in its Justices a reflection of the American people.Judge Jackson, just with your presence here today, you are writing a new page in the history of America.Who the President nominates, and the Senate decides to confirm, to our Federal judiciary, and especially our Nation’s highest Court, is critically important.  The American people—our constituents—and their faith in the courts is central to our democracy.  The decisions made in our courts, and ultimately at the Supreme Court, affect the daily lives of each one of us.  Fundamental questions about access to health care, the integrity of our elections, the fairness of our criminal justice system, the preservation of bedrock environmental laws, protections for workers—these issues, and many more, are routinely decided by the Court.  Every American must believe the courts are impartial and independent.  They must believe that our courts are not a mere political arm of the Executive or the Congress, but faithful only to the rule of law.  The stakes are simply too high.Let’s make a few things clear.  Judge Jackson is no judicial activist.  She is not a puppet of the so-called “radical left.”  She has been praised by Republican-appointed judges for her jurisprudence.  Lawyers from the right and the left who have appeared before her in court have called her “judicious and even-handed.”Judge Jackson is not “anti-law enforcement.”  She hails from a law enforcement family.  She has also won the support of preeminent, national law enforcement organizations, including the National Fraternal Order of Police.And no, Judge Jackson is not, quote, “soft on crime.”  Her background as a Federal public defender would bring an informed perspective of the criminal justice system to the Supreme Court.  I am a former prosecutor.  Confidence in my prosecution of a case was strongest when I knew the defendant had the best representation.  When both sides and the presiding judge have a real grasp of our criminal justice system, that is when justice is most likely to be done. Judge Jackson’s background here is an asset to the Court, not a liability. Since her nomination, and again here today, we have heard about the long, distinguished record of Judge Jackson.  A graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School.  A judicial clerk at the district, circuit and Supreme Court levels.  A Federal appellate judge, a Federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice, and a Federal public defender.  All these experiences and perspectives have provided her a mastery of our justice system, and in particular, the criminal justice system.  If confirmed, she would become the first ever Justice to have served as a Federal public defender, an important experience given how much the Court shapes our criminal justice system. Perhaps most of all, it is Judge Jackson’s nearly 10 years as an appellate and trial judge that underscore the experience she would bring to the Supreme Court.  Confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2013 to the D.C. District Court, she served with distinction for eight years, issuing more than 500 opinions and presiding over a dozen trials.  A bipartisan majority of the Senate confirmed her to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year.  She is a fair and impartial jurist, with a fidelity to the law above all else.  This is what Americans want to see in a Supreme Court Justice.Years of so-called ‘judicial wars’ have left Americans feeling like our courts have become increasingly partisan.  The extreme interests of pressure groups on both sides of the political spectrum have left the American people wondering if they can get a fair shake in our courts.  And yet in this moment, we have before us a unique opportunity to change the narrative. I am under no illusion that we can mend this process overnight. But we have before us a nominee who has brought us together across party lines before. And one who perhaps can bring us together again. The Senate can change course and return to how we fairly and objectively evaluate nominees, with the highly qualified nominee we have in Judge Jackson. I am the President Pro Tempore of the Senate.  A former Chairman of this Committee.  I have participated in 20 prior Supreme Court nomination processes, most leading to confirmation, and a small handful not.  I have supported nominees from both Democratic and Republican Presidents.  In Judge Jackson, I have found a distinguished nominee with an unassailable record that merits our respect, regardless of party.  I believe the American people will see in her what I have come to learn in my review of her career and life story.  Judge Jackson’s nomination is a reflection of the arc of our democracy—the arc that bends toward justice, as Dr. King once said.  Although in fits and starts, with every generation, we have sought to become more inclusive and more representative.  We have looked to citizens, civic leaders, elected representatives, and yes, to judges, to strengthen our democracy and to recognize that our strength comes from our diversity.  Judge Jackson’s story, and her nomination today, is part of the evolving story of America. Judge Jackson, I want to congratulate you on this nomination.  Despite all the darkness in the world and the political brinksmanship that has unfortunately become a hallmark of Congress in recent years, your nomination fills me with hope—hope for the Court, hope for the rule of law, hope for the country.  One need look no further than the chaos, devastation and inhumanity halfway around the world in Ukraine to know how precious our democracy is.  And how precious a legacy we have in our independent Federal judiciary.  I need look no further than my own grandchildren to know how necessary our fight for freedom, fairness, and equality is.  The independence and impartiality of our courts, and of the Supreme Court, are a cornerstone of the great experiment that is the United States.  In you, the American people have a nominee in whom they can be proud.  We have before us an historic moment; I hope we can meet it.I look forward to your testimony this week. # # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/tillis-and-leahy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-combat-copyright-theft-enhance-content-sharing-and-hold-tech-accountable,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the SMART Copyright Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation that would hold tech accountable by developing effective, widely-available measures to combat copyright theft.“In the fight to combat copyright piracy, there is currently no consensus-based standard technical measures and that needs to be addressed,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation that will provide widely available piracy-fighting measures and create a trusted and workable internet for our creative communities.”“Nearly twenty-five years ago we enacted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a landmark update to the copyright laws for the internet age.  Since then, the internet has significantly changed, and with it so has the world of copyright,” said Senator Leahy.  “I’m excited to work, alongside Senator Tillis, with filmmakers, musicians, authors, and artists of all stripes, enlisting the help of online platforms, to address online copyright theft that robs these artists of the fruits of their creativity and hard work.  The technology exists to protect against this theft; we just need online platforms to use the technology.  I’m working hard to make sure our artists get paid, and we can enjoy legal access to their wonderful creations.  I look forward to working with all realms of the copyright community to address the problem of copyright theft.” Background:Online service providers struck a deal with Congress twenty years ago—they wouldn’t have to pay for copyright theft facilitated by their systems if they worked with copyright owners to create effective standardized technical measures (STMs) to identify and protect against distribution of stolen content. In enacting this grand bargain, Congress clearly envisioned this safe harbor immunity would act as an incentive for platforms and rights holders to collaborate on developing effective measures to combat copyright theft, lower transaction costs, accelerate information sharing, and create a healthy internet for everyone. Yet rather than incentivizing collaboration, the law actually inhibits it because service providers cannot risk losing their valuable safe harbors if an STM is created. In addition, the current statute provides only one path to establish that a technological measure is a consensus-based STM that must be available to all. As a result, no STMs have been identified since the law took effect.  The issue isn’t whether technical measures to combat rampant copyright infringement exist—plenty do—but rather how to encourage service providers to adopt technical measures to combat stealing and facilitate sharing of critical copyright data.    The Strengthening Measures to Advance Rights Technologies (SMART) Copyright Act of 2022 takes a measured approach to addressing these barriers in two ways. It creates flexibility so that more existing measures could be eligible for consensus created STMs and it addresses the incentive issue by authorizing the Librarian of Congress to designate through an open, public rulemaking process technical measures identified by stakeholders that certain service providers must accommodate and not interfere with. Instead of “bet the company” loss of safe harbors, violations involving designated technical measures (DTMs) risk only actual or statutory damages, from which innocent violators can be exempt.Read a one-pager of the bill HERE and myth vs. fact HERE.Read text of the bill HERE.###  "

Partnerships at the University of Vermont.  Rural states face unique challenges in everything from broadband connectivity to water quality, and the University of Vermont is leading the state and the nation in researching new ways to address these challenges.  Leahy secured an additional $30 million dollars in programmatic funding to support such institutes.National Farm to School Institute: Leahy secured $5 million to establish a National Farm To School Institute at Shelburne Farms in Vermont to provide technical and practical assistance to farm to school programs in Vermont and around the country.  Shelburne Farms has been a longtime leader in Farm to School activities.Bennington Readiness Center: Leahy secured $16.9 million to replace the nearly 100-year-old Vermont National Guard Readiness Center in Bennington that is currently home to B Troop and the 1-172 Mountain Cavalry.Other Vermont CDS highlights include: A comprehensive list of the CDS projects for Vermont secured by

including an increase in LIHEAP funding at a time when fuel prices are rising, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and many other initiatives.  Highlights of these include:Dairy Business Innovation Centers: Leahy secured $25 million, a $3 million increase, for the Dairy Business Innovation Centers, which improve the economic viability and resilience of dairy producers.  One of the centers is located in Vermont and received $6 million in fiscal year 2021.  The USDA last week announced an additional $20 million for the center through the American Recovery Plan Act.Patrick Leahy Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program: Leahy secured $30 million for the program, which has provided thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country with more nearly 1.5 million vests, including – including more than 5,000 vests for Vermont law enforcement agencies. Northern Border Regional Commission: Leahy secured over $65 million for the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) across several agencies.  NBRC is a federal-state partnership with a mission to help alleviate economic distress and encourage private-sector job creation throughout the northern counties of Maine, New Hampshire, and New York and all of Vermont.  Since its inception, the Commission has awarded funding to 96 projects in Vermont totaling more than $24 million. Lake Champlain Geographic Program: Leahy secured $20 million, a $5 million increase, for the Lake Champlain Geographic Program, which is an Environmental Protection Agency program designed to implement a comprehensive pollution prevention, control and restoration plan for protecting the Lake Champlain Basin.Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization Grants: Leahy secured $10 million, a $2.5 million increase, for Paul Bruhn

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/remarks-on-the-urgent-need-to-pass-voting-rights-legislation,"Last week I spoke on the Floor reflecting on the unthinkable events of January 6th, 2021, when a violent mob attempted to snuff out one our democracy’s most sacred traditions: the peaceful transition of power.  That mob’s attack on our nation’s Capitol was fueled by the former president’s “big lie,” the utterly false alternate reality that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election through widespread fraud. But the January 6th insurrection, as nightmarish as it was, was not the only thing spawned by the “big lie.”Inspired by the former president’s baseless conspiracy theory, dozens of states have passed new laws suppressing voters and making it easier for partisan officials to overturn the will of their constituents.  These have been billed as “election integrity” or “election security” laws.  Even George Orwell would be impressed by the brazen euphemisms.  Disenfranchising tens of thousands of minority voters does nothing to improve the integrity of our elections.  And empowering partisan actors to disqualify ballots and ignore the popular will makes our elections more insecure.  A record number of these voter suppression laws are being considered and enacted as we head toward a major midterm election that will shape the direction of our country.Many of these laws would not see the light of day if the Department of Justice still possessed its preclearance powers under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  However, the Supreme Court unwisely decided to gut the Justice Department’s preclearance powers in the Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013.  Adding insult to injury, the Supreme Court toppled another critical pillar of the Voting Rights Act in the 2021 Brnovich decision, even further limiting the federal government’s tools to combat voter suppression.  With a green light from our nation’s highest court and constant prodding from a man who refuses to accept reality, partisan state actors have breathed new life into the “big lie.”  Not by breaking laws, as the January 6th mob did, but by making them.Now, I happen to have a bipartisan bill to restore the Justice Department’s powers to oversee and prevent states from enacting discriminatory voting laws: the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  I worked very hard to craft a compromise bill that has garnered Republican support here in Senate.  So it was truly a low point when Republicans recently refused to even allow debate on my bipartisan legislation.   Isn’t that the whole point of being a Senator?  To debate and vote on bills?  How can you justify telling your constituents that you refuse to allow even debate on a voting rights bill with a 56-year-record of bipartisanship?  Are we that afraid to simply do our jobs?It bears repeating but the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would simply restore and update provisions of the Voting Rights Act that have been overwhelmingly supported by both parties throughout the law’s history.  The Voting Rights Act has been reauthorized by large bipartisan majorities in Congress five times, and proudly signed into law by Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and George W. Bush.  Not exactly what you’d call a liberal trio of Presidents.  The most recent VRA reauthorization in 2006 was a 98 to 0 vote in the Senate.  A number of Senators still serving today, both Republican and Democrat, voted to support that legislation.  The compromise bill I have crafted with Senator Murkowski follows the very same blueprint of these other bipartisan efforts to restore the Voting Rights Act.Maybe I’m old fashioned but it would be a tragedy if Senators have completely sacrificed our sense of common purpose at the altar of partisanship.  We used to believe that protecting our right to vote – the very right that gives democracy its name – is bigger than party or politics.  We used to believe that a system of self-government – a government of, by, and for the people – is one that is worth preserving for generations to come.  And we used to believe, regardless of party, that government exists to serve the will of the people – not the other way around.I sincerely hope that we still believe those things.  The only way to prove it is through our actions.  I don’t know what the next few weeks will have in store.  But if we have an opportunity to consider the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I hope that my Republican friends will at least have the courage of their convictions and allow for a vote on it.  If you oppose a bipartisan bill to restore a landmark voting rights law with nearly six decades of unwavering bipartisan support, then you should be willing to stand up on the Senate Floor and vote against it.I, for one, will proudly vote yes.  All the tweeting and partisan posturing that seems to consume most of our energy these days will quickly be forgotten.  What will be remembered for decades is what the Senate did in our democracy’s hour of peril.  I hope – indeed I pray – that the answer is not nothing.  # # # # #        "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/vaafm-announces-vermont-pay-for-performance-agricultural-phosphorus-reduction-program-now-taking-applications,"MONTPELIER (Saturday, January 8, 2022) - The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets (VAAFM) recently opened applications for the new Vermont Pay for Phosphorus (VPFP) program, one of the first of its kind in the United States.   VAAFM received a $7 million grant award from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in September of 2020, enabling the Agency to launch a statewide Vermont Pay for Phosphorus (VPFP) Program to further expand and support agriculture’s role in delivering clean water results for Vermont.  The program will provide $4.9 million in direct payments to farms over 4 years for successful phosphorus management.Vermont farmers wishing to apply for the program have until January 31, 2022 to do so.  To encourage participation in the VPFP Program, farmers who successfully enroll will be eligible for an initial payment of up to $4,000 per farm.  Ultimately VAAFM hopes to work with 40 to 50 farms on data entry this year and to enroll 20 to 30 farms for an additional phosphorus reduction payment of up to $50,000 per farm in 2022.  Participants will have the opportunity to manage the requirements of this program independently, or to work with local Natural Resources Conservation District personnel at no cost to the farmer. This innovative, flexible, cost-efficient payment approach supports conservation where it is most effective and gives farmers options to implement conservation practices they know will work for their own operations. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a longtime member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, including as past chairman, said: “Vermont’s farmers are good stewards of the land. This program will help provide them with the financial support they need to further improve that legacy of stewardship. It will help them to protect the waterways we all share. I congratulate the Vermont Agency of Agriculture for creating this program that will reward good, climate-smart agricultural practices, while empowering farmers with the flexibility to make on-farm decisions that best suit their land. I thank NRCS for funding this program, which reflects exactly the innovation we hoped to see when we included the Regional Conservation Partnership Program in the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills.”The VPFP will build on the success of the current state and partner clean water implementation efforts and Vermont’s engaged farmers. Agriculture was responsible for 97% of the reported phosphorus reductions in the Lake Champlain Basin in State Fiscal Year 2019 – and achieved these reductions with the most cost-effective rate of implementation in any sector. This new program will accelerate agricultural water quality improvements with new funding and a new strategy for incentivizing and valuing farmer’s agricultural land stewardship efforts.Vermont Governor Phil Scott said, “Farmers have already been key partners, making great strides improving the environment, and this innovate approach gives them another tool to improve water quality, while rewarding them financially for the management of their land.”“Vermont farmers have shown us time and time again that they are innovators and lead the way at improving water quality,” VAAFM Secretary Anson Tebbetts said. “This program will not only provide payment for that important work, but also give Vermont farms tools to keep their conservation momentum moving forward.  We encourage all Vermont farmers to take a close look at this new program.”The launch of this program in Vermont was made possible by a grant from the national USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) Alternative Funding Arrangement (AFA), and represents the culmination of more than nine years of work by AAFM to engage stakeholders, research new technologies, and model and test innovative conservation systems. The VPFP is also designed to be equitable between geographic areas, farm types, and farm sizes. To apply or find more information about the Vermont Pay For Performance Agricultural Phosphorus Reduction Program visit: https://agriculture.vermont.gov/VPFP # # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-south-sudan,"Mr. LEAHY.  Mr. President, several months ago I spoke of the hope we all felt that after decades of civil war, famine, and political turmoil, after millions were killed and millions more became refugees including thousands of “lost boys” and “lost girls”, South Sudan’s independence and a peace agreement would be the beginning of a period of lasting stability and progress.Regrettably, what has unfolded since then is the antithesis of stability or progress.  The past decade has been plagued by continued ethnic violence, widespread hunger, and ongoing disputes between rival politicians who have been motivated by their own personal ambitions rather than building a democratic country or improving the lives of the South Sudanese people.  Two individuals, President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar, are primarily to blame for fueling tensions and mobilizing support along ethnic lines, and for failing in their responsibility to invest in public infrastructure, basic services, and the institutions of a multi-party democracy.  The country remains divided, violent, and impoverished.  The Parliament is nothing more than a hand-picked rubber stamp.In Senate Resolution 380, which passed unanimously on December 9, 2021, we recounted the failure of leadership that continues to plague South Sudan.  We said:Whereas despite years of fighting, widespread suffering of South Sudanese civilians, punitive actions by the international community, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders of South Sudan have failed to build sustainable peace, and critical provisions of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict [R-ARCSS] . . . remain unimplemented;Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have consistently failed to uphold their responsibilities to create the conditions for peace and prosperity, have prioritized self-preservation and corruption over the needs of the people they represent, have acted in bad faith in the implementation of cease fire and peace agreements, and have betrayed the cause of freedom, resulting in the loss of millions of lives; andWhereas South Sudan has not held an election since its independence and the current leaders of South Sudan were appointed or installed through transitional arrangements based on peace agreements.The people of South Sudan deserve better.  Their children are hungry.  They live in constant fear that the country will again erupt into civil war and they will be forced to flee their homes yet again.  It is a travesty that despite billions of dollars in international aid, oil revenues, and black market loans so little has been accomplished due to the whims and greed of two politicians.  Where did all that money go, when the government does not pay teachers, or health workers, diplomats, or war veterans, or build schools, health clinics, housing, or roads, or otherwise address the basic needs of the people of South Sudan?  Where did the money go when the government does nothing to protect its citizens and their livestock from drowning from the yearly flooding of the Nile River?  Does anyone doubt that it ended up in secret bank accounts or to purchase properties far away from South Sudan? I have spoken before of the People’s Coalition for Civil Action (PCCA), a pro-democracy civil rights movement that seeks to mobilize the people of South Sudan in their pursuit of peaceful political change, which is their right.  The PCCA and similar peaceful organizations represent a rejection of war, corruption, insecurity, and poverty.  They are calling for new, honest and capable leadership that is committed to improving the lives of their people, to providing stability and security, rather than self-enrichment. I note that Senate Resolution 380 calls on the Secretary of State to “lead a comprehensive interagency process to develop a revitalized United States policy toward South Sudan that . . . identifies South Sudanese political and civilian stakeholders, beyond President Kiir and First Vice President Machar, with whom the United States may work for the promotion of peace, democracy, development, accountability, transparency, and anti-corruption efforts.”  Supporting the PCCA would be a good place to start.How has President Kiir responded to this praiseworthy demand for nothing more than that he and Vice President Machar keep their promise to lead the country out of poverty?  Several of the PCCA’s leaders have been arrested.  Others live in exile, fearing that they too would be jailed if they return home.  I think of Abraham Awolich, one of the lost boys.  One of his brothers was killed fighting for the liberation of South Sudan and Abraham nearly died himself for the same cause, but he was fortunate to be educated in a refugee camp in Kenya and resettled in my state of Vermont where he graduated from the university.  He is one of the dedicated leaders of the PCCA who have called for free and fair elections so the country can finally have new leadership and leave behind a generation of corruption, violence, and misery.  Abraham left the comfort of living in America and chose to go back to South Sudan to help build a new democratic society, but he has had to flee his country and his assets have been frozen for speaking out and standing up for democracy and civil rights.  This is wrong.Others who are in jail for their peaceful advocacy are Kuel Aguer Kuel, Pastor Abraham Chol Maketh, Malik Angok, and Fadhia Ngor.  Rajab Mohandis, Wani Michael, Joseph Akol Makeer, and Jame David Kolok are on the run for the same reason, their assets also frozen.  Other advocacy organizations the government has targeted besides the PCCA include the Organization for Responsive Governance, the Okay Africa Foundation, and the Foundation for Democracy and Accountable Governance.These individuals and organizations deserve and need our support.I urge the South Sudanese authorities to release Kuel Aguer Kuel and all the political prisoners mentioned so they can begin this new year with their families. The government should also unfreeze the assets of the individuals and organizations affected and issue a public statement revoking any further threats against them and their organizations.The repressive actions of the South Sudanese government should outrage each of us, especially considering the billions of dollars American taxpayers contributed to secure South Sudan’s independence and put the country on a path to a prosperous future.  President Kiir and Vice President Machar have a duty to provide the political and civic space for their people to exercise their rights of free expression, association, and assembly, and to petition for free and fair elections and for honest and competent governance. Ever since independence 10 years ago, the people of South Sudan have struggled to survive under the suffocating oppression of the same two disgraced leaders.  President Kiir and Vice President Machar have an opportunity to show real statesmanship, but time is running out.  They should listen to the voices of their people expressed through the National Dialogue and step aside and give South Sudan a new beginning.  The two could end the unrest in South Sudan with a public declaration of their intention not to contest the next election.  Rather than delay elections as they have done repeatedly before, President Kiir and Vice President Machar should set a date for national and parliamentary elections, in accordance with the R-ARCSS, and declare their unconditional commitment to relinquish power as soon as South Sudan’s new leaders are sworn in. In acting on this advice, President Kiir and Vice President Machar would receive international support for an honorable exit from power.  Ignoring this advice, however, would result in further condemnation and consequences from the United States and the rest of the international community.The text of Senate Resolution 380 bears repeating, because it identifies some, but by no means all, of the consequences that could result.  It “urges the Secretary of the Treasury—(A) to prioritize investigations into illicit financial flows fueling violence in South Sudan;(B) to work with the Secretary of State to update, on a regular basis, the list of individuals and entities designated under the South Sudan sanctions program, including individuals at the highest levels of leadership in South Sudan and from within the National Security Service; and(C) to coordinate, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, with the United Kingdom and the European Union on South Sudan-related sanctions designations and enforcement.”Mr. President, what has befallen the people of South Sudan in the ten years since independence is a travesty.  Their dreams of a better future have been crushed.  Their rights have been trampled.   Many have paid with their lives or their freedom.  Their government has become a subject of ridicule by the same international donors that staked so much on the good faith of leaders who have failed them. Time has run out for President Kiir and Vice President Machar.  The patience of the South Sudanese people has run out.  The tolerance of the international community has run out.  They have squandered and abused their authority for far too long.  They would be well-advised to stand aside so that others, chosen in a free and fair election, can begin the process of uniting and rebuilding the country.  To that end, the United States can work with regional allies, Canada, Norway, the UK, other European nations, and church leaders to achieve a democratic and peaceful solution in South Sudan.# # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/remarks-on-the-anniversary-of-the-jan-6-attack-on-the-capitol,"These are among the most somber and sorrowful remarks that I have had to make as President Pro Tempore and in my several decades of service in this body. What an unthinkable event it is that we are marking today.  An attempted coup incited not against a president, but by a president, who promoted and still promotes a litany of lies, to overturn the results of an election in order for him to hold on to power that he no longer possesses.  We are in the business of words, but there are none to adequately capture the damage that he and his henchmen have done and are doing to our country.I am certain that no one serving here ever thought that such an attack on our democracy, by a violent insurrectionist mob that stormed the Capitol, the very citadel of our democracy, could ever happen in our beloved country, the world’s most enduring democracy.This very chamber where we are gathered was breached and desecrated, as was the rest of the Capitol.This morning in my capacity as President Pro Tem, I called the Senate into session.  As I looked around the Chamber, so many memories came to my mind.  I first saw this Senate Chamber as a teenager visiting from our home in Montpelier, Vermont, with my parents coming to this Capitol, and then later as a Georgetown Law student I would sit in the visitors’ gallery and just watch.I saw the Members of the Senate in both parties speaking to the conscience of our nation and trying to protect our Constitution.In 1975 I came onto the Floor of the Senate as the junior most member.  I was in awe of the Senate then, and never expected to become the Dean of the Senate.  A year ago I sat on the Floor of the Senate as Vice President Pence was announcing the certification of ballots, and I saw him doing this in a straightforward and honest way, even though he knew that at the end of the count he would soon no longer be vice president, nor would Donald Trump still be president.We were all in the Senate paying attention when suddenly officers came rushing onto the Floor and took the vice president off the dais and out the door.  Chuck Grassley, the then President Pro Tem, went to the dais and prepared to recess the Senate.Most of us were wondering what was happening, until I looked a few feet away from me and saw a man wearing a vest that said police and carrying a submachine gun.  I had never seen anything like this in the U.S. Senate.The police rushed us through a back door to the basement of the Capitol and shuttled us off to a secure location.  I was still trying to sort through my mind what was happening.  Officers were going through the halls, and one officer came along and said, ""We're going to watch out for you, Shamrock.""  So many memories flooded back because Shamrock was the police codename for me when I was a recipient of a deadly anthrax letter addressed to me that killed and maimed others.Ahead of me I could see the brave Parliamentarians and others who had grabbed the cases with the certification of ballots, and they also grabbed the ivory gavel, which I used today to call the Senate into session. When we were in the secure room, we were starting to see the television and seeing a mob – Americans who turned into a mob and turned their back on our Constitutional history.  They were rejecting everything that made America great, ignoring our laws, our customs and most of all ignoring our history.  The destruction in the rampage was something you would see in a movie – I never expected to see it in the Capitol, a building that has always been a symbol of our democracy.A suggestion was made that we use our authority under the law to vote and make the secure room the Senate Chamber.  I said that we should not be hiding here.  Instead when it is safe to go back to the Senate, we should go back there, all of us, and have the American people see us there.It may take an hour, it may take ten hours, but we should be there carrying out the Constitution, and saying no criminals can destroy our history, our Constitution, our America.  I was relieved when virtually all of the Republicans and Democrats who were in that room stood and said loudly that they agreed with me, and that we would wait until we went back.I was standing next to the Parliamentarian and the leather boxes carrying the certification of election.  We both looked at them, and I'm sure we were both thinking the same thing -- we will protect our Constitution, we will protect the Senate, we will protect America.To the credit of the Members of the Senate and the House, we reconvened after the siege and fulfilled our Constitutional duty to certify the confirmed results of the election, results that every state and federal court has upheld in the face of blatantly frivolous challenges.My thoughts today are not only about how fragile our democracy is, but about the heroes of that day: the Capitol Police officers – some of whom lost their lives or suffered grievous and enduring injuries -- and those who joined in the Capitol’s defense, especially from the Metropolitan Police Department.That day one year ago today was such a sad and wrenching day.  So disturbing was it to see such hatred and anger, to see the Confederate battle flag paraded in the Capitol -- where it never was brought even during the Civil War -- and to see Nazi emblems and other symbols of hate and violence carried by those in the mob.  And it was so horrifying to see our brave police officers -- many of them war veterans who defended America in Iraq and Afghanistan -- not just disregarded and disrespected, but brutally attacked, even by the wielding of poles bearing the American flag, used as bludgeons and spears. In the aftermath, National Guard contingents from several of our states were called in to protect the Capitol.  I visited with members of the Vermont National Guard.  I know that many other Senators did the same with their states’ Guard troops.In the moment, that night, and the next day, Senators on both sides of the aisle called this out for the travesty that it was.  But amnesia has set in since then in some quarters.  There has been a concerted effort to downplay or grossly mischaracterize the terrible events of that day by some Members in both Chambers of Congress.  It was not, as has been said, ‘just another day in January.’  What an insult to those who lost their lives, and to those who suffered injuries from which they still struggle to recover.The question begs and answers itself:  What are we in the Senate here for, if not to defend our Republic and our Constitution?There is a clear need for justice, and the courts are doing their essential work.  There is a clear need to know the truth, and even some of the former president’s closest supporters are heeding their duty to respond to the bipartisan Congressional investigation into what happened that day.  There will be a clear need to learn the lessons, to safeguard and strengthen our democracy, to protect those who serve and protect the Capitol and those of us who work here. The courts are dealing with these crimes, but it is detestable how so many were so callously used as cannon fodder.  Their actions were wrong, but many believed they were acting as patriots.  The former president told them so, and egged them on, and they believed him.  Meanwhile he and so many of his cronies, unlike many of his followers who stormed the Capitol, have paid no price for their roles.  They must be held accountable for planning and promoting this travesty, and, in his case, doing nothing to stop the assault, even when appealed to, repeatedly, by his closest advisors.As The New York Times has observed, our nation faces an existential threat from a movement that is openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown a willingness to use violence to achieve its ends.  No self-governing society can survive such a threat by denying that it exists.  To deny is to be complicit.But more than anything else, today is a day to remember, to feel sorrow that our nation ever suffered such violence and division, to mourn those who died and were injured, to mark the day as History will:  The first time in 244 years that our exceptional country was almost prevented from carrying out a peaceful transfer of power, a sacred principle and tradition of which we have taken pride, and taken for granted, throughout our entire lives, and that we have held up as an example to people everywhere.Our job in Congress is different than the prosecutors’ roles.  Democracy needs a foundation, and that foundation is nothing less than the truth.  It has been said that trust in the rule of law is built in drops and lost in buckets.  Our job is fundamental, to defend and advance the truth, and to protect the rule of law itself. # # # # #"

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/sanders-leahy-welch-send-letter-to-dejoy-on-mail-delays-and-issues-at-white-river-junction-facility,"Burlington Vt., Dec. 23 – Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) on Thursday sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy demanding action to address the postal issues across Vermont, including the immediate installation of a functioning cancellation machine at the White River Junction mail processing facility.“We write with great concern about the Postal Service’s continued failure to meet its own standards of service,” Sanders, Leahy and Welch wrote. “In October 2020, we wrote to you asking for the immediate delivery of critical equipment needed at the White River Junction Processing and Distribution Center in White River Junction, Vermont. Over a year later, this issue remains unresolved. An increasing number of Vermonters have also been reporting significant issues with daily mail delivery and parcels being prioritized over First Class mail.”The White River Junction U.S. Postal Service facility is one of two facilities that sort mail in Vermont. In July 2020, one of White River Junction’s two functioning AFCS 100 series machines – which had been due to be replaced already for several years – was finally removed in preparation for the arrival of a new AFCS 200 series. However, the replacement machine never came, leaving the facility with only one mail processor for months which, when it broke down, forced postal workers to sort mail by hand and significantly slowed deliveries.In October of 2020, the Vermont delegation sent a letter to Postmaster General DeJoy demanding the immediate delivery and installation of the new AFCS 200 cancellation machine at the White River Junction mail processing facility.After months of delay and a missed January 2021 deadline, the facility was sent a machine on October 15, 2021 – ten months after it was due and a different machine than was originally promised. After nearly a year of waiting, the newly delivered machine remains completely unusable, having been stripped for parts prior to arrival – a fact that was not identified until its installation in White River Junction because it was also not tested prior to shipment, as is required.Now, for over a year, DeJoy and his staff have failed to deliver on their promise of a functioning mail processor and continue to be unhelpful as the Vermont delegation has worked to resolve these issues, as well as other concerns about timely mail delivery from Vermonters across the state. Nearly every day the delegation hears from a Vermonter who is reliant upon an increasingly unreliable mail system for delivery not only of checks and bill payments, but lifesaving medications.“During this holiday season – as well as each and every day – we are grateful for the tireless efforts of our dedicated postal employees, Sanders, Leahy and Welch wrote. “They are working remarkably hard under extraordinary circumstances and deserve to know that you, their Postmaster General, support their efforts and will provide them with the equipment they need to do their job.”You can read the 2021 letter here.

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-urges-supreme-court-to-take-up-case-with-major-implications-for-the-us-patent-system,"(MONDAY, Dec. 20, 2021) – Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Chair of the Senate’s Intellectual Property Subcommittee, part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) Ranking Member of the House Intellectual Property Subcommittee, Monday filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hear a case with major implications for the American patent system.Their official brief explains how a key post-grant review process at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) – created by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act – is being undercut by new rules the lower courts have put in place.  They explain that the courts have prevented those who challenge a patent at the PTO from obtaining judicial review, discouraging the public from using a process that is critical in weeding out poor-quality patents and undermining the intent of the statute.  Without judicial review, the public will have no recourse from a negative decision, while still being bound by the results.  The brief explains that the case is bigger than the patents in question or the parties in this case, and it does not take a position on those details.  Ten years ago, Leahy authored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which created this PTO review process, known as inter partes review, allowing members of the public to challenge a patent’s validity at the PTO directly.  This process provides a faster, less expensive and more accessible avenue than litigation in the courts.  When more than ten thousand small businesses in Vermont and around the country were targeted by entities holding poor-quality patents in 2013, the tool that ultimately ensured that those patents would not be abused again in the future was this PTO review process.Leahy said:  “I am proud of the legacy we built ten years ago with the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.  I want to protect the gains we made in the AIA and ensure that our patent system reinforces high-quality patents while ensuring that poor-quality patents don’t disrupt the American economy.  This case is bigger than any two parties or any one sector of the economy.  I hope the Supreme Court will understand the need to maintain a balance that helps start-ups, small businesses, and American manufacturers thrive.""Leahy has long advocated for a strong patent system that ensures that only the highest-quality patents are issued while championing post-grant proceedings like inter partes review that curb the harms posed by poor-quality patents that never should have issued.  He is the author in this Congress of the Restoring the America Invents Act, bipartisan legislation that would bolster the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act by reversing policies put in place during the term of the previous PTO Director that have also undermined inter partes review.    The brief can be found here. # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-and-usda-announce-conservation-program-improvements-which-will-benefit-participating-vermont-farmers,"(MONDAY, Dec. 20, 2021)– U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Monday announced changes to USDA conservation programs which will make the programs work better for Vermont farmers and landowners.Participants in the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) will now have more flexibility in how they meet a required 50 percent match, making it easier for landowners to conserve land through the program. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) helps farmers implement clean water practices, such as increased buffers along fields, by reimbursing them for land taken out of production.  CREP, a component of CRP, provides additional cost-share to establish vegetative buffers adjacent to perennial streams and rivers.  A recent rule change will allow farmers to receive full payments for this land, even if farms are required to conserve the land as a result of local regulations, such as Vermont’s Required Agricultural Practices.Leahy, former chair and the most senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said:  “CREP and CRP are critical tools for meeting Vermont’s water quality goals while increasing farmers’ resilience to climate change, enhancing the biological diversity and ecological health of our state, and, importantly, improving farm viability.  I pushed hard for this during the prior administration and am pleased that Secretary Vilsack and Administrator Ducheneaux have made it a priority to enact these changes that will finally leverage the programs’ full potential in Vermont and give farmers the support and flexibility they need to take their climate stewardship even further.”“CREP is one of the most flexible tools we have for locally-driven, partner-led efforts to reward producers and drive important environmental and climate outcomes,” said Farm Services Agency (FSA) Administrator Zach Ducheneaux.  “We look forward to working with new, diverse partners – including those here in Vermont – to shape CRP to address priorities most important to them and to local communities, from water quality and conservation to wildlife habitat and climate outcomes. The CREP changes in this rule will remove barriers and provide partners with increased flexibility to participate in this powerful program.” A Dec. 6, 2019, rule required that 50 percent of matching funds from partners be in the form of direct payments, which made it more difficult for some USDA partners to participate in CREP. With this rule change, partners can now provide matching funds in the form of cash, in-kind contributions, or technical assistance. The December 2019 rule also subjected states like Vermont to a 25 percent payment reduction through the program if state regulations require farmers to implement minimum water quality practices, as Vermont’s Required Agricultural Practices do. The payment reduction was in direct contradiction to a provision included by Leahy in the 2018 Farm Bill that directed USDA to allow these states to participate and is corrected as a result of today’s announcement.  This rule change will directly benefit Vermont farmers, who will no longer receive lowered levels of federal reimbursement simply because Vermont requires them to implement water quality practices.To help partners access the CREP program, FSA has hired three additional staff.  Among them is Evelyn Whitesides, who will focus on Vermont and other Eastern states.   “We want to build capacity so that we can better reach partners, including those who we may not have worked with before,” Ducheneaux said.  “We’re taking action to reduce barriers to access and opportunity for historically underserved producers and landowners, and by engaging more partners, we’re working with groups that provide a direct link to these communities.”  These investments in CREP build on other recent outreach and education efforts, including a  $4.7 million investment announced this year to establish partnerships with organizations to provide outreach and technical assistance to historically underserved farmers and ranchers on a variety of FSA programs, including conservation programs.  Currently all CREP partners are state agencies, however FSA is strongly encouraging Tribes and non-government organizations to consider partnerships.Eligible entities include State agencies, Tribal groups, and non-government conservation organizations. Potential partners interested in CREP should contact Vermont’s FSA office.“We are pleased with this update here in Vermont, and we hope it will increase interest and participation in CRP and CREP among the state’s agricultural producers,” said Lana Walden, FSA’s Acting State Executive Director in Vermont.  “The program is a great conservation option for our farmers to help USDA conserve sensitive land, like buffers along streams and rivers, wetlands and critical wildlife habitat. It is important that the program is an accessible, viable management option.”   # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-announces-266-million-for-ovw-programs-addressing-sexual-and-domestic-violence,"(MONDAY, Dec. 20, 2021) -- U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy announced Monday that four Vermont organizations will share in $2.66 million in federal grants from the U.S. Dept. of Justice Office on Violence Against Women (OVW).Leahy said:  “Domestic and sexual violence are complex problems which we need to address on multiple fronts, which these grants do.  There is funding for law enforcement investigators, specialized prosecutors and training for judges, all of which is necessary, but there is also money to help survivors rebuild their lives.  Perhaps most importantly, there is money to support youth who are impacted by sexual and intimate partner violence either because they witnessed it or they themselves have survived it.”Leahy, the author and chief Senate sponsor of the most recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), said:  “I have long-supported the Office on Violence Against Women, which implements the Violence Against Women Act. I will continue my support for OVW and its programs through the bipartisan VAWA reauthorization, which is set for introduction in the Senate next month.Voices Against Violence/Laurie’s House received $650,000 to operate five transitional apartments for survivors of intimate partner abuse, sexual violence and stalking in Franklin and Grand Isle counties.  The grant will enable Voices to operate the apartments for the next four years.In addition to rent on the apartments, the grant also helps to pay for services to help survivors regain their footing, including financial counseling from the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity’s Financial Futures program and employment assistance through Vermont Works for Women.“Oftentimes, people come to us in a place where they don’t have any financial resources, having left them behind or because their partner controlled all of the finances,” explained Kris Lukens, executive director of Voices.  “This grant particularly is focused on helping people move forward.”An $823,126 Services, Training, Officers and Prosecution (STOP) grant to the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services will help to fund prosecutors with expertise in handling domestic violence cases, investigators with training in these types of crimes, advocates, domestic violence shelters, and training for judges.  The funding includes advocates with specialized training to assist members of the Abenaki, LGBTQ, refugee and immigrant communities, as well as people with disabilities.The STOP grant will also support the creation of a Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview training center in Windsor County, which is serving as a model for Vermont and the nation.In addition, the Center received a Sexual Assault Services Program grant for $415,553 which will provide essential funding for the state’s two stand-alone sexual violence programs, Mosaic in Barre and HOPE Works in Burlington.“During the pandemic Vermont’s Domestic and Sexual violence programs saw increases in the severity of violence, due to the stress of the pandemic, and never closed their doors.  They are there when people need them most, save lives, and are cornerstones for the safety and security of Vermonters,” said Jennifer Poehlmann, Executive Director of the Center.A Child and Youth Grant for $499,945 to Steps to End Domestic Violence will be used to support young people who may be exposed to domestic violence in their homes or community, as well as responding to dating violence and stalking experienced by teens. Working with the Colchester School District and other partners, Steps will be developing more comprehensive support services, curriculum and informed policies for responding to violence as well as teaching students about healthy relationships.  “We hope to build a strong, proactive school and community that invests in safe, healthy youth from an inclusive and nonjudgmental perspective,” said Nicole Kubon, Executive Director of Steps.The Vermont Network Against Sexual and Domestic Violence received $270,782, which it will use to support domestic and sexual violence programs across the state.“Through the supports created by these grants, survivors of domestic and sexual violence have access to vitally important services and supports,” said the Network’s Executive Director Karen Tronsgard-Scott.  “We are grateful for Senator Leahy’s leadership and his determination that all survivors have access to culturally appropriate, safe, and sustainable services.”  She continued:  “In 2022 survivors will be able to access housing supports, legal representation, specialized assistance from the criminal justice system, and 24 hour crisis services through our state’s domestic and sexual violence services organizations.  These 15 organizations served nearly 20,000 Vermonters in 2021, directly and through 24 hour hotlines.  VAWA grants are key to the continued safety and well-being of survivors.”# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/recognizing-dan-and-whits-general-store,"Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont, the general store is the epicenter of a community. It is where people not only buy their groceries and newspapers, but also tools and hardware, mittens and hats, axes and chainsaws, gas for their cars, and too many other things to name. But just as important, general stores are where Vermonters meet their neighbors, and when the weather is good, pass the time and talk about their families, things going on in town, or the state of the world.Marcelle and I have been to just about every general store in Vermont, and each one has its own history and character. One of them, Dan & Whit's, stands out. Located in Norwich about halfway up the eastern side of the State bordering on the Connecticut River, the store that became Dan & Whit's has been operating since 1891. It was originally called Merrill's Store, and the old Merrill's sign is still affixed to the front. The same neon clock, mounted high on the front of the store's facade, has told the time to the town since the 1950s. Made by the Electric Neon Clock Co. in Cleveland, it was recently restored and made energy efficient.In 1955, Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks, who had both worked at the store for over 20 years, bought it from Mr. Merrill. Since then, Dan & Whit's has been open for business 365 days a year, including a half day on Christmas and a half day on Thanksgiving. Dan and Whit ran the store as partners, and Dan's wife Eliza, known to all as ``Bunnie'', did the bookkeeping in the raised office near the stationery and greeting cards until Whit retired and sold out in 1972.Dan, who from what I am told hardly took a day off during all those years, retired in 1993, and turned the management of the store over to his sons George and Jack, and their sister Jane pitched in off and on. George's wife Susan took over Bunnie's job in the office, which hadn't changed in decades, except the typewriter was replaced by a computer. Ownership of the store is currently shared between George and his two sons Dan and Matt. Dan, after a 14-year career as a special education teacher, has taken over the day-to-day management.Most townspeople have an account, so they can simply sign the register and pay the bill at the end of the month. At no charge for local calls, anyone can use the push-button phone with its long cord by the ice machine, and before cell phones, it was a vital link from the magical abundance of the store to the outside world: ``Do we need anything at Dan & Whit's?''There is a reason why the sign in the store window says, ``If we don't have it, you don't need it,'' because when you walk in and keep walking, the store never seems to end. Dan & Whit's has got absolutely everything, at least everything a person could reasonably want or need. There is fresh fruit and vegetables, a selection of wines, kitchen utensils, bins of nails and boxes of screws, fishing tackle, ladders and rakes, paint, bags of horse feed, maple syrup and candy, toys, ice cream scooped on the premises in summertime, home-brewed beer, bright orange hunting caps, snow boots, plumbing and electrical supplies, shovels and wheelbarrows, wood stoves, birdseed, the local and national newspapers, a deli, gasoline pumps and an electric vehicle charging station, and lots more. The place is kept warm in the winter by a wood-fired furnace in the basement, requiring cords and cords of wood--delivered, split, and stacked behind the Frasers' homes, and there are solar panels on the roof. Dan & Whit's has long been a favored stop for hikers on the Appalachian Trail, which passes through the center of Norwich.Over the years, Dan & Whit's has hired local high school students to run the cash registers, and there was a time not that long ago when the employees who stocked the shelves and helped you find what you were looking for were long-timers like Larry Smith, who worked there for over 50 years.Recently, like so many other businesses in our State and around the country, it has been hard to find help. In fact, Dan & Whit's was facing the real possibility of closing, which would have been devastating for the people of Norwich, as well as countless others who come there to shop, as well as former residents of Norwich who stop at the store just to be sure that it is the same as it always was.As many have remarked, Dan & Whit's is the heart of Norwich, and losing it would have changed everything. I can't imagine Norwich without Dan & Whit's, and I suspect just about everyone who knows the store feels the same way. Real estate listings for property sales in the town include the distance from Dan & Whit's. Hundreds of notices are along the wall by the entrance: dog lost, secondhand items for sale, yoga lessons, a free concert, snow plowing. It all happens at the general store.Fortunately, but not surprisingly, when word got out that the store might close, the people of Norwich came to the rescue, and Dan & Whit's has not lost a day of business. I want to add my thanks to Dan and the volunteers who saved the heart of Norwich. They have reminded us of what is best about Vermont and, in doing so, have set an example for people everywhere.I ask unanimous consent that a piece written on December 7 by Robert Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, be printed in the Record.There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed inthe Record, as follows:The Heart of a Community: a Small Business(By Robert Reich)I've got a special place near my heart for Dan & Whit'sgeneral store in Norwich, Vermont. It was there for me duringmy undergraduate years in college in nearby Hanover, NewHampshire--often on snowy evenings when I couldn't getsupplies elsewhere. Years later, when my parents moved toVermont for their retirement, Dan & Whit's was there forthem, too.Like many places around the country, Vermont has beenstruggling with finding enough workers to fill jobs. Butunlike most urban centers, where the obvious answer is to payworkers more, rural towns can't always count on higher wagesto elicit more job applicants because populations are thinand often declining. And unlike profitable national retailchains, mom-and-pop businesses can't just absorb higher laborcosts. And they can't simply pass them on to customers inhigher prices, because small-town customers might not havethe ability to pay.So when Dan & Whit's owner Dan Fraser recently put up a``Help Wanted'' sign, the inhabitants of Norwich knew it wasbad news. (I never met the younger Dan but I'm sure I met hisgrandfather, who passed the store on to his father, whopassed it on to Dan.) After three generations, Dan would haveto close the place down if he didn't get help. So what was heto do? I heard the rest of the story on the radio. It turnedout that Dan didn't need to do anything. Word went out. Soon,Dan's customers began applying for the jobs. Rick Ferrell, alocal doctor, took on a shift at the register. A retiredfinance director applied for the deli counter. A nurse, ateacher, a psychology professor, a therapist, a schoolprincipal--nearly two dozen customers have stepped up tostock shelves, do the inventory, and clean up the place, sothat Dan & Whit's can remain open. (Virtually all of thesenew hires are donating their hourly wages to some of Dan'sfavorite charities.)I've spent a lot of time over the years examining whathappens to communities when important businesses close orabandon them--often because some bean counters back inheadquarters hundreds or thousands of miles away decide it'snot worth the cost of keeping the businesses going where theyare. Economists often praise capitalism's wondrous``efficiencies'' at moving assets to their ``highest and bestuses.'' Well, there'ssomething to that. But what's left out of the equation arethe social costs of these moves. They can be quite high.When asked why the people of Norwich stepped in to help Dan& Whit's keep going, employee Dianne Miller said it was``because Dan & Whit's is the heartbeat of this community.''Others described it as the ``heart of the town.'' That's thebest quick summary of the social benefits of a place like Dan& Whit's I've ever heard. Communities do have hearts. Whenbusinesses at those hearts disappear, more is lost than aneconomic asset. The community loses a place that allows it tobe a community--a place where people meet up, congregate,exchange gossip and information, barter, learn about commonproblems, sometimes decide to take action.I remember Dan & Whit's as such a place. I can't imagineNorwich without it. Luckily, it won't have to be. But thisisn't just a ``feel good'' story about one country towncoming together to save an iconic general store. It seems tome there's an important lesson here for all of us, whereverwe live.American capitalism is the harshest form of capitalism inall of the world's advanced economies. It takes almost noaccount of social costs and benefits. Businesses swoop in andswoop out wherever and however profits can be maximized andlosses minimized.But communities are different. They aren't nearly asfootloose as financial capital. They're built on socialcapital, which often takes years to accumulate and can't becashed in.I think people owe something to businesses that are thehearts of our communities. Maybe we shouldn't allow bigchains or Walmarts to drain our main streets of the commercethey need to survive. (Even if Walmart's items are cheaper,the social costs of losing the small businesses thatundergird our community are often way higher.) Maybe weshould donate some of our own time and labor to account forthe importance of these core businesses. Maybe those of uswho can afford to should buy shares in them, to give them anadded financial cushion. At the very least, we owe them ourpatronage--rather than, say, the Waltons or Jeff Bezos.What do you think?"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-announces-nomination-of-vermonter-to-serve-as-northern-border-regional-commission-co-chair,"WASHINGTON (THURSDAY, Dec. 16, 2021) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) says he is proud to announce that a longtime member of his staff, Chris Saunders, has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as the co-chair of the Northern Border Regional Commission.Leahy said:  “I am proud of Chris, who I count among my most long-serving and valued staff.  Chris has worked hard for Vermont and the nation in both Vermont and Washington, and this appointment is wonderful news for the entire Northern Border Region.”The Northern Border Regional Commission is a partnership between the states of Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and New York which promotes community and economic development along the border between the United States and Canada.  In Vermont, the Commission, which Leahy has championed, supports projects across the entire state. The NBRC was authorized in 2008 and funded with $1.5 million for the first time in Fiscal Year 2010.  Due to its great success in providing economic development support in northern New England, the budget and scope has grown, and in fiscal year 2021 reached $30 million.   The 2021 budget included $4 million to address declining forest-based economies, $5 million for broadband initiatives, and $1 million for state capacity building grants.  Additionally, the FY21 Appropriations Act provided $1.5 million for the Commission to help combat opioid abuse disorders and $1 million to provide technical assistance, coordination of care, and investments in the social determinants of health all aimed at strengthening rural healthcare.  Many of these funding streams would not have been possible without the hard work of Saunders while on Leahy’s staff.A Burlington resident, Saunders has served on Leahy’s staff for nearly two decades.  First in Washington, where he held a variety of legislative roles, focusing on health care, housing, education and domestic appropriations.  For the past decade, he has been a member of Leahy’s Vermont office as a Field Representative, where he has engaged with Vermont communities on community and economic development, transportation, and telecommunications policy.A Middlebury native, Saunders attended Bowdoin College.The NBRC supports Vermont projects as diverse as museums, railway stations, and water and wastewater infrastructure.  The impact of the Commission, with Saunders at the helm, will continue to increase with an additional $150 million provided to supplement annual appropriations over the next several years through the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  A NBRC grant is often the catalyst that enables communities to begin projects and attract funds from additional sources.   The NBRC is well-positioned to continue to be a major factor in the economic revitalization of the region.The White House announcement follows, BELOW -- The White HouseFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEDecember 15, 2021   President Biden Announces Key Nominees and an Appointee to Board and Commission RolesWASHINGTON – Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate the following individuals to serve in key roles: In addition, the President has appointed Glenda Glover as Vice Chair of the President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.Chris Saunders, Nominee for Federal Co-Chair of the Northern Border Regional CommissionChris Saunders has served for nearly two decades on the staff of United States Senator Patrick Leahy. For the past decade, he has been a member of Senator Leahy’s Vermont office as a Field Representative, where he has engaged with Vermont communities on community and economic development, transportation, and telecommunications policy. From 2002 to 2011, Saunders held a variety of legislative roles in the Senator’s Washington D.C. office, focusing on housing, health care, education, and domestic appropriations.  An avid hiker, skier, and angler, Saunders was raised in Middlebury, Vermont, attended Bowdoin College, and currently resides in Burlington, Vermont with his wife and two children. # # # # #"

The Social Security Administration recently took action to stop such obstacles from denying people survivor benefits through Social Security, and the Senators urged the IRS to take similar action to ensure individuals aren’t denied pension survivor benefits due to discrimination.“We write to urge you to reconsider the guidance issued under the Obama Administration that permits certain qualified retirement plans to discriminate against providing survivor benefits to same-sex couples.  We should not let the echoes of the bigotry that robbed so many people of the right to marry for so long rob them once again after they have lost their loved ones,” wrote the Senators.“When the Supreme Court struck down state bans on same-sex marriage, tens of thousands of Americans rushed to get married.  These LGBTQ+ Americans had been in committed relationships for years—some, for decades—and were finally able to have their love recognized under the law and receive all of the benefits that come with marriage.  However, in a painful reminder of the inequality these couples have long faced, some in same-sex relationships who tragically lost their partner shortly after being married or before they were able to legally marry have also been kept from receiving survivor benefits. For these surviving spouses or partners, difficulties arise where access to benefits depends on the length of their marriage.”The letter was also signed by Senators Warren (D-MA), Brown (D-OH), Markey (D-MA), Casey (D-PA), Baldwin (D-WI), Booker (D-NJ), Shaheen (D-NH), Duckworth (D-IL), Cardin (D-MD), Merkley (D-OR), Menendez (D-NJ), Hassan (D-NH), Kaine (D-VA), Blumenthal (D-CT), Padilla (D-CA), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Van Hollen (D-MD), Whitehouse (D-RI), Sanders (I-VT), Sinema (D-AZ), Hirono (D-HI), Durbin (D-IL), Warnock (D-GA), Bennet (D-CO), Klobuchar (D-MN), Smith (D-MN), Reed (D-RI), Murphy (D-CT), Coons (D-DE), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Cantwell (D-WA), Heinrich (D-NM), Rosen (D-NV), Lujan (D-NM),  Feinstein (D-CA), Schatz (D-HI), Gillibrand (D-NY), Stabenow (D-MI), Kelly (D-AZ), Schumer (D-NY), Peters (D-MI), and Carper (D-DE).Full text of the letter below and PDF HERE. December 9, 2021  The Honorable Janet Yellen                                               The Honorable Charles P.

Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.[3]  In Notice 2014-19, the IRS required a qualified retirement plan to recognize the same-sex spouse of a participant as the participant’s spouse on and after June 26, 2013, if the participant was domiciled in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, as well as on and after September 16, 2013, if the participant was domiciled in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriages.[4]  The guidance, though, also notably provided that a qualified retirement plan will not be disqualified “merely because it did not recognize the same-sex spouse of a participant as a spouse before June 26, 2013.”By permitting a plan to disregard same-sex relationships before that date, the IRS ignores the reality that many of these couples were barred from marriage because of discriminatory marriage laws where they lived—even though they were in loving, committed relationships and would have married earlier if they could.  It was not until June 26, 2015, that same-sex relationships were properly recognized, when the Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges a constitutional right to marry, including the “constellation” of rights associated with marriage, such as the “rights and benefits of survivors.”[5] The Social Security Administration recently recognized this reality and will accept and/or reconsider claims for survivor benefits by same-sex spouses and partners who were unable to be married for the required nine months because of state marriage bans.[6]  The IRS should do the same for pension survivor benefits.  Just as laws barring same-sex couples from marriage are unconstitutional, so, too, are exclusions from survivor benefits that are tied to those marriage bans.Specifically, the IRS should revise its 2014 guidance to require that qualified retirement plans with marriage duration requirements must recognize as eligible for survivor benefits bona fide same-sex relationships where same-sex partners had married their loved ones but were denied equal access to benefits because they were prevented from being married for the time required under the plans’ documents, or where they were prevented from marrying their loved ones at all.  While the use of a marriage duration requirement may be justified as a proxy for detecting or deterring sham relationships between opposite-sex couples—who have always enjoyed the right to marry—it cannot serve that function for same-sex couples who were banned from marrying one another.  Surviving same-sex partners and spouses who were unable to be married because of discriminatory marriage laws should be permitted to submit new claims for survivor benefits or reopen previously denied claims.Correcting this error will end the discriminatory treatment of potentially thousands of same-sex partners and spouses, and allow them to access the benefits they are owed.We look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you in advance for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely, # # # # #[1] See 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(11). [2] See 26 U.S.C. § 417(d); see also 26 CFR § 1.401(a)-20 Q-25.[3] 570 U.S. 744 (2013).[4] See IRS Notice 2014-19, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-19.pdf.[5] 576 U.S. 644, 670 (2015).  The Supreme Court further acknowledged these rights in Pavan v.

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-led-changes-to-federal-dairy-program-will-deliver-millions-to-vermont-farmers,"(WEDNESDAY, Dec. 8, 2021) — U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Wednesday announced changes made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the dairy safety net program that will benefit Vermont’s small dairy farms. As it opens enrollment of the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program for 2022, changes to the program sought by Leahy will deliver additional payments to Vermont producers.A change in how feed costs are calculated will mean an additional $3.1 million in retroactive payments will be distributed to Vermont farmers who were enrolled in DMC in 2020 and 2021, as a direct result of efforts by Leahy in his role as the most senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. In addition to the feed calculation change, USDA is also allowing small farms to enroll additional production in the DMC program for farmers who have increased production since 2014. This change will also result in retroactive payments to farmers enrolled in DMC in 2021, and provide additional safety net benefits headed into the 2022 and 2023 seasons.The changes to the DMC program finalized by USDA this week were first announced by Leahy and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack during the Secretary’s visit to Vermont in August.The DMC program, which Leahy helped establish in the 2018 Farm Bill, operates similar to crop insurance, providing catastrophic coverage for free and additional coverage for a fee based on a farm’s production history. In the case of dairy, the insurance covers the margin, or difference, between feed prices and milk prices. When feed prices rise, milk prices fall, or both happens at once, dairy farmers can be left without enough money after paying for feed to pay other farm expenses. The DMC program allows them to insure that margin.DMC payments are issued when the margin between feed costs and milk prices falls below the insured level. Feed costs were previously based on 50 percent alfalfa hay. This didn’t accurately reflect what farmers were paying for feed, particularly in the Northeast where feed costs are higher than in other regions of the country. Using the lower cost feed made margins appear larger than they actually were.In the 2018 Farm Bill, Leahy included a provision directing the National Agricultural Statistics Service to begin collecting data on premium alfalfa prices for the first time. With that data now available, USDA will now use this more accurate market information to calculate the feed price in the DMC.“The feed cost calculation has long been too low, failing to accurately account for the costs incurred by dairy farmers in Vermont and the Northeast in particular,” said Leahy, who also chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This change will benefit farmers now and in the future at a time when input costs continue to increase at the farm level. I applaud Secretary Vilsack for working quickly to improve the safety net and provide much-needed relief to producers in Vermont and across the country.”Overall, USDA expects to distribute nearly $23 million to 482 Vermont dairy farms through the DMC program this year.Farmers seeking to enroll in DMC or update their production numbers should contact their local USDA Service Center. The enrollment period for 2022 begins on December 13 and runs through February 18, 2022. To determine the appropriate level of DMC coverage for a specific dairy operation, producers can use the online dairy decision tool.The USDA statement on the changes to the DMC may be found here. # # # # # "

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-cuba,"Mr. LEAHY.  As someone who has observed the evolution of relations between the United States and Cuba for nearly 50 years, particularly since I first traveled there in 1999, I find the situation between our two countries today bewildering, tragic, and exasperating. Bewildering, because senior Administration officials – who have publicly and privately acknowledged that the 60-year policy of unilateral United States sanctions, isolation, and threats has failed to achieve any of its objectives and instead has hurt the Cuban people – have nevertheless adopted that same failed policy as their own.Tragic, because the policy has emboldened Cuba’s hardliners who have cracked down even more on citizens who dare to peacefully protest about shortages of food, medicine, and electricity, and against government repression.  And it has exacerbated the crisis that has engulfed the island due to the COVID pandemic and the government’s dysfunctional economic policies.Exasperating, because anyone who understands Cuba could have predicted what has happened since the Trump Administration reversed the Obama Administration’s policy of engagement and would have taken steps to mitigate it.  Instead, the current policy is making the situation even worse.For the past ten months I have urged the White House to not repeat past mistakes when it comes to our relations with Cuba’s government and the Cuban people, and to pursue a policy based on our long-term national interests.  I deeply regret that has not yet happened. Instead, this administration’s policy, so far, has been dictated by a tiny but vocal constituency in this country that has always opposed U.S. engagement with Cuba.  It is a policy that history has shown is doomed to fail.Currently, the United States and Cuba have diplomatic relations, but to what end?  There is no meaningful diplomacy being conducted, and our embassy in Havana and Cuba’s embassy in Washington are barely functioning.  Consular operations have ceased.  The dialogues we had with the Cuban Government on issues of mutual interest, from law enforcement to human rights to public health – dialogues the Trump Administration cut off – have not resumed.  How can this be in our national interest?While Cuba remains on the list of state sponsors of terrorism due to a last minute, politically driven, vindictive, and factually indefensible decision of the Trump Administration, we continue to have diplomatic relations.  Is this not irreconcilable? And whatever became of the Administration’s review of that deeply flawed designation which was promised months ago?Cultural, scientific, and educational exchanges have largely ended.  This is neither justified nor in our national interest.  The COVID pandemic provided an obvious opportunity for cooperation between American and Cuban scientists, but that opportunity, like so many others over the years, was squandered due to politics, distrust, and spite. The U.S. Treasury Department continues to block remittances from Cuban Americans to their relatives on the island, even though it is their money, not Treasury’s.  Shouldn’t Cuban Americans have the right to decide for themselves whether to send their own money to their relatives, rather than having that decision dictated by the White House?  Remittances help Cubans be less dependent on the government, improve their standard of living, and provide the seed capital for Cuba’s growing private sector which today comprises one-third of the Cuban workforce.The amount of remittances siphoned off by the Cuban government is a small fraction of what some have falsely claimed, and is no more than what other governments charge.  Let’s base our policy on facts, rather than on rumor and what plays well domestically.And Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida, is the only country besides North Korea where travel by Americans is severely restricted, despite our common history and cultural traditions.  It’s as ridiculous as it is self-defeating.The White House has repeatedly said that “democracy and human rights” are at the core of its policy toward Cuba.  Those are aspirations – laudable aspirations – but they are not a policy.  We all want to see a Cuba where political freedom and fundamental rights, especially freedom of expression, are respected and where an independent judiciary protects the right of due process.  Those rights are severely restricted in Cuba today as they are in many countries, including some recipients of hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S aid. Where we disagree is on how best to support the Cuban people’s struggle to obtain those rights. I have asked, but I have no idea what the Administration’s practical objectives are in Cuba, or how it proposes to achieve them.  After being told six months ago that the State Department was conducting a review of its policy, we have yet to see any change from the policy it inherited from the Trump Administration a year ago.  What happened to the review?  What did it say?Several Administration officials have justified the continuation of President Trump’s punishing sanctions because of the public protests in Cuba on July 11.  They say “everything changed” on July 11. Cuba is changing.  Access to social media and cell phones has dramatically increased.  Attitudes among the younger generation are changing.  The Cuban government is making historic, albeit hesitant, reforms to relax restrictions on private businesses.  President Obama’s opening to Cuba, which lasted only two years, was instrumental in helping to bring about these changes. Rather than acknowledge the unprecedented progress during that short period, those who defend a policy of sanctions say Obama’s policy of openness failed because Cuba remains a repressive, one-party state.  They completely ignore that the same was true for 50 years before Obama, and for the five years since Obama. When it comes to helping to bring positive changes to the people of Cuba, President Obama wins hands down.But today the United States is once again on the sidelines, clinging to an outdated policy that history has shown will not succeed.  In fact, it is having the opposite effect by denying opportunities to both Cubans and Americans.United States policy toward Cuba is replete with contradictions, hypocrisy, arrogance, and missed opportunities. Cuba is an impoverished country that poses no threat to the United States, yet we treat it as if it does largely because of our own actions. While we maintain an intricate web of unilateral sanctions that every nation in this hemisphere opposes, the Russians and Chinese are aggressively filling the vacuum as anyone who visits Cuba today can readily see. Engaging with a government whose policies are anathema to our own does not bestow legitimacy on that government’s leaders or acceptance of its repressive policies.  If that were the case, we should cease engaging not only with Cuba but with dozens of governments around the world including several U.S. partners, Saudi Arabia and Egypt being obvious examples. We condemn the arbitrary arrests, sham trials, laws that criminalize civil society, and the mistreatment and imprisonment of political dissidents.  These abuses are common to many countries, and we apply targeted sanctions and we restrict aid.  But for purely domestic political reasons we continue to impose a vast web of sweeping sanctions against Cuba, even when the Administration knows they have not worked.I have said it many times:  our policy toward Cuba needs to be guided – first and foremost – by what is in our national interest, not by what is in the interest of a tiny domestic constituency, and not by making demands that we know the Cubans won’t submit to. Engaging with Cuba affords U.S. diplomats and American citizens the opportunity to build relationships with Cuban counterparts and identify issues of common interest on which to make progress.  We saw that during the Obama administration, despite some who could not bring themselves to admit it. Over time, that is how we can then begin to address the more difficult issues that divide us, knowing that it is the Cuban people, not the United States, who will ultimately determine their country’s future. This Administration has had ten months to demonstrate that continuing the failed Trump policy of trying to bludgeon the Cuban authorities into submission can produce positive results.  There is not a shred of evidence that it can.  It never has.  Are we going to waste another year and another after that? I hope not, but that is what will happen if the White House does not change course and show the kind of thoughtful leadership on Cuba that we saw during the Obama Administration, and that was welcomed by a large majority of the American people. As Einstein said and so many have repeated, “insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”  This Administration can do better.  It needs to do better. # # # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/chairman-leahy-statement-on-the-further-extending-government-funding-act,"It is my hope that soon the Senate will vote on a bipartisan agreement to keep the government open and funded through February 18th.  I am pleased we reached this agreement.  The only thing worse than running the government under a continuing resolution (CR) is a government shutdown.  A shutdown only hurts the American people and wastes billions in taxpayer dollars. I am glad that the bill includes critical funding to support Afghan refugees as we help them get resettled here in the United States.  These brave men and women were our allies through 20 years of war, and we have an obligation to support them as they begin their new lives.      But this is not a victory lap.  We are two months into the fiscal year and appear no closer to getting an agreement on full-year appropriations bills.  With this vote we are buying time to complete those negotiations, and we must.  But in order to complete these negotiations, we have to begin them.  And my Republican colleagues still, to this day, refuse to come to the table.  The American people deserve better than that from their elected officials. On October 18, nearly a month and a half ago, Senate Democrats released a comprehensive offer in an effort to jumpstart these negotiations, and to let our Republican colleagues and the American people know our values.  Since then we have been met with nothing but deafening silence. Our offer was fair.  It provided a five percent increase for defense programs compared to last fiscal year, and a 13 percent increase for all other programs.  This is significantly higher than the 1.7 percent increase for defense proposed by the Biden Administration, and significantly lower than the 16 percent the Administration proposed for non-defense programs. That’s called compromise.  It’s how we get deals done. The five percent increase I offered on defense was not picked out of thin air.  It is the exact amount contained in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that has been before the Senate this week and was reported from Senate Armed Services Committee 23-3.  Work on that bill has stalled due to Republican obstructionism over a dispute about amendments.  To be clear though, none of the amendments Republicans are fighting for on the NDAA would increase total spending in the bill.  That’s because the five percent increase has bipartisan and bicameral support.  Republicans unanimously endorsed the five percent increase when the NDAA was marked up in the Senate Armed Services Committee.  And the five percent increase passed overwhelmingly in the House when it considered the NDAA over two months ago.  In the U.S. Congress, that is as close to consensus as we get. So why not take yes for an answer?  If I was a cynical person, I would think this delay was deliberate.  If I was a cynical person, I would think this delay was meant to drive us into a full-year continuing resolution.  Some in the Republican Party have even expressed this desire out loud.  But for a party that claims to care about our Nation’s defense, I suggest they do the math.  A full-year CR would not only reduce defense spending by $37 billion compared with the levels set forth in the NDAA that they claim to support, it would actually cut defense spending below last year’s levels. I have to ask those Republicans who are advocating for a full-year CR, is their support for our Nation’s security merely political theater?The impact a full-year CR would have on American families in all corners of this country is equally unthinkable.  Housing, education, child care, and critical health care programs – they are all at risk under a full-year continuing resolution.  I cannot possibly believe this is an outcome the other side of the aisle would endorse.  Yet here we are. Every week it seems, I receive letters from advocacy groups and industry associations, detailing the problems that would come from a full-year CR and asking that we do our job and enact full-year bills, including the National Defense Industrial Association, the Aerospace Industries Association, and numerous veterans groups.  I ask consent that a sampling of these letters be placed in the record.Let me be clear - refusing to come to the negotiating table undermines national security, inhibits our ability to invest in American families, and impedes our capability to respond to the coronavirus and its emerging variants.  It’s irresponsible.  And it is the reason we are here today, kicking the can down the road another two months. We have a job to do, and the bill we will soon vote on gives us roughly two months to do it. That is plenty of time.  But the Republican leadership needs to step up and engage, and they need to do it in the next few weeks.  Otherwise we will be right back here on February 18th. I urge all of my colleagues to vote AYE on the bill, and I urge my Republican colleagues to work with me and with the House to ensure that we do not have to pass another one in February.   I want to thank Vice Chairman Shelby for his partnership and cooperation in reaching this agreement, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the path forward over the coming weeks.# # # # # "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/senator-leahy-governor-scott-announce-63-million-in-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-funding-for-vermonts-clean-water-and-wastewater-revolving-loan-funds,"(THURSDAY, Dec. 2, 2021) – U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D) and Vermont Governor Phil Scott (R) on Thursday announced that Vermont will be receiving $63,041,000 in funding for drinking water systems and wastewater treatment as a result of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Biden late last month.The funds will go into the State’s revolving loan funds for drinking water and wastewater. Those funds are loaned or granted to municipalities for constructing, improving or expanding public drinking water and wastewater systems.  This funding is in addition to the State’s annual allocation of approximately $15.8 million for the revolving loan funds, bringing the total federal funding for 2022 to nearly $80 million.Leahy, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said:  “We all know Vermont needs more housing of all types, but one of the barriers to building that housing has long been a lack of sufficient water and wastewater infrastructure.  Vermonters across the state have expressed a desire for vibrant, walkable downtowns, where people can step outside their doors and walk to local businesses.  Realizing that vision requires precisely the infrastructure that these investments will fund.”Scott said:  “The historic investments included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, in addition to the American Rescue Plan, offer Vermont a once in a generation opportunity to invest in our water and sewer infrastructure, which is key to economic growth and ensuring safe and healthy communities.  I cannot thank Senator Leahy and our entire Congressional Delegation enough for their hard work securing these funds.  My Administration has made these kinds of investments a top priority, and because of their work, we will be able to have a huge impact on communities in all 14 counties, helping them build back more prosperous and resilient.""Currently, 200 Vermont communities lack a public wastewater system.  Communities across the state have been looking at creative ways to provide wastewater treatment at a scale appropriate for their community.  This funding will help them plan and build those systems.Leahy added that the funding for clean drinking water is just as essential.  “This money will also provide funding to hopefully end the scourge of lead contamination in our drinking water and help communities whose water supplies have been contaminated by so-called ‘forever chemicals.’”In his role as head of the Appropriations Committee, Leahy advocated for water and wastewater funding as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law.Announcing the funds, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan called the law’s funding for water “transformational.”  The law sends $50 billion to the EPA “to strengthen the nation's drinking water and wastewater systems – the single largest investment in water that the federal government has ever made,” Regan wrote.Most of the funding will go to state revolving loan funds.  However, the EPA has identified three priorities for how states use the funding: addressing PFAs (perfluoroalkyls and polyfluoroalkyls) contamination; assisting historically underserved communities, including rural communities; and, replacing lead pipes.Communities typically receive a combination of low-interest loans and grants from the revolving loan funds to help pay for projects developed locally.# # # # #"

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/gillibrand-leahy-collins-introduce-bill-to-lift-voices-of-dairy-farmers-by-calling-for-federal-milk-marketing-order-hearings-addressing-class-i-milk-pricing,"WASHINGTON (WEDNESDAY, Dec. 1, 2021) — U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) Wednesday introduced the bipartisan Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act, which would direct the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to initiate the process of holding Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) hearings within six months. The hearings would provide an opportunity for producers, who understand the dynamics of milk pricing first hand, to have a voice in formulating any potential changes in how the price of Class I milk is calculated.The introduction of this bill builds on a Senate Agriculture Subcommittee hearing in September on modernizing milk pricing and the Federal Milk Marketing Order system (FMMO) and would pave the way for critical FMMO reform in not just Class I pricing, but potentially other areas of need.“Even before the coronavirus pandemic upended the dairy economy, producers in Vermont and throughout the Northeast were already struggling through years of price volatility, market consolidation, and rising costs. Small- and mid-sized farms, the very same farms that have underpinned Vermont’s rural communities for generations, have long borne the brunt of these market forces. As Congress and USDA help farmers recover from the pandemic’s immediate impacts, it’s a critical time to reexamine the federal milk pricing system and ensure it works equitably for all farmers.” – Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee“When the dairy pricing system isn’t working for farmers, the economic ramifications are felt across the country. I heard from producers across the industry firsthand during my subcommittee hearing on dairy pricing and the message was clear– our dairy pricing system is inadequate, out of date, and working against producers. That’s why I introduced the Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act, a bill that would put the power back in farmers’ hands and bring the industry together to build a system that works for the 21st century dairy farmer. This bill is a great first step and I look forward to continuing efforts on broader FMMO modernization.” – Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security“Maine dairy farmers are resilient, and for years they have been weathering the storms of market instability and industry consolidation. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would help restore some stability to this sector by ensuring that USDA holds public hearings to receive farmers’ input on ways to correct the unintended consequences of a pre-pandemic pricing policy. Our dairy farmers have always worked tirelessly to provide high-quality, nutritious products for Maine people, and we must address the obstacles that threaten to prevent them from carrying on that tradition.” – Senator Susan CollinsExperts agree that the current milk pricing system is one of the most complicated economic systems in the country and leaves too many farmers without adequate pay, especially as costs rise and competition intensifies. Even before the pandemic, dairy farmers across the nation were facing the challenges of volatile milk prices, as well as increased competition from non-dairy “milk” products. This has led to a substantial loss of licensed dairy herds, with the United States losing almost 40,000 dairy herds since 2003. The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act would allow dairy producers and industry to consider and review proposals that could change Class I milk pricing, while also creating the opportunity for hearings to be held on other areas of the Federal Order system that are in need of reform.The Dairy Pricing Opportunity Act has drawn support from across the dairy industry, including from the American Farm Bureau Federation, New York Farm Bureau, American Dairy Coalition, Maine Dairy Industry Association, and Agri-Mark which provided testimony in favor of the bill.Class I, or fluid milk, is milk that is sold directly to consumers for drinking and is the milk for which farmers have traditionally been most highly paid.Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill, the Class I milk price was calculated using the “higher of” Class III (milk used to make cheese) or Class IV (milk used to make butter or milk powder) price plus the applicable Class I differential. This was changed in the most recent Farm Bill to an averaging method of Class III and Class IV plus $0.74. This change, compounded by government intervention in cheese markets as a result of the pandemic, has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost income for dairy farmers from May 2019 through April 2021. This combination of factors demonstrates that when there is a wide discrepancy between the Class III and Class IV price, the current mover will cause significant loss of Class I skim milk revenue relative to the previous Class I mover and what was intended by Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill change. This has led to increased calls from producers and industry for USDA to hold Federal Milk Marketing Order national hearings to resolve this issue with the Class I mover.For the full text of the bill, please click here. ### "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-hossam-bahgat,"Mr. LEAHY.  In June of this year, Egyptian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation concerning human rights defender Hossam Bahgat, in relation to a December 2020 tweet criticizing Egypt’s flawed parliamentary elections. The acts he has been accused of would not be considered crimes in the United States, nor in any other country that respects freedom of expression.Hossam Bahgat is the Executive Director and founder of one of the most respected Egyptian human rights organizations, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). His work has been recognized around the world, and in April 2021, Mr. Bahgat met with Secretary of State Blinken as part of a group of leading human rights activists. Other EIPR employees have also been targeted, along with many others as part of the government’s crackdown on independent civil society organizations. In February of 2020, EIPR researcher Patrick George Zaki was forcibly disappeared and reportedly tortured. A year ago, three of EIPR’s senior employees, Gasser Abdel-Razek, Karim Ennarah, and Mohamed Basheer, were also arbitrarily detained, effectively silencing them.Mr. Bahgat faces up to three years in prison and almost $20,000 in fines for reportedly doing nothing more than expressing views the Egyptian authorities consider to be “insulting” or “false news”. This is not the first time Mr. Bahgat has been targeted for his courageous and important reporting. In 2015, he was detained for three days after reporting on officers convicted of planning a coup, and was only released when the case received international attention from human rights groups and the United Nations.I have consistently spoken out about human rights in Egypt and in other countries, especially when governments crack down on human rights activists. The State Department publicly expressed concern in July of this year. Today, I am adding my voice to others who have raised concerns about Mr. Bahgat’s wrongful detention. A verdict in his case may be imminent. I hope the Egyptian government will abandon its persecution of Hossam Bahgat and his fellow human rights defenders. Like the Department of State, I have been urging the Egyptian authorities to make progress on human rights so our two countries can expand cooperation in other important areas. Further attempts to silence Mr. Bahgat and the other EIPR employees will needlessly impede those efforts.# # # #"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-comments-on-usda-accepting-applications-for-reconnect-broadband-funding,"(TUESDAY, Nov. 30, 2021) – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently accepting applications for $1.15 billion in funding through the ReConnect Program.  This program provides loans and grants to help Americans living in rural communities get access to quality, high-speed internet service.  Eligible applicants are state, local or territory governments, corporations, Native American Tribes, limited liability companies and cooperative organizations.This funding is available for projects that serve rural areas where at least 90 percent of the households lack broadband service at speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 20 Mbps upload.  USDA will give funding priority to projects that will serve people in low-density rural areas and areas lacking internet access services at speeds of at least 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload.Previously, areas of Vermont covered by a USDA Rural Utilities Service loan to the Vermont Telephone Company, Inc. (VTel) were not eligible for this program, excluding much of the state.  However, Senator Patrick Leahy, through his work as Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was able to change eligibility requirements so that any area of Vermont which does not meet the current minimum broadband service speed threshold of 100 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload is eligible for the ReConnect program. This change makes nearly every area of Vermont eligible for the program.  Only those service areas where VTel is providing fiber service are ineligible.  Leahy said:  “For too many years, Vermont has been handcuffed from receiving any funds from the USDA ReConnect grant program – that is why I fought so hard to include a provision in the Fiscal Year 2021 Appropriations Act to reopen this program to Vermont.  I am delighted to see the USDA follow through with this critical change.  Closing the digital divide in Vermont, particularly in the rural communities across the state, has long been a priority of mine as a United States Senator.  As a rural state, Vermont’s economic development hinges upon access to high-quality internet and telephone services, particularly as more Vermonters are working from home and more remote workers are moving to Vermont.  As school, work and access to health care shifted even further online, access to quality, high-speed broadband service will allow more Vermonters to learn, stay in touch with loved ones, and access essential government services from the comfort of their homes.”    Applicants must commit to building facilities capable of providing broadband service at speeds of 100 Mbps download and 100 Mbps upload to every location in a proposed service area at the same time.  In making funding decisions, USDA will also consider the economic needs of the community to be served; the extent to which a provider will offer affordable service options; a project’s commitment to strong labor standards; and whether a project is serving Tribal lands or is submitted by a local government, Tribal government, non-profit or cooperative.Applications for funding must be submitted through USDA Rural Development’s online application system on the ReConnect webpage.  For additional information, see the Oct. 22, 2021, Federal Register.This round of USDA ReConnect funding does not include the nearly $2 billion from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act that was signed into law by President Biden earlier this month.  Vermont will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state from the bipartisan infrastructure law because of the all state minimum secured through Senator Leahy’s work as Chairman of Senate Appropriations Committee. # # # # #  "
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-the-dismantling-of-democracy-in-el-salvador,"Like the Salvadoran people, I hoped that the 1992 Peace Accords would signal the beginning of a new era of democratic governance, justice, and a better life for the people of El Salvador after 12 years of a disastrous civil war.  Instead, rampant corruption, incompetence, and the unchecked personal ambitions of successive Salvadoran leaders to hold onto power have prevented the realization of those goals.  The officials responsible for the dismantling of the country’s democratic checks and balances have populist appeal, but they also share ominous characteristics with the military junta that ruled the country, with U.S. support, in the 1980s.  For many of the same reasons why I opposed U.S. military aid back then, the United States should not partner with the leaders of El Salvador’s today, who lack a basic commitment to democratic principles, justice, and fundamental rights, including the right of civil society to function without interference."
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-sanders-and-welch-laud-97-million-us-dot-investment-in-vermont-bicycle-pedestrian-infrastructure,"(FRIDAY, Nov. 19, 2021) -- Senator Patrick Leahy (D), Senator Bernie Sanders (I), Representative Peter Welch (D) and South Burlington City officials announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has awarded the City a Rebuilding American Infrastructure With Sustainability And Equity (RAISE) grant totaling $9,768,834, to build a bicycle and pedestrian bridge over Interstate 89.  The project will provide a safe and protected way for bicyclists and pedestrians to travel between South Burlington and Burlington.Leahy said:  “This project in the heart of Chittenden County will make it safer and easier for Vermonters to travel home and to work by bike or on foot.  Part of the federal strategy to limit the worst impacts of climate change must be to invest in non-vehicular transportation infrastructure.  Projects like this not only improve our transportation network but strengthen Vermont’s downtowns with environmentally sustainable projects.”  In his role as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Leahy included language in the Fiscal Year 2020 Omnibus Appropriations Bill to ensure that rural states like Vermont would receive a portion of these competitive grants.Sanders said:  “If we are going to combat the existential threat of climate change, strengthen our economy, and improve the lives of Vermonters across the state, we can and must transform our transportation systems away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable alternatives.  This project, which provides a safe, affordable, and sustainable way for Vermonters to travel between Burlington and South Burlington, is an important step in the right direction.”Welch said:  “Transportation is Vermont’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.  To do our part to combat climate change, it’s critical that we find ways to cut down on emissions, while improving quality of life for Vermonters.  This new project does just that: Vermonters will be able to travel safely by bike and on foot between South Burlington and Burlington, reducing our state’s greenhouse gas emissions while increasing accessibility to South Burlington’s new downtown center.”South Burlington City Manager Jessie Baker said:  “On behalf of the residents and City Council of South Burlington, we want to sincerely thank Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders, and Congressman Welch for their support of this transformational project for our community.  Envisioned to be a destination, not just a pathway, this bicycle and pedestrian bridge will connect our burgeoning City Center with our neighboring community and key destinations such as the University and the Hospital.  Modern infrastructure is critical to address the impacts of climate change.  We are thankful for the financial support to do this while also building community vibrancy.” The RAISE grant for the City of South Burlington will provide $9,768,834 for the construction of a pedestrian and bicycle crossing bridge over Interstate 89 for East-West travel.  Currently, pedestrians and bicyclists must transverse four on- and off-ramps next to high-speed traffic at the busiest interstate exchange in Vermont to cross the Interstate on U.S. Route 2.  This bridge will allow residents the choice of active, fuel-free, lower-cost and on-demand transportation, contributing to improved health and environmental outcomes.  By increasing transportation options in Chittenden County’s busiest transportation corridor, the investment will support South Burlington’s once-in-a-century downtown project to shift community growth away from sprawl and toward the newly developed City Center.The Vermont Congressional Delegation submitted a letter of support for the City of South Burlington’s RAISE Grant project in July, 2021, which is available here.This year USDOT received 765 eligible RAISE applications requesting more than $10.3 billion in funding.  Fewer than 100 applications were funded this year for the highly competitive RAISE program. # # # # #  "

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-of-senator-patrick-leahy-central-american-democracy-faces-existential-threats,"Democracy in Central America is facing existential threats.  In Guatemala, the Constitutional Court is under assault by the Congress and the Executive.  If the Court’s magistrates are replaced with cronies of the other branches of government, any semblance of a credible justice system will be lost. In Honduras, corruption permeates the highest ranks of government, civil society activists are under attack, and the justice system is complicit in perpetuating lawlessness and impunity. El Salvador is becoming a one party state, where the separation of powers has little meaning and the president behaves as though he is the government. The Nicaraguan government is, by any definition, a dictatorship that will use whatever means it deems necessary to try to prevent a free and fair election.Meanwhile, the Central American people struggle with abject poverty, food insecurity, gang violence, a lack of confidence or trust in their leaders, and little hope for a better future.  It is no wonder that so many of them risk everything and leave their homes for the possibility, no matter how remote, of safety and economic opportunity elsewhere.Without good governance, no amount of foreign aid will fundamentally change this dynamic. The Biden Administration and the U.S. Congress should reassess our relations with these governments that are the antithesis of credible partners, and in doing so reaffirm our strong commitment to defending the rights of the Central American people and the principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  # # # # #"

https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-hails-final-passage-of-the-american-rescue-plan,"WASHINGTON (WEDNESDAY, March 10, 2021) – Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, hailed House passage Wednesday of the American Rescue Plan, which will bring much-needed financial relief to Vermonters and help to Vermont communities.  The House passed the final version of the package that the Senate had passed on Saturday.Leahy said that through direct assistance to Vermonters, financial aid for the State of Vermont and local municipalities, and dozens of other programs, the package will direct more than $2.7 billion in formula funding and economic payments to the state and to individual Vermonters.  The bill now goes to the desk of President Biden, who has said he will sign it.  Leahy said the Biden Administration will begin delivering some of these resources to Vermonters before the end of the month.Leahy said:  “From family budgets, to health care delivery, to students and business owners struggling with slow or no broadband, the pandemic has strained nearly every aspect of life across Vermont.  My top priority for this relief package has been to ensure that Vermont has the resources we need to address our current needs and to chart a course of recovery out of the pandemic.  The American Rescue Plan delivers on that goal by making significant investments in our infrastructure to help us end this pandemic and making the largest investments to address poverty in over a generation.”As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Leahy worked to include provisions across many programs that ensure all states would receive equitable resources, regardless of their population size.   While additional resources will come into Vermont through competitive programs, unemployment insurance benefits, and other means, he said Vermont should receive an estimated $2.7 billion from the following sources: # # # # # "

The bipartisan bill introduced in the House mirrors legislation we introduced in the last Congress. Unfortunately, that bill was blocked in the Senate last Congress and didn’t even receive a vote in committee.            “This isn’t a Democratic bill or a Republican bill – it’s a survivors’ bill. It was written with the support of the people on the front lines who know what is needed in the real world. It preserves protections made in previous reauthorizations and also makes meaningful improvements to the law.            “A quarter of American women will be the victim of physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetimes. More than a third of all women will be raped, assaulted or stalked. Sadly, according to U.S. News and World Report, domestic violence has spiked 81 percent during the coronavirus pandemic.            “We look forward to working with and under the leadership of Chairman Durbin to advance this important legislation. It’s far past time for this bill’s important updates to be put in place and ensure that women across the country receive these reasonable protections.”###[Both Leahy and Feinstein are former chairs of the Judiciary Committee.  Leahy is the principal author and sponsor of the most recent VAWA law.  Leahy’s bill both strengthened and renewed VAWA’s programs.] Adam Russell (Feinstein), 202-224-9629David Carle (Leahy), 301-872-0665"
https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/statement-on-senate-passage-of-the-american-rescue-plan,"Across our country, in every state, in every community, Americans are suffering.  It doesn’t matter if they are represented in Congress by Republicans or by Democrats, or whether they live in rural communities or in urban centers.  All have suffered under an unprecedented health and economic crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 520,000, and of more than 2.58 million people around the world.  Families are living under the tremendous burden of not knowing how they will pay their rent, feed their families, return to work fulltime, or when their children will be able to safely return to school.  This afternoon, the Senate met this crisis by passing bold and urgently needed relief that was long overdue. While the distribution of vaccines has finally begun to turn the page on the pandemic, this crisis is far from over, and the American Rescue Plan will provide the resources we need in the weeks and months ahead.  It provides new resources to state and local governments, supports vaccine distribution, invests in students’ safety, provides a targeted round of additional support directly to qualifying Americans, and includes a needed extension of unemployment benefits for the millions of people who are still out of work through no fault of their own.It is disappointing that Republicans – after months of delay last year – again put partisan politics ahead of the needs of the American people.  The American Rescue Plan supports American families in every corner of the United States – whether those states are represented by Republicans in the Senate, or by Democrats.  All will benefit from this bold plan. It supports small communities and large cities.  It is not a partisan bill, and poll after poll suggests it has broad support.  It is a popular bill.As we inch closer to moving beyond this pandemic, we must, too, move beyond the partisan rancor, and get to work to meet the real needs of the American people.# # # # #  "

And it will deliver support to the states to address shortcomings in rural communities that the pandemic has brought to bear, including the simple necessity of reliable, accessible internet access.Every American, whether they are represented in the Senate by a Republican or a Democrat – or both – will benefit from this package.  Every American.  Delay after delay last year denied Vermonters and all Americans the essential relief they need.  Dilatory tactics have no place here, not when the country continues to struggle, and when we are on the cusp of truly getting a handle on this pandemic.  Vermonters can be confident that our state is getting its fair share in this package.  It’s time to pass it, and do for the American people what we were sent here to do – lead, and govern.# # # # # "
