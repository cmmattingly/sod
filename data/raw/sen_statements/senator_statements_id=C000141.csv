These funds from the U.S. Department of Treasury, under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP), will be directed to Harbor Bank of Maryland, a Baltimore-based Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and Minority Depository Institution (MDI).“The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harmed the financial well-being of many members of our minority-owned small business community,” said the lawmakers. “As we recover, we must continue to support those who are providing capital and loans to our hardest hit small businesses so they can fully bounce back and generate economic growth and new job opportunities. We were proud to fight for this funding and will continue to invest in these institutions as they provide needed support to small businesses that help strengthen our communities.”The lawmakers fought to increase emergency funding for CDFIs throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to boost local economies in low-income, rural, and urban communities that were disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CDFIs are mission-driven financial institutions that serve as a direct lifeline for struggling communities by providing financing to small businesses, non-profits, affordable housing, and community development projects.CDFIs and MDIs often make smaller loans and work with borrowers who face barriers in our economy and may require more time-intensive and personalized technical support. ECIP investments are designed to support mission-driven institutions to increase responsible investments in low- and moderate-income and minority communities that have disproportionately suffered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/maryland-congressional-delegation-announces-over-340-million-in-infrastructure-funding-to-bolster-public-transit-across-the-state,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced $348,108,466 in federal funding for Maryland in fiscal year 2022 to strengthen public transit infrastructure across the state. The lawmakers helped secure this increased federal funding through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration (FTA) – which can be used to modernize aging infrastructure, upgrade vehicles, expand accessibility of transit stations, improve safety, address equity in transportation, and more – through the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“Every day, Marylanders rely on public transit to get where they need to go. Greater federal investment in public transit is essential to make transit safer and more reliable and to reduce pollution and strengthen our economy,” the lawmakers said. “That’s why we worked to increase funding for transit that will create new, good-paying jobs by building infrastructure, upgrading vehicles to newer and cleaner models, and improving service for Maryland riders. We will continue to fight for federal investments to improve our state’s transportation infrastructure.”The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a once-in-a-generation investment in American infrastructure that will provide more than $7 billion in federal funding directly to Maryland over five years to strengthen our infrastructure from transit systems to roads and bridges to water infrastructure, broadband connectivity, and more. The law includes measures on workforce development, equity, and climate change. The lawmakers worked to secure passage of this law in Congress, which will help spur job creation, enhance U.S. competitiveness, and make our transportation systems more sustainable and equitable. Nationally, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will provide $69.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years representing the largest federal investment in public transit in history. It will repair and upgrade crumbling infrastructure, modernize bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users through a new program with $1.75 billion in dedicated funding, and bring transit service to new communities with an additional $8 billion for Capital Investment Grants. The IIJA will help replace thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles through an additional $21.3 billion, 5 percent of which is dedicated to training the transit workforce to maintain and operate these vehicles. Additionally, it will benefit communities of color who have historically had more limited access to transit despite being twice as likely to take public transportation.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-votes-to-confirm-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-to-the-supreme-court,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today issued the following statement on the bipartisan confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the 116th justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  “As a senator, one of the most important responsibilities I have under the Constitution is whether to provide my consent to a president’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. Today, I cast my vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court because she is one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to this lifetime position. She has sterling legal credentials, depth of knowledge, immense integrity and – as we witnessed over days of marathon hearings – incredible judicial temperament. The Supreme Court makes profound decisions every day that affect the lives of people across this country and it is clear that Judge Jackson will work to preserve and protect the Constitution, and to make sure that all Americans are treated equally under the law. “This is an historic day for our nation. As both the first public defender and first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, Judge Jackson will bring needed diversity of perspective and experience to the court. Based on her record, I believe she will be a powerful, consensus-building jurist, as well as a role model for so many.”Senator Cardin’s floor statement on the nomination can be viewed on YouTube here.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-wicker-urge-passage-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-additional-relief-to-restaurants-and-other-hard-hit-industries,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today urged passage of their legislation to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) and provide relief to small businesses in other industries that have experienced significant declines in revenue, including gyms, minor league sports, buses and ferries, among others.“More than two years into the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of restaurants and other small businesses are still fighting to survive, while thousands have already closed their doors for good,” Senator Cardin said. “Congress cannot mistake the hopeful signs of recovery in our economy for signs that restaurants, bars, and other hard-hit small businesses no longer need help. Congress must pass this bill so the SBA can provide relief to the more than 177,000 RRF applicants who remain unfunded and to other hard hit industries.”“Congress took action to provide much needed relief to restaurants and other businesses during the height of the pandemic, but the initial program left thousands of eligible restaurants and their employees without any assistance. As our economy recovers from a difficult two years, it is important to replenish this fund as a matter of fairness,” Senator Wicker said.Last August, Cardin, Wicker and Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced bipartisan legislation to provide additional funding to RRF.The program was created in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and provided a $28.6 billion appropriation to provide eligible entities with grants equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss up to $10 million and no more than $5 million per location. On June 30, 2021, the Small Business Administration (SBA) announced the closure of RRF due to the exhaustion of funds. SBA also announced that more than 278,000 applications were submitted to the program, but the agency was only able to fund approximately 101,000 of them.The Cardin-Wicker measure would provide an additional $40 billion to RRF, which is enough to provide all applicants that have not received any assistance with full grants. The measure also includes enhanced auditing requirements for new and existing grants to prevent fraud, as well as new transparency and customer service requirements to ensure that SBA shares information with Congress and the public.There are other bipartisan small business assistance proposals in the bill, including:  Grants for Gyms: $2 billion for aid to gyms that have suffered losses of greater than 25 percent. Based on the bipartisan GYMS Act introduced by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).Grants for Minor League Sports Teams: $500 million for aid to minor league sports teams that lost at least 50 percent of their revenue during the first year of the pandemic. Based on the bipartisan Minor League Baseball Relief Act introduced by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.).Grants for Live Venue Service and Support Companies: $2 billion for aid to businesses that support live events that have suffered losses of greater than 25 percent. Based on the bipartisan MUSIC Act introduced by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).Grants for Border Businesses: $1.415 billion for aid to very small businesses located in areas adjacent to land ports of entry that were subject to closure during the pandemic. Based on the bipartisan Border Business COVID-19 Rescue Act introduced by Senators Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas).Grants for Exclave Communities: $85 million to small businesses located in communities in Alaska, Washington, and Minnesota were not accessible from the United States during the pandemic due to border closures, including $75 million for communities in southeastern Alaska that were completely cut off.Grants for Buses and Ferries: Provides an additional $2 billion for grant funding to the Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) program for buses and ferries, including commuter buses, school buses, charter buses, and passenger ferries. Based on the bipartisan CERTS legislation proposed by Senators Susan Collins (I-Maine) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.).Save Our Stages Extension Act: Extends the date by which Shuttered Venue Operator Grant recipients may incur reimbursable expenses. Bill was introduced by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas).PPP Transportation Contractor Fix: Prevents certain government contractors that received PPP loans from being unfairly disqualified from loan forgiveness.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-calls-permanent-reauthorization-of-global-magnitsky-sanctions-a-clear-message-to-putin,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Chair of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, issued the following remarks Thursday after the Senate unanimously approved, by a 100-0 roll call vote, the permanent reauthorization of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act (GloMag). Authored by Cardin, the 6-year-old law gives the United States the power to deny entry to the United States and to seize property of individuals worldwide who commit gross violations of human rights, and those who commit acts of significant corruption.“Magnitsky sanctions, first started a decade ago with the Sergei Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act that applied only to Russia, and made worldwide with the Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act, have been transformative in holding accountable the individuals responsible for violations of human rights and significant corruption. It is no wonder that Vladimir Putin tried to stop these efforts even before they were enacted into law.“Today, as Putin commits war crimes against the people of Ukraine, unanimous passage of permanent GloMag reauthorization sends a strong signal to him and other dictators and kleptocrats that there will be personal consequences for human rights violators and corrupt actors. The United States of America sets no time limit on defending human rights and battling corruption.“My sincere thanks to Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) for their consistent support for the more robust version of the GloMag reauthorization that was adopted in the House last month by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 424-to-8. The House bill would have codified Executive Order 13818 as issued in December 2017. It is unfortunate that a very small number of Senate Republicans were able to block adoption of the House version, even though the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed it unanimously last June. While the Executive Order remains in place today, we will continue to pursue ways to strengthen the now-permanent Global Magnitsky statute, which provides an important and proven tool against Putin and others who have previously thought they were beyond the rule of law.“Had the Senate failed to reauthorize the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, it would have expired this year at the very time it was needed to hold Putin accountable for his heinous actions,” Senator Cardin added.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) were original cosponsors of the legislation.“We introduced this measure in January as part of a broad campaign to deter Russia from making a terrible mistake, which the Kremlin has nevertheless now done.  This horrific, unnecessary and unprovoked war against Ukraine has to end – with Ukraine prevailing against Russia’s aggression,” said Senator Cardin. “Our bipartisan bill streamlines the president’s ability to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, defend innocent civilians and also to protect our frontline NATO allies who may become targets of a desperate Vladimir Putin.”“How we address a threat against one democracy’s sovereignty sends a message about how we’ll act on others, and adversaries like China are watching,” said Senator Cornyn. “If we believe America supports freedom and democracy, we must provide Ukraine with the weapons necessary to protect its citizens, and I urge the House to pass this legislation as soon as possible lest our promises to our allies ring hallow.”Background:As part of his Arms Export Control Act authority, the President can currently lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest. However, bureaucratic barriers and other limitations make these authorities impractical for the current crisis facing Ukraine. This enhanced lend-lease authority would be specific to Ukraine to help remove obstacles to lending arms to Ukraine. It would not create a new program but would streamline the President’s current authority to lend the defense articles necessary to defend civilian populations in Ukraine.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-flexibilities-to-feed-children,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON –  U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) joined Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in introducing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act. The bill extends USDA school meal flexibilities from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of our schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give our schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed. The bill will also help schools transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. USDA requested this authority be extended in the FY22 omnibus/Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.“The pandemic has heightened financial hardships and many families are still facing food insecurity,” said Senator Cardin. “No matter if a child is in school or on summer break, they deserve access to healthy and nutritious meals. Healthy options are essential to development and will help prevent chronic illnesses, maintain energy levels and stabilize moods. I will continue to work to provide our local school systems with the flexibilities they need to support the more than 43 percent of Maryland students who count on these school meals.”“No child should go hungry. But for many struggling families providing consistent and healthy meals can be a daily struggle. These challenges are only worsened when school lets out for the summer. To fix this problem, we must keep working to ensure that every child’s needs are met year-round,” said Senator Van Hollen. “That’s why we’ve introduced this legislation to ensure USDA can provide the flexibility necessary for our schools to continue these programs to meet the needs of our communities and help reduce child hunger in Maryland and across the country.” “We should make it easier for kids to get the meals they need – not harder. Our bill cuts red tape and keeps the priority on giving children the healthy meals they need and deserve,” said Senator Stabenow. “As we come out of this pandemic, schools are doing their best – but it takes time for them to transition back to their operations before COVID. We can’t let hungry kids get caught in the middle. Without this support, up to 30 million kids who get food at school will see their essential breakfast and lunch meals disrupted. And millions of hungry kids who rely on summer meals may have nowhere to go to get food.”“For far too many children in Alaska and across the nation, hunger is a daily reality. For many students, the meals served at school, and in summer or afterschool programs, may be the only meals they can count on,” said Senator Murkowski. “Following the widespread disruptions caused by COVID, life is beginning to feel more ‘normal’ for some. However, many Alaskans are still working to overcome the economic fallout from the pandemic and many schools continue to struggle with supply shortages and higher prices. That’s why I’m glad to join Senator Stabenow and my Senate colleagues in a push to allow USDA to extend vital support for school nutrition programs and preventing barriers that may prevent students from receiving a healthy meal.” In addition to Senators Van Hollen, Cardin, Stabenow, and Murkowski, this legislation is cosponsored by Senators Heinrich (D-N.M.), Collins (R-Maine), Manchin (D-W.Va.), Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Casey (D-Pa.), Smith (D-Minn.), Brown (D-Ohio), Baldwin (D-Wis.), Booker (D-N.J.), Lujan (D-N.M.), Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Warnock (D-Ga.), Markey (D-Mass.), Hirono (D-Hawaii), Duckworth (D-Ill.), Sanders (I-Vt.), Reed (D-R.I.), Leahy (D-Vt.), Wyden (D-Ore.), Shaheen (D-N.H.), Hassan (D-N.H.), Bennet (D-Colo.), Merkley (D-Ore.), Warren (D-Mass.), Padilla (D-Calif.), Warner (D-Va.), Murray (D-Wash.), Coons (D-Del.), Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Carper (D-Del.), Schatz (D-Hawaii), Peters (D-Mich.), King (I-Maine.), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Rosen (D-Nev.), Menendez (D-N.J.), Kaine (D-Va.), Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Murphy (D-Conn.), Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Kelly (D-Ariz.), Sinema (D-Ariz.), Ossoff (D-Ga.), Tester (D-Mont.), Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Cantwell (D-Wash).###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer and Andy Harris (all Md.) today announced the addition of three historical sites in Maryland as new listings to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program. The new listings join over 700 sites, facilities, and programs already in the Network that provide insight into the experiences of those who bravely escaped slavery and those who assisted them.“Maryland has a rich legacy of abolitionists and suffragists including the iconic Harriet Tubman,” said Senator Cardin. “I laud the addition of these sites to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. This action will allow Marylanders to further visit and understand our state’s – and nation’s – complex history and honor the contributions of courageous individuals who tirelessly worked towards the goals of freedom and equality for all.”“We applaud the addition of these sites to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom after recently celebrating the 200th birthday of Maryland’s own ‘conductor’ of the Underground Railroad – Harriet Tubman. Our civil rights figures and landmarks stand as pillars of freedom and teach us lessons in moral courage, reminding us and future generations to be steadfast in the fight for equality and justice,” said Senator Van Hollen. “We will continue to highlight these stories to preserve their place in history, shining light on the men and women who courageously escaped slavery and those who sought to end this evil institution.” “Brave and courageous Marylanders like Harriet Tubman put their lives on the line and sacrificed at great costs so that others could live a life free from bondage,” said Congressman Hoyer. “On the 200th birthday of Harriet Tubman, I am proud that Maryland is adding three new sites to the National Underground Railroad Network to recognize her efforts and her strength in the face of injustice. I hope that every Marylander has the opportunity to explore these new sites, reflect on our history and honor heroes like Harriet Tubman who challenged us to uphold our founding principles.”    “As we celebrate the 200th birthday of our most famous conductor and Dorchester County native Harriet Tubman, I’m excited to hear about the addition of these sites to the Underground Railroad Network.  It is inspiring to read about their historical significance and I look forward to continuing to support the activities and research that goes into documenting these historic sites,” said Congressman Harris.New historical sites being added to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program:The National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom serves to honor, preserve, and promote the history of resistance to enslavement through escape and flight, which continues to inspire people worldwide. The Network currently represents over 700 locations in 39 states, plus Washington D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Through its mission, the Network to Freedom helps to advance the idea that all human beings embrace the right to self-determination and freedom from oppression.### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume and David Trone (All D-Md.) with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig. The meeting served as a follow up to letters from Team Maryland, as well as other Senate and House members, over the last few months, as they continue to prioritize ensuring the IRS is more responsive to the requests of Marylanders, many of whom have been caught in the massive backlog currently facing the agency that has been spread thin over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the 2021 tax season ends in less than two weeks on April 18, millions of returns remain unprocessed from the 2020 tax-filing season.“There is a crisis at the IRS that needs to be addressed. We thank the IRS workers who, despite staffing shortages in the midst of a pandemic, were tasked with processing taxes, as well as Economic Impact Payments, Child Tax Credit advances, Employee Retention Tax Credits and other critical COVID-related programs. The recent FY 2022 spending package and the president’s budget seek to reverse the agency’s historic underfunding, but we still need high-level action from IRS leadership to reduce the backlog and put the IRS on a better path to improved customer service,” the lawmakers said after the meeting.“We made clear to Commissioner Rettig that as the IRS is given more tools and resources to accomplish its mission, we need to know that our constituents will see relief soon. We fully acknowledge the strain the IRS and its workers have endured, but there is more that must be done to overcome these immense challenges.”PHOTO (Left to right, top to bottom rows) IRS Chief Taxpayer Experience Officer Ken CorbinIRS Commissioner Charles RettigIRS Deputy Chief Financial Officer Bryan MusselmanU.S. Senator Ben CardinU.S. Rep.

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced $45,708,416 in federal funding to help Marylanders lower utility costs by making energy efficient upgrades to their homes. The lawmakers helped secure this federal funding through the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The funds will improve the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of Marylanders, especially for low-income households and vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, saving households on average $372 or more every year. Funding was provided through the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program and will be delivered to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development’s Housing and Building Energy Programs. “As Americans face the pressures of higher costs, making energy-efficient improvements to their homes can help lower their utility bills and save their hard-earned money. This investment not only benefits Marylanders’ pocketbooks, but also protects public health, improves energy efficiency, and creates jobs in our communities. Simply put, this is a win-win for Maryland homeowners and our environment. Investments like these are exactly why we fought to pass the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act,” the lawmakers said.The U.S. Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) reduces energy costs for low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while ensuring health and safety. As the nation’s single largest residential whole-house energy efficiency program, WAP has created an industry producing new jobs and technologies while helping the most vulnerable families across the country. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is making historic investments in WAP and American infrastructure and providing more than $7 billion directly to Maryland. These investments will help strengthen climate resilience, improve our environment, create good-paying American jobs, and rebuild and repair our roads, bridges, transit systems, and more.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-portman-urge-president-biden-to-revoke-tax-related-benefits-extended-to-russia,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) sent a letter to President Biden urging him to consider new options to target Russia’s economy, focusing on suspending both the U.S.-Russia tax treaty and the exchange and sharing of tax information.“In light of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we believe the United States should consider all options to isolate Russia and make clear that there will be consequences for its actions. This should include changes to the tax relationship between the United States and Russia. Preferential tax treatment with the United States is a privilege not a right,” wrote the senators.The Income Tax Convention was signed and submitted to the Senate in 1992 and went into effect in 1994, making it easier for U.S. companies to invest in Russia. Given the situation in Ukraine, suspending this treaty would be a viable option to continue the expansion of punitive measures against Russia. The letter also urges President Biden to follow the United Kingdom in suspending the exchange and sharing of tax information, which is used to promote the administration and compliance of tax laws.  You can read the full letter here or below.Dear Mr. President:In light of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we believe the United States should consider all options to isolate Russia and make clear that there will be consequences for its actions. This should include changes to the tax relationship between the United States and Russia. Preferential tax treatment with the United States is a privilege not a right. You, and your administration, possess numerous authorities to bring additional pressure to bear on Russia with respect to taxation, and we urge you to continue to work with our allies in exploring and utilizing every means appropriate in this effort.While there are a number of tax-related policy options to consider, we believe it important to highlight two specific actions, which can be accomplished swiftly and to great effect.The United States has a number of agreements to facilitate the exchange of tax information to effectively administer and enforce tax laws. Specifically, the Income Tax Convention between the United States and the Russian Federation contains such tax information provisions. We do not believe it is in the interest of the United States to engage in information exchange under this Convention and urge you to consider suspending this practice. We were pleased that the United Kingdom has already taken such action, and we believe suspension of tax information exchange represents another opportunity to work closely with our allies in response to Russia’s invasion.An additional step would also be to consider suspending the entire Income Tax Convention with Russia. Suspending the tax treaty with Russia would discourage continued U.S. investment in the Russian Federation and prevent preferential tax treatment for Russian businesses and investments in the United States. Such a move would not be unprecedented; in 1986, the United States terminated a tax treaty with South Africa as part of our country’s response to apartheid. And on the eve of World War II, President Roosevelt unilaterally suspended the International Load Line Convention given the country’s unique foreign policy position at the time. Even President George Washington suspended the Franco-American Treaty of Alliance, one of the most important treaties in our nation’s history, in the wake of the French Revolution. Given the unique foreign policy crisis presented by Russia’s invasion, it is within the rights of the United States to suspend our tax treaty until adherence to the treaty returns to the orbit of our national interest.We fully support the sanctions that have been imposed to isolate Vladimir Putin’s war machine and degrade the engine that finances Russia’s hostilities. However, as Russia escalates its aggression and disregards the lives of innocents, the United States must continue to explore new ways to pressure Moscow and utilize every tool in our tool box. Opportunities to do so exist in the options we have highlighted, and we urge your consideration of these options as you continue to coordinate our response with our allies. Thank you for your consideration of this request.Sincerely,###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

This report revealed an undercount of Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Some Other Race populations.”According to the Census’ post-enumeration report, the 2020 Census undercounted the Hispanic or Latino population by nearly 5%, up from 1.54% in 2010. Black or African American individuals were uncounted by 3.3%, and American Indian or Alaska Natives in reservations were undercounted by 5.64% – the most significant undercount margin of all demographic groups.The Senators acknowledged the pandemic affected the Bureau’s outreach, data collection process, and other aspects of the census operation. However, they highlighted that before the COVID-19 pandemic the previous administration made significant efforts to depress participation in the 2020 Census, particularly in immigrant and Latino communities.“The prior Administration insisted on numerous occasions the inclusion of a citizenship question in the non-partisan 2020 Census. It went so far as to ask the Supreme Court to review a case and decide whether a citizenship question could be included in the 2020 Census,” added the Senators. “Although this question was ultimately not included in the 2020 Census, and despite numerous outreach efforts, these actions, and the public coverage thereof, undoubtedly influenced minority communities’ participation in the latest Census, particularly in the Hispanic and Latino populations.”The Senators concluded by focusing on how the undercounting of Latino, Black and Native American individuals deeply affects already disadvantaged and underserved communities.“As you are aware, an accurate decennial census is not only a constitutional responsibility of the federal government, but its results determine the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, guide the allocation of nearly $1.5 trillion in federal funds annually, and are used to draw legislative districts within the states,” concluded the Senators. “We ask the U.S. Census Bureau to consider ways to correct the undercount in the annual population estimates derived from 2020 Census data and reiterate its commitment to counting all persons in future decennial censuses.”Joining Senators Cardin, Menendez, Booker, Hirono, and Schatz in signing this letter were Sens.

We request information regarding steps that the U.S. Census Bureau is taking to ensure that every person is counted and how we can jointly address the decades-long problem of undercounting minority communities in the country.Earlier this month, the U.S. Census Bureau released its National Census Coverage Estimates for People in the United States by Demographic Characteristics, which is a 2020 Post-Enumeration Survey Estimation Report. This report revealed an undercount of Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Some Other Race populations.[1] The 2020 Census undercounted the Hispanic or Latino population by 4.99 percent, up from 1.54 percent in 2010 and more than three times the percentage of the previous census. Similarly, individuals who identify as “some other race” had an undercount three times that of the previous census. In the case of Black or African American individuals, the report revealed an undercount of 3.30 percent, nearly twice the undercount of the 2010 Census. Finally, American Indian or Alaska Natives in reservations had the greatest undercount of all at 5.64 percent.We are aware of the challenges the U.S. Census Bureau faced to conduct the 2020 Census. A devastating pandemic was detrimental to the Bureau’s outreach, data collection process, and other aspects of the census operation. However, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump Administration made significant efforts to depress participation in the 2020 Census, particularly in immigrant and Latino communities. The prior Administration insisted on numerous occasions on the inclusion of a citizenship question in the non-partisan 2020 Census. It went so far as to ask the Supreme Court to review a case and decide whether a citizenship question could be included in the 2020 Census.[2] Although this question was ultimately not included in the 2020 Census, and despite numerous outreach efforts, these actions, and the public coverage thereof, undoubtedly influenced minority communities’ participation in the latest Census, particularly in the Hispanic and Latino populations.The undercounting of Latino, Black and Native American individuals deeply affects already disadvantaged communities in a plethora of ways, most acutely in the allocation of federal funding and government representation. As you are aware, an accurate decennial census is not only a constitutional responsibility of the federal government, but its results determine the apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, guide the allocation of nearly $1.5 trillion in federal funds annually, and are used to draw legislative districts within the states. We ask the U.S. Census Bureau to consider ways to correct the undercount in the annual population estimates derived from 2020 Census data and reiterate its commitment to counting all persons in future decennial censuses. In addition, we ask the Bureau to provide a plan for how it will ensure such undercounting in the four groups outlined above does not repeat itself.We appreciate your attention to this issue­­­­­, and we look forward to your response.###[1] https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/coverage-measurement/pes/national-census-coverage-estimates-by-demographic-characteristics.pdf [2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-quickly-take-up-census-citizenship-question/2019/01/22/93734014-1e73-11e9-8e21-59a09ff1e2a1_story.html Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

These visas are vital to the small businesses that make up Maryland’s crab and seafood industries, and the supplemental release follows efforts from the Senators to press DHS to provide more visas after only one of Maryland’s ten crab processors was selected to receive them. The Senators also worked to secure language with the fiscal year 2022 omnibus to provide DHS with the authority to release additional visas.“The small businesses that make up Maryland’s crab and seafood industries are vital to our local Shore economy and our communities. Having a reliable workforce is crucial to their success, and the H-2B visa program is essential to building and maintaining that workforce. That is why we’ve fought to deliver additional visas for our Maryland businesses – including by securing language in this year’s funding bill to ensure DHS had the authority to take action. We’re glad to see them heed our calls to provide these additional visas, and we urge them to get them out as quickly as possible to the businesses that need them.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-portman-praise-house-passage-of-retirement-security-reforms,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) praised the House of Representatives today for passing the Securing a Strong Retirement Act by a vote of 414-5. Cardin and Portman, longtime champions of retirement security, are cosponsoring companion legislation in the Senate. Cardin and Portman praised this commonsense, bipartisan bill, led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.-01) and Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-Tex.-08), that would make significant improvements to the retirement system for all. It includes increasing retirement savings, improving the retirement system and helping small businesses, younger workers and women.The Neal-Brady legislation has significant overlap with the Cardin-Portman Retirement Security and Savings Act (S.1770). Both bills would allow people to save more for retirement, help small businesses offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans, and provide more certainty and flexibility during Americans’ retirement years, ensuring the opportunity for all to have a dignity in their retirement years.“Americans need to save more so they can retire with the dignity and stability they deserve. It’s an ongoing struggle. We are encouraged with the ongoing bipartisan and bicameral interest in necessary reforms that will help more Americans save more for retirement,” Senators Cardin and Portman said. “We will continue to support solutions that help increase savings, expand access to retirement plans for working families, and promote lifetime income solutions. This is an area of broad, bipartisan consensus. We look forward to working with Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo and our House colleagues to move this legislation through the Finance Committee as swiftly as possible so that it can get to the president’s desk.” ###F405Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer (D-Md), Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Congressman Anthony Brown (D-Md.), Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks today released the following statement after the President unveiled his budget for the Fiscal Year 2023, which includes language to ensure the FBI will have a new, consolidated suburban headquarters that will house 7,500 employees.“We are pleased that President Biden’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2023 includes language for the new FBI headquarters. This has been a top priority for Team Maryland: the new campus will ensure that 7,500 employees have a suitable and secure location to protect our national security. The President’s budget is evidence that his Administration is serious about moving forward with a consolidated headquarters that can effectively serve the American people. We look forward to working with President Biden and his Administration to continue advancing this project, and are confident the Maryland sites in Greenbelt and Landover are the best locations for a consolidated FBI headquarters location. We join in thanking President Biden for his dedication to this important priority, and we continue to advocate for the Greenbelt and Landover sites as they are the best locations for this project.”    Since 2004, the FBI has been discussing a new consolidated headquarters with the GSA. Such a facility would consolidate the headquarters employees currently located at the Hoover Building with others in leased locations around the National Capital Region. During the Obama Administration, the GSA and FBI identified two sites in Maryland that met the needs of the FBI for a new headquarters – Greenbelt and Landover. The Trump Administration abruptly stopped work on this process, negating nearly 14 years of planning and advocacy, and suggested that the FBI’s needs be served by tearing down the Hoover Building and building a new headquarters on the existing site. The Trump plan would have failed to provide adequate security for the FBI community and would not have met critical needs. Given these concerns, the Congressional delegation successfully fought throughout the Trump Administration to preserve the FBI headquarters project at the three original sites, as defined by years of study and a Congressionally-approved prospectus.After years of delays, the members of the Maryland Congressional delegation fought to include language in the Omnibus FY2022 package to advance the process for constructing a new consolidated FBI headquarters project.

An important step in this regard would be to redirect the wasteful use of funds and personnel on excessive devotion to disparaging Israel to allow the UN Human Rights Council to fairly promote human rights around the world.We write to urge you to prioritize reversing the UN Human Rights Council’s (UNHRC) discriminatory and unwarranted treatment of Israel by leading a multinational effort in the Council and in the UN to end the permanent Commission of Inquiry (COI) on the Israeli Palestinian conflict.In May 2021, just days after the conflict between the Gaza-based terrorist organization Hamas and Israel, the UNHRC approved an unprecedented open-ended investigation of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, purported war crimes and human rights violations. This Commission will not only focus on the actions Israel took in Gaza as it sought to defend its citizens, it will also have a carte blanche mandate – in perpetuity – to examine any period in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about violations not only in the West Bank and Gaza, but also within Israel’s pre-1967 borders. The mandate made no mention of the 4,300 lethal rockets fired by Hamas toward Israeli civilians in a matter of days and no mention of Israel’s right to defend itself.This one-sided approach is consistent with UNHRC’s continuing bias against Israel and the disproportionate use of resources in an ongoing campaign to disparage, discredit and denounce Israel. Its Agenda Item VII is the only country-specific permanent item on the Council’s agenda. The COI will now operate with an annual budget of over $4 million and a permanent staff of 18, which represents considerable resources devoted to maligning and ultimately prosecuting Israel. Of the thirty-two UNHRC mandated investigative probes, nine have been against Israel. By comparison, the investigation of North Korea’s violations of the human rights of its people had half the staff and lasted for only a year. Additionally, egregious human rights violations such as the treatment of the Uyghurs in China are not addressed by the UNHRC at all.We appreciate your commitment to put the Council’s “disproportionate focus on Israel” at the top of the Biden Administration’s agenda for reforming the Council when the U.S. announced it would seek to rejoin the UNHRC, as well as your commitment to “continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security, including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly.”  Delegitimizing and ultimately eliminating this permanent commission is an opportunity for the administration to fulfill U.S. Ambassador Patrick Kennedy’s pledge to the Council that “the U.S. stands with Israel in rejecting the unprecedented open-ended mandate of this Commission of Inquiry, which perpetuates a practice of unfairly singling out Israel in the U.N.”By unfairly singling out Israel, the UNHRC undermines its credibility to investigate human rights violations around the world.The COI is the latest endeavor by UNHRC to discredit the only Jewish state and is likely to further fuel antisemitism worldwide. Therefore, we urge you to act upon the Administration’s commitment to defend Israel from discriminatory treatment at the Human Rights Council and throughout the UN system. We also urge the U.S. to firmly raise its voice and concerns during the current UNHRC session, the first meeting in several years in which the United States will be a member of the council.We thank you in advance for your attention to this matter and look forward to your response. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-hoyer-announce-more-than-12-million-to-early-childhood-education-programs-in-st-marys-county,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (all D-Md.) today announced $1,277,001 in federal funding for the St. Mary’s County Board of Education’s Head Start programs to expand early learning, development, health services and family well-being.“Early childhood education is essential for children to develop the social and emotional skills needed to thrive at school and close the learning gap,” said Senator Cardin. “It is essential that we support early childhood education, in communities that are underserved and most vulnerable. I will continue to work with Team Maryland to secure federal funding to support early education programs like Head Start in St. Mary’s County and across the state.”“Learning gaps have only widened during the pandemic, and have particularly disadvantaged our youngest students. Investing in early childhood education programs like Head Start is one of the best ways to set up all our children for future success,” said Senator Van Hollen. “This funding will expand early learning and development opportunities in St. Mary’s County so that more children can access a high-quality education.”“After a pandemic that has set our school systems and our students back, it is important that we meet the needs of our educators and our children so that they can achieve their fullest potential,” said Congressman Hoyer. “I am glad that Maryland early childhood education programs are set to receive more than $1.2 million in federal funds to help improve the educational experience of students and also provide important support to our families. Every child should be set up for success in St. Mary’s County, and this funding is a positive step in that direction.”The $1,277,001 award comes from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Child Care and the Office of Head Start. Each year, Head Start and Early Head Start programs benefit more than a million families nationwide. This continuation funding from annual Appropriations was voted for by Senators Cardin and Van Hollen and Congressman Hoyer, each of whom continue to champion early childhood education funding annually. More information on Head Start and Early Head Start programs and services can be found here.   ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-marks-second-anniversary-of-cares-act-calls-on-congress-to-double-down-on-lessons-learned,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today marked the second anniversary of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, by releasing a staff report on the COVID-19 relief programs created by Congress since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report reflects on lessons learned from the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and Advance Grant Programs, the Small Business Debt Relief Program, the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) Program, and Restaurant Revitalization Fund.  Cardin delivered a speech on the Senate floor this week reflecting on the pandemic and urged his colleagues to build on the lessons learned from implementing relief programs.The Small Business Committee Chair said, “We have demonstrated that the historic structural barriers that have inhibited the growth of small businesses in underserved communities are far from insurmountable. Now is not the time to retreat. It is time for us to double down.”Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Congress has appropriated over $1 trillion to help small businesses weather the challenges caused by the pandemic. For underserved entrepreneurs, especially minorities and women, these challenges are exacerbated by long-standing structural barriers that limit their ability to start and grow small businesses. It was with these barriers in mind that Cardin and Senate Democrats championed policies to make the federal small business relief programs created by Congress fair and equitable. Cardin was a member of the bipartisan Small Business Task Force that negotiated the small business provisions of the CARES Act along with Senators Jeanne Shaheen, (D-N.H.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Susan Collins (R-Maine), and achieving equity in the programs has remained his top priority throughout the pandemic. Cardin and Shaheen secured language in the CARES Act that required the SBA to issue guidance to financial institutions participating in PPP to prioritize loans for underserved small businesses. In April 2020, in response to the Trump Administration’s failure to issue the guidance, Cardin and Senate Democrats secured a $60 billion set-aside for smaller lending institutions participating in PPP, such as credit unions, community banks, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and minority depository institutions (MDIs) that better reach underserved businesses. In the bipartisan Economic Aid Act passed by Congress in December 2020, Cardin also secured an additional $30 billion set aside for community lenders and $35 billion for borrowers who were unable to apply for an initial PPP loan.According to the staff report, “The equity-focused policies implemented by Congress and the Biden Administration over the lifetime of PPP resulted in a significant improvement in the number and share of loans that were made to minority-owned, women-owned, and other underserved small businesses.” During his floor speech, Cardin pushed for Congress to pass legislation to invest in small businesses to take advantage of the historic surge in new business formation since the beginning of the pandemic.“By implementing lessons learned over the lifetime of PPP, we should create a new direct loan program within SBA and further empower small businesses,” Cardin said. “We must build on the inroads that the SBA has made with underserved communities during the pandemic to get entrepreneurial development, business mentorship, and technical training into communities that would benefit from it the most. And we should continue to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that American small businesses have the tools they need to emerge from the COVID–19 stronger than ever.”Click here to download a copy of the staff report.

By then, it was clear that we were experiencing a once-in-a-century pandemic and that preventing the spread of this dangerous virus would require our Nation’s greatest collective effort since World War II. Here in the U.S. Congress, we knew that this era-defining challenge would require unprecedented action from the Federal Government to confront the economic and public health crisis created by COVID–19. The pandemic has waxed and waned in the two years since then, so opportunities for American families and small business owners to return to their normal lives have come in fits and starts. But one lesson that has remained true through these ups and downs and has been confirmed on multiple occasions through the pandemic is that the U.S. Federal Government can—it must— play a role in solving our Nation’s longstanding, difficult, and intractable problems. Let us remember those first few weeks of the pandemic. The vast majority of Americans did not know what to make of the Centers for Disease Control’s January report of a novel virus, the coronavirus identified abroad. By mid-February, small business owners were already feeling the effects of reduced revenues. By the end of February, the U.S. economy was rapidly deepening into a recession. There were severe disruptions in domestic and global supply chains, leading to shortages in food and critical personal protective equipment, and the unemployment rate was increasing rapidly. Congress had to act and act fast, so that is exactly what we did. We passed the CARES act—a bold, unprecedented, and comprehensive $2.2 trillion COVID relief package that met the scale of the crisis we faced—and we did it without partisan rancor or political infighting. The bill passed the Senate 96 to 0. It is one of the greatest acts of bipartisanship I have witnessed during my career in politics. The CARES Act provided funding to our public health infrastructure for testing, tracing, and vaccine development. It directed funds to State and local governments that were straining under the cost of the pandemic. It also authorized the Treasury Department to get stimulus payments to American families and increased unemployment payments because we knew that millions of Americans would be unable to work as we came together to slow the spread of the virus. The bill also provided hundreds of billions of dollars to support our Nation’s small businesses. I was proud to lead bipartisan negotiations on the small business provisions of this bill on the Small Business Task Force, which included myself and Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Marco Rubio, and Susan Collins. As we negotiated these provisions, we had several key facts in mind. First, small businesses have low profit margins and carry little in cash reserves, so they could only survive a few weeks of a closure without some form of support. Secondly, eventually, Americans unable to work would return to work, and it is much easier and quicker for small businesses to reopen with their existing staff instead of hiring new staff. Third, keeping small businesses in operation would make our eventual recovery come about more quickly and much more robustly. So we wanted to keep small businesses afloat. We wanted to keep their employees employed. We wanted to keep our economy moving forward. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which predates the pandemic, had already been approved to provide loans to small businesses harmed by COVID–19. So we knew that small businesses would have access to the long-term capital they needed to adapt their businesses and make other investments. EIDL can meet small businesses’ long-term capital needs, but we knew that we had to move quickly to meet the immediate capital needs of these businesses, so we created the EIDL Advance Grant Program to send $10,000 grants to small businesses that applied for EIDL. We knew how important it was to a recovery to keep employees on payroll, so we created the Paycheck Protection Program to provide small businesses with loans worth up to $10 million to cover the cost of up to 8 weeks of payroll, and we made a promise to borrowers to forgive the loans as long as they used the funds for payroll or other allowable expenses. We created a debt relief program to cover all costs associated with new and existing SBA loans for 6 months. We invested in the SBA entrepreneurship development programs to hire experts and increase capacity to help small businesses navigate the ups and downs of the pandemic. In total, the CARES Act included more than $375 billion in aid to small businesses. The aid could not have come soon enough. The initial $349 billion in PPP funds were exhausted in less than 2 weeks. SBA approved more than 1.6 million loans in that time. SBA’s laudable efforts to deliver relief to small businesses also came with disappointments and missed opportunities. Senator Shaheen and I fought to include a provision in the CARES Act that required SBA to issue guidance to the banks participating in PPP to prioritize loan applications for small businesses in underserved communities. We knew that those small businesses that had priority relationships with banks would be first in line, but we wanted the SBA to make sure that those that did not have those privileges would also be able to benefit by the PPP program. We insisted on the inclusion of this provision because we knew that a program like PPP, which relied on financial institutions to make loans, ran the risk of worsening the existing inequities in our private capital market. We simply could not allow small businesses in our most vulnerable communities to fall further behind. SBA failed to issue the guidance. So it was no surprise when organizations representing underserved small businesses sounded the alarm that women, minorities, small businesses in rural communities, and other underbanked borrowers were at risk of being frozen out of the program. The SBA’s inspector general would eventually report that the Agency’s implementation of PPP “did not fully align” with the intent of Congress. With funds exhausted after less than 2 weeks, the prior administration requested additional funds for PPP—and only PPP—which would have neglected the equally important EIDL Program, which had also exhausted its funds by then. It is important to keep in mind that since these programs were designed to work together, funding one without the other would not meet the needs of many small businesses. Once again, Members of this Chamber worked with our colleagues across the Capitol to create a comprehensive COVID–19 relief package that we all could agree on, which passed the Senate, again, unanimously. The bill provided an additional $370 billion of funds to the SBA COVID–19 relief efforts, with $310 billion for PPP, $10 billion for the EIDL Advance Grant Program. The bill also provided $50 billion for the EIDL Program, which allowed the Agency to make more than $350 billion in loans. And similar to the ways in which the CARES Act implemented lessons learned during a prior economic downturn, the second package implemented lessons learned during the first round of PPP. Since the SBA did not issue the guidance as required by the CARES Act, Senate Democrats championed more prescriptive policies to make the PPP fairer and more equitable. I remain proud that we were able to set aside $60 billion of PPP funds to be distributed by credit unions, community development financial institutions, minority depository institutions, community banks, and other small lenders that are better able to get funds to underserved and underbanked communities. We wanted to make sure that those who needed it could get it, and I am proud that we were able to include that in that legislation. Thanks to the set-aside, approximately 600 new, mostly nonbank, lenders that did not participate in phase 1, participated in phase 2 of the PPP program. We should take great pride in knowing that the set-aside worked. According to the Government Accounting Office report issued in September of last year, banks made the vast majority of PPP loans during phase 1 of the program. As a result, the program favored larger small businesses. During phase 2, however, the Agency found that the share of loans to underserved businesses and communities ‘‘was proportionate to their representation in the overall small business community.’’ We succeeded in the second round. For example, 42 percent of the loans approved during phase 1 of PPP went to businesses with between 10 and 499 employees, but those businesses only accounted for 4 percent of all the businesses in the United States. We know that women-owned and minority-owned small businesses are less likely to have employees at all, and when they do, they have less employees, on average. During phase 2, the share of loans to the larger of these businesses with 10 or more employees dropped to 17 percent. We achieved our objective. And while only 9 percent of the PPP loans issued during phase 1 went to businesses located in counties where women-owned businesses accounted for a large share of all businesses, the number doubled to 18 percent during phase 2, which is in line with the share of small businesses nationwide owned by women. Similarly, 36 percent of phase 1 loans went to small businesses in high-minority counties, and that number increased to 50 percent in phase 2. In every example in underserved communities—minority-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses—because we targeted the funds to mission lenders, because we were able to get the entrepreneurial services to small businesses that needed the help, we reached the underserved community. I would like to take a moment to highlight the significance of these findings. The fact that women and minorities face historic and pervasive barriers to entrepreneurship is not new, and the primary barrier is their inability to access capital. But the GAO’s report confirms that through the policies, the capital access gap is bridgeable. We can bridge this gap if we pass the right policies.After the end of phase 2 of PPP on August 8, Congress negotiated the next round of COVID–19 relief, which was not finalized until December 22. Negotiations may have taken much longer than any of us would have liked, but we once again found common ground to pass the bipartisan Economic Aid Act, providing $900 billion in COVID–19 relief, including an additional $325 billion for small businesses. In this bill, my Democratic colleagues and I secured an additional $30 billion set-aside for smaller lenders in addition to expanding eligibility to additional industries and nonprofits. The Economic Aid Act also provided eligible small businesses with an additional Second Draw PPP loan worth up to $2 million. The bill created new programs as well. The Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program was created to provide grants of up to $10 million to live venues, independent movie theaters, and other cultural institutions that were shuttered as a result of COVID–19. And a new $20 billion Targeted EIDL Advance Program was created to provide additional EIDL Advance grants to our Nation’s most vulnerable small businesses that couldn’t afford to take out a loan. They needed grants. I would like to take a moment to speak on why the Targeted EIDL Advance Program was necessary. Similar to how the Trump administration initially handled the PPP, hindering the program’s utility, the administration’s implementation of the EIDL Advance Program also made it less useful to small businesses. The CARES Act directed SBA to provide $10,000 grants to all EIDL applicants, but the Trump administration only provided $1,000 per employee up to 10 employees. The Targeted EIDL Advance Program addressed the problem directly by targeting the program to the most vulnerable communities and providing small businesses in those communities with the remainder of the $10,000 Congress intended them to receive. We corrected the mistake initially made. It remains frustrating to know that our Federal response to the pandemic could have helped even more small businesses. So it was welcome relief when President Biden was inaugurated because I knew that America’s underserved small businesses would have a champion administering phase 3 of PPP, and we in Congress would have a partner committed to ensuring that these programs helped as many small businesses as possible. The administration hit the ground running. In February of 2021, President Biden instituted a 14-day priority period for PPP, during which the SBA only processed applications for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The administration also changed the loan calculation formula for small proprietors and eliminated an exclusionary restriction that prevented small business owners with a prior non-felony conviction from obtaining a PPP loan for their businesses. In addition to these administrative actions, President Biden also proposed and Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan. The bold relief package created the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to provide grants to restaurants and bars that lost revenue due to COVID–19, added additional funds to the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, added additional funds to the Targeted EIDL Advance Program, and provided $350 billion to States and localities, which helped spur new State programs and replenish existing ones, like the RELIEF Act and the Maryland Strong Economic Recovery Initiative in my own home State, and created a new Community Navigator Program to get the SBA’s entrepreneurial development resources in the communities that would benefit from them the most. We had the Federal programs. Then we had the navigators to help small businesses get those funds. And we provided local funds through State and local governments so they could help small businesses. We really went through everything we could to help those that needed the help the most. The significance of these actions— the passage of the bipartisan Economic Aid Act in December, the Biden administration’s administrative steps, and the American Rescue Plan—cannot be overstated. They helped set our nation on course for the most robust economic recovery in American history. Phase 3 of PPP—January to May 31, 2021—had the most equitable loan approval shares, according to a report released in January of this year by economists Robert Fairlie and Frank Fossen. Fairlie and Fossen, both of whom have been following PPP and the pandemic’s impact on small businesses closely for the past 2 years, cited the extraordinary increase in loan volume of Prestamos, a CDFI that targets Hispanic-owned small businesses, as an example of the success of the PPP under the Biden administration. These numbers are impressive. During phase 1 of PPP, Prestamos ranked 4,274 among PPP lenders by volume. That was phase 1, where you really had to have an existing relationship if you were going to be able to get a PPP loan. In phase 2, where we did a better job of targeting, they ranked 325. In phase 3, they were among the top ranked PPP lenders by volume. They wrote that the 14-day priority period in particular ‘‘helped to bring the PPP loans to disadvantaged small businesses.’’ Thank you to the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress. The program hasn’t only been good for small businesses; it has also supported small community banks. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis wrote that small business lending was a ‘‘key business line’’ for small community banks during the operation of the program and that the program will help smaller banks regain some of the ground they have lost through larger competitors in the small business loan market. The Biden administration’s implementation of the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program has also been a resounding success. After awarding more than 12,800 initial grants worth more than $11 billion at an average of more than 1 million per institution, the administration also awarded more than 8,700 supplemental grants worth more than $3 billion. I mention all of that because we know our shuttered venues would be out of business if it weren’t for the shuttered loan program. It has kept them in business. And the administration successfully provided more than 100,000 restaurants with the Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants, worth more than $28 billion in grants. I have seen firsthand the benefit of these grants as I have traveled in Maryland. On Small Business Friday, last year, I did a walking tour down Main Street in Annapolis. Every single restaurant owner I visited shared that they may not have survived without the Restaurant Revitalization Fund grant. All of these restaurants are more than just a place to grab a bite to eat. These are decades-old institutions owned by small business operators, and their closures would have been deeply felt by the community. In the coming weeks, Congress must finish the job by replenishing the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. There are still hundreds of thousands of applicants waiting on funds. We have to finish the job for our restaurants, because if there are any lessons learned from the past 2 years, it is that when Congress comes together to produce thoughtful policies that address the system issues in our economy, it yields results. After enduring the deepest economic contraction since 1947, the American economy grew at the fastest rate since 1984 with the first year of Joe Biden’s administration. We are back, but we still have pockets that need help. In an ironic twist of history, the lessons we have learned and the expertise and capacity that we have built up within the SBA have now prepared us for what can only be described as an entrepreneurial renaissance underway in our communities. According to the Census Bureau, Americans registered 4.4 million new businesses in 2020—4.4 million new businesses—the highest total on record and a 24-percent increase over the prior year. Remarkably, the surge is being driven by entrepreneurs in some of our most underserved communities, and our policies helped make that a reality. For example, data shows that between February 2020 and August 2021, the number of Black business owners increased by 38 percent. Congress needs to take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit that is surging throughout our communities by continuing to invest in our entrepreneurs, especially those in underserved communities. We have demonstrated that the historic structural barriers that have inhibited the growth of small businesses in underserved communities are far from insurmountable. Now is not the time to retreat. It is time for us to double down. In implementing lessons learned over the lifetime of PPP, we should create a new direct loan program within SBA and further empower small businesses. We must build on the inroads that the SBA has made with underserved communities during the pandemic to get entrepreneurial development, business mentorship, and technical training into communities that would benefit from it the most. And we should continue to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that American small businesses have the tools they need to emerge from the COVID–19 stronger than ever. The bottom line is our policies made a difference. We saved America’s small businesses. We need to continue to work in the future to make sure the climate for small businesses is healthy so that our economy can continue to grow. We know that small businesses are the growth engine of job growth in America. We know that they are where most innovation takes place in our economy. Our policies during this pandemic helped save small businesses and now expand the opportunity for small businesses, but we need to continue to pay attention to these issues. I hope we can do this in a bipartisan way.

When Paul came to Metro from BWI Airport six years ago, the transit system was in a crisis state and needed a steady hand to improve safety and reliability. Paul provided leadership and determination to put the region’s transit system on a better path forward. He made tough calls to prioritize resources and time to repair infrastructure and upgrade stations that were crumbling under foot. He systematically replaced escalators that had long been neglected. I credit Paul for keeping Metro rolling throughout the pandemic so essential workers could make it to their jobs at the local hospitals, grocery stores and other key locations. I thank Paul for his service to the National Capital Region. Despite these achievements, a safety-first culture still has not taken root at Metro. With lingering maintenance and safety issues and the ongoing pandemic presenting urgent challenges to the transit system, there is much more work ahead.”Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) announced that Maryland will receive $409,507,880 over the next five years to improve bridges and create good-paying jobs across the state. This historic federal funding is one the single largest investments ever made to repair and reconstruct our state’s bridges, including city and county-owned bridges. The lawmakers fought to deliver these funds through the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.The Maryland Democratic Congressional Delegation voted to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by President Biden in November. There are currently 273 bridges in poor condition in Maryland, and this first round of federal funding will dedicate $81,901,576 to their repair. Of this total, $12,285,236 is set aside for bridges not part of the federal highway system, including those owned by counties, cities, towns, or other local agencies.“Bridges across our state are in desperate need of repair. That’s why we fought to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is now delivering over $400 million in federal funds to fix our bridges. This will not only improve the day-to-day lives of Marylanders but also create hundreds of good-paying jobs in the process,” the lawmakers said. “These funds are key to modernizing our state’s transportation network, keeping drivers safe, and bolstering our infrastructure’s resiliency to risks posed by climate change.”The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a once-in-a-generation investment in American infrastructure that will provide more than $7 billion in federal funding directly to Maryland over five years to strengthen our roads and bridges, along with our water infrastructure, broadband internet, climate resilience, and more. The lawmakers worked to enact this law in Congress to create good jobs, grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness in the world, and make our transportation system more sustainable and equitable. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) – through which these bridge-related funds are administered – more than $350 billion over five fiscal years for surface transportation programs.Previous Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding announcements from the lawmakers include nearly $800 million in highway funding, $31.5 million for airports, and $140 million for water infrastructure improvements.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/senate-passes-cardin-rubio-measure-to-foster-progress-and-protect-freedoms-in-haiti,"Press ReleaseLegislation aims to combat corruption, hold human rights abusers accountableWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) today applauded the passage by the full Senate of their legislation, the Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative Act (S. 1104). First introduced in April, passed by the House in June and advanced in October by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Cardin-Rubio bill prioritizes the protection of human rights and anti-corruption efforts in Haiti by fostering strong relationships with independent civil society groups. The legislation also requires the U.S. State Department to report on human rights abuses that have taken place in Haiti. The bill further supports the efforts of the Haitian Government to identify persons involved in such human rights violations and significant acts of corruption in Haiti and hold them accountable for their actions.Amended since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July and the August earthquake and tropical storm, all of which exacerbated long-term challenges facing Haiti, the bill would measure the progress of post-disaster recovery and efforts to address corruption, governance, rule of law and media freedoms. The House of Representatives is expected to act quickly to accept the amended bill, which will then be sent to the president for his signature.“The Haitian people continue to face a long list of struggles in their daily lives, as disasters and tragedies mount,” said Senator Cardin. “We are greatly concerned that a Haitian government that is both unstable and corrupt will allow or enable additional human rights abuses. UNICEF has reported that 1.6 million people in Haiti, including 800,000 children, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The United States must act with urgency to help our Haitian neighbors emerge from this ongoing crisis.”“For far too long, the Haitian people have endured the hardships of corruption, criminal gangs, civil unrest, and devastating natural disasters,” said Senator Rubio. “As we begin a new year, the U.S. Senate is sending an important message of support to the Haitian people with the passage of our bipartisan Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative Act. A more secure and prosperous Haiti benefits not just the Haitian people, but also our entire hemisphere. With the Senate’s passage of this important bill, we are one step closer to making it law.”The legislation can be downloaded here.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cardin-commemorates-martin-luther-king-jr-day,"Press ReleaseBALTIMORE – In honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, January 17, 2022, U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) released the following statement. Senator Cardin serves as Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly.“Each January, we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who gave voice to the civil rights movement and the struggle for equality for Black Americans. A federal holiday for more than two decades, we honor Dr. King’s work through service to others – helping the stranger and making our community a stronger, safer and more just place. This work cannot – and should not – be confined to one day a year.“To truly honor the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we must work daily to right the wrongs of systemic racism and economic and health disparities, as well as hate and intolerance. In his 1963 letter from Birmingham, Dr. King wrote: ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.’“It is fitting that within days of Martin Luther King Jr. Day that the U.S. Senate will consider legislation to preserve and protect voting rights. This is a matter of upholding our democracy. We must act to make sure everyone has the right to vote and their vote is counted accurately. At the signing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson described ‘the vote’ as ‘the most powerful instrument ever devised by human beings for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison people because they are different from others.’“After record turnout in 2020, during a pandemic, far too many states across the country are taking steps that would make it harder for Black Americans, Latinos, seniors, people with disabilities, young people and others to vote. We can best honor Dr. King by reinforcing and expanding the right to vote instead of weakening and restricting this sacred right. These actions are as un-American as you can get, yet they continue.“The Senate needs to act and put an end to such unconstitutional measures. If only Republicans of today would mind the words of former President Ronald Reagan, who said, ‘The right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see its luster diminished.’“This is a perilous time for our nation. Will we choose to maintain and strengthen our democracy, or will we allow authoritarianism to take root? In memory of Martin Luther King Jr., and every man and woman who sacrificed on the unending path to make our nation a more perfect union, I will do everything in my power to preserve our democracy and make a more equitable and just nation. At times of great despair and frustration, the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. serve as my guide in this mission: ‘The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.’” ### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-new-federal-bridge-funding-will-make-historic-investments-across-maryland,"Press ReleaseBALTIMORE – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, welcomed news Friday that the Biden-Harris administration will send Maryland $81.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022, the first installment of $409.5 million over the next five years, in federal funding to repair and upgrade hundreds of bridges across Maryland. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which administers bridge funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress, this is “the largest federal investment ever” made in fixing bridges across the country. There are 273 bridges across Maryland considered in “poor condition” today.“This federal funding is a critical component of the historic investment we are making in our nation’s infrastructure through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that President Biden signed into law last year. It will enable Maryland to take significant steps to upgrade and repair bridges statewide,” said Senator Cardin. “The federal government is delivering investments to address the real impacts Marylanders have felt from outdated infrastructure—safety risks, longer commute times, higher costs, and reduced productivity. These federal funds will bring tangible improvements to every community.”“The Biden-Harris Administration is thrilled to launch this program to fix thousands of bridges across the country – the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate highway system,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “Modernizing America’s bridges will help improve safety, support economic growth, and make people’s lives better in every part of the country – across rural, suburban, urban, and tribal communities.”A portion of the federal funds from the Bridge Formula Program will be directed to the needs of “off-system” bridges with no local match requirement. Typically, local communities would need to pay 20 percent of the costs, putting many repairs out of reach for smaller jurisdictions.Today’s announcement is one component of the historic investment in Maryland’s roads and bridges under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which will deliver an estimated total of $4.6 billion to the state in formula funding over five years and provide opportunities to compete for additional federal grant funding. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/helsinki-commission-welcomes-first-charges-under-the-rodchenkov-anti-doping-act,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON—Following the first charges filed under the Helsinki Commission’s Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act for a doping scheme at the Tokyo Olympics, Helsinki Chairman Sen. Ben Cardin (MD), Co-Chairman Rep. Steve Cohen (TN-09), Ranking Member Sen. Roger Wicker (MS), Ranking Member Rep. Joe Wilson (SC-02), and former Commissioner Rep. Michael Burgess (TX-26) issued the following statements:“Swift utilization of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act is exactly what we hoped for with this legislation,” said Chairman Cardin. “I thank the U.S. attorneys and investigators who put in long hours of work pursuing this case. They understood the importance of cleaning up cheating and corruption in international sports, which often is a tool of autocratic governments. These first charges are only the beginning and serve as a very public part of the global anti-corruption strategy supported by the Biden administration and spearheaded by the Helsinki Commission for many years.”“I welcome this first enforcement action under the Rodchenkov Act and urge the Department of Justice to continue unraveling the corruption that infects international sport,” said Co-Chairman Cohen. “Sports should bring people together and celebrate achievement—they should not be an opportunity for fraud. My own GOLD Act would expand the Rodchenkov Act and I call on my colleagues to pass it swiftly.”“These charges are the culmination of years of work to hold administrators, doctors, and officials accountable for their role in corrupting international sport,” said Sen. Wicker. “They demonstrate that our new approach is working. I thank the public servants at the U.S. Department of Justice and urge them to continue their efforts to enforce this critically important law.”“Dictators and their cronies interfere in everything we hold dear, including sports. They view victory in international sport as a way to trumpet the greatness of their oppressive systems. Cheating in sports is part of their foreign policy,” said Rep. Wilson. “With the Rodchenkov Act, we are holding these corrupt networks to account. I applaud the Department of Justice for prosecuting fraudsters at the Tokyo Olympics and call on them to do the same in Beijing.”“From a young age, professional athletes dedicate themselves to becoming the best in their sport. For those skilled enough to make it to the Olympics, their efforts should not be tainted by doping schemes,” said Rep. Burgess. “Yesterday’s charges provide hope to those that have been defrauded. They would not have been made possible without the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act. I worked to enact this law to maintain sport integrity and keep all American athletes safe and protected from fraud. Further, yesterday’s action is a win for athletes such as Katie Uhlaender, whose moving testimony spurred Congress into action. I hope that yesterday’s charges are only the beginning of combatting fraud in international sport competition.”  “This is exactly the kind of action we hoped for following the enactment of this groundbreaking anti-doping legislation,” said Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow’s anti-doping laboratory and the Russian whistle-blower after whom the law is named. “We are grateful to United States Attorney Damian Williams for taking this monumental first step toward restoring the Olympic games to their role as a cherished forum for nations to convene in the spirit of peace, fairness and cooperation. We cannot continue to allow corrupt states and the overlords of sport commerce to exploit our athletes and traditions of peace to advance the economic and geopolitical interests of the few. Yesterday’s action is entirely appropriate and puts real teeth into anti-doping enforcement, while also setting an example of international cooperation and fair play for future generations.”The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, which became law in December 2020, criminalizes doping in international sport. In July 2021, the Helsinki Commission hosted a hearing on the enforcement of the Rodchenkov Act at the Tokyo Olympics. Earlier that year, Dr. Rodchenkov spoke out publicly for the first time about the impact of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act on a Helsinki Commission podcast, calling it a “game-changer.”On Wednesday, the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the charges against Eric Lira, who they allege “obtained various performance enhancing drugs (‘PEDs’) and distributed those PEDs to certain athletes in advance of, and for the purpose of cheating at, the 2020 Olympic Games held in Tokyo in the summer of 2021.” Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Expanding and encouraging professional training opportunities will better prepare State Department personnel for their roles promoting and defending U.S. national interests around the world.The bipartisan legislation calls for the State Department to move beyond its current “on-the-job training” approach and move toward a more robust professional training continuum, incorporating innovative education and training courses, methods, programs and opportunities with a clear link between required employee training, and promotional opportunities and assignments. The bill also requires the establishment of a Chief Learning Officer position to serve as the principal advisor and strategist for State Department training and development, as well as the establishment of a non-partisan Board of Visitors to provide independent oversight, including providing advice and recommendations regarding training at the Foreign Service Institute.“The Department of State is a crucial national security agency. It’s time to modernize and prioritize the training and professional development they receive – enabling these public servants to more effectively promote our national security interests abroad,” said Senator Cardin. “We must continue to recruit and retain the best and brightest to represent America around the world, so we must invest in their skills and constantly add value to their experiences.”“When I served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I had the privilege of working alongside some of the State Department’s brightest and most capable men and women, so we must look for more effective ways to train all members of the State Department,” said Senator Hagerty. “This bipartisan legislation calls for the State Department to build a more professional diplomatic corps, with a clear link between required employee training and promotional opportunities and assignments, and to establish a Chief Learning Officer to spearhead that effort.

According to the FDA, amending the expiration date of some prescription drugs may alleviate the shortages that the United States currently is facing.“The U.S. is the wealthiest nation in the world; no one in this country should fall victim to prescription drug shortages,” said Senator Cardin. “The federal government must work to ensure that patients who rely on life-sustaining medications for the treatment of infections, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and for basic medical procedure necessities, like saline or epinephrine, will always have an adequate supply of the prescription drugs they need. No one should have to go without essential prescriptions drugs when usable supplies are available despite the date stamped on their box or bottle.”“At a time when our health care system is overburdened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing doctors, nurses, and patients should have to worry about is whether there will be an adequate supply of the medications they need,” said Senator Collins. “To help ensure all patients have access to lifesaving medications, our bipartisan legislation would update FDA guidance in order to safely extend the shelf life of essential drugs.”As FDA noted in their 2019 Drug Shortages Task Force Report, shortages of essential drugs may be, “… exacerbated if drugs must be discarded because they exceed a labeled shelf-life based on unnecessarily short expiration dates.” The regulations that govern prescription drug shelf life testing have not been amended since 1981. Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy of shelf life data, it is imperative that regulations governing shelf life stability testing are up-to-date.The Drug Shortages Shelf Life Extension Act would:### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) met with Ortiz to discuss Chesapeake Bay Program oversight, implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, environmental justice and other regional environmental issues. Highlights included strategies to build climate resilience and Bay-friendly agricultural supply chains, and protect vulnerable populations and drinking water sources.“Having a Marylander at the helm of EPA Region III is a game changer for the region and the future of the Chesapeake Bay,” the lawmakers said after the meeting. “Administrator Ortiz brings to his new position a base of knowledge that allows us to get straight to the issues and will help the watershed states go further towards meeting their obligations and 2025 cleanup targets. He also has firsthand experience of how climate change has affected Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic, creating opportunities to achieve greater resilience, deliver on environmental justice and implement additional restoration measures across sectors.“We appreciated the opportunity to offer Administrator Ortiz our support in his new role and discuss our shared goal of protecting and restoring the Bay. From Chesapeake Bay Program oversight to implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to tackling the climate crisis and improving climate resiliency, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us. We look forward to partnering with him and the pending Chesapeake Bay Czar to maximize federal support for the environmental health of the region.”“It was a pleasure meeting with members of the Maryland Congressional delegation,” said Administrator Ortiz. “I appreciate their leadership and support for our work as EPA’s Mid-Atlantic region fully steps up in our role to make sure states meet their commitments for a clean Chesapeake Bay.”A former mayor of Edmonston, Md., Ortiz previously served as the Director of the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, the Director of the Department of Environment for Prince George’s County and he held positions in the administration of Gov.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-call-for-tps-designations-for-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) today joined 31 of their Senate Democratic colleagues in formally requesting that the Biden administration grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) re-designations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a new TPS designation for Guatemala. In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the senators expressed their grave concern with the worsening humanitarian conditions across Central America being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple devastating natural disasters, all of which have contributed to an uptick in outmigration from the region.“The crisis in Central America is urgent. … TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration,” the senators wrote. “It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration.”Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.“Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. … Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media,” the senators added. “The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society in the region to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility.”Joining Senators Cardin and Van Hollen in signing the letter were Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken,We write to express our concerns about ongoing humanitarian needs in Central America and to appeal for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and a new TPS designation for Guatemala. It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration. The Guatemalan government has requested a TPS designation, and U.S. Embassies have issued disaster declarations for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in recognition of the urgent needs. TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. Lastly, such designations would be consistent with the Administration’s commitments to address climate migration.The crisis in Central America is urgent. In the past year, the region has experienced extreme weather events, including two hurricanes followed by a months-long drought. According to the World Food Program (WFP), farmers in the region face the worst dry farming season in 35 years. Hunger in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua has increased almost fourfold over the past two years, according to WFP, from 2.2 million people in 2018 to close to 8 million people in 2021. Eight in ten households are resorting to crisis coping measures, selling their lands, tools, and livestock, and missing meals or eating less nutritious meals. It will take years to repair damage to roads, schools, bridges, wells, and other physical infrastructure caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which continue to impede citizens’ livelihoods. The pressures have led to an uptick in outmigration from the region. In January, 15 percent of people surveyed by WFP said they were making concrete plans to migrate — double the number two years ago. Media report that the region’s citizens are having to choose between migrating or facing hunger. Despite U.S. Embassies’ disaster declarations, which activated the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance, 8.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in July 2021, including 5.5 million who were in desperate need of food as of September 2021, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network.The International Monetary Fund says that remittances initially supported the region’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but tropical storms Eta and Iota interrupted progress, damaging crops and halting manufacturing. In 2020, Honduras’ GDP dropped nine percent, El Salvador’s GDP dropped nearly eight percent, Nicaragua’s dropped two percent, and Guatemala’s by 1.8 percent. The IMF supported the region with emergency financing to cope with these shocks. However, the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging vaccination campaigns, especially in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, will prolong the region’s economic recovery.Combined, the effects of the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly exacerbated food insecurity, violence, and led to rising social tensions. Forced displacement continues to plague the region. Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. On November 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights named El Salvador the most dangerous Latin American country for women. Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media.TPS is a humanitarian tool used by both Democratic and Republican administrations to provide relief for individuals who are unable to return to countries facing extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society in the region to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility. They would also provide immediate and tangible humanitarian benefits to new status holders and help mitigate the factors driving dangerous outmigration by securing life-saving remittances.It is our view that El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua meet the standards for TPS. We look forward to working closely with and supporting the Biden administration as it take this important step to uphold humanitarian protections, safeguard U.S. national security interests, and defend American families. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.Sincerely,### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin, and David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced that $143,357,536 in federal relief has been delivered to Maryland families to help cover their energy costs for fiscal year 2022 (October 2021 to September 2022). With the winter months upon Maryland, this relief from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) – boosted by funding from the American Rescue Plan – will help eligible Marylanders cover utility costs and stay warm this winter.“For Marylanders struggling to get by, the high energy bills that come during the winter months can create one of the biggest burdens on their pocketbooks. This vital relief will help families cover their utility costs and stay warm this winter. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our communities, we were proud to fight for funding in the American Rescue Plan to support Marylanders, and we will keep working to reduce the burden of high energy costs that so many hardworking Americans face,” the lawmakers said.The lawmakers secured $69,851,450 in LIHEAP funds for Maryland in the initial FY22 federal government funding legislation passed in September, in addition to the $73,506,086 delivered from the American Rescue Plan they helped enact in the spring of 2021.Thanks to their work to pass the American Rescue Plan, the total funding of $143,357,536 is more than double Maryland’s typical annual funding for energy assistance — and the highest amount the state has ever received to help people struggling with the high cost of home energy. Eligible Marylanders can use this relief to cover energy bills as well as costs related to weatherization and energy-related repairs and upgrades.Marylanders who need assistance with energy costs can apply through the Maryland Department of Human Services.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Senator Reid assumed the role of Senate Majority Leader as I entered the Senate in 2007, a role in which he served until 2015. He was a trusted adviser and an astute strategist who proved his ability to deliver results in the Senate under presidents of both parties. A former boxer and member of the Capitol Police, Senator Reid never shied from a difficult battle or quit before the fight was finished. Among his many accomplishments, Senator Reid found ways to coalesce support behind landmark laws like the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the Dodd-Frank Act, among many others. Along with his unwavering loyalty to his home state of Nevada, these pieces of transformational legislation will serve as his lasting legacy.“On a personal level, Myrna and I will hold Harry’s wife Landra, children and grandchildren in our prayers. The Reid family repeatedly has faced health challenges and always done so with grace and dignity.

With many Marylanders relying heavily on USPS amid the holiday season and pandemic, we hope increased staffing and the activation of additional mail facilities lead to a notable improvement after the poor service many have experienced over the past year. That said, the Postal Service still has more work ahead to implement recommendations from the Inspector General and to ensure the timely delivery of Marylanders’ mail. On behalf of our constituents, we will continue pressing for progress until these issues are fixed.”The USPS’s response outlines some improvements made for the holiday season, including the hiring of more than 2,000 staff in Maryland, activation of additional sorting and delivery annexes in the state, and opening of a new carrier training academy. USPS set metrics for employee availability and delivery failures to evaluate performance in the Baltimore area but has not established thresholds for these metrics to determine when the Baltimore postmaster should request additional support from outside the area. The USPS Inspector General recommended that the USPS establish these metrics and thresholds in its November audit of Baltimore mail facilities, and USPS agreed to carry out that recommendation by November 30, 2021.The full USPS letter to the Maryland Congressional Delegation is here.

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced $796,122,349 in FY22 federal funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law to improve roads and bridges and create good-paying jobs across the state. These federal investments also fund critical new programs to address climate change, both through reducing carbon emissions and strengthening infrastructure to withstand climate and extreme weather impacts.The Maryland Democratic Congressional Delegation voted to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law, which was signed into law by President Biden last month and provides an infusion of new federal funding for highway and bridge repair for communities across the nation. The funds, administered by the Federal-aid Highway Program, will be used for construction, reconstruction or improvement. This is the first round of funding under the five years of federal investment in Maryland highways authorized by the bipartisan infrastructure law.“The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was a long overdue investment in the roads and bridges Marylanders rely on every day,” the lawmakers said. “This new round of federal funding will help to rebuild Maryland’s roads and overall transportation network, cut down on gridlock and pollution and keep drivers and pedestrians safe. Team Maryland is proud to support good-paying union jobs for our state through this funding, and we are looking forward to delivering more of the federal infrastructure resources to our communities from the infrastructure modernization bill that we fought so hard to pass.”The American Society of Civil Engineers gave Maryland a C grade on its Infrastructure Report Card, finding many deficiencies that require immediate attention like Maryland’s road congestion and population growth.The funding will be distributed as follows:Highway Performance Program$418,076,496Transportation Block Grant Program$203,388,565Safety Improvement Program$44,898,331Highway Crossings Program$2,507,549Mitigation and Air Quality Program$58,505,854Metropolitan Planning$9,148,013National Highway Freight Program$20,840,720Carbon Reduction Program$18,135,480PROTECT Formula Program$20,621,341 ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

The grant was awarded through Phase 1 of the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) “Build Back Better Regional Challenge.” By competing successfully for a Phase 1 grant, Howard County and its partners will have the opportunity to further develop specific project ideas and compete for a larger amount of funding for implementation in Phase 2.The proposal from the Howard County Economic Development Authority aims to leverage Maryland’s strength as a leader in cybersecurity and to open up more pathways for workers to enter into this field and contribute to its continued growth and innovation.“As we have seen over the last few weeks with the Maryland Department of Health’s recent cyberattacks, we must continue to strengthen and reinforce our cybersecurity efforts in Maryland to protect us from online threats, security breaches, and hacks that jeopardize our safety and privacy. That’s why the creation of the Solutions project is critical – so we can stay at the forefront of this rapidly developing field by investing in our workforce and continuing to grow jobs,” the lawmakers said. “This new round of America Rescue Plan funding will help expand opportunities in the cybersecurity community and strengthen our middle class through skills training programs. We will keep working to provide our communities with critical federal funding and assistance to build back better and stronger.”This funding opportunity was made possible by the American Rescue Plan, one of Congress’ key legislative accomplishments this year aimed at driving economic recovery from the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic with an eye towards future growth and competitiveness. Specifically, this “Build Back Better Regional Challenge” aims to boost economic pandemic recovery and rebuild American communities, including some that have been grappling with decades of disinvestment. It also provides transformative investments to develop and strengthen regional industry clusters across the country, all while embracing economic equity, creating good-paying jobs, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness globally.The Phase 1 award granted to the Howard County Economic Development Authority Solutions project is an outcome of a highly-competitive process in which 529 applications were submitted to the EDA, highlighting the strong interest and need across the country for concerted economic development planning on a regional scale. Phase 1 of the challenge required regions to submit unique plans that will develop industry, train the local workforce and build economies. As a finalist, the Howard County Economic Development Authority will compete for Phase 2 of the challenge for an award of $100 million for 3-8 projects across Maryland that support an industry sector. ### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Joe Wilson (SC-02) issued the following joint statement:“The Kremlin continues to twist Russia’s so-called justice system to punish civil society, opposition politicians, and independent media who dare to speak out against the abuses of Putin’s regime. The United States should raise the stakes and impose concrete consequences on any officials who support such vindictive action against the Russian patriots who defend the human rights of their fellow citizens.”In a December 17, 2021 letter, Chairman Cardin, Co-Chairman Cohen, Sen. Wicker, Rep. Wilson, and Helsinki Commissioner Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) urged President Joe Biden to sanction 17 Russian officials and associates involved in the harassment and prosecution of Memorial and its leadership.“The United States has a moral duty to prevent this attack on universal rights and freedoms,” they said. “Publicly sanctioning the Russian officials involved in the attack on Memorial and their enablers would be an effective way to support pro-democracy forces in Russia and deter perpetrators.”In November 2021, Russia’s Supreme Court notified Memorial that the General Prosecutor’s office was suing to dismantle the organization for alleged violations of Russia’s “foreign agent” laws. In a November 17 statement, the Helsinki Commission expressed concern about the organization’s potential dissolution, noting, “We continue to see an alarming increase in attacks on civil society, opposition politicians, and independent media in Russia. Now the Kremlin actively seeks to dismantle Memorial, a respected network of organizations dedicated to revealing and preserving the history of Soviet repression and fighting for political prisoners in Russia today. Memorial’s efforts to defend truth and human rights are essential and must be protected for generations to come.”Memorial, established in the final years of the Soviet Union by dissidents including Andrei Sakharov, is one of the most respected and enduring human rights groups in the region. Its local chapters focus on preserving the truth about Soviet repressions, particularly under Stalin, and honoring the memories of those lost. Memorial also maintains a comprehensive database of current political prisoners in Russia and continues to advocate for the rights of the people of Russia, especially in the North Caucasus.The Helsinki Commission has convened numerous events featuring Memorial representatives. Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-urge-ftc-and-doj-to-protect-workers-rights-by-limiting-non-compete-agreements,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (Both D-Md.), along with Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are supporting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division’s role in restricting the use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts to promote worker mobility at a time of low unemployment rates and economic recovery. Earlier this month, the FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division held a workshop studying “the implications for efforts to protect and empower workers through competition enforcement and rulemaking” after President Biden directed the FTC via Executive Order to address non-compete clauses. In their comment letter to the FTC Commissioners and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, the senators highlighted the anti-competitive nature of non-competes, which stifle innovation, depress wages, and hinder entrepreneurship.“The American workforce has experienced significantly reduced job mobility, tepid wage growth, and declining rates of entrepreneurship in recent decades. At the same time, non-compete clauses have become more prevalent,” the senators wrote. “At their core, non-competes inherently manipulate competitive labor market forces by narrowing the available employment options for workers. This manipulation is bad for both employees and employers. For employers, non-competes limit the available supply of qualified workers to fill their workforce needs. This is especially true at a time of low unemployment and recovery.The senators continued: “In short, non-compete clauses stifle entrepreneurship by preventing employee spinoffs and take away workers’ leverage to grow their careers and enjoy economic mobility by switching firms or bargaining for higher wages. We therefore believe that the FTC and DOJ Antitrust should act to limit the use of non-compete clauses. Reducing the use of non-competes would allow workers to get better jobs, boost wages, increase entrepreneurship, spur innovation, and allow for a more robust recovery out of the COVID-19 pandemic.”“Limiting the use of non-compete clauses is a bipartisan issue in the United States Senate, with Senators strongly discouraging the abusive and anti-competitive use of non-compete agreements through public statements, in Committee hearings, and through legislation, including the Workforce Mobility Act. The FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division have a duty and the authority to significantly restrain the use of non-compete clauses. We believe that the use of non-compete clauses in the American economy is anti-competitive,” the senators concluded.A full copy of the letter can be found below and here.Dear Commissioners and Assistant Attorney General Kanter,Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice Antitrust Division’s role in restricting the use of non-compete clauses in conjunction with your joint workshop, “Making Competition Work: Promoting Competition in Labor Markets.” We write in support of FTC and DOJ Antitrust action that restricts the use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts and promotes competitive labor markets and worker mobility.The American workforce has experienced significantly reduced job mobility, tepid wage growth, and declining rates of entrepreneurship in recent decades. At the same time, non-compete clauses have become more prevalent.At their core, non-competes inherently manipulate competitive labor market forces by narrowing the available employment options for workers. This manipulation is bad for both employees and employers. For employers, non-competes limit the available supply of qualified workers to fill their workforce needs. This is especially true at a time of low unemployment and recovery. For employees, the harmful effects of non-competes are more acute, as their use clearly leads to suppressed wages, lower initial wages, and reduced upward economic mobility.Non-compete clauses also hinder entrepreneurship, as research shows that the use of non-competes leads to fewer startups, and firms that start in states that enforce non-compete clauses are more likely to fail.As recent economic and labor market data has exhibited, many workers are realizing their potential for economic mobility by switching jobs and beginning new careers at staggering rates. And yet, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, other workers who lost their job by no fault of their own still have to abide by non-compete clauses that restrict their job options, closing pathways to career growth in their chosen industry and community.[1]In short, non-compete clauses stifle entrepreneurship by preventing employee spinoffs and take away workers’ leverage to grow their careers and enjoy economic mobility by switching firms or bargaining for higher wages.We therefore believe that the FTC and DOJ Antitrust should act to limit the use of non-compete clauses. Reducing the use of non-competes would allow workers to get better jobs, boost wages, increase entrepreneurship, spur innovation, and allow for a more robust recovery out of the COVID-19 pandemic.There are several actions the agencies could take to limit the use of non-competes. First, the permissible use of non-compete clauses should be limited to only the most necessary circumstances, such as the sale of a business or dissolution of a partnership, and only to the most senior executives. Second, FTC and DOJ should act to increase the transparency of the use of non-compete clauses by employers. Studies show that 30 to 40 percent of workers required to sign a non-compete clause do so after the prospective employee has already accepted the job offer. As such, these clauses are often entered into under unfair and deceptive circumstances. Therefore, employers should be required to disclose to the prospective employee that they will be bound to a non-compete clause should they accept the job, and that non-compete agreements entered into after the employee accepts the job should be unenforceable and illegal.Limiting the use of non-compete clauses is a bipartisan issue in the United States Senate, with Senators strongly discouraging the abusive and anti-competitive use of non-compete agreements through public statements, in Committee hearings, and through legislation, including the Workforce Mobility Act.The FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division have a duty and the authority to significantly restrain the use of non-compete clauses. We believe that the use of non-compete clauses in the American economy is anti-competitive. We appreciate that the Commission and DOJ are seriously examining non-compete clauses, and ask you ultimately to take actions that would limit their use across the labor market.Sincerely, ###[1] GFA Int’l, Inc., v.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-brown-schatz-lead-group-of-senators-in-calling-on-vaccine-manufacturers-to-increase-vaccines-to-low-income-countries-to-fight-the-covid-19-pandemic,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) along with Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) led a group of eight senators in calling on Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna to increase COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries to help tackle the global disparities in accessing the vaccine.“If global vaccination rates do not improve, the virus will continue to threaten lives and our global economy. This situation prolongs the need for booster shots to maintain the vaccines’ protection and creates dangerous conditions for the emergence of new variants that are potentially resistant to vaccines. In our global society, there is no question that these variants will spread to the United States; when that happens, our current vaccines may not be sufficient to protect the population. This is not just a hypothetical problem: the latest variant of concern—Omicron—clearly points to the need for swift and urgent action around the world,” wrote the senators.U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) also joined the letter.The full text of the letters is available here: Letter to Johnson & Johnson | Letter to Pfizer | Letter to ModernaA copy of the letter to Pfizer can be found below:Albert Bourla, DVM, Ph.D.Chief Executive OfficerPfizer Inc.235 East 42nd StreetNew York, NY 10017Dear Dr. Bourla,We write with grave concerns about Pfizer’s commitment to providing vaccines for low-income and middle-income countries. We commend the company on its ground-breaking work in developing and manufacturing one of the most effective mRNA vaccines currently on the market, and we urge you to take immediate action to work with the Biden Administration, our international allies, and global public health experts to make the Pfizer vaccine immediately more widely available to communities around the globe and to tackle the ongoing significant disparities in global COVID-19 vaccine supply and access. Without a stronger commitment from you and your company, millions of preventable deaths will occur.  Vaccines represent the world’s best hope at containing the COVID-19 pandemic, but our goals for effectively responding to the pandemic will remain out of reach unless we successfully ramp up our global vaccination effort and get more shots in arms as quickly as possible. While more than 6.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, they have been concentrated in high-income countries. Less than 10 percent of people living in low-income countries have received at least one dose of the vaccine,[1] and efforts to expand low-income and middle-income countries’ access to vaccines have stalled. Despite a significant contribution from the United States, the COVAX international vaccine aid program has fallen hundreds of millions doses short of its vaccine distribution goals. All vaccine manufacturers outside China missed their 2020 production targets by 96 percent,[2] and are projected to miss their initial 2021 targets by about 50 percent.[3],[4]If global vaccination rates do not improve, the virus will continue to threaten lives and our global economy. This situation prolongs the need for booster shots to maintain the vaccines’ protection and creates dangerous conditions for the emergence of new variants that are potentially resistant to vaccines. In our global society, there is no question that these variants will spread to the United States; when that happens, our current vaccines may not be sufficient to protect the population. This is not just a hypothetical problem: the latest variant of concern—Omicron—clearly points to the need for swift and urgent action around the world.If the pandemic is not controlled, there will be dire consequences in human and public health terms. Already, over five million people around the world have died of COVID-19.[5] If current trends in vaccination rates and preventative measures such as mask wearing continue, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington projects that by March 1st 2022 there will be approximately 6.26 million reported deaths – and nearly 13.63 million reported and unreported deaths – due to COVID-19.[6] Among the remaining 230 million people who contract COVID-19 and survive, almost 25 percent[7] are likely to continue to experience chronic symptoms known as long covid, which will impact their long-term physical and psychological health as well as the health of our global economy.Continuing to allow the global pandemic to run rampant will also hurt the United States’ economy. High rates of infection in low-income and middle-income countries have reduced their capacity to meet factory production targets and maintain global shipping networks,[8] thus creating supply chain delays that contribute to inflation and damage American companies’ ability to deliver goods and services. Furthermore, American cities and states continue to lose tourism revenue due to the pandemic. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Americas saw a 68 percent drop in international tourist arrivals in 2020 and a 65 percent shortfall in 2021, with improvements not expected until 2023 or 2024 if current trends continue.[9] Lastly, the pandemic has curtailed the entry of international university students and workers into the United States, with travel restrictions likely to remain in place for those who cannot access vaccinations.[10] These limits mean that the American economy will miss out on substantial financial, intellectual, and social contributions from these groups.[11]As a pioneer in developing a highly effective mRNA vaccine, Pfizer is in a unique position to bring a swift end to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. We appreciate Pfizer’s commitment to provide 1 billion vaccine doses to the U.S. government at not-for-profit prices for donation to low-income and middle-income countries, and the company’s efforts to ensure expanded and equitable access to its COVID-19 treatment pill.However, more work is urgently needed in the short-term. Experts have estimated that another 4.5 billion doses are needed to fully vaccinate 80 percent of the world’s seven billion people over the age of five years, and up to 6 billion additional doses may be needed in 2022 for booster shots to reinforce the efficacy of vaccines given to individuals in 2021.[12]Pfizer is in a strong financial position to significantly increase its contribution to global vaccination efforts and has a responsibility to do so. Although the company did not accept any American federal funding while developing the vaccine, the German government provided a $445 million grant to Pfizer’s partner firm, BioNTech, to expand vaccine trials and production capacity.[13] Furthermore, the United States government coordinated scientific expertise and research infrastructure,[14] provided Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite the market launch of the vaccine,[15] and pre-ordered doses early in the development process to ensure healthy sales.[16]Given all this public support, and the fact that Pfizer is expected to earn about $36 billion in 2021—and up to $54.5 billion in 2022 according to some projections—from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine,[17],[18] it is reasonable to expect the company to make a sizeable contribution to global vaccination efforts. By all accounts, Pfizer is able to do so without undercutting investment in the development of future mRNA technology or payouts to shareholders, as individual stock returns have increased by 52 percent since the end of 2019.[19]Working to increase global access to the COVID-19 vaccine is consistent with Pfizer’s Statement of Purpose,[20] which includes a commitment to health equity in obtaining access to the vaccine. It is time to move beyond statements of principle and take more substantial concrete steps to get shots in arms around the world.We are dismayed at Pfizer’s continued prioritization of vaccine orders for high-income countries,[21] lack of transparency about where COVAX and other low and middle-income countries are in the queue for vaccine deliveries, and resistance to sharing its technology and immediately ramping up global vaccine production.[22] There are many important ways in which Pfizer can make a more substantial contribution to global vaccination efforts and save countless lives. We call on the company to:Thank you for your urgent attention to the matter of global disparities in vaccine supply and access. We stand ready to work with you to bring a swift end to the global pandemic. Sincerely,  ###[1] University of Oxford & Global Change Data Lab.

The members were joined in sending the letter by over a dozen of their colleagues. Congressman Garamendi is the only returned Peace Corps volunteer currently serving in the U.S. House of Representatives and co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Peace Corps Caucus.On October 6, 2021, the Department announced reforms including a new temporary waiver period that allowed some borrowers to receive credit towards Public Student Loan Forgiveness for periods of public service that would have not previously qualified under the program. The newly available temporary waiver period fixed issues that prevented some public servants from receiving Public Student Loan Forgiveness credit during their service due to the repayment status of their student loans.Unfortunately, returned Peace Corps volunteers, who had faced similar challenges in receiving the student loan relief that they were otherwise due, were not made eligible for the temporary waiver period and are precluded from having their service count through the adjustments to Public Student Loan Forgiveness.In their letter to Secretary Cardona, Senators Cardin and Van Hollen and Rep. Garamendi said, “We strongly support your Department’s efforts to reform, strengthen, and expand the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program, including the time-limited waivers for additional student borrowers announced on October 6, 2021. We simply request that you provide for current and returned Peace Corps volunteers by creating a new waiver or expanding current waivers to allow volunteers to credit their full service overseas towards PSLF or Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, even if their federal student loans were placed into deferment or forbearance status during their service.”The full text of their letter is available here.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

The team brings police officers and mental health professionals together so they can better assist those experiencing a behavioral or mental health crisis.“The Frederick Mobile Crisis Team pairs law enforcement personnel with mental health professionals to help those in crisis get the care they need in an effective, compassionate manner,” said the lawmakers. “This program should serve as a blueprint for response teams across Maryland and the country as an added tool to prevent escalation or crimes. These federal funds will only build on the team’s success in the Frederick community to keep our neighborhoods safe.”   “Mental health calls are some of the most complex cases that an officer can encounter, and our cops do an exceptional job navigating these difficult situations. But often law enforcement is not the right tool when a person is in crisis,” said Frederick Police Chief Jason Lando. “The Crisis Car takes a collaborative approach by adding more tools to the crisis intervention toolbox. This grant allows our agencies to expand the hours of the program to further meet the needs of our residents experiencing a mental health crisis.”The award comes from the Department of Justice and will be used to treat those experiencing a mental or behavioral health crisis more effectively and as part of its crime prevention strategy. The Mobile Crisis Team pairs one police officer with a mental health professional during each shift. Police officers are dressed in a “soft” uniform to limit any hesitation in communication from individuals in crisis. The Mobile Crisis Team aims to collaborate more with community partners, improve the effectiveness in handling a mental or behavioral crisis, and increase the amount of individuals seeking treatment. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie Raskin and David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced $31,662,850 in the first round of federal funding to airports across the state from the bipartisan infrastructure law.This funding comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation through the bipartisan infrastructure law, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden in November. This funding will help Maryland airports prepare for future growth and better serve their passengers by undertaking a variety of projects to improve safety and operation of runways and taxiways and expand capacity at airport terminals. Airports in Maryland are expected to receive a total of $158 million over the next five years as a result of the bipartisan infrastructure law.“Modernizing our airports will help our state and our communities meet economic demand today and in the future. With this federal support, our Maryland airports will create and maintain high-quality jobs and deliver safer and more efficient service to passengers and regional businesses,” the lawmakers said. “We worked to advance the once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure because funding like this is crucial to Maryland’s communities and local economies.”Awardees include:LOCIDAirport NameCityTotal BWIBaltimore/Washington International Thurgood MarshallBaltimore$                      25,643,515SBYSalisbury-Ocean City Wicomico RegionalSalisbury$                        1,045,462HGRHagerstown Regional-Richard A Henson FieldHagerstown$                        1,018,873MTNMartin StateBaltimore$                           763,000ESNEaston/Newnam FieldEaston$                           763,000FMETiptonFort Meade(Odenton)$                           295,000FDKFrederick MunicipalFrederick$                           295,000GAIMontgomery County AirparkGaithersburg$                           295,0002W6St Mary’s County RegionalLeonardtown$                           295,000DMWCarroll County Regional/Jack B Poage FieldWestminster$                           295,000CGECambridge-Dorchester RegionalCambridge$                           159,000CGSCollege ParkCollege Park$                           159,000CBEGreater Cumberland RegionalCumberland Heights$                           159,0002G4Garrett CountyOakland$                           159,000OXBOcean City MunicipalOcean City$                           159,000W29Bay BridgeStevensville$                           159,000The Maryland delegation has fought for funding to support our local airports throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and has delivered to Maryland airports over $100 million in funding through the American Rescue Plan. Previously, the lawmakers announced American Rescue Plan Funding for Regional Maryland Airports for COVID-19 safety, cleaning and operations and nearly $14 million in federal funding to BWI, Easton/Newnam and Carroll County Regional Airports. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/maryland-delegation-announces-more-than-190-million-to-help-health-care-providers-impacted-by-covid-19-,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen and Congressmen Steny H. Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Andy Harris, M.D., Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (all Md.) today announced $191,711,521 in payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to help health care providers across Maryland recover from revenue losses and expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.This latest tranche of PRF funding is authorized through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) and comes from HHS through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). It will be distributed across 1,723 providers in Maryland. These federal funds are part of the Biden-Harris administration’s push to release $25.5 billion to health care providers to recruit and retain staff, purchase masks and other supplies, modernize facilities, and replenish resources depleted from COVID-19.“The pandemic has significantly strained and tested our health care providers,” the lawmakers said. “We must continue to support our frontline providers as they respond to the sustained demand for their services in our communities, especially those worst hit by COVID-19. This federal relief will help ensure communities have access to the care and resources they need.”Approximately 75% of Phase 4 PRF funding is being distributed based on expenses and decreased revenues from July 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. HRSA is reimbursing a higher percentage of losses and expenses for smaller providers – which generally entered into the COVID-19 pandemic on worse financial footing, have historically operated on slimmer financial margins, and typically care for vulnerable populations – as compared to larger providers. Consistent with the Biden-Harris administration’s dedication to health equity and supporting the most vulnerable communities, HRSA is distributing 25% of Phase 4 funding as “bonus” payments based on the amount and type of services provided to Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP patients. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/senators-send-bipartisan-letter-to-state-department-in-support-of-tibetan-autonomy,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote Tuesday to Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya, ahead of her expected appointment as Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, advocating for a U.S. policy toward Tibet that protects the rights, autonomy, and dignity of the Tibetan people. The letter also calls for a policy that further validates Tibet’s distinct political, ethnic, cultural, and religious identity apart from that of the People’s Republic of China. In the letter, the senators outlined various steps that the Biden Administration, and Congress, can take to advance U.S. policy on Tibet, including: Joining Cardin, Rubio and Leahy in the letter were Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Angus King (I-Maine), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), as well as Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Tex.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), James Lankford (R-Okla.), A companion letter, which was signed by a group of bipartisan members in the House of Representatives, was led by Representatives Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.).“Tibet matters to us, not only as an issue that is important to our constituents and the Tibetan-American community, but also as a tangible manifestation of a principled foreign policy that prioritizes human rights and the quest for human dignity,” the senators wrote. “We stand ready to work with you on this urgent moral issue.” The full text of the letter is below.Dear Under Secretary Zeya:Following your confirmation as Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, we anticipate your appointment as Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues is forthcoming in keeping with precedent. Tibet has generated deep bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for several decades. Advocacy for the rights and dignity of the Tibetan people is essential to any principled foreign policy.  As you prepare to assume the duties of the Special Coordinator, we write to convey our thoughts about how the Biden Administration, and Congress, can collaborate to advance U.S. policy on Tibet consistent with U.S. law, including the 2002 Tibetan Policy Act and the 2020 Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA): Engage with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Four of the last five Presidents have hosted His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan religious leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in the White House, and often multiple times during their presidencies. President Biden can demonstrate the importance of His Holiness’ moral message and example by inviting His Holiness to meet in the Oval Office to discuss shared interests and strategies for addressing the world’s most pressing problems. If His Holiness is unable to travel, then the President should seek an opportunity to meet with him in India, or send a high-level representative, such as the Vice President or a cabinet official, to do so in his stead.Deepen engagement with the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in Exile. Over the last several years, through specific appropriations by Congress, the U.S. government has increased its support for projects to improve the welfare and education of Tibetans in CTA-administered communities in India and Nepal. In April 2021, Tibetans in exile once again chose a new leader through democratic elections. We encourage you to engage the new Sikyong, Penpa Tsering, on ways to improve the livelihoods of Tibetans within the CTA, to protect Tibetan culture and language inside and outside of Tibet, and to resolve the Tibet conflict consistent with Tibetans’ aspirations for dignity and freedom.Religious freedom and the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. The Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA) established as U.S. policy that decisions involving the next Dalai Lama are religious in nature and belong solely to him and the Tibetan people. We welcome the Biden Administration’s support of this policy. We urge you, and other administration officials, to publicly reiterate this policy and work with like-minded governments to craft a multilateral strategy to affirm this stance as the international norm, not only as a matter of religious freedom but as a strategic counter to the Chinese Communist Party’s and government’s claims of ownership to the lands of the Tibetan people and its assertion of control over the religious institution of the Dalai Lama. Tibetan political prisoners. Tibetans have long been subject to particularly brutal treatment in the Chinese criminal justice system, and contribute disproportionately to the number of political prisoners in China. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China’s Political Prisoner Database contains thousands of records of Tibetans detained since the 1980s for political or religious reasons, and currently counts 687 such Tibetans who are known or believed to currently be in detention. We urge you to advocate on behalf of Tibetans detained or imprisoned in the People’s Republic of China due to the exercise of their internationally recognized human rights, demanding their release and improved treatment while in custody.Access to Tibet. We encourage you to fully implement the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act. We look forward to receiving reports required by sections 4(a) and 5(c) that are due this summer, and seek assurances that the State Department is ensuring access to Tibetan areas in keeping with the principle of reciprocity, and considering appropriate responses if such access continues to be denied. Likewise, we note the importance of restoring opportunities for engagement with the Tibetan people inside Tibet and for monitoring developments on the Tibetan plateau. In Questions-for-the-Record submitted to Secretary Blinken during his January nomination hearing, Senator Rubio expressed concerns about the PRC authorities’ closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, which historically dealt with Tibet issues, in August 2020, and asked Mr. Blinken whether he would establish a Tibet Unit within the Political Section of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to maintain the work of the consulate, to which Secretary Blinken replied in the affirmative. We ask that you work with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs to ensure that the Secretary’s commitment is fulfilled. We also affirm our interest in the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa as expressed in Section 618 of the TPSA, and encourage you to work with the relevant officials in the Department to accomplish this goal.Help invigorate a political initiative to put Tibetans back at the table. The last round of the Sino-Tibetan dialogue was held in January 2010.  The PRC side has shown no interest in further talks, insisting that the Dalai Lama first meet unreasonable preconditions.  Persistent calls from the U.S. and other governments for a resumption of dialogue have failed to produce results. We encourage the U.S. government to engage earnestly with both sides, like-minded partners, and experts to explore novel strategies that could produce forward movement. Tibet’s status. We appreciate that the Tibet section of the 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices does not refer to Tibetan areas as “part of the People’s Republic of China.”  The Chinese government has demanded, as a precondition to dialogue, that the Dalai Lama state that Tibet has been a part of China “since ancient times,” which the Dalai Lama has refused to do on the grounds that it is false. The Chinese government has asked several governments to state that “Tibet is part of China,” with success, and cited these statements to portray the Dalai Lama as isolated and not representative of the Tibetan people. These actions by the Chinese government are obstacles to dialogue. Consistent with the State Department’s calls for dialogue without preconditions, we urge the continued exclusion of this phrase from future reports and statements, both as a means to promote renewed negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives, and as an opportunity to ground U.S. policy in a respect for historical accuracy and affirm the Tibetan peoples’ rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Thousands of Tibetan refugees reside in Nepal without legal status and without a path to acquire such status. They are vulnerable and lack means to assert rights to equal treatment before the law, education, land ownership, freedom of movement, and employment. There has been a frustrating inertia on this issue for decades.  We encourage you to work expeditiously with like-minded governments to find solutions to these issues. Support Tibetan language and culture. Authorities in Tibetan areas of the People’s Republic of China continue to force Mandarin instruction and decrease the role of the Tibetan language in educational settings, in tandem with PRC policy directives to promote the “Sinicization” of Tibetan Buddhism. We urge the U.S. government to continue to fund programs, by both the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, to help Tibetans preserve their language and cultural identity, including exchange and scholarship programs. We also ask you to ensure that Tibetan language training is provided to Foreign Service officers, per the Tibetan Policy Act. Multilateral coordination. We encourage you to prioritize coordination with like-minded states on policy initiatives pertaining to Tibet, including to promote negotiations on a political resolution as provided for by the TPSA. Such coordination is critical to affirming the right of the Dalai Lama to choose his successor, and important to efforts to monitor and protect the environment on the Tibetan Plateau which is experiencing the effects of rising temperatures, including glacial retreat, changes in the monsoon cycle and the flow of rivers, and desertification.Tibet matters to us, not only as an issue that is important to our constituents and the Tibetan-American community, but also as a tangible manifestation of a principled foreign policy that prioritizes human rights and the quest for human dignity. We stand ready to work with you on this urgent moral issue. Sincerely,###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-casey-booker-kaine-introduce-bill-to-empower-community-college-students,"Press ReleaseAccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 100 occupations only require an associate degree or postsecondary non-degree credential CREATE Graduates Act will remove barriers for community college students who transferred to a four-year college to earn an associate degreeWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) today introduced the Correctly Recognizing Educational Achievements (CREATE) Graduates Act, which would help community college students who transferred receive their associate degree by transferring their earned credits back to their community college, a process known as “reverse transfer.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 100 occupations only require an associate degree or postsecondary non-degree credential. The CREATE Graduates Act will help students achieve greater economic security and access more employment opportunities.“A college degree can significantly increase economic opportunities for workers, and we must recognize the college credits and skills gained by those who worked towards but did not earn a four-year undergraduate degree,” said Senator Cardin. “The CREATE Graduates Act would break down administrative barriers and accelerate Maryland’s existing work to enhance reverse transfer agreements for Maryland students and provide them with the associate’s degree they have earned.”“In today’s economy, an associate degree can help graduates compete for jobs, earn higher wages and build brighter futures,” said Senator Casey. “Too many students have done all the work, but through no fault of their own, never earn the degree. The CREATE Graduates Act recognizes the accomplishments of hardworking Americans by allowing them to receive their associate degrees and gain access to more employment and economic opportunities.”“As occupations increasingly require people to possess a higher-education degree, our nation must take steps to ensure that workers have the qualifications and skills necessary to thrive in this job market,” said Senator Booker. “Currently, thousands of students have successfully completed the requirements of an associate degree but have not yet received one. This legislation will identify and assist these students in obtaining their rightfully earned credentials, helping them secure employment and succeed in their future careers.”“The success of our economic recovery will depend on our ability to help people access the education and skills they need to thrive in the workforce,” said Senator Kaine. “By making it easier for students to receive an associate degree, this legislation helps them prepare for good-paying, in-demand jobs as we continue to build back better.”Each year, thousands of community college students who haven’t yet received a degree transfer to four-year institutions. If these students leave the university before graduation for any number of reasons—to start a job, care for family, serve in the military or because they could no longer afford the cost—they are left with nothing to show for their hard work. Without a degree, these individuals are less likely to secure employment and earn less over their lifetime than their peers. The CREATE Graduates Act awards competitive grants to states to help institutions identify students who have already completed the credit requirements for an associate degree or could do so within a short time.The bill would encourage higher education institutions to establish “reverse transfer” programs, initiatives to transfer back credits from a four-year institution to the community college where a student was initially enrolled. It would also help colleges and universities proactively provide outreach and information on the next steps to complete their degree.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-outline-chesapeake-bay-priorities-for-army-corps-of-engineers,"Press ReleaseSenators call on Corps to tackle backlog of dredging projects for small ports and channels, quickly transition from Poplar Island to Mid-Bay restorationWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (Both D-Md.) wrote Monday to the newly confirmed Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, who leads the Army Corps of Engineers, spotlighting the major priorities across Maryland and their importance to our state. “The enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides an opportunity to accelerate progress on the effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay, of which the Army Corps of Engineers is a federal agency partner,” they wrote.The letter includes requests to continue the “multi-year effort in transitioning from Poplar to Mid-Bay,” as well as “timely maintenance” for Maryland’s beaches and shorelines. The senators “ask for your consideration of the large maintenance backlog for smaller, federally-authorized navigation channels and harbors in Maryland,” urge the expanded staffing of the Army Corps’ Baltimore District to support its regulatory program, and request greater engagement through Planning Assistance to States and Flood Plain Management Services to help communities undertake resilience planning and adapt to the new kinds of storm and flood risks we face in Maryland. Finally, they ask the Assistant Secretary to recommit to implementation of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program (Section 510 of WRDA 1996), which plays an important role in the restoration and protection of the Bay.Senator Cardin is Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, which has oversight responsibility for the Army Corps of Engineers and develops the Water Resources Development Act legislation, which authorizes projects and sets national policy for the Army Corps. Senator Van Hollen is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee which has jurisdiction over Army Corps funding and determines annual spending for the Army Corps to complete these vital projects.The full letter follows and can be found at this link.The Honorable Michael ConnorAssistant Secretary of the Army for Civil WorksDepartment of the Army108 Army PentagonWashington, D.C. 20310-0108 Dear Secretary Connor,Congratulations on your confirmation as Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Your background and your understanding of our nation’s water resources challenges will serve you well in this position. Your appointment comes at an important moment in our history—the start a new era of major federal investment in our nation’s infrastructure. The enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides an opportunity to accelerate progress on the effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay, of which the Army Corps of Engineers is a federal agency partner. It is with this opportunity in mind that we write you today to highlight our aspirations for collaboration with you and the Army Corps.The work of the Army Corps of Engineers is critically important to our state, and the numerous Maryland projects listed each year in the Corps’ annual Work Plan testify to this fact. This year, we support all 12 of the projects listed for Maryland in the Administration’s Budget Request for FY 2022, six of which cross state boundaries. We are especially grateful for the inclusion of the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Recovery project in the Budget Request for the first time and support its inclusion in future budget requests. With the return of Congressionally Directed Spending and Community Project Funding requests in the Senate and House, the Maryland Congressional Delegation secured $45.8 million to support six additional Corps projects beyond what was included in the Administration’s Budget Request, and we ask that these projects be implemented if included in an FY 2022 omnibus funding bill:Beyond the projects identified by the Administration, as you begin to formulate plans for the coming year and for implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we ask you to consider several longstanding priorities not necessarily included or fully expressed in the list of projects in the Budget Request.First, the Port of Baltimore plays a critical role as a driver for our state economy and as a hub in our national supply chains. Its ability to expand capacity and increase efficiency will be a key component of our work nationwide to upgrade our supply chain infrastructure. In Maryland, we are proud to partner with the Port in advancing projects for the beneficial use of dredged material, pursuing the dual goal of maintaining the safety of our navigation channels and restoring the Bay’s ecosystems and wildlife habitat. We have done this at Poplar Island and are eager for the work to continue with the construction of the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island Ecosystem Restoration Project. We ask for your commitment to this multi-year effort in transitioning from Poplar to Mid-Bay.Second, as you consider the Army Corps’ contribution to the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we ask you to keep in mind the importance of Maryland’s beaches and shorelines. As a coastal state, the active use of our beaches and shorelines requires timely maintenance. Ocean City, Maryland for example, has relied on the Corps’ regular installments of beach renourishment work, and we hope you will incorporate this priority into your planning for the use of construction funds under the IIJA. Since the 1990s, this renourishment work has prevented more than $900 million in storm damages, while helping to maintain local economic activity that contributes hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax revenue each year.Third, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides $4 billion for Operations and Maintenance. We ask for your consideration of the large maintenance backlog for smaller, federally-authorized navigation channels and harbors in Maryland. For many small communities along the Chesapeake Bay, daily lives and a sense of place are linked to opportunities on the water for both commerce and recreation. However, some of the channels and harbors that these communities rely on have waited years or even decades for maintenance necessary for safe navigation. Projects to address this maintenance backlog can provide benefits for disadvantaged communities, including flood protection and ecosystem resilience.We recognize that these channels and harbors would likely be categorized as “low use” within a national context that includes our largest ports. But they are nevertheless vital to the livelihoods and identities of the communities along the Chesapeake Bay and are part of what gives the Bay watershed region its unique character. We also recognize that addressing their maintenance needs requires coordination and planning, such as identifying suitable disposal sites for dredged material. However, expanded use of dredged material can contribute to resilience and integrated water resources management, unlocking more ways to move forward on navigation maintenance. We are confident that with a concerted effort to find creative solutions and new funding under the IIJA, we can address the backlog of navigation needs in Maryland, and bring our small channels and harbors back to a safe, usable condition.Fourth, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides $160 million for the Army Corps’ regulatory program. This funding is a critical to protect the nation’s aquatic environments, including wetlands. As construction begins on a wide range of infrastructure projects, the regulatory program’s workload is certain to increase in the near future. We need the regulatory program to execute its critical role in safeguarding our natural resources without becoming overburdened and causing avoidable delays in permitting. As you plan for the allocation of this funding, we request your full consideration of the Baltimore District’s needs for expanding capacity in the regulatory program, including hiring new staff.Fifth, climate change is embedded in all of the water resources issues that we have raised in this letter so far. Increasing the climate change resiliency of the Chesapeake Bay watershed is an essential goal of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Our efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay will be successful only insofar as they recognize the reality of climate change and the need for resilience to its impacts. Around our state, the adverse impacts of climate change are already hitting home, such as record-setting rainfall events that are overwhelming our infrastructure, increasing frequency of nuisance flooding that is undermining investment in business districts, and rising sea levels that threaten communities around the Bay. We request that as you assume your new position, you consider how the Corps can expand its work through Planning Assistance to States and Flood Plain Management Services to help communities undertake resilience planning and adapt to the new kinds of storm and flood risks we face in Maryland.Finally, the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure that supports commerce, livelihoods, ecosystems, and a unique cultural heritage in Maryland. The establishment of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program in Section 510 of WRDA 1996 recognized the important role the Army Corps plays in the restoration and protection of the Bay, and the program now has a completed Comprehensive Water Resources Restoration Plan. It is time to recommit to implementation, and we ask for your support in allocating funds to this program to accelerate progress towards our environmental goals.Again, congratulations on your confirmation. We look forward to partnering with you and the Army Corps of Engineers in the months ahead, and we appreciate your consideration of these requests.Sincerely, ### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-trone-announce-12-million-in-american-rescue-plan-funding-for-hagerstown-and-frederick-airports,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON —  Today, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen Congressman David Trone (all D-Md.) announced $1,202,449 in new American Rescue Plan funding for the Hagerstown Regional Airport ($1,143,449) and the Frederick Municipal Airport ($59,000). The federal relief funds will be used to cover costs of operations, personnel, cleaning, sanitization, janitorial services, debt service payments, and to prevent the spread of pathogens at the airport amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“Investing in our airports supports our local economies and helps drive business in the region,” said the lawmakers. “That’s why we fought to pass the American Rescue Plan and secure federal dollars like these to help our local airports weather the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will keep working to bring federal resources to our state to modernize Maryland’s infrastructure and support our regional airports.”“The new American Rescue Plan funding ensures that airport staff are equipped to handle the uncertainty of the pandemic and keeps our community safe,” said Jeff Cline, President of the Board of Washington County Commissioners. “The Hagerstown Regional Airport has been an important part of our community for as long as I can remember, and ensuring that it can operate smoothly is essential. I’d like to thank Congressman Trone along with Senators Cardin and Van Hollen for helping us get this funding.” “We are very excited to receive over $1.1 million in grant funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA),” said Rick Johnson, Hagerstown Regional Airport Director. “These funds will help HGR as we continually work to combat the health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  They will be utilized in our operational efforts to combat the spread of pathogens at the airport, to include funds for additional cleaning, sanitization, janitorial services, and more. HGR is a gem to our community and these funds will help us in our continual effort to provide a safe environment for those who utilize our airport.” “The federal government’s investment in general aviation at FDK is an investment in the economic vitality of the City of Frederick, said Michael O’Connor, Mayor of Frederick. “This additional funding will help FDK continue to build our local transportation economy and support the City’s full economic recovery from the effects of the pandemic.” “We appreciate the continued support from our federal partners, the ARPA relief funds will aid our goals to be the preferred intermodal access point to the National Capital Region and the Frederick area,” said Andrew Moore, Frederick Municipal Airport Manager. The Hagerstown Regional Airport is one of the oldest operating airports in the country. It’s located on Route 11, just three miles north of Hagerstown. The airport contributes to the community by hosting private pilots, businesses, and tourism events. The Frederick Municipal Airport, also known as FDK, is a full-service reliever airport in the National Capital Region. It operates over 90,000 aircraft operations annually, making it the second busiest airport in the state of Maryland. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-announce-106-million-in-relief-funds-for-purple-line-from-the-american-rescue-plan-passed-by-congress,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) today announced that the Purple Line light rail project connecting Montgomery and Prince George’s County is expected to receive $106,163,373 from the American Rescue Plan as part of funds provided through the Capital Investment Grants program. The Senate approved the COVID-19 relief package on Saturday, the House of Representatives passed it earlier this week and President Joe Biden signed the bill into law today. The funding will help keep the Purple Line on track for completion in spite of challenges the State has encountered with the project. This funding will bring the total federal allocation for the Purple Line to more than $910 million since 2009.“The Purple Line and the vital public transportation that it will bring to Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties is one of our top transit priorities,” said Cardin and Van Hollen. “One of the best ways to spur growth and build back from the economic downturn caused by this pandemic is to invest in projects that create local jobs while improving our local public transportation and infrastructure. The Purple Line is critical for achieving these goals in Maryland. We are proud to have helped secure this additional federal funding to support the Purple Line, overcome the setbacks the project faced over the past year, and move forward towards completion. We will continue to monitor the project closely to ensure continued progress and engagement of the local communities along the route.”The Purple Line, a 16.2-mile light rail system with 21 stations, will connect Montgomery County to Prince George’s County and is expected to take approximately 17,000 cars off the road each day. Along the way, it will connect to three Metrorail lines, all three MARC Commuter rail lines, and Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor line. Nearly half of the riders on the new Purple Line are expected to connect to Metrorail and MARC. The project has been estimated to generate more than 20,000 permanent jobs and more than 6,000 construction jobs.  ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/bipartisan-group-of-senators-introduce-the-keeping-women-and-girls-safe-from-the-start-act-of-2021-,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and nine of their Senate colleagues today in introducing the Keeping Women and Girls Safe from the Start Act of 2021. Introduced on the heels of International Women’s Day, the bipartisan legislation seeks to strengthen current United States’ and international actors’ efforts to address gender-based violence perpetrated during humanitarian crises, which disproportionately threaten the wellbeing of vulnerable women and girls.In addition to establishing U.S. government policy to advance the skills of humanitarian actors, improve coordination in emergency response, and bolster support for survivors of gender-based violence in humanitarian emergency contexts, the comprehensive legislation seeks to elevate the voices of women and girls around the world by fostering empowerment opportunities that promote economic advancement, access to education, and leadership and involvement in humanitarian response efforts.“As millions of displaced people seek refuge around the world, women are holding their families together even in the most dire of circumstances. I am proud to support this legislation that expands women and girls’ leadership opportunities and strengthens their protections in humanitarian crises,” said Senator Cardin, Chair of the SFRC Subcommittee on State Department and USAID Management, International Operations. “By formalizing the State Department’s and USAID’s Safe from the Start program, we can improve efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence.”“With this commonsense legislation, we stand in solidarity with vulnerable communities around the world who have suffered immeasurable tragedies under humanitarian emergency conditions, including the widespread and horrific perpetration of gender-based violence,” Chairman Menendez said. “Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the largest recorded refugee crisis in history, displaced women and girls seeking refuge and safety have endured horrific abuses that demand swift and substantive action. I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to pass this legislation and critically strengthen the tools necessary for the United States and its partners to confront gender-based violence against women and girls everywhere.”“During the COVID-19 public health crisis, violence perpetrated against women and girls has drastically increased around the globe. Refugees, displaced and stateless women and girls were at greater risk from gender-based violence long before COVID-19, but the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have only exacerbated these pervasive issues,” Senator Murkowski said. “We have a collective responsibility to safeguard the most vulnerable, particularly during global conflict. This commonsense legislation will promote a coordinated response to gender-based violence, while establishing prevention methods and increasing access to services for survivors around the globe.”Joining Senators Cardin, Menendez and Murkowski in introducing the legislation were Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Susan Collins (R-Maine).“Around the world, there is a disturbing pattern of humanitarian crises intensifying horrific gender-based violence experienced by women and girls,” said Senator Merkley. “Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse are extremely serious crimes—and we can’t stay silent while they happen. We must do all that we can to ensure that our international efforts actively address gender-based violence by providing the resources necessary to help those who are impacted and to expand economic, educational, and leadership opportunities for women.”“Preventing and responding to the global epidemic of violence against women and girls requires our swift and immediate action,” said Senator Rosen. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in this bipartisan legislation that will help bring an end to gender-based violence by enabling the State Department to provide communities across the globe with resources and tools to prevent incidents, as well as to empower women and girls who are experiencing violence. Together, we can help put an end to gender-based violence.” “America’s global leadership must include standing up and speaking out against gender-based violence. Keeping women and girls safe around the world, as well as promoting efforts to empower them, should be central to our efforts to address humanitarian crises. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation that reaffirms the United States’ commitment to protecting the safety of and expanding opportunity for women across the globe,” said Senator Van Hollen.“The Keeping Women and Girls Safe from the Start Act takes practical action to address the disproportional impacts on displaced women and girls during a humanitarian crisis, and I applaud Senators Menendez and Murkoswki for their leadership,” Senator Markey said. “Our humanitarian responses will be more impactful and humane if our interventions respond to the specific vulnerabilities and needs of girls and women. This legislation will help to prevent, identify, and manage cases of gender-based violence, and expand opportunities for women and girls in humanitarian settings.”“I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Keeping Women and Girls Safe Act,” said Senator Coons. “The United States is the global leader in humanitarian assistance, and we have a responsibility to make sure that women and girls are safe from violence and sexual exploitation. All too often, women and girls face the real risk of gender-based violence even when they’ve escaped from conflict or disaster zones. Part of the solution is bringing women to the table and empowering them as decision-makers and agents of change in humanitarian response.”“When humanitarian crises emerge, women and girls are at greater risk of experiencing sexual and domestic violence. Combating gender-based violence is a moral responsibility as well as a critical part of broader efforts to bring stability and economic security to some of the most vulnerable corners of the globe. This demands Congress’ attention and should be a U.S. foreign policy priority,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m glad to join Senators across the aisle in this bipartisan legislation to ensure the State Department and USAID prioritize addressing gender-based violence during humanitarian crises, making sure sites like refugee camps are not safe harbors for perpetrators to target displaced and vulnerable women. We must remain vigilant and ensure our women and girls are at the forefront of our work to resolve humanitarian emergencies.”“In addition to being a pressing human rights issue, gender-based violence contributes to inequality and political instability, making it a security issue as well as a moral issue for us all. Our bipartisan bill would support U.S. and international efforts to combat such violence around the world,” said Senator Collins. “I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to end gender-based violence and to provide the assistance and resources necessary to achieve this goal.”Find a Section-by-Section summary of the bill HERE.Find a copy of the bill HERE.Tarah Demant, Director, Gender, Sexuality, and Identity Program, Amnesty International USA, said:  “All people have the right to live free from violence, yet 1 in 3 women globally will experience violence, and in humanitarian emergencies, women and girls are even more vulnerable to violence. Ending violence against women and girls should be at the heart of U.S. foreign policy, including in work to address humanitarian crises.”Richard L. Santos, President and CEO, Church World Service, said:  “Women and girls face increased risks of gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies, including natural disasters and protracted refugee crises. This is unacceptable, and all the more tragic given that displacement caused both by conflict and extreme weather events around the world continues to increase. The impact of COVID-19 now further exacerbates this situation, and has increased the risk of gender-based violence for women and girls everywhere. CWS accompanies women and girls in rebuilding their lives after being forced from home by conflict, persecution or disaster; we know their needs are profound and their voice, choice and agency need to be heard. We are proud to support the Keeping Women and Girls Safe from the Start Act and urge Members of Congress to do the same.”The Keeping Women and Girls Safe from the Start Act was endorsed by over 68 leading civil society organizations.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-applauds-marylander-merrick-garlands-confirmation-as-attorney-general-,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today commended the Senate’s confirmation of Judge Merrick B. Garland to be the 86th Attorney General of the United States by a 70-30 vote.“Merrick Garland is a fellow Marylander, and I was proud to introduce him in a statement before the Judiciary Committee on February 22.  I was pleased that last week the committee favorably recommended his nomination to the full Senate by a bipartisan vote of 15 to 7.“Judge Garland is uniquely qualified at this moment in history to serve as the people’s lawyer and restore honor, integrity, and independence to DOJ.“From 1994 until his appointment as U.S. Circuit Judge, he served as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, where his responsibilities included supervising the Oklahoma City bombing and UNABOM prosecutions.  In 1997, he was appointed as a Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often seen as the nation’s second highest and most powerful court, given their review of federal agency actions and other matters.  He served as Chief Judge of the DC Circuit from 2013 to 2020. “Judge Garland has published in the Harvard Law Review and Yale Law Journal, taught at Harvard Law School, and served as President of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University. He served as Chair of the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 2017 to 2020.“Judge Garland has served both Democratic and Republican administrations in the Justice Department, including service under President Carter, the first President Bush, and President Clinton.  He earned a reputation as a tough and fair prosecutor who took on complicated terrorism, violent crime, and corruption cases.  He established a sterling reputation of handling cases with the utmost professionalism, and is seen by his peers as a modest man who is fundamentally a decent human being. “As President Biden noted in his introduction of Judge Garland’s nomination, despite his busy schedule and prestigious positions, he still makes time to volunteer regularly, tutoring students in Northeast DC, as he’s done for 20 years.  And I agree this really shows us the true character of Judge Garland, in terms of his commitment to public service, helping others, and not necessarily seeking out the limelight.“I am hopeful that Judge Garland’s appointment will shore up and improve the morale at the Justice Department, as the Department renews its commitment to uphold civil rights and voting rights laws; protect the civil liberties and equal access to justice of all Americans; safeguard our national security and combat violent crime; and rout out systemic racism in our criminal justice system and government.  As the only Cabinet department named after an ideal, I am convinced that Judge Garland will follow the facts, evidence, and law wherever it leads him, regardless of political pressure or outside influences.”  ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-durbin-call-on-sec-to-amend-weak-final-rule-implementing-section-1504-of-dodd-frank-act,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Finance committees, and U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) are urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend its weak final rule on the implementation of Section 1504 the Dodd-Frank Act (Cardin-Lugar Energy Security Through Transparency). The provision was designed to add transparency and stability to markets through greater information and predictability thereby reducing corruption and protecting investors from undue risks. Section 1504 requires extractive companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose, in their SEC filings, payments made to governments for oil, gas and mining.“We urge the SEC to act swiftly to amend the December 16, 2020 rule to ensure it serves as an effective tool for combating corruption and provides critical information to investors,” the senators wrote. “The SEC can and must act to strengthen certain key aspects of the rule to ensure it satisfies the anti-corruption and investor protection objectives of the original statute. Most importantly, the rule must require payment disclosure that is disaggregated and publicly disclosed on a project-basis.”Citing the global leadership of the United States in fighting corruption and ensuring transparency of its markets, the senators called upon the U.S. and SEC “to reclaim that leadership role and recommit to acting in the best interests of investors,” and committed to “working with the SEC in its efforts to fight corruption, protect American investors, and reclaim American leadership in promoting extractive sector transparency.”The full letter can be found below and at this link.March 10, 2021The Honorable Allison Herren LeeActing ChairU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission100 F Street N.E.Washington, D.C. 20549 Dear Acting Chair Lee:We were deeply disappointed with the December 16, 2020 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue a weak rule implementing Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule fails to provide the level of granular transparency necessary to satisfy the original bipartisan Congressional intent behind the statute and it significantly diverges from the international payment transparency standard for the oil, gas, and mining industries reflected in transparency regulations in other markets and the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). We agree with the concerns you[1] and Commissioner Crenshaw[2] outlined in your dissenting views during December’s meeting to finalize the rule. As you both correctly pointed out, Congress intended the U.S. to lead on extractive industries transparency and in the fight against corruption, but with the current version of the final rule we would fall far behind.We note with concern that the SEC failed to take into account significant comments received during the public comment period, including in particular the views of stakeholders who have engaged with the SEC for over a decade on the rule. As we noted in our December 11, 2020 letter to former Chairman Clayton, to which we did not receive a response, the vast majority of commenters during the public comment period urged the SEC to strengthen its proposed rule to ensure consistency with other markets and the EITI standard. This position was strongly expressed by a wide range of stakeholders, including investors, many of the world’s largest oil, gas and mining companies, domestic and international civil society organizations seeking to use the information, and anti-corruption and legal experts. The SEC’s rule, which is far weaker than those in place in other markets, ignores these significant comments, undermines U.S. leadership in the fight against corruption, and is at odds with the original statutory objective to support international transparency promotion efforts. The SEC can and must act to strengthen certain key aspects of the rule to ensure it satisfies the anti-corruption and investor protection objectives of the original statute. Most importantly, the rule must require payment disclosure that is disaggregated and publicly disclosed on a project-basis, with “project” defined as the contract, lease or license that forms the basis of the payment liability, consistent with the definition already used in other markets and the EITI. The rule must also eliminate the overly broad exemptions that allow too many companies to avoid disclosure, creating a significant gap in the intended transparency of Section 1504, and ensure investor protection by requiring that disclosures be filed rather than furnished. With increased volatility and uncertainty in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, investors require more information to inform their decisions and safeguard their interests. We urge the SEC to act swiftly to amend the December 16, 2020 rule to ensure it serves as an effective tool for combating corruption and provides critical information to investors. The United States has long been a global leader in fighting corruption and ensuring transparency of its markets, and protecting U.S. investors by providing access to valuable information to assess risk and company performance. It is time for the U.S. – and the SEC – to reclaim that leadership role and recommit to acting in the best interests of investors. The SEC must ensure its rulemaking is responsive to stakeholder concerns.We look forward to working with the SEC in its efforts to fight corruption, protect American investors, and reclaim American leadership in promoting extractive sector transparency. We believe swift administrative action to amend this rule will further these objectives.Sincerely, cc:       Commissioner Hester M. PeirceCommissioner Elad L. RoismanCommissioner Caroline A.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-secure-maryland-funding-in-senate-passed-american-rescue-plan,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) today announced estimated top-line funding Maryland will receive following the Senate’s passage of the American Rescue Plan. This package will bring significant resources directly to Maryland to help workers, families, small businesses, and the State and local governments combat COVID-19 and recover from the health and economic impacts of the virus.    “We fought for this bill because it is going to bring real, concrete relief to Maryland and our nation at a time when we need it most. This pandemic is far from over,” said Senator Cardin. “The American Rescue Plan makes strategic investments in lifting up the hardest hit families and small businesses to help our communities recover. We are investing in our future by investing in vaccines, testing, contact tracing, public health, and all we need to finally get control of and bring an end to this public health crisis. We tackle the economic and social devastation by lifting families and children out of poverty, extending help for the unemployed, food insecure, and those left without health insurance or struggling to pay rent or mortgage. Small businesses, restaurants, seafood processors and nonprofits are going to get the lifeline they need to make it through this public health crisis. Importantly, the American Rescue Plan will provide desperately needed resources to state and local governments and our courageous front-line workers. Americans support this package because they know how much of a real difference it will make in their lives and their communities.”“From direct payments to Marylanders working to make ends meet, to an expansion of the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit that will lift thousands of Marylanders out of poverty, the American Rescue Plan is the bold relief our state needs at this moment. This sweeping package also includes critical funds that will go directly to our state and local governments, allowing them to ramp up vaccination efforts and ensure frontline workers stay on the job, while providing more resources for the equitable distribution of the vaccine nationwide. I was proud to fight for Maryland’s priorities within this bill, including important provisions to extend unemployment insurance, funding to help close the digital divide, resources to get our students safely back into the classroom, and support to allow small businesses and public transit networks to weather this storm. Americans called for action, and with the American Rescue Plan we answered those calls,” said Senator Van Hollen.American Rescue Plan: Maryland Wins State & Local Government Funding To help our state and local governments fund emergency services, distribute the vaccine, employ frontline workers, and more, the American Rescue Plan will provide: Totaling in: $6.355 Billion directly to our state (See below for further breakdown by city and county)Direct Payments To help Marylanders stay afloat during this economic downturn, the American Rescue Plan will provide: Totaling $6.25 Billion in direct payments for MarylandersChild Tax Credit To protect our most vulnerable, the American Rescue Plan expands the Child Tax Credit, resulting in a historic reduction in child poverty across the United States.

The bill provides: Health Care In addition to funds for state and local governments, to help get more vaccines in the arms of Americans efficiently and equitably and to beat the COVID-19 pandemic, nationwide, the American Rescue Plan includes: To ensure health care affordability and access nationwide, the American Rescue Plan: To support behavioral health, the American Rescue Plan includes nationally: Small Business To help our small businesses weather the storm of COVID-19, the American Rescue Plan provides critical support through a number of nationwide emergency programs, targeted at those who need them most. As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, Senator Cardin worked to secure these provisions. They include: To date:Transportation & Public Transit To allow our frontline workers to travel to and from work and to ensure our transit systems are able to weather this storm to serve commuters, the American Rescue Plan includes: To allow Maryland airports to weather this storm and to continue delivering crucial supplies to our state, the American Rescue Plan includes funding for the following:Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall$                 94,906,280Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional$                     1,405,618Hagerstown Regional-Richard A Henson Field$                     1,168,383Martin State$                         148,000Easton/Newnam Field$                         148,000Frederick Municipal$                           59,000Tipton$                           59,000Montgomery County Airpark$                           59,000St Mary’s County Regional$                           59,000Carroll County Regional/Jack B Poage Field$                           59,000Cambridge-Dorchester Regional$                           32,000College Park$                           32,000Greater Cumberland Regional$                           32,000Garrett County$                           32,000Ocean City Municipal$                           32,000Bay Bridge$                           32,000Housing and Utility Assistance To help Marylanders struggling to meet their rental payments, the American Rescue Plan includes:The legislation also includes significant investments in nationwide programs to support homeless services and prevent utility shut-offs including: Nutrition To help ensure American families can put food on the table, the American Rescue Plan includes, nationwide:  Expanded County, Municipality Breakdown Counties, in Millions of Dollars:Allegany County13.66Anne Arundel County112.34Baltimore City115.10Baltimore County160.46Calvert County17.94Caroline County6.48Carroll County32.67Cecil County19.95Charles County31.66Dorchester County6.19Frederick County50.34Garrett County5.63Harford County49.54Howard County63.17Kent County3.77Montgomery County203.77Prince George’s County176.36Queen Anne’s County9.77St. Mary’s County22.01Somerset County4.97Talbot County7.21Washington County29.30Wicomico County20.09Worcester County10.14 Cities, In Millions of Dollars (note further data on Maryland cities/towns available upon request): Baltimore555.17Rockville 56.90College Park 26.88Laurel 21.42Cumberland20.18Hagerstown20.04Greenbelt 19.41Westminster 15.58Hyattsville 15.24Takoma Park 14.81Easton 13.93Aberdeen13.39Elkton 13.06Havre de Grace 11.72Gaithersburg11.27New Carrollton 10.81Frederick10.32Cambridge 10.25Salisbury9.66Bel Air 8.46La Plata 8.05Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-trone-announce-50000-to-support-safe-housing-for-women-recovering-from-substance-use-disorder,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen  and Congressman David Trone (all D-Md.) today announced $50,000 in federal funding for Archway Station, Inc.’s Allegany Oxford House, which will serve as a safe housing option for women recovering from substance use disorder and their children. The funding will be used to renovate the Allegany Oxford House in Cumberland into apartment-style residences for those receiving treatment.“Archway Station understands that helping individuals in treatment for substance use disorders requires providing patients with support, resources and a safe place to call home. With this federal funding, Archway Station will be able to make necessary renovations to their Oxford House location to provide shelter to women in recovery and their children,” said Senator Cardin. “It is critical that we continue to get resources to Maryland communities to help combat the opioid epidemic and support addiction recovery, especially as we continue to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.”“Safe, stable housing is a critical component of recovery from substance use disorder. With these federal funds, Archway Station will be able to help more women and their children in Allegany County as they work to rebuild their lives. We will continue fighting to secure more resources to tackle the opioid epidemic and help address addiction in Western Maryland and throughout our state,” said Senator Van Hollen.“With overdose deaths up 111% in Allegany County this year, this federal funding is critical in supporting Archway Station, Inc.’s Allegany Oxford House as they create safe housing for women and their children impacted by substance use disorder,” said Congressman Trone. “With this funding, the Allegany Oxford House will be able to continue to provide women with a safe environment to help them stay in recovery during this unprecedented pandemic.”“The vision of Archway is to assist those who have addictions issues to become stable and self-sufficient while living with peers who help guide one another in recovery. The Oxford House is a welcomed addition to the community and will serve as a catalyst to assist those in recovery to get back on their feet and be able to lead a successful life in recovery,” said Jim Raley, Executive Director of Archway Station.Funding comes from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). ARC is a regional economic development agency that represents a partnership of federal, state, and local governments. Established by Congress in 1965, ARC is comprised of the governors of the 13 Appalachian states and a federal co-chair, who is appointed by the President. Local participation is provided through multi-county local development districts. This past December, the lawmakers helped secure a $5 million increase in funding for ARC, which will help boost the amount of federal funding available to support Western Maryland’s regional economies and improve residents’ lives. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-wicker-want-to-strengthen-key-federal-program-for-local-bike-and-pedestrian-options,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) have announced bipartisan legislation to extend the highly popular Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) that provides local governments authority over dedicated federal transportation funding for local active transportation priorities, including bikeways and sidewalks. The Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act (S. 614) uses federal funds for important local infrastructure projects that reduce traffic congestion, provide children with safe routes to school, and give communities more affordable transportation and stormwater management options.“’Safer outdoors’ means the local hiking and biking trails are more vital to local communities than ever,” said Senator Cardin, Chair of the Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. “I’m proud to partner with Senator Wicker to strengthen the Transportation Alternatives Program and further empower local leaders with the resources to enhance their neighborhoods, promote economic development and improve quality of life and public health.”“The coronavirus pandemic has encouraged Americans to spend more time outdoors walking and biking, and federal support for local bikeways and sidewalks should keep up,” Senator Wicker said. “I am glad to join Senator Cardin to introduce legislation that would give local governments more flexibility to bring these projects to their communities.”Supported by the League of American Bicyclists and Safe Routes Partnership, the Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act (S. 614):“The League of American Bicyclists applauds the leadership of Senators Cardin and Wicker in introducing the Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act. This program reaches into the very hearts of communities to build better places for people to bike and walk. This bill will help the small amount of transportation funding that goes to biking and walking projects have a bigger impact for local governments and local priorities,” said Bill Nesper, Executive Director of the League of American Bicyclists. “Throughout the COVID pandemic, we’ve seen so many Americans bicycling and walking, and this bill will give local leaders the opportunity to improve the safety and accessibility of biking and walking for people in their communities.”“As a national organization dedicated to advancing safe walking and rolling to and from schools and in everyday life, improving the health and well-being of people of all races, income levels, and abilities, and building healthy, thriving communities for everyone, the Safe Routes Partnership is grateful to Senator Ben Cardin and Senator Roger Wicker for their ongoing leadership in reintroducing the Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act, which would expand, strengthen, and make the Transportation Alternatives Program more accessible to communities across the country,” said Cass Isidro, Executive Director of the Safe Routes Partnership. “Communities of all sizes rely on Transportation Alternatives Program as the key source of funding to create safe, connected routes to school, retail, parks, jobs, and health care.” The Transportation Alternative Program has funded a variety of projects across Maryland that enhance safety and connect communities. From bringing Baltimore’s bus stations into ADA compliance, to enhancing recreation opportunities in Cambridge, to providing safe active transportation routes in Frederick, and making Complete Streets vision for Chamber Avenue in Capitol Heights a reality, TAP dollars have helped diverse communities across the state expand their transportation options.In 2012, Cardin and former Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) authored an amendment to the MAP-21 (Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century) that consolidated three U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) surface transportation programs (Safe Routes to School, Transportation Enhancements, and Recreational Trails) into the new Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). Under TAP, local communities can apply for funds for a variety of local transportation needs, including bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, Safe Routes to School initiatives, community improvement activities, recreational trails and more.The 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which converted the TAP program into a set-aside in the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, mandated state reporting on their transportation alternatives plans. The first report year was 2016. On average, there was insufficient funding for more than half of the priority projects nationwide at a potential cost of nearly $3.5 trillion.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

As the lead author and ardent defender of the Global Magnitsky Act, I am pleased to see the Biden administration revoke the license granted to the billionaire and his companies. If this egregious permit had been allowed to continue, it would have risked enabling corruption and setting back the integrity and legitimacy of the Global Magnitsky program.“If well-connected international billionaires like Gertler think there is a chance they can get away with their corrupt actions, then they will not be deterred. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act has become one of the most effective tools available to the U.S. government against foreign officials who have been credibly accused of corrupt practices or human rights abuses. Mr. Gertler’s case reinforces the need for the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Reauthorization Act (S. 93), which I recently introduced with my Republican colleague Senator Wicker to send a clear signal of our national commitment to defending democratic values and the international rules and standards.” ### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-collins-trone-mcmorris-to-introduce-bill-to-promote-girls-leadership-and-political-participation-around-the-world,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON — On International Women’s Day, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced that they will introduce the Girls Leadership, Engagement, and Advocacy in Development (LEAD) Act, legislation to promote girls’ leadership and participation in civic and political processes through U.S. foreign assistance.  Representatives David Trone (D-Md.-06) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.-05) introduced the companion legislation in the House.“By giving girls more opportunity to impact the decisions that affect their daily lives, communities can become more responsive and inclusive to all their citizens’ needs. Empowering girls will lead to a generation of empowered women who have the tools to make their families and their countries better,” said Senator Cardin. “On this International Women’s Day, I am proud to announce the Girls LEAD Act with Senator Collins.”“Despite comprising more than 50 percent of the world’s population, women are underrepresented at all levels of public sector decision-making,” said Senator Collins.  “The Girls LEAD Act would complement Congress’ efforts to combat this issue by specifically addressing the civic involvement and leadership of adolescent girls, an area where there is currently a gap in U.S. foreign assistance programing.”“When women are in leadership positions around the world, we are better for it. Over this past year, we have seen the immense contributions of women leaders who have taken swift, decisive action in the face of COVID-19 to protect communities in the face of an unprecedented crisis,” said Congressman Trone. “This bipartisan bill prioritizes investment in girls’ interaction with civic systems at an early age, creating a strong pipeline for girls to become leaders and decision-makers for years to come. I want to thank Representative McMorris Rodgers and Senators Cardin and Collins for partnering in this bipartisan, bicameral effort on International Women’s Day.”“When women engage, democracies are stronger, foreign aid is more effective, and the world is safer. A truly representative government relies on the voices of all its citizens, no matter their background or walk of life,” said Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers. “The bipartisan Girls LEAD Act highlights the importance of engaging girls in civics and public service. This will help build a stronger pipeline for young women to run for political office and encourage them to seek leadership positions in the private sector. With more women empowered, it will support a new generation of transformational leaders in democracies around the world.” The Girls LEAD Act has been endorsed by several organizations, including Save the Children and ChildFund.“We know that adolescent girls understand best what they need to live up to their full potential,” said Janti Soeripto, Save the Children President and CEO. “It’s imperative we listen to and empower girls so they can be a force for change within their own communities. The Girls LEAD Act is a critical step in recognizing girls as powerful drivers of progress, and ensuring their meaningful participation in democracy, human rights and civic engagement.”“Most of U.S. foreign assistance programming for girls focuses on ensuring their access to health, education and entrepreneurship opportunities but fails to educate them about their roles as citizens with unique strengths and wisdom to shape the systems and policies that affect them,” said Anne Lynam Goddard, President and CEO of ChildFund. “Until programs and funding aiming to bolster democracies and civic participation worldwide include girls, they will continue to fall short.”According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 132 million adolescent girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not enrolled in school.  School closures related to the COVID–19 pandemic have pushed nearly 743,000,000 more girls around the world out of school. It is vitally important that girls and young women in childhood are empowered and that we invest in their leadership potential early so that they can develop pathways to positions of political leadership and civic engagement.Current U.S. assistance for girls’ empowerment and leadership is largely based around health and education efforts; however, assistance does not directly address girls’ civic engagement and participation.  Additionally, current democracy and governance programs often lack a gender or age-lens.The Girls LEAD Act would:  The Girls LEAD Act complements the efforts of the Women, Peace, and Security Act, which was signed into law in October 2017, and the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment (WEEE) Act, which was signed into law in January 2019.  Senator Cardin co-authored the WEEE Act and Senator Collins was a cosponsor. Click HERE to read the text of the bill and HERE to read the one-pager. ###  Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Marylanders are hurting, and have been for more than a year now. The American Rescue Plan will invest more resources into vaccines, testing, contact tracing, public health, and related programs to contain COVID-19 and finally get control of and bring an end to this public health crisis. The economic and social devastation left by this pandemic will take longer to eradicate. This is where the American Rescue Plan makes strategic investments in lifting up the hardest hit American families and small businesses to help our communities recover from this once in a 100 years crisis. The bill is so comprehensive precisely because we are working to make our nation and our people whole again after a year like none other.“Emergencies like this are when government can best bring together the resources that will make a positive difference in people’s lives. Among its many provisions, the American Rescue Act provides $1,400 per person in economic relief payments to millions of low- and moderate-income households. It extends a lifeline for those whom the pandemic has left jobless, without health insurance, food insecure, behind on utility bills, rent and mortgage payments, and struggling to make ends meet. This just-passed legislation provides desperately needed resources to state and local governments and our courageous front-line workers who have been working around-the-clock and often place themselves at great personal risk to keep our communities safe over the last year. For our families and students, we deliver the resources needed for adequate childcare and we tackle the infrastructure repairs and upgrades needed to reopen schools safely and supplement online learning programs. The increase to the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000 will lift families out of poverty and give them a fighting chance to recover from this pandemic.“The American Rescue Plan provides billions to address pandemic-related disruptions throughout the food supply chain, including seafood; support small meat and poultry processors; protect food and farm workers; and increase food donations. It will help shuttered businesses, restaurants, bars and nonprofits survive the worst of COVID-19’s economic impact and get back to doing what they do best.“The COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet, but the American Rescue Plan brings concrete relief to this nation at a time we need it most.” Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

The reported human rights abuses are gravely concerning and cannot go overlooked – it’s critical that all parties cease violence and commit to respecting and protecting the safety of civilians. It’s urgent that those in Ethiopia come to the table at once to address these matters in a peaceful way,” said Van Hollen.“Ethiopia is a vital U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa and broader region, and Prime Minister Abiy has worked to advance democratic and economic reforms since 2018,” said Risch. “The situation in Tigray is deeply concerning due to the significant human suffering it has caused, but also because it poses the most significant threat to Ethiopia’s fragile transition to democracy to date and has serious implications for the security and stability of the broader region.”“I am proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues in calling for an end to the fighting in Tigray, an improvement in the humanitarian situation, and an investigation into atrocities,” said Coons. “I hope the Ethiopian government will work with the United States to address these concerns and facilitate the swift distribution of lifesaving assistance to all who need it.”Full text of the resolution can be found hereRead MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-Va.) today urged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to quickly make available the maximum number of Congressionally-authorized H-2B visas in order to ensure that seafood processors in Maryland and Virginia have the seasonal workforce they need ahead of the seasonal start date on April 1.“In the rural and remote coastal regions in our states, even in a time of high unemployment, seafood processors have struggled to find domestic workers,” wrote the Senators in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. “Seafood processors are designated as part of the ‘essential, critical infrastructure’ during the pandemic and yet many have been unable to operate at full capacity due to lack of workers. Disruptions to the food supply chain will harm American consumers, the seafood industry, and the U.S. economy. Withholding H-2B visas for seasonal seafood processors will only exacerbate this matter.”“On February 24, 2021, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it had received enough petitions to meet the H-2B cap for the second half of FY 2021,” they continued. “Unfortunately, many small, family-owned businesses in our states were unable to obtain H-2B visas before the cap was met last week. Without these additional visas, our states’ treasured seafood industries, which are crucial to the economies of the Northern Neck and Eastern Shore, will be forced to scale back operations, default on contracts, lay off full-time American workers or, in some cases, close operations completely.”The H-2B Temporary Non-Agricultural Visa Program allows U.S. employers to hire seasonal, non-immigrant workers during peak seasons to supplement the existing American workforce. In order to be eligible for the program, employers are required to declare that there are not enough U.S. workers available to do the temporary work, as is the case with the seafood industry, which relies on H-2B workers for tough jobs such as shucking oysters and processing crabs. In their letter, the Senators also raised concern with reports that USCIS decided to use ‘receipt by’ instead of ‘mailed by’ dates to reject otherwise timely applications for nonimmigrant workers. Noting mail delays due to inclement weather on the East Coast, they asked the DHS Secretary to reconsider this decision and allow these applications to proceed.Senators Cardin, Van Hollen, Warner and Kaine have long advocated for the seafood processing industry – a community largely made up of rural, family-owned operations. Last year, the Senators urged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to release additional H-2B visas needed to support local seafood businesses in Maryland and states like Alaska, Virginia and North Carolina. A copy of the letter is available here and below.The Honorable Alejandro MayorkasSecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland Security                                             Washington, DC 20528 Dear Secretary Mayorkas:We are writing on behalf of Virginia and Maryland seafood processors who depend on H-2B temporary, seasonal workers to operate their businesses.  In the rural and remote coastal regions in our states, even in a time of high unemployment, seafood processors have struggled to find domestic workers.  Seafood processors are designated as part of the “essential, critical infrastructure” during the pandemic and yet many have been unable to operate at full capacity due to lack of workers. Disruptions to the food supply chain will harm American consumers, the seafood industry, and the U.S. economy. Withholding H-2B visas for seasonal seafood processors will only exacerbate this matter. The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with the authority to lift the existing statutory cap of 66,000 annual H-2B visas.  We urge DHS to promptly make available the maximum number of additional Congressionally-authorized H-2B visas while balancing safety to meet the labor needs of seafood processors in our states.On February 24, 2021, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it had received enough petitions to meet the H-2B cap for the second half of FY 2021.  February 12, 2021 was the final receipt date for new cap-subject H-2B worker petitions requesting an employment start date before October 1, 2021. Unfortunately, many small, family-owned businesses in our states were unable to obtain H-2B visas before the cap was met last week.  Without these additional visas, our states’ treasured seafood industries, which are crucial to the economies of the Northern Neck and Eastern Shore, will be forced to scale back operations, default on contracts, lay off full-time American workers or, in some cases, close operations completely. Despite good faith efforts to find local seasonal workers, our seafood industries rely on H-2B workers for tough jobs such as shucking oysters and processing crabs.  Seafood processors have used the seasonal H-2B visa program to supplement their U.S. workforce for decades and have not grown significantly in the numerical requests for visas over time. The April 1 seasonal start date is just weeks away and the seafood processors in our will not be able to operate without their seasonal workforce.Additionally, we have also received reports that USCIS has decided to use ‘receipt by’  instead of ‘mailed by’ dates to reject otherwise timely applications. A number of our constituents mailed their applications before the deadline but due to inclement weather on the East Coast their applications were delivered after the cap was met. For example, USCIS Forms I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Workers overnighted on February 11, 2021 were not delivered until several days later due to winter storms. Among the employers affected are several seafood companies on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and the Northern Neck of Virginia. Employers elsewhere in the country using the same shipping methods had their applications receipted before the cap simply due to their geographic location. We ask that you reconsider these decisions and allow these applications to proceed.We thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter; the viability of many seasonal businesses in our states depend on the H-2B program.Sincerely,###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-legislation-finally-would-prohibit-racial-and-religious-profiling-by-all-levels-of-law-enforcement,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) Thursday introduced the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2021 (ERRPA) that would ban discriminatory profiling by federal, state and local law enforcement nationwide. ERRPA (S. 597) is designed to promote best practices in community-based law enforcement to strengthen enforcement of the right to equal protection under the law, which is one of our most basic constitutional principles.“The End Racial and Religious Profiling Act takes an important step toward reforming our broken criminal justice system and dismantling the pervasive legacy of racial and religious profiling in our law enforcement system,” said Senator Cardin. “Discriminatory profiling wastes limited law enforcement resources and breeds distrust within communities. It unfairly targets individuals simply because of their race, religion, skin color, or country of origin, relying on harmful stereotypes and bias. This is wrong; it’s ineffective and, as we’ve seen far too often, it can be deadly. We have long needed a national standard prohibiting this dangerous practice and promoting uniform enforcement of equal justice for all.”ERRPA is included as a key component of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House Wednesday and previously was approved in the 116th Congress.Joining Senator Cardin as cosponsors of ERRPA for the 117th Congress are Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).“I thank our cosponsors and the supporting organizations who have been on the forefront of upholding the rule of law across our nation,” added Senator Cardin, who serves as the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly.“The NAACP is grateful and proud to endorse and work for the passage of the ‘End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2021’ and strongly thank Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland and the other U.S. Senators who have already co-sponsored this crucial legislation for their courage and vision,” said Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau. “Racial, ethnic and religious profiling of Americans by law enforcement officials is a serious, painful, and dangerous problem in the United States, and as we see too often it can result in deadly consequences. This discriminatory practice consistently and severely undercuts the very trust and integrity in our law enforce community necessary to effectively engage community members as we work to coordinate the prevention and solving of crimes. The End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2021 comprehensively addresses the insidious practice of biased treatment by law enforcement because of who you are, which God you worship, or who you are perceived to be.”“Not only is profiling a fundamentally un-American policing tactic, it erodes community trust and is an ineffective law enforcement method. If stereotyping is allowed to be a substitute for legitimate criminal investigations, law enforcement’s time and resources are diverted away from actual threats,” said Jennifer Bellamy, ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel.“The past year has further revealed the extent to which law enforcement rely on racial profiling to do their work — from the murder of Breonna Taylor by Louisville Police, to the FBI’s unethical and intrusive surveillance of Muslims using the MuslimPro app. Law enforcement agencies repeatedly show that they are capable of and willing to abuse legal loopholes to target Black and racialized Muslim communities. The End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2021 (ERRPA) closes these loopholes and ensures that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from employing racist, xenophobic, or otherwise bigoted stereotypes to systemically oppress and marginalize people of color. We must put an end to all forms of profiling through the passage of ERRPA,” said Simran Noor, Board Chair at South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT).The full text of ERRPA (S. 597) can be downloaded here.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/senators-introduce-no-check-no-sale-bill-to-close-the-charleston-loophole,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON– Today, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) introduced legislation with twenty-four of their Senate colleagues to close a current loophole that allows gun sales to proceed if a background check is not completed after 72 hours, even if the gun buyer is not legally allowed to purchase a gun. The gap in existing law has allowed thousands of gun sales to prohibited buyers, including the sale of the firearm used by the shooter in the deadly attack at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church.“If there is no background check, there should be no sale of a firearm. The goal is simple: keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t be able to buy them,” said Senator Cardin. “Let’s finally do what the American people support and require federal background checks for all gun sales before more lives are lost.”“Gun violence has plagued too many families across Maryland and the country. Closing the Charleston loophole – which allows a gun sale to proceed even when a background check has not been completed – will save lives and keep weapons out of dangerous hands. I will keep fighting to enact meaningful gun reform to tackle this crisis and stop senseless violence. This legislation is an important step forward in getting this done,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Closing this glaring loophole six years ago would have stopped the Charleston shooter from walking out of a store with a gun he was already legally ineligible to buy,” Blumenthal said. “This arbitrary time limit has allowed thousands of dangerous people – people prohibited under current law from possessing a firearm – to buy a gun. If you haven’t passed a background check, you shouldn’t be able to purchase a weapon. No check, no gun. It’s really that simple.”“Six years ago, a glaring loophole in our background checks system allowed a white supremacist to walk into a church in Charleston and murder nine Black congregants. It’s outrageous that a criminal could be able to buy a gun because his background check took longer than three days to process,” said Murphy. “And let’s be clear: this is not an isolated incident. Tens of thousands of dangerous individuals have gotten their hands on weapons because of the ‘Charleston loophole.’ We must act. We must pass the Background Check Completion Act.”“An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that background checks should be required for all gun sales,” Durbin said. “We have seen the tragic consequences that can result when background checks are not completed and guns end up in the hands of prohibited purchasers.  It is long past time to fix this loophole, and I’m proud to support this bill to do so.”“A background check should be completed before every gun sale, but that isn’t happening today,” Feinstein said. “The increased number of gun sales during the pandemic has put an even greater strain on an already overloaded background check system. Our commonsense bill would provide law enforcement enough time to complete a background check and ensure that people who shouldn’t have guns aren’t able to buy them.”When a criminal background check indicates that a firearm purchaser may have a criminal record, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tries to determine whether the purchaser can legally buy a gun. If this process takes longer than 72 hours, gun dealers can complete the sale even though there is a heightened risk that the purchaser is legally disqualified from purchasing a gun.The Background Check Completion Act would require a completed background check for every gun buyer who purchases a gun from a federally-licensed gun dealer. The full text of the legislation is available here.The Background Check Completion Act is also co-sponsored by Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The legislation has been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety, Giffords, Brady, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Sandy Hook Promise and Newtown Action Alliance.“Closing all loopholes in the federal background check process is critical to keeping our communities safe. Everyone needs to fully complete a background check before they can purchase a firearm. It’s as simple as that,” said Mark Barden, co-founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise and father of Daniel, who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. “After eight long years, we are grateful to finally see momentum on this common-sense gun reform.”“No one should be able to purchase deadly weapons without a completed background check,” said Po Murray, Chairwoman of Newtown Action Alliance. “We need Congress to act to keep guns away from dangerous individuals by closing all loopholes in our background check system. Incidents of armed intimidation are rising in our communities and domestic terrorists are the greatest threat to our nation. According to the FBI, the Charleston loophole allowed 2989 individuals to purchase guns without completed background checks in 2019.

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-menendez-rubio-kaine-and-cassidy-introduce-idb-general-capital-increase-act,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) alongside Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ranking Member and Chairman of the SFRC Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, as well as Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in reintroducing legislation authorizing the tenth general capital increase for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the hemisphere’s leading international financial institution. At a moment when countries in the region have suffered from the widespread economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and devastating hurricanes, the bill highlights that the U.S. Congress is leading efforts to prioritize and secure an IDB capital increase.The legislation would increase the IDB’s annual lending to $20 billion and strengthen its ability to lead financial recovery efforts across Latin America and the Caribbean. As part of the capital increase, the bill encourages the creation of the IDB’s first environmental fund and lending facility — a groundbreaking initiative that would position the Bank to expand efforts to improve environmental sustainability and disaster preparedness in the hemisphere. “We know the Inter-American Development Bank is vital to the financial future of our Hemisphere,” said Senator Cardin. “With the unprecedented economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. support for this capital increase is more important than ever. I am proud to support this capital increase and the creation of a new IDB environmental fund. This fund would be instrumental for ensuring that economic recovery in Latin America is sustainable and responsive to the challenges countries face from climate change.”“As we continue looking for ways to step up our efforts to address global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this important legislation renews the United States’ commitment to the region’s leading multilateral development bank and to deepening economic relations with our hemispheric partners,” Senator Menendez said. “I’m glad to be joined by so many of my colleagues to ensure the IDB has the resources it needs to support our partners in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly after the hemisphere’s economic outlook was severely battered by COVID-19 and a devastating hurricane season. This bill would also ensure that the IDB is better prepared to address the growing challenges of climate change in the Americas by calling for the establishment of its first-ever environmental fund.”“I’m proud to join Senator Menendez in reintroducing this important bill at a time when American leadership in our hemisphere is needed more than ever,” Senator Rubio said. “By supporting the Inter-American Development Bank’s capital increase, we are reaffirming our support of the organization and its financial initiatives. As we continue to confront this global pandemic, we must continue doing all we can to counter China’s predatory behavior in our hemisphere.”“This bill is a critical step in providing the economic help Latin America and the Caribbean urgently need,” Senator Kaine said. “With 8% of the world’s population and 30% of its COVID-19 deaths, the region is experiencing one of its worst economic contractions on record: millions have lost jobs or fallen into poverty, and per capita income in 2025 is expected to be less than in 2015. I hope that other IDB member countries will join the United States in increasing their commitments and that ultimately we will be able to aggressively help struggling people in the region.”“We’ve got to tackle illegal migration, corruption and organized crime. One way to do that is the IDB and a stronger relationship between the U.S. and Latin America,” said Dr. Cassidy.The legislation includes the following provisions:The full text of the Inter-American Development Bank General Capital Increase Act can be found HERE and a section-by-section description of the legislation can be found HERE.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

I am committed to removing the barriers to affordable health care and securing supplementary funding to bolster our Community Health Centers, particularly with their growing prominence in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.” “This new federal funding will help support frontline health workers in Western Maryland as they continue to fight COVID-19 and provide affordable, high-quality health care to residents. Community Health Centers, like the Tri-State Community Health Center, are critical partners in our efforts to beat this virus and keep Marylanders healthy. I will keep fighting for funding to strengthen accessible health care throughout the region and our state,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Western Marylanders depend on the Tri-State Community Health Center, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must provide the Center with the resources it needs to continue to serve our community,” said Congressman Trone. “This funding will help keep people safe, fight COVID, and make high-quality, affordable health care accessible to Western Marylanders.”Funding is provided through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The new award will increase Tri-State Community Health Center’s capabilities and keep frontline workers safe through staff training, purchasing additional personal protective equipment and ramping up COVID-19 testing. Last year, Tri-State Community Health Center received more than $1.2 million in federal funding to strengthen Maryland’s COVID-19 response, such as increased testing capacity at Community Health Centers. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-van-hollen-murphy-senators-reintroduce-legislation-to-require-universal-background-checks-to-reduce-gun-violence,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen (both D-Md.) joined Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and a number of their Senate colleagues in reintroducing the Background Check Expansion Act to expand federal background checks to all gun sales. Under current federal law, unlicensed or private sellers are not required to conduct a background check prior to transferring a firearm. Research indicates that, due to these exceptions, as many as a quarter of all gun sales in the United States may occur without a background check. Additionally, polling shows that 97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. U.S. Representative Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) introduced the companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.“If there is no background check, there should be no sale of a firearm. The goal is simple: keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t be able to buy them,” said Senator Cardin. “Let’s finally do what the American people support and require federal background checks for all gun sales before more lives are lost.”“Gun violence has plagued too many families in Maryland and across the country. Universal background checks will save lives. Our bill is a common-sense, effective way to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. It’s time to get it done. I’ll keep fighting to pass this bill and enact meaningful gun reform to tackle this crisis and stop the violence that is plaguing our communities,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Background checks are simple, easy, and they save lives. That’s why more than 90 percent of Americans support our legislation to make sure no guns are sold in this country without a background check,” said Senator Murphy. “Joe Biden and hundreds of congressional candidates from both parties ran on the issue of background checks. This is the year to get this bill passed into law. And this legislation has the chance to bring this country together – even 85 percent of gun owners believe in expanding background checks, and a growing anti-gun violence movement, made up of both Democrats and Republicans, is demanding change. I look forward to working across the aisle to get background checks legislation across the finish line.”“The last two years have been a turning point in our longstanding fight to help prevent gun violence and today we take another leap forward in helping to save lives. Joined by Democrats and Republicans, today we introduce the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 to help keep guns out of the hands of those who may be a danger to themselves or others,” said Representative Thompson, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Time and time again, we have seen that the American people want universal background checks, in fact public polling shows that the majority of people, Democrats, Republicans and Independents, support this. We began our work to combat the scourge of gun violence eight years ago after the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School and will not stop until we deliver for the American people.”The Background Checks Expansion Act will require background checks for the sale or transfer of all firearms. This requirement extends to all unlicensed sellers, whether they do business online, at gun shows, or out of their home. Exceptions to the Background Check Expansion Act include transfers between law enforcement officers, temporarily loaning firearms for hunting and sporting events, providing firearms as gifts to immediate family members, transferring a firearm as part of an inheritance, or temporarily transferring a firearm for immediate self-defense. In addition to Senators Cardin, Van Hollen, and Murphy, this legislation is also co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.) co-sponsored the bill.Full text of the bill can be found here.###  Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Alcee L. Hastings (FL-20) and  Joe Wilson (SC-02) issued the following statements:“Only in a free Russia can justice truly be served. Sanctioning perpetrators of the crimes against Mr. Navalny is a necessary first step,” said Sen. Cardin. “We must make it clear that the United States and our allies will not tolerate attempts by the Kremlin to silence its critics—whether through assassination, imprisonment, or harassment.”“The Kremlin’s attacks on Mr. Navalny are meant to serve as a warning to any Russian who dares to defy Putin,” said Sen. Wicker. “The United States will not tolerate such threats against the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Russian people without imposing serious consequences to deter Putin and his criminal regime.”“Our actions signal that we continue to stand with the Russian people,” said Rep. Hastings. “The United States will always defend those like Mr. Navalny who battle against the oppression of their fellow citizens, fight for basic freedoms, and offer a path to democracy.”“The Kremlin will insist that sanctions are anti-Russian. On the contrary, there is nothing more anti-Russian than authorities who cheat, harm, and steal from their fellow citizens,” said Rep. Wilson. “These sanctions provide a concrete check on the bad acts of Putin’s flunkies.”In August 2020, Alexei Navalny was the victim of an assassination attempt by the Russian FSB that used a Russia-developed chemical weapon in the Novichok family. He spent months recovering after being flown to Berlin for treatment.Navalny returned to Moscow on January 17, 2021, and immediately was arrested. On February 2, a Russian judge sentenced Navalny to three and a half years in a prison colony for violating the terms of a suspended sentence related to a 2014 case that the European Court of Human Rights deemed arbitrary and unreasonable.Previous time served under house arrest reduced his prison time to two years and eight months. Navalny is likely to serve the remainder of his sentence at one of Russia’s most notorious penal colonies in the Vladimir region, about three hours east of Moscow.###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-boozman-spotlight-global-crisis-in-education-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.) today introduced updated legislation that would help identify the scope of one of the most significant secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: education loss. The global health crisis has disrupted the education of an estimated 90 percent of students world-wide, meaning that 1.6 billion youth have been negatively affected. The implications are especially dire for up to 24 million students at risk of dropping out of school permanently due to rising levels of child poverty associated with the pandemic.   “Education loss due to the pandemic is going to reverberate throughout the globe long after COVID-19 is contained, and its impact will be more than empty classrooms. Education loss has the potential to fuel hunger, poverty, and violence. It also undermines equality, especially for girls and young women, as well as stability all over the world. We have a responsibility to mitigate this crisis before an entire generation is left behind,” said Senator Cardin, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.“Understanding the impact COVID-19 has on the education of children around the world is important to our long-term investment in international education programs. Having detailed information about these evolving challenges will help us innovate the delivery of academic opportunities so students can continue to receive a quality education when faced with unexpected circumstances. I appreciate Senator Cardin’s leadership to ensure no student is left behind,” said Senator Boozman.Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.-06), Mike Quigley (D-Ill.-05) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.-01) have introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. “We cannot overstate the profound impact COVID-19 is having on education across the world,” said Representative Houlahan. “This education gap has the potential to hinder global efforts on economic justice, lasting peace, poverty eradication, ending world hunger, gender equity and more. As a steadfast advocate for women and girls around the world, I’m particularly concerned about the harrowing consequences school-aged girls face in light of school closures – including an increased likelihood of gender-based violence. I am glad to be leading a bicameral effort with colleagues from across the aisle to ensure we in the United States are doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of such an education gap and stand up for the world’s youth.”“The coronavirus pandemic has affected every corner of US government, including foreign aid and development. USAID’s mission is vital to America’s international relationship building. Congress needs a thorough understanding of how the pandemic has impacted that mission if we hope to continue our global basic education  programs successfully in the future,” said Representatives Quigley and Fitzpatrick. “USAID providing Congress with a report is the first step to developing that understanding and supporting USAID effectively moving forward.”Serious educational gaps that existed before COVID-19 are being exacerbated as schools have been forced by the pandemic to transition to remote learning or close completely. Children and youth who were already vulnerable, including girls and young women, refugees, and those with disabilities, are likely to be the worst impacted by this loss of access to education. This bill notes the major economic and humanitarian implications of the learning loss, as well as the significant shortage of global financing for international education programs that is predicted. It highlights the need for the United States to promote inclusive learning opportunities, help strengthen education systems, and support the return of children to school across the globe.If enacted, the bill requires the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to submit a report within 180 days to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the impact of COVID-19 on global learning and basic education programs. It requires the report to be made publicly available and to include:The Global Learning Loss Assessment Act can be downloaded here. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-reed-outline-plan-to-get-overdue-targeted-covid-19-relief-to-small-businesses-and-critical-community-services,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – The COVID-19 pandemic and economic disruption continues to wreak havoc on families, businesses, health systems, and our economy. Americans are still reeling from the Trump Administration’s botched COVID-19 response, which left the nation with hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, over 10 million Americans out of work, and put nearly 100,000 small businesses permanently out of businesses.U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship Chair Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and a key proponent of the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund in the CARES Act, were joined on a press call today by Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien and Small Business Majority Founder & CEO John Arensmeyer to discuss the urgent need for COVID-19 relief for small businesses and states, localities, and Tribal nations, and U.S. Territories responsible for essential community services.“The American Rescue Plan is a bold solution to get Americans vaccinated and support small businesses through the remainder of the pandemic,” Senator Cardin said. “This bill will provide overdue relief to the hardest hit small businesses, including restaurants and Black-and Latino-owned small businesses. We must pass this overdue relief as quickly as possible to put our nation on the road to recovery.”“Congressional Republicans have made a calculated decision to oppose the American Rescue Plan in lock step.  But that won’t stop Democrats from delivering much-needed, long-overdue targeted assistance to the American people.  And even though Republicans inside the Beltway oppose the plan, it has broad bipartisan support from people across the country, and from Red state Governors and nearly three dozen independent and Republican Mayors who all recognize the need to surge vaccines, save lives and jobs, and strengthen our economy.  I hope Republicans will join us, but President Biden and the Democratic majority are determined to do our part to deliver the relief Americans desperately need and voted for,” said Senator Reed.“I thank Senator Ben Cardin and Senator Jack Reed for continuing to fight for our diverse residents and small businesses. Pawtucket truly appreciates the hard work of both Senators to provide necessary relief for the families, businesses, and communities who have experienced a negative economic impact as a direct result of the pandemic,” said Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien.“Without additional funding, 3 in 10 small businesses report they will not survive the next few months. This is why small businesses need the U.S. Senate to immediately pass the American Rescue Plan and send it to President Biden’s desk for his signature,” said John Arensmeyer, Founder & CEO of Small Business Majority. “The plan includes several critical provisions, including funds for grants, loans and business assistance to help small businesses in under-resourced and underbanked communities. Small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open can’t afford to wait for additional relief, and we need policymakers on both sides of the aisle to act on this now.”This week the U.S. Senate is taking up a comprehensive package of legislation that includes help for struggling small businesses, states, and communities. The American Rescue Plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks to individuals, an extension of unemployment insurance, and tens of billions in aid for small businesses and not-for-profits, as well as $350 billion for state, local, and Tribal governments, many of which have experienced increased costs and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic.The Democratic Policy & Communications Committee released 8 reports on the American Rescue Plan.

And states and local governments are in dire need of federal assistance to meet the unprecedented costs necessary to address this immediate crisis, limit long-term harm caused by the pandemic, and address longstanding inequities exacerbated by COVID-19.The American Rescue Plan will address the ongoing needs of small businesses in the hardest-hit communities and business sectors by providing:Additionally, the American Rescue Plan will provide a $350 billion state and local aid package to help states and local governments of all sizes deal with urgent needs and lagging, negative economic impacts of COVID-19, including:Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-blunt-urge-permanent-reauthorization-for-tax-credit-that-has-promoted-growth-in-underserved-communities,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) today introduced a measure to permanently extend the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC), which has created jobs and driven investment in neighborhoods with high poverty and unemployment rates. The New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act (S.456) will permanently authorize a 39 percent federal tax credit for businesses or economic development projects in areas with poverty rates of at least 20 percent, or median incomes at or below 80 percent of the area median. “In Maryland and across the country, the New Markets Tax Credit has demonstrated its strength in encouraging a diverse range of infrastructure and community development efforts in low-income and minority neighborhoods,” said Senator Cardin, a member of the Senate Finance Committee. “I thank Senator Blunt and our cosponsors for ongoing support for this tax credit that will continue to create jobs and stimulate our economy in communities nationwide.”“The New Markets Tax Credit program has a proven record of creating jobs, boosting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life in underserved areas,” said Senator Blunt. “From grocery stores and manufacturing facilities to affordable housing and social services, the NMTC program has supported more than 400 Missouri businesses and economic revitalization projects. Together, these projects have improved communities and expanded opportunities in areas where they’re needed most. This is a program that we know works and should be made permanent. I urge all of our colleagues to join us in this effort.”In addition to making the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program permanent at a $5 billion annual allocation level, the legislation indexes future allocations to inflation and exempts NMTC investments from the Alternative Minimum Tax.Blunt and Cardin introduced similar legislation in the previous Congress. The NMTC was originally authorized in 2000 as part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act. In 2020, under the leadership of Cardin and Blunt, the program was extended for five years at a $5 billion annual allocation level.The New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Maria Cantwell (Wash.) and Tim Scott (S.C.).Following are a few examples of Maryland projects that have benefited from the NMTC: Helping Up Mission’s House of Freedom – This new 131,000 square foot, 7-story facility in Baltimore supports women and their children who are experiencing poverty, homelessness. It also includes a residential substance abuse program, emergency shelter, mental health services, counseling and a workforce development and education center. The project is estimated to create 150 construction jobs, 42 permanent jobs and will include 260 beds.Remington Row – In the neighborhood of Remington, the Remington Row project includes a new health clinic, retail, 108 apartments priced at below-market rates, an open market and will include ten small kitchens for Baltimore chefs and entrepreneurial food vendors, the redevelopment of 30 abandoned row homes for sale to teachers, police officers and first responders; and the redevelopment of an old tire shop into a restaurant, theater and office space – all made possible by the New Markets Tax Credit. The project created 200 construction and 265 permanent jobs in a severely distressed neighborhood.East Baltimore Revitalization – In East Baltimore, the NMTC program helped attract nearly $2 billion dollars of private sector financing toward the redevelopment of 88 acres of former industrial land into new and rehabilitated affordable and mixed-income housing, the first new school built in Baltimore in 30 years, a life sciences and technology park, modern manufacturing space, retail space, and more than 8,000 new jobs.Following are a few examples of Missouri projects that have benefited from the NMTC:Ferguson Empowerment Center: A multi-nonprofit community empowerment center was built on the site of the QuikTrip that was vandalized during the Ferguson unrest. The center provides job training and placement, financial literacy, and other empowerment programs for residents.Marquette Tower: The newly restored Marquette Tower in Cape Girardeau, Mo., is the epicenter of the Marquette Tech District, bringing jobs and tech industry growth to Cape Girardeau. Anchored by an expansion of Codefi, the historic building offers offices, suites, and coworking spaces to technology-based and innovative companies, and organizations that support them.Guardian Angel Settlement Association: NMTC financing supported the development of a new social services center in St. Louis. The 18,000 square foot facility serves thousands of individuals each year.  ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-stabenow-seek-to-close-important-gaps-in-kids-dental-care,"Press ReleaseOn anniversary of Deamonte Driver’s death, senators introduce measure to eliminate annual and lifetime limits on dental coverage under Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Bill also requires and strengthens wrap-around coverage from CHIP for more childrenWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) today introduced new legislation that would significantly expand the dental insurance coverage available to vulnerable children nationwide through the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which currently provides health coverage to 9.6 million, through both Medicaid and separate programs.The “Ensuring Kids Have Access to Medically Necessary Dental Care Act” would eliminate the limits on coverage, both annual and lifetime, provided under CHIP, a federal-state partnership administered by states, according to federal requirements. The new bill, S. 448, also would require that CHIP wraparound dental coverage be the same as dental coverage for CHIP enrollees. And instead of simply allowing states to provide dental-only coverage to kids who would be eligible for CHIP, but for the fact that they are covered under a group health plan or employer-sponsored insurance, the new legislation requires it.The senators are introducing the new legislation on the anniversary of the death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George’s County resident, whose tragic passing was entirely avoidable. What started out as a toothache turned into an abscess and then severe brain infection that an $80 extraction could have prevented. After multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, Deamonte tragically passed away 14 years ago today, illustrating the importance of National Children’s Dental Health Month, which we mark each February.“Making sure kids have proper dental care is one of the most fundamentally important things we can do, yet too many children continue to fall through the cracks in our country. This new bill makes sure our safety net for pediatric dental health is both stronger and wider,” said Senator Cardin, a senior member of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care. “Time is of the essence when we’re talking about ensuring that kids have access to good dental care, as quality care during childhood can have life-long implications. The changes advanced in our new legislation provide targeted improvements to known shortcomings in our system, and we must address them immediately.”  “Children need good dental care to grow up healthy and happy. But right now, that care is still out of reach for many families. Senator Cardin and I partnered together to make it easier for kids to get the care they need by improving dental coverage under the Children’s Health Insurance Program,” said Senator Stabenow.More information on CHIP is available here.  ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-menendez-lead-efforts-to-increase-covid-19-vaccination-rates-in-underserved-and-minority-communities-,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) continue to drive a concerted effort in Congress to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and improve vaccination rates in underserved and minority communities. In Maryland, New Jersey and across the country, there are sharp racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID-19 vaccination, due to a number of confounding factors such as fear, language barriers, limited transit, and lack of health services.“Communities of color have disproportionately borne the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Maryland and nationwide,” said Sen Cardin. “Given that these at-risk communities faced barriers in accessing care before the pandemic and such problems have been greatly exacerbated, our communications must be culturally tailored and from trusted messengers. I am proud to reintroduce this legislation to promote equitable vaccine administration that will be essential for protecting our communities of color, while also calling on the White House to collect critical demographic data to ensure the success of the vaccination effort nationwide.” “The pandemic has only magnified the racial and ethnic health disparities that have existed in this country for far too long,” said Sen. Menendez. “The fact remains that fewer people in underserved and minority communities are getting vaccinated, compared to other communities, even though they are more likely to be infected or die from COVID-19. We can and must do better. That is why I have consistently advocated for an equitable, nationwide COVID-19 response and vaccine distribution that leaves no one behind, and won’t stop fighting to ensure that those most affected by this crisis have access to the resources they need to safeguard their and their family’s well-being.” Sens. Cardin and Menendez today reintroduced the updated COVID-19 Health Disparities Action Act that would support targeted and culturally competent public awareness campaigns about COVID-19 vaccines and preventative measures such as masking and social distancing. These campaigns would specifically target communities disproportionately harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including racial and ethnic minority populations.The bill is supported by the National Alliance against Disparities in Patient Health (NADPH), the Friends of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), the National Council of Urban Indian Health, and the National Hispanic Medical Association. The bill is cosponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).Health officials are recording disproportionate hospitalizations and deaths and observing lower than average vaccination rates in communities of color.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 16% of Marylanders who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose are African American and 4% are Hispanic, despite these populations comprising 30% and 11% of the state’s total population, respectively.Sens. Cardin and Menendez also sent a letter today with eight Senate colleagues urging the Biden Administration to include demographic data on race and ethnicity for those getting vaccinated on its national vaccine dashboard. The letter was cosigned by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).“It is critical that our federal database tracks nationwide distributions of vaccines to states, territories, and tribes, and collects robust demographic information to ensure at-risk communities are being vaccinated appropriately,” the Senators wrote to White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients, Acting Health and Humans Services (HHS) Secretary Norris Cochran and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky. “Comprehensive vaccine data is crucial for helping public health officials evaluate how to efficiently and equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines across the United States.  It is also a crucial tool to aid public health officials in identifying the barriers minority communities face in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and determine where vaccine hesitancy may persist.”While almost all states report vaccination data to the CDC, only 32 states include demographic data specifying race and ethnicity. Just a few of weeks ago, the Washington Post reported there are significant gaps in reported data because race and ethnicity data was missing for nearly half of all vaccine recipients in the early days of vaccine distribution.Since the pandemic started, Sens. Cardin and Menendez have been calling for greater equity in the country’s nationwide COVID-19 response.  In April 2020, Sens. Cardin and Menendez, alongside many of their colleagues in the Senate, called on Big Pharma to prioritize diversity in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, underscoring the critical need for comprehensive demographic and racial data to ensure new treatments for all Americans.  In July 2020, they introduced the COVID-19 Health Disparities Action Act in the 116th Congress in response to the Trump Administration’s dismal COVID-19 response, which has consistently and disproportionately affected communities of color.The House version of the COVID-19 Health Disparities Action Act is being led by U.S. Representatives Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J).“The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately hurt Brown, Black, Indigenous, and Asian and Pacific Islander communities,” said Congressman Cárdenas. “People of color are getting sick and dying from the coronavirus at higher rates. Because of employment conditions and other social determinants of health, Brown and Black people are often the most likely to be exposed to the virus. Whether that’s working outdoors in agriculture, indoors in meatpacking plants, on the frontlines in community health centers, or in a range of in-person service-focused industries, these jobs increase exposure and risk of contracting the virus. Racial and ethnic health inequities have existed long before this public health crisis, but the pandemic has exacerbated this problem and it’s time we addressed it head-on.”“As we’ve seen through the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, poor and minority neighborhoods as well as underserved rural communities have been especially hard hit,” said Congresswoman Watson Coleman. “Sadly, vast disparities exist in our health infrastructure and they must be addressed. If we are to be successful in defeating the virus our response must include extra resources to attack the pandemic where it’s hurt the most. This bill recognizes this reality; I strongly support it and am grateful to my colleagues Congressman Cárdenas and Senator Menendez for helping to push this issue.”Full text of the letter is below and can be downloaded here. Mr. Jeffery Zients White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. Zients,         For over a year, COVID-19 has wreaked havoc both domestically and internationally. However, the approval of vaccines provides an opportunity for our nation to get one step closer to defeating this devastating disease. Through a robust vaccine initiative, our schools, economy and lives can return to some semblance of normal. While a lack of planning and leadership by the previous Administration resulted in a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, we are encouraged by this Administration’s efforts to scale up vaccinations across the country. President Joe Biden’s initial actions of expanding vaccine availability, assisting states in vaccination efforts, and committing to ensuring all Americans who want a vaccine can have one by the summer, are mitigating further COVID-19 devastation. Additionally, the Administration must build on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine data dashboard, as it has done for other COVID-19 metrics. In particular, it is critical that our federal database tracks nationwide distributions of vaccines to states, territories, and tribes, and collects robust demographic information to ensure at-risk communities are being vaccinated appropriately.While almost all states are reporting vaccination data to the CDC, only 32 states include demographic data specifying race and ethnicity.1 However, there are still gaps in reported data because race and ethnicity data was missing for nearly half of vaccine recipients in the early days of vaccine distribution.2 Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities have been disproportionately harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and yet, they are being vaccinated at significantly lower rates.3 There have also been reports of inaccurate and inconsistent data collection by states, leading to logistical lapses that highlight the need for increasing data entry staff.4According to the GAO report on Critical Vaccine Distribution, Supply Chain, Program Integrity, and Other Challenges Require Focused Federal Attention, there is currently no federal process or system to ensure the collection of standardized COVID-19 data,5 resulting in reporting of data that is often incomplete and unreliable. The lack of a uniform system across the country makes it difficult to provide a clear picture of vaccine distribution and administration. Comprehensive vaccine data is crucial for helping public health officials evaluate how to efficiently and equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines across the United States. It is also a crucial tool to aid public health officials in identifying the barriers minority communities face in receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and determine where vaccine hesitancy may persist.We request that the national COVID-19 vaccine dashboard be updated in order to improve transparency and communication in vaccine distribution and administration across the country. It is essential to our public health response efforts that the CDC COVID-19 vaccination dashboard display the most up-to-date information regarding the number of individuals that have received the COVID-19 vaccination by various demographics and by state of residence.At a minimum, we believe the dashboard should include:By updating our national dashboard to include more demographic data, we can better target and invest federal funding in those communities where vaccination rates lag, and ensure vaccines are equitably distributed and administered across the country. We urge you to take the steps necessary to develop and implement this valuable tool. We look forward to your response and thank you for your consideration of this important issue. Sincerely,  ### Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-and-wicker-team-with-clarke-gosar-simpson-and-meng-to-promote-loan-forgiveness-to-recruit-more-dentists,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) have reintroduced The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act (S. 449) to help increase the number of dental and dental hygiene faculty in the workforce by assisting dental and dental hygiene training programs to attract and retain faculty through loan forgiveness. There are nearly 6,500 dental health professional shortage areas nationwide. Nearly 60 million Americans, including 835,000 Marylanders, struggle to find a dental provider, even with insurance coverage. By 2030, the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) projects that the United States will have a national shortage of 16,000 dentists. We rely on dental faculty to train the next generation of oral health providers, but too often, these educators find themselves pushed to work in private practice in order to pay off their student loans. The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act will ease some of this financial burden and allow faculty members to stay where they are needed most by eliminating certain loan assistance benefits from counting as taxable income.“We can only hope to solve the shortage of accessible dental care if we can recruit and retain enough faculty to train the next generation of dentists and dental hygienists. Crippling educational debt should not prevent our nation from having the oral health care providers it needs,” said Senator Cardin. “The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act will strengthen recruitment efforts by reducing the tax burden that often comes with choosing a public service profession over higher-paying opportunities. I’m proud of the bipartisan, bicameral unity on this issue and encourage all of our colleagues to back this commonsense support for health communities.”“Communities across the country face unique challenges in recruiting and retaining dentists and dental faculty, drastically impacting access to dental care in underserved areas,” Senator Wicker said. “Attracting more faculty to train a new generation of dental students is essential to addressing national shortages of dentists, especially in states like Mississippi. This legislation would offer loan relief to encourage dentists to choose teaching over a private sector career.”Companion legislation (H.R. 1285) has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.), Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (R-Ariz.), Mike Simpson, D.M.D. (R-Idaho) and Grace Meng (D-N.Y.). The bicameral, bipartisan legislation is supported by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.“Our nation is in desperate need of talented and compassionate capable doctors, nurses, and dentists, who will work to address and eliminate health disparities that plague our most underserved communities,” said Congresswoman Clarke. No medical professional should have to worry about crushing student loan debt while caring for our most vulnerable populations. The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act gives these heroes one less thing to worry about.”“Dentists carry immense debt from years of specialized schooling to serve their communities. As we rebuild our nation after COVID-19, we must help everyone—including dentists—overcome their financial burdens. This starts with supporting and passing the bipartisan and bicameral Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act that would provide much-needed relief for dental faculty from paying potentially hefty taxes on their federal loan repayment benefits,” said Congresswoman Meng. “This commonsense bill will help aspiring dental professionals manage their student debt while pursuing their careers. I urge Congress to pass this measure.”“Training our next generation of dentists is critical to the overall health of our country,” said Congressman Gosar. “I’m proud to work with my colleagues on legislation that aims to remove barriers and strengthen oral health training.” “The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act provides much-needed relief to health professionals who serve our communities,” said Congressman Mike Simpson. “As a former dentist, I am pleased to see legislation lift some of the burdens off young people trying to enter the profession, especially potential pediatric dentists.”“The dental faculty loan repayment program (DFLRP) was created due to the significant difficulties in recruiting qualified individuals to fill faculty positions, especially acute in pediatric dentistry. A critical factor in recruiting and retaining dental school faculty from recent dental school or residency program graduates is the staggering student loan debt and income disparity with private practice. By alleviating taxation of such payments to the individual, this legislation will make the program even more effective in recruiting and retaining pediatric dental faculty,” said Jessica A. Lee, D.D.S, M.P.H., PhD, President, American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has decreased access to oral health care. Though patient volumes have improved since last spring, recent surveys from the American Dental Association (ADA) indicate that since August many private practices have been operating at around 80 percent of pre-COVID-19 patient volumes while public health practices have been operating at around 60 percent of pre-COVID-19 patient volumes. Patients nationwide have experienced restrictions throughout the pandemic impeding their ability to visit health professionals like oral health practitioners, while dental practices have experienced financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic. Ensuring access to oral health care during this incredibly challenging time includes easing the burden on our struggling providers, which is what the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act would do.Text of the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act (S. 449) can be found here. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-leads-senate-call-for-restoring-voting-rights-to-formerly-incarcerated-individuals,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) today introduced the Democracy Restoration Act (DRA/S. 481) that would end the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions nationwide. The bill aims to eliminate the complicated patchwork of state laws that creates a lack of uniform standards for voting in federal elections, exacerbates racial disparities in access to the ballot box, and contributes to confusion and misinformation regarding voting rights.“Voting is a fundamental right of citizenship and, under our Constitution, there is no legitimate justification for denying people who have paid their dues from having a voice in our democracy,” said Senator Cardin. “The United States is one of the few Western democracies that allows the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals with criminal convictions. This must end if we truly want to reintegrate ex-offenders as productive members of our communities.”In 30 States, individuals with convictions may not vote while they are on parole and 28 of those States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. Several States deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. These state laws deny citizens participation in our democracy and have a disproportionate impact on African Americans and other racial minorities Studies indicate that disenfranchisement is associated with an increased risk of recidivism. In 2020, more than five million individuals and as many as one in five African-Americans in some states were disenfranchised as a result of these laws.The Democracy Restoration Act (S. 481) is endorsed by a large coalition of civil rights and reform, faith-based, and criminal justice groups. This includes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, the Sentencing Project, and other organizations working on federal criminal justice reform. “The DRA is a critically important piece of civil rights legislation. The DRA makes our country more just, our democracy more inclusive, and our elections more participatory. The DRA makes space in the public square for second chances, for forgiveness, for redemption, and for love. Thank you, Senator Cardin, for continuing to be such a champion of the DRA,” said Myrna Perez, director of the Brennan Center’s Voting Rights and Elections Program.“The Democracy Restoration Act would begin to right the wrong of disenfranchisement by restoring the right to vote to returning citizens. Stripping the right to vote – a basic human right – is a relic of the Jim Crow era’s suffocating racism. Our democracy works best when all can participate,” said Sonia Gill, Senior Legislative Counsel, American Civil Liberties Union.“The criminal justice system shouldn’t decide who gets a say in our democracy. One in 16 Black Americans cannot vote because of a felony conviction — a rate almost 4 times greater than for people who aren’t Black. The racial injustices that permeate the U.S. criminal justice system now infect the electoral process. The Democracy Restoration Act would restore voting rights to millions of citizens released from prison; an important step to strengthen communities harmed for generations by oppressive laws,” said Kara Gotsch, Deputy Director of The Sentencing Project.Senate cosponsors of the Democracy Restoration Act include U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Mike Bennet (D-Colo.).As noted in the legislation, state disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. In recent years, African-Americans have been imprisoned at over 5 times the rate of Whites. More than 6 percent of the voting-age African-American population, or 1,800,000 African-Americans, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 9 States—Alabama (16 percent), Arizona (13 percent), Florida (15 percent), Kentucky (15 percent), Mississippi (16 percent), South Dakota (14 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), Virginia (16 percent), and Wyoming (36 percent)—more than 1 in 8 African-Americans are unable to vote because of a felony conviction, twice the national average for African Americans.Latino citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate representation in the criminal justice system. In recent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11 percent, Wyoming, 4 percent), twice the national average for Latinos.The full text of the Democracy Restoration Act (S. 481) is available here.

Cardin and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) drafted a provision in the CARES Act that required the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue guidance to financial institutions participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to prioritize loans for underserved small businesses, which has led to a movement by the Page 30 Coalition for more equity in SBA’s COVID-19 response. In April of last year, Cardin secured a $60 billion set-aside in PPP for smaller lending institutions, such as credit unions, community banks, Community Development Financial Institutions, and Minority Depository Institutions that can better reach Black-owned businesses. In the $900 billion bipartisan relief bill that passed in December, Cardin also secured an additional $60 billion in set-asides that included $35 billion for borrowers who were unable to apply for an initial PPP loan, of which $15 billion is for smaller borrowers with up to 10 employees or loans of up to $250,000 in low-income areas; and $25 billion for second PPP loans for the same small borrower category. Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-Va.) today announced a bill to renew the federal funding commitment to Metro for the next ten years – legislation that comes at a critical time for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which continues to provide critical service to essential frontline and federal workers despite the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis.“Maintaining a safe and reliable public transit system for the seat of the federal government is a clear national priority. We recognized 10 years ago – as we do now – that providing dedicated funding for WMATA will help keep Metro on track for everyday use and during national and regional emergencies. Metro and its workers have been on the front lines as essential workers providing vital service to others who also are keeping our communities, our health system and our economy running during this challenging time,” said Sen. Cardin, Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. “Our bill helps put Metro on solid footing into the future as our region emerges from the COVID-10 pandemic.”“WMATA provides a vital network that keeps our region connected and moving — getting federal employees to their jobs, essential workers to the front lines of the fight against the pandemic, and getting area residents and visitors where they need to go,” said Sen. Van Hollen. “As we continue to weather the COVID-19 storm, this bill helps WMATA not only meet the current needs in this crisis, but also makes the long-term improvements necessary to enhance safety, efficiency, and reliability for riders for years to come.”“Last year, I was proud to help negotiate the December COVID-19 relief bill that provided critical emergency relief funding to help WMATA stay afloat and avoid drastic service and staffing cuts,” said Sen. Warner, a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which has oversight over our nation’s urban transit systems. “With this legislation, we have the opportunity to ensure that WMATA can continue to support our federal workforce in the long term, as well as provide reliable and timely service for individuals – including many essential workers – commuting in and out of Virginia, DC, and Maryland.”“It’s critical Congress provide this necessary funding to help people, especially frontline workers, get around the DMV amid the pandemic,” Sen. Kaine said. “I urge our colleagues to support this vital legislation that will help prevent significant cuts, and allow individuals to rely on safe and efficient travel.”Recognizing that the Metro system is integral to the functioning of the federal government, for the past decade, Congress has provided Metro with $150 million annually for capital expenses, with Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia each providing $50 million in matching funds. The Metro Safety, Accountability and Investment Act of 2021 will ensure that WMATA can continue to count on this full federal funding for an additional ten years by reauthorizing funding levels from the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 through fiscal year 2030, at an annual level of $150 million, matched by funding from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.Additionally, this legislation would help bring about a series of key safety, oversight, and governance reforms at WMATA by including an additional $50 million per year in federal funding that is not subject to local match, bringing the annual federal commitment to Metro to $200 million. In order to access the additional $50 million, WMATA will be required to: further empower Metro’s Inspector General; establish task forces on track safety and bus safety; implement policy and procedures to improve WMATA’s capital planning process; improve the transit asset management planning process; continue to reinforce restrictions on the activities of alternate WMATA Board members to provide more effective Board management and oversight; and prioritize the implementation of new cyber security protections and the integration of wireless services and emergency communications networks.The bill also restricts WMATA from using federal funds on a contract for rolling stock from any country that meets certain criteria related to illegal subsidies for state-owned enterprises. Sens. Cardin, Van Hollen, Warner and Kaine have previously raised concerns regarding the possibility of Metro awarding a contract to build its newest 8000-series rail cars to a Chinese manufacturing company.  This legislation has the support of a number of groups and organizations, including 2030 Group, Connected DMV, MetroNow Coalition, Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce, Prince George’s Chamber of Commerce among others.“This bill once again demonstrates our Congressional delegation’s leadership supporting critically needed funding to maintain a safe and reliable transportation system, and it will be critical to the region’s recovery for years to come,” said Paul J. Wiedefeld, Metro General Manager and CEO. “We welcome provisions that will increase transparency and ensure taxpayer funds are well-spent to continue to earn the public’s confidence.  We thank the authors of this bill for understanding the importance of Metro to the entire region.”“The Metro system is one of the nation’s great public assets that millions of people rely on every year – from federal workers to visitors from around the world,” said Paul C. Smedberg, WMATA Board of Directors Chair. “We’re deeply thankful for the work of our region’s Congressional delegation to establish a long-term source of funding so we can continue to serve the public and bolster the independent oversight that is critical to maintaining trust with our customers.”“As we recover from the pandemic and move our economy forward, it is crucial that Metro delivers safe, reliable, efficient and equitable services to millions of riders including federal employees,” said Jack McDougle, President & CEO of the Board of Trade and a founding member of the MetroNow Coalition. “The reauthorization is needed to ensure access to opportunities for all our residents and keep the region competitive. The second largest public transit system in the country, Metro requires sufficient resources to make the right investments as well as keep up with the latest technology.”Bill text is available here.

Today, researchers at USAMRDC and USAMRIID are on the front lines of a rejuvenated effort to confront COVID-19 and successfully put an end to our public health crisis.Senators Cardin and Van Hollen held a virtual meeting this week with Brigadier General Michael Talley, Commanding General, US Army Medical Research and Development Command; Dr. Sarah Donahue, Deputy Chief of Staff, US Army Medical Research and Development Command; COL Darrin Cox, Commander, US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases; and others with oversight for the Fort Detrick research operations.“Thank you to the scientists and engineers at Fort Detrick who are working full throttle on research, development, testing and evaluation of vaccines against COVID-19. Maryland is proud that so many of the best minds in medical research are working here in our state,” said Senator Cardin. “We knew a year ago that the same lab that had developed vaccines for anthrax, Ebola and botulism needed to be part of the race to beat COVID-19. Senator Van Hollen and I will continue to do all we can to ensure Fort Detrick has the resources it needs to protect Americans from current and future biological and chemical threats.”“We are grateful for the men and women at Fort Detrick working on the front lines to protect the health and safety of Marylanders. This top-notch team of medical researchers, engineers and support staff are critical to beating this pandemic as they work around the clock to accelerate and develop the safest and most effective vaccines and therapeutics to support our nation’s response to COVID-19,” said Senator Van Hollen. “The work being done at Fort Detrick is vital to our state and our country. We are grateful for their service during this public health crisis. Senator Cardin and I will continue to fight for the funding necessary to make sure the base can continue its work defending our country.”USAMRIID is the Department’s lead laboratory for medical biological defense research. Their research helps to protect the American warfighter from biological threats and investigate disease outbreaks and threats to public health. Research conducted at USAMRIID leads to therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and information that benefit military personnel and civilians. USAMRICD is the nation’s leading science and technology laboratory in the area of chemical countermeasures research and development.In February 2020, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD/A&S) notified the senators that it was withholding $104 million in payments to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) at Aberdeen Proving Ground. In a letter to then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, searching for an explanation, the senators wrote: “Given the critical contributions of USAMRIID and USAMRICD to our national security, including their role in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, we were alarmed to learn that the OUSD/A&S has withheld payment for laboratory research since September 2019.” The full letter can be found here.The federal budget for Fiscal Year 2021 included $130 million for the expansion of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick in Frederick, recognizing its leading role in our biological defense research. ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
https://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-applauds-inclusion-of-the-chesapeake-country-all-american-road-in-american-byways-collection,"Press ReleaseWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, today celebrated the inclusion of the Chesapeake Country All-American Road, a more than 400-mile route from Chesapeake City to Crisfield on country roads along the Chesapeake Bay’s edge, in the U.S. Department of Transportation “America’s Byways” collection.“The inclusion of the Chesapeake Country All-American Road in the National Scenic Byways network will open new doors for federal funding that can help Maryland communities preserve, showcase and monetize their historic, cultural, natural, recreational and tourism resources,” said Senator Cardin. “This valuable new partnership was exactly the type of expansion of the program that I had hoped we would spark when authoring and working to pass the bipartisan Reviving America’s Scenic Byways Act of 2019. The Chesapeake Country All-American Road weaves together some of the very best historic and natural landscapes that Maryland has to offer, and its recognition by the National Scenic Byways program helps secure its status as a treasured resource that will to flourish into the future.”The Chesapeake Country All-American Road was one of 49 new designations to the America’s Byways collection, including 15 All-American Roads and 34 National Scenic Byways in 28 states, recently announced by the Federal Highway Administration. These new designations were the first made pursuant to Public Law 116-57, which required the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to solicit nominations for certain roads to be designated under the National Scenic Byways Program as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads based on their archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational, and scenic qualities. Before the All-American Road designation, only part of the Chesapeake Country route, from Kent County to Queen Anne’s County, was considered a national scenic byway.“The All-American Road designation simply tells people what we already know. The Eastern Shore of Maryland is a very special place,” said Cassandra M. Vanhooser, the Director of Economic Development and Tourism for Talbot County. “Not only is this national designation a source of tremendous community pride, it will help us present our assets in such a way that visitors can more easily experience them. I call that a win for everyone involved.”“The Chesapeake Country byway’s designation internationally significant cultural heritage and outdoor recreation experiences help make Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay a unique and exciting place to visit,” said Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly M. Schulz. “Throughout the challenging nomination process, the nomination committee, comprised of a number of tourism partners, state agencies, and local county tourism offices, worked together to maximize this opportunity to showcase the byway as one of the best driving tours in the country.”“The National Scenic Byways Program brings new jobs, tourism, and other benefits to communities along these scenic roads. We are grateful to Senator Cardin for his leadership in passing Public Law No. 116-57, The Reviving America’s Scenic Byways Act, which made today’s announcement possible,” said Scenic America President Mark Falzone. “We congratulate Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway on their designation as an All-American Road today and are excited to partner with them as they tap into the program’s benefits.” ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"

Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John P. Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Anthony G. Brown, Jamie B. Raskin and David Trone (All D-Md.), are urging President Joe Biden to approve Maryland’s appeal for an emergency declaration in support of the state’s efforts to improve safety and security across the National Capital Region for the 59th Presidential Inauguration.The state’s request for an emergency declaration was denied by President Trump in the final days of his administration.“[T]he breach and riots at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 demonstrated the need for additional coordination and planning leading up to the January 20 inauguration, due to potential threats in Washington, the National Capital Region (NCR), and state capitals such as Annapolis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Emergency operations centers at both the state and local levels activated to both monitor and coordinate necessary support.“Maryland took significant, necessary, and reasonable preparations to ensure the overall safety of the public throughout the events surrounding the inauguration. We therefore request that you grant the State of Maryland’s appeal and approve the emergency declaration request.”The full letter follows and can be found at this link. February 17, 2021 The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.The President of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden:       We are writing as the Maryland Congressional Delegation to express our strong support for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan’s appeal of the denial of an emergency declaration for response actions directly related to the 59th Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2021. The federal government denied this request on January 17, 2021.      Maryland began planning for potential impacts from the inauguration several months in advance of the event. However, the breach and riots at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 demonstrated the need for additional coordination and planning leading up to the January 20 inauguration, due to potential threats in Washington, the National Capital Region (NCR), and state capitals such as Annapolis. Emergency operations centers at both the state and local levels activated to both monitor and coordinate necessary support. Maryland took significant, necessary, and reasonable preparations to ensure the overall safety of the public throughout the events surrounding the inauguration.      Several state and local government agencies incurred costs for in-state activities directly in response to the inauguration, including the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland State Police, and the Maryland Department of Transportation. After the incident at the Capitol on January 6, specialized law enforcement teams were placed on standby for response to potential threats both in the state and in the District of Columbia. Fortunately, and in part due to better preparations, we witnessed a peaceful transition on January 20, 2021.                The State of Maryland continues to experience unprecedented fiscal challenges due to COVID-19. Inauguration response activities placed an additional burden on staffing levels throughout the state, as personnel performing emergency protecting measures for COVID-19 took on these added tasks. We therefore request that you grant the State of Maryland’s appeal and approve the emergency declaration request, following the work of state and local governments in conducting emergency protective measures (eligible under FEMA Public Assistance Category B) in direct support of the inauguration.Thank you for your timely consideration of this request, and we look forward to your response.  Sincerely,  ###Read MoreRead MoreRead MorePrivacy PolicyBaltimore100 South Charles StreetTower 1, Suite 1710Baltimore, MD 21201(410) 962-4436U.S. Capitol509 Hart Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510(202) 224-4524Bowie10201 Martin Luther King, Jr. HwySuite 210Bowie, MD 20720(301) 860-041413 Canal Street Room 305 Cumberland, MD 21502 (301) 777-2957Easton114 South Washington StreetSuite 202Easton, MD 21601(410) 546-4250451 Hungerford Drive Suite 230 Rockville, MD 20850 (301) 762-2974"
