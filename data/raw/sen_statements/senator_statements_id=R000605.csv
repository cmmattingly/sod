https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-nominates-the-hughes-family-of-sioux-falls-for-angels-in-adoption-award-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) announced that he has nominated John and Beth Hughes for the 2022 Angels in Adoption Award, presented by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption (CCAI).John and Beth Hughes have a passion for helping women who choose adoption. Their adoption practice, Heart2Heart Adoptions, which is a part of Hughes Law Office in Sioux Falls, began more than thirty years ago when John was asked by friends to help with the interstate adoption of twin girls. John said that he had never done an adoption before and was promptly told, “Well, then you better learn.” While John provides the legal expertise and counsel, Beth has a remarkable ability to ask the tough questions of expectant mothers and hopeful adopting parents in the most loving of ways.Their greatest reward is having a birth mother they helped in the past come back and tell them that adoption was one of the hardest, but best, decisions in her life. They cherish watching the children grow through the years and love receiving Christmas photos and graduation announcements. In their 31 years of adoption practice, they have assisted with over 500 adoptions in 45 states. John has been admitted to practice in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Court for more than 20 years, and he has had successful adoption experiences with all nine Sioux tribes.John and Beth are blessed with highly-skilled and caring staff who support their adoption work at every step: Jeryl, Mary, Angi and Mel. John and Beth have three grown sons, two daughters-in-law and three grandchildren.“I am honored to nominate John and Beth for this year’s Angels in Adoption Award,” said Rounds. “John and Beth have brought numerous families together and have touched the lives of so many. Over 500 adoptions in 45 states is a remarkable accomplishment, and their dedication continues to have a positive impact on our state.” Rounds is a member of the CCAI. Each year, members of Congress are invited to nominate an outstanding family or organization from their state to receive an Angels in Adoption award. CCAI is a 501(c)3 nonpartisan organization dedicated to raising awareness about the tens of thousands of orphans and foster children in the United States and the millions of orphans around the world in need of permanent, safe and loving homes through adoption.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-ossoff-introduce-bill-to-reform-veteran-records-backlog,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) introduced the Access for Veterans to Records Act. This legislation would work to eliminate the backlog of veteran records requests at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) within the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). “Our men and women in uniform have sacrificed so much to protect our freedom,” said Rounds. “The current backlog is unacceptable and impedes veterans’ ability to access the services they have earned. This bill would work to reform the National Personnel Records Center so our veterans can acquire their records in a timely manner. I am pleased my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are coming together to introduce this commonsense legislation.”“Too many Georgia veterans are having to wait too long to access their service records. It can impact their access to health care and veterans’ benefits,” said Ossoff. “That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan bill to address the backlog.”As of July 2022, NPRC still had a backlog of 499,000 records requests from veterans. The Access for Veterans to Records Act would direct NARA to submit a plan to Congress for eliminating the current backlog. Within the plan, NARA would be required to include timeframes for reducing the backlog, as well as steps to improve customer service and upgrade technology infrastructure to prevent future backlogs.Rounds and Ossoff were joined by Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives, which passed in July by a vote of 406-21.  Click HERE for full bill text.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-introduces-legislation-to-strengthen-school-security,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced the Security to Avoid Violence in Educational Settings (SAVES) Act. This legislation would redirect federal funds to establish a grant program to enhance school safety at the state and local levels.“The first responsibility of any school is to provide for the safety of all students,” said Rounds. “When it comes to our kids, it should not be a one-size-fits-all approach. South Dakota has schools of many sizes and needs. Decisions about education are best made at the state and local levels. This bill would allow states and local schools to determine how to improve school safety in a manner that best fits their needs.”The SAVES Act would create a new Department of Justice grant program to improve school security. This program would reallocate $500 million in funding over five years to states to create grants for local K-12 schools and school systems. Unlike other federal programs for school security, this grant program will allow states and local schools, rather than federal agencies, to determine how to utilize this money to strengthen school safety.The grant program would not cost any additional taxpayer money. It would instead transfer funding appropriated in last year’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements at public school facilities. The redirecting of funds would allow schools to access metal detectors and school security officers rather than providing solar panels at schools.You can read the full bill text HERE. ###"

This acquisition could threaten our national security by allowing the Chinese Communist Party to closely monitor the operations and communications at a very important military facility.“In my travels around South Dakota, I’ve heard from many farmers and ranchers who are concerned about foreign adversaries owning American farmland. It’s time to put a stop to this and take action. This legislation makes certain American interests are protected by blacklisting foreign adversaries from purchasing land or businesses involved in agriculture.”On July 1, 2022, Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) introduced the House version of the PASS Act. Rounds’ legislation retains key provisions of the House version and adds additional language related to foreign investments, agricultural land acquisition and reporting by the Secretary of Agriculture.

The Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Proceeds from coin sales will go toward much-needed repairs and maintenance to the memorial at no cost to taxpayers.“The World War II Memorial recognizes the tremendous sacrifices made by our Greatest Generation,” said Rounds. “They put their ordinary lives on hold to step into numerous roles defending our country. Whether at home or abroad, their selfless efforts made an unmatched impact on our generation and generations to follow. I am pleased this bill was signed into law so future generations will remember and honor the courageous heroes that came before them.”“Our bipartisan bill signifies the commitment of lawmakers and leaders to honor the heroic veterans who fought in WWII and to ensure they will not be forgotten,” said Shaheen. “The National World War II Memorial is a testament to the tremendous sacrifices made by our Greatest Generation, and stands as a crucial reminder of what the sons and daughters of America did to rid our world of tyranny. I’m proud to have led the bipartisan push with Senator Rounds to restore this memorial so Americans can continue to have a public place to honor and remember the brave individuals who served, and those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.”   “With the signing into law of the Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act, we continue our bipartisan work to honor the National World War II Memorial and preserve it for years to come,” said Kaptur. “The Greatest Generation commemorative coin will stand the test of time – representing America’s enduring gratitude for the millions of brave servicemembers who answered the call to defend Liberty when our nation and the world needed them most.”The Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act unanimously passed both the Senate and the House in July. Beginning in 2024, the coins will be sold to the public. Proceeds from the sale of the coins will be used by the Friends of the National World War II Memorial, in partnership with the National Park Service, to perform necessary maintenance and repair work at the memorial and provide enhanced educational and commemorative programming for the millions of people who visit annually. Read the bill text that was signed into law HERE. ###"

Both countries are longtime partners of the alliance and have gone through the necessary procedures to join. The requests to become formal members of NATO come as the Russian military initiated an unjustified and despicable invasion against the sovereign country of Ukraine. Finland and Sweden are well positioned to provide support to NATO allies if needed and are strategic additions to the alliance. As a member of the Senate’s NATO Observer Group, I am pleased the Senate efficiently provided ‘advice and consent’ and voted with wide bipartisan support for Finland and Sweden to join NATO. The accession of both countries will send a message of unity and strengthen the alliance against Russia’s growing threat.”"

With the president’s signature, this bill will help preserve the memorial so future generations can continue to honor the courageous heroes that came before them. I am proud that the last of this storied generation, many of whom continue to visit our nation’s capital through honor flights, will set their eyes on a fully-restored memorial.”“I’m thrilled that our legislation to invest in the World War II memorial and ensure its structural integrity is secure for generations of Americans is now on its way to the President’s desk,” said Shaheen. “This is about preserving our history and honoring the brave souls who gave their lives for a cause greater than any one person or one nation. It’s important to protect public spaces and memorials like this so that we can provide a place for loved ones and fellow Americans to reflect, appreciate and remember the heroism of those brave individuals. I look forward to the President signing this bill into law.”“At the heart of our nation’s capital, the National World War II Memorial stands as an enduring testament to the patriots of America’s Greatest Generation whose selfless courage secured the victory of Liberty in the 20th century,” said Kaptur. “The Greatest Generation commemorative coin will serve as a sturdy token that honors those who fought and sacrificed while fortifying the sacred national shrine that salutes their legacies.”Proceeds from the sale of the coins will be used by the Friends of the National World War II Memorial, in partnership with the National Park Service, to perform necessary maintenance and repair work at the memorial and provide enhanced educational and commemorative programming to the millions of people who visit annually. The bill authorizes Treasury to mint up to 50,000 $5 coins, 400,000 $1 coins, and 750,000 half-dollar coins for use as legal tender. Beginning in 2024, the coins will be sold to the public at face value plus a $35, $10, and $5 surcharge, respectively, to fund the work and programming led by the Friends of the National World War II Memorial.“The commemorative coin will serve as an important representation of the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the brave Americans who fought to defend the nation and advance peace and freedom throughout the world,” said Friends of the National World War II Memorial Executive Director Holly Rotondi. “We are grateful to Congresswoman Kaptur and Congressman Adam Kinzinger, along with Senators Mike Rounds and Jeanne Shaheen for their strong leadership in recognizing the importance of the memorial as the singular place in the U.S. to commemorate World War II and its veterans and moving this significant legislation through Congress.”""The National World War II Memorial stands as an important symbol of America’s national unity, a timeless reminder of the moral strength and power that flows when free people are united and bonded together in a common and just cause for liberty,” said Friends of the National World War II Memorial Chairman Jane Droppa. “In 2024, the Memorial will turn 20 years old, and without the efforts of Congresswoman Kaptur and Congressman Adam Kinzinger and Senators Mike Rounds and Jeanne Shaheen the legislation passed today it would not be possible to provide much needed attention to this sacred space.”You can read the full bill text HERE.  "

The delegation has strongly supported previous disaster declaration requests, including the one that was granted on June 29, 2022, which came as a result of severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding that devastated communities across eastern South Dakota on May 12, 2022.“Unfortunately, South Dakota was in the midst of recovering from multiple natural disasters when these storms occurred, and, since then, has been battered by more devastating storms,” the delegation wrote. “The resilience and resourcefulness of South Dakotans in recent months has been extraordinary, however, as losses mount, the people of our great state hope the federal government will join in their restoration efforts.”Full letter HERE or below:+++ The Honorable Joseph BidenPresident of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500Dear President Biden,We write to you in support of Governor Kristi Noem’s request for a major disaster declaration covering the South Dakota counties of Butte, Haakon, Jackson, Jones, McPherson, and Spink. This declaration would greatly assist in recovery efforts from significant weather events occurring June 11, 2022, through June 14, 2022.Much of the western and central South Dakota plains experienced extreme weather during the specified timeframe that involved severe thunderstorms with golf ball to grapefruit size hail and wind gusts of 80 to 95 miles per hour. The last of these storms produced winds over 120 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. These winds caused extensive damage to homes and businesses, agriculture, and public infrastructure, such as rural electrical cooperative power lines and telephone poles. More than 6,000 residents experienced power outages, many of whom were left without power for several days.Unfortunately, South Dakota was in the midst of recovering from multiple natural disasters when these storms occurred, and, since then, has been battered by more devastating storms. The resilience and resourcefulness of South Dakotans in recent months has been extraordinary, however, as losses mount, the people of our great state hope the federal government will join in their restoration efforts.In light of these considerations, we urge you to approve Governor Noem’s request as soon as possible so that the necessary federal resources are available to assist relevant areas of our state. Please do not hesitate to contact any of our offices with any questions. We thank you for the support you have already offered, and respectfully ask for your continued attention and assistance in providing the resources necessary to ensure the safety of South Dakotans.###"

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-and-tester-introduce-legislation-to-improve-homeownership-opportunities-for-native-american-veterans,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.), member and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, introduced the Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation aimed at helping Native American veterans achieve homeownership.This legislation would reform the Native American Direct Loan (NADL) program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and make it more accessible to Native American veterans living on trust land. Specifically, it would allow Native American veterans to use the NADL program to refinance any other existing mortgage on the same property. It would also create a relending program to allow Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to obtain loans through the NADL program and relend those funds to qualified Native American veterans.Additionally, this legislation would expand the VA’s existing NADL program outreach to include collaborating with local service providers that are familiar with the mortgage lending process on trust land. This would offer homebuyer education and housing counseling to assist Native American veterans who are looking to qualify for mortgage financing. “Homeownership is part of the American dream and a key to building wealth,” said Rounds. “This legislation would improve the Native American Direct Loan program and enhance outreach and other assistance as needed to Native American veterans seeking to qualify for mortgage financing. By creating expanded access to Native American veterans, our bill would help make the dream of homeownership a reality.”“Native Americans serve our nation at the highest rates, so there’s no question that we’ve got to keep expanding resources to help them access safe and affordable housing here at home,” said Tester. “Our bipartisan bill will do just that by offering additional services and support under the Native American Direct Loan program that’ll connect more Native Veterans and their families with the tools they need to buy, build, or fix up homes on our tribal lands.”The Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act is supported by the South Dakota Native Homeownership Coalition, Grow South Dakota and the following South Dakota Native CDFIs: Mazaska Owecaso Otipi Financial, Lakota Fund/Lakota Federal Credit Union and Four Bands Community Fund.""We are so appreciative of Senator Rounds' leadership on these issues,"" said Sharon Vogel, chair of the South Dakota Native Homeownership Coalition. ""The Coalition has been working with him and his staff closely over the past five years to identify strategies to improve homeownership opportunities for Native veterans. This bill would provide excellent opportunities for meaningful collaboration between VA staff and the Native organizations who serve as the boots on the ground to support our Native veterans.""For full bill text click HERE.###"

This announcement stops the recommended reduction in services at VA facilities in Hot Springs, Sioux Falls, Sturgis and Wagner.“As Senators, we share a commitment to expanding and strengthening modern VA infrastructure in a way that upholds our obligations to America’s veterans. We believe the recommendations put forth to the AIR Commission are not reflective of that goal, and would put veterans in both rural and urban areas at a disadvantage, which is why we are announcing that this process does not have our support and will not move forward. The Commission is not necessary for our continued push to invest in VA health infrastructure, and together we remain dedicated to providing the Department with the resources and tools it needs to continue delivering quality care and earned services to veterans in 21stcentury facilities—now and into the future.”Background:###"

The senators’ legislation will address anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries that hurt consumers and producers, threaten the nation's food supply and endanger America’s food security.“Anticompetitive behavior in the meat packing industry hurts both consumers and producers,” said Rounds. “Unfortunately, packer concentration in the beef industry is more consolidated today than it was when the Packers and Stockyards Act was first signed into law over 100 years ago. It’s long past time to address this problem. I thank my colleagues on the committee for their bipartisan support of our legislation and look forward to working across the aisle to get this bill signed into law.”“Anticompetitive behavior by the large meatpackers have raised prices on consumers and pushed family ranchers out of business, so this is a critical step toward making sure capitalism works like it’s supposed to work,” said Tester. “I want to thank Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Boozman for their leadership, feedback, and rigorous debate during the committee process. Now we need to put this bill on the Senate floor so we can make sure there is fair competition in the marketplace because when free markets work, consumers see lower prices at the meat counter, producers get a fair return on their product, and our economy grows stronger in rural America and across the country.”“With the passage of this bill, my years-long beef with Big Cattle is one step closer to being settled,” said Grassley. “Iowa cattle producers have struggled to receive a fair price for years – long before inflation hit a 40-year high. It’s past time for Congress to stand with independent cattle producers and put an end to the cozy relationship between large meat packers and big cattle feedlots.”The senators' Meat Packing Special Investigator Act would create the ""Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters"" within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Packers and Stockyards Division.The new USDA special investigator will have a team of investigators, with subpoena power, dedicated to preventing and addressing anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries and enforcing our nation's antitrust laws. They will coordinate and act in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to create a new bridge between the USDA and the Department of Homeland Security to protect the continuation of the food supply and increase national security.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-rubio-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-protect-the-rights-of-pregnant-students-and-their-babies,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and other Senate colleagues introduced the Pregnant Students’ Rights Act. The bill strengthens existing requirements for higher education institutions to publicly disclose the resources and rights available for pregnant and parenting students, including information about how to file a Title IX complaint with the U.S. Department of Education if their school does not provide these accommodations.“The Pregnant Students’ Rights Act requires colleges to provide helpful information to pregnant students who are enrolled at higher education institutions,” said Rounds. “By making certain an expected mother knows her rights under Title IX, this bill not only encourages students to continue their education, but also protects the lives of the unborn.”   “Pregnant college women should never feel like abortion is their only option,” said Rubio. “This bill would help pregnant students choose life by ensuring women are aware of the information and resources provided by their school to support them and their babies while pursuing their education. Every life is precious and college campuses should never make young women feel marginalized for choosing life.”Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) are cosponsors of the bill. Representative Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.   Specifically, the Pregnant Students’ Rights Act would: The bill has been endorsed by Susan B.

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) today urged President Biden to promptly grant Gov. Kristi Noem’s (R-S.D.) request for federal disaster assistance in portions of South Dakota. The request follows the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that devastated communities across eastern South Dakota on May 12, 2022.“Widespread impacts resulted from this storm system, including uprooted or snapped trees, significant property damage, downed power-lines, overturned semi-trucks, as well as injuries and two tragic fatalities,” the delegation wrote. “The high winds and ensuing weather also caused extensive damage to agriculture—the lifeblood and economic engine of South Dakota.“The state, county, and local governments stepped up to meet the disaster with all available resources and authorities. However, the impact to public infrastructure across the 20 counties and two Indian reservations is severe,” the delegation continued. “We respectfully request that you expeditiously review Governor Noem’s request and declare a major disaster for relevant areas of our state.”Full letter below:Dear President Biden: We write in strong support of Governor Kristi Noem’s request for a major disaster declaration for the state of South Dakota as a result of severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred on May 12, 2022. As Governor Noem’s request indicates, eastern South Dakota was struck by a string of destructive storms on May 12, 2022, with 14 reported tornadoes and wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour in some areas. Widespread impacts resulted from this storm system, including uprooted or snapped trees, significant property damage, downed power-lines, overturned semi-trucks, as well as injuries and two tragic fatalities. The high winds and ensuing weather also caused extensive damage to agriculture—the lifeblood and economic engine of South Dakota. Fortunately, it was too early in the season to wipe out any crops, but farmers lost essential equipment and resources—feed, grain bins, outbuildings, and more.The state, county, and local governments stepped up to meet the disaster with all available resources and authorities. However, the impact to public infrastructure across the 20 counties and two Indian reservations is severe. As Governor Noem indicated in her request, this event was of “such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments, and supplemental federal assistance is necessary.” This determination was reached on the basis of a preliminary damage assessment completed by the state in cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.We respectfully request that you expeditiously review Governor Noem’s request and declare a major disaster for relevant areas of our state. Along with our fellow South Dakotans, we appreciate your consideration of this request and stand ready to assist in any way possible."

This legislation closes the legal loophole that requires immigration authorities to release illegal aliens back into the United States when they have not been accepted for deportation to other countries after being detained for six months, a practice also referred to as ""catch and release.""“The failed policies of the Biden administration and the ‘catch and release’ loophole have created a crisis at our southern border,” said Rounds. “Our commonsense legislation closes this dangerous loophole helping to keep the American people safe.”“Our immigration system is broken and President Biden won’t acknowledge the crisis we are facing at the southern border,” said Inhofe. “That’s why my colleagues and I introduced the Keep Our Communities Safe Act this week. This legislation would close the ‘catch-and-release’ loophole, which puts law abiding citizens, local law enforcement officials and communities at risk. Our bill will ensure that illegal aliens who have been found guilty of violent crimes and aggravated felonies are not able to remain in our communities. As the current law stands, an illegal alien with a criminal record is released back into the United States after six months if no other country accepts them for deportation. This bill is a commonsense solution and it’s time for it to become law.”Rounds and Inhofe were joined by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), John Kennedy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.).Click HERE for full bill text.###"

This bipartisan legislation will support the timely restoration of this Memorial, which pays tribute to those who bravely fought to defend our country during World War II.”“I’m proud our bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously, showing the overwhelming consensus that exists around supporting our veterans,” said Shaheen. “This legislation will help provide critical infrastructure updates to the World War II Memorial, which commemorates the millions of Americans who served and the 400,000 who died in World War II. Educating generations, both young and old, about the war and our nation’s achievements is an important tribute and ensures the Greatest Generation of heroes are never forgotten.

Last year, Rounds and Thune introduced legislation that would make the Hyde Amendment permanent.“We write to express our unwavering support for the Hyde Amendment and all other longstanding pro-life protections,” the senators wrote. “For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children.

The AIR Commission should be called the ERROR Commission. Senator Manchin and I first introduced common sense legislation to eliminate this commission in 2019. Now that the consequences of the VA MISSION Act are being widely experienced, more members are joining our efforts to stop it. I will continue working to make certain veterans in South Dakota receive the care they have earned.”“Our Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect our nation and deserve easy access to the healthcare they have earned,” said Manchin. “The VA’s recommendations to the AIR Commission are skewed against rural states like West Virginia, which would see a reduction in services at three of our four VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure our brave Veterans don’t lose access to the healthcare they earned and sacrificed for and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join this critical legislation.”Rounds and Manchin were joined by Senators Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).Background:###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-smith-reintroduce-bipartisan-legislation-expanding-mental-health-services-in-rural-america-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) led a bipartisan group of senators in reintroducing legislation to expand telemental health services in rural areas. The Home-Based Telemental Health Care Act would establish a grant program for health providers to expand telemental health services for those specifically in rural populations working in farming, forestry and fishing industries. Additional cosponsors include Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.).“Those living in rural areas may live far away from a mental health facility, making in-person visits difficult for those seeking care,” said Rounds. “Utilizing telemental health capabilities will allow South Dakotans in rural areas to receive quality care from the comfort of their homes. Not only does this save time and resources, it provides an important mental health service during a difficult period for our farmers and ranchers, who for years have suffered economically due to challenging weather, trade disputes and price disparities.”“Now—especially as our nation continues dealing with a pandemic—we need to help rural America overcome the unique obstacles that small towns and rural communities face in providing mental health,” said Smith. “Our bipartisan bill will help health providers in rural areas expand tele-mental health care services for farmers, ranchers and foresters, and many others in local communities who are experiencing stress and burnout caused by the pandemic, difficult weather, low commodity prices and more. It’s important that they get the services they need during this uncertain time.”The Home-Based Telemental Health Care Act is supported by the South Dakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, South Dakota Farmers Union, National Farmers Union, National Rural Health Association, Sanford Health, Avera Health and Monument Health.This legislation would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth of the Health Resources and Services Administration, in coordination with the Rural Health Liaison of the Department of Agriculture, to award grants to entities to establish demonstration projects for the provision of telemental health services for rural populations, specifically those working in the farming, fishing and forestry occupations. It would authorize up to $10 million for each fiscal year through 2026, using current funds.“Farmers across the state are suffering from drought, labor shortages and price disparities,” said Scott VanderWal, President of the South Dakota Farm Bureau. “The demands of farming, especially during this time of the year, make it difficult for farmers to seek care. The Home-Based Telemental Health Care Act works to provide farmers in rural communities with accessible, quality mental health services. I thank Senators Rounds and Smith for their leadership in addressing the well-being of our rural communities.”“We thank Senator Rounds for introducing Senate Bill 3937 to bring telemental health services to our rural communities and to study the impact of receiving this service in the home rather than traditional in-person physician offices,” said Tim Rave, President and CEO of South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations. “Mental health care needs are not being met in rural areas today so we look forward to supporting this initiative for individuals in farming, fishing and forestry.Knowing full well of the challenges farmers and ranchers face in their day-to-day lives, SDFU has been a strong advocate for telemental health care,” said Doug Sombke, President of South Dakota Farmers Union. “Our communities across the state have faced great loss because mental health was left unaddressed. Earlier access to telemental health may have saved lives. This bill will help provide resources for farmers and ranchers, and I like to think continued advocacy will save some lives from being lost.”“Sanford Health would like to thank Sen. Rounds and Sen. Smith for their leadership on these issues,” said Corey Brown, System Vice President of Government Affairs for Sanford Health. “Mental health continues to emerge as the next national challenge and we appreciate the proactive, informed, and direct attention towards trying to tackle this significant healthcare issue.”“Avera has seen the benefit of being able to provide telehealth directly to patients where they are during the course of the pandemic. Given our vastly rural footprint and the challenges so many in our area continue to face, we are appreciative of this legislation – and know it will help to ensure care is provided to those who need it, when and where they need it,” said Dr. Matthew Stanley, Avera psychiatrist and Clinical Vice President of the Avera Behavioral Health Service Line.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-delivers-opening-remarks-at-cybersecurity-subcommittee-hearing2,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, delivered opening remarks today at a subcommittee hearing on AI applications to operations in cyberspace. Video of the remarks is available here.Rounds’ remarks, as prepared for delivery: I would like to thank our witnesses for appearing at our hearing today.  The topic of today’s hearing is one that is of particular interest to me.  Over the last few years, this subcommittee has witnessed first-hand at our many hearings and briefings how dynamic and rapidly-evolving the cyberspace domain is.  New technologies are emerging all the time — that’s a good thing, but it also poses new challenges.  Malicious cyber actors have demonstrated time and time again how quickly they can exploit these new technologies to attack our systems and infrastructures.  The Department of Defense must move just as quickly to understand these emerging technologies, both to provide our United States Cyber Command with cutting-edge capabilities for their cyberspace mission and also to defend against these technologies being used against our Nation.I cannot think of a technology that will have a broader impact on cyberspace than the application of Artificial Intelligence (known as AI).  I’d like to share an excerpt from the final report of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI), which captures the landscape nicely: “AI-enhanced capabilities will be the tools of first resort in a new era of conflict as strategic competitors develop AI concepts and technologies for military and other malign uses and cheap and commercially available AI applications ranging from ‘deepfakes‘ to lethal drones become available to rogue states, terrorists, and criminals. The United States must prepare to defend against these threats by quickly and responsibly adopting AI for national security and defense purposes. Defending against AI-capable adversaries operating at machine speeds without employing AI is an invitation to disaster. Human operators will not be able to keep up with or defend against AI-enabled cyber or disinformation attacks, drone swarms, or missile attacks without the assistance of AI-enabled machines. National security professionals must have access to the world’s best technology to protect themselves, perform their missions, and defend us.”Put simply, our adversaries are going to use AI against us — so we must use AI to defend against them.I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today.  To start with, I would like each witness to give a short basic introduction of AI that will help us understand these technologies better and help us describe these issues to other Senators to have the policy discussions that need to be done.  Please give us a short overview of the difference between a normal computer program, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing.I would also like to hear from the witnesses on their perspectives of the current state of adoption of AI technologies in industry to defend against AI-capable adversaries.  How are your companies leveraging AI today to defend your cyberspace infrastructure?  How do you think the Department of Defense needs to leverage AI for their cyberspace missions? I would appreciate your thoughts on the best way to leverage AI-enabled cyber defenses to protect against AI-enabled cyber attacks.Thank you again to our witnesses for coming here today.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-issues-statement-on-leaked-supreme-court-draft-decision,"WASHINGTON – Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) issued the following statement after the leak of a draft decision authored by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization:“Our Framers intended for the Supreme Court to be an independent judiciary, separate and distinct from the executive and legislative branches. The information being reported on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case was wrongfully leaked from the Court. The Court should investigate and hold accountable whoever is responsible for this breach.“I am pro-life and firmly believe abortion is wrong. However, I recognize that if this case is decided as reported, individuals across the country will be faced with difficult, emotional decisions. Our job as policymakers should be to make it easier for individuals to choose life, whether that be making certain they have the proper means to raise a child or the confidence to know adoption is a viable option.“I remain focused on promoting policies that protect life from conception to natural death.”"

The bill unanimously passed the Senate and now awaits passage in the House of Representatives.“It’s long past time to remove federal laws that are discriminatory to Native Americans from our books,” said Rounds. “In many cases, these laws are more than a century old and do nothing but continue the stigma of subjugation and paternalism from that time period. Clearly, there is no place in our legal code for such laws. I thank Tamara for her support and for providing testimony to the House subcommittee overseeing this legislation. As Tamara said in her opening statement, it’s time for the House to pass this bill and get it to the president’s desk.”The RESPECT Act would repeal 11 outdated federal laws, including laws that stripped Native American children from their families for the purpose of placing them in cruel “Indian reform schools” like the now infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School.A full list of laws the RESPECT would repeal is available HERE.The RESPECT Act is supported by the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Association and the National Congress of American Indians.St. John’s Remarks as prepared for delivery:“Good afternoon, Chairwoman Leger-Fernandez, Ranking Member Obernolte, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of Senate Bill 789, the Repealing Existing Substandard Provisions Encouraging Conciliation with Tribes Act, also known as the RESPECT Act.I wish to thank Senator Rounds who represents my beloved state of South Dakota for providing the leadership on this important legislation. The RESPECT Act can be a base for further work to amend or change federal policies that limit the progress of Native Nations and indigenous people in the United States of America. Many of us in the Great Plains, and across the country, are excited to see this RESPECT Act finally receive a hearing in the United States House of Representatives. My understanding is this legislation originated out of tribal consultations when Senator Rounds’ staff was working with Sioux Tribes, located in present-day South Dakota, on Carlisle Indian School repatriation efforts. I have often heard it described as being a rare, non-partisan, non-controversial, and no-cost piece of legislation. I thank all of you for giving this legislation the opportunity to be heard.In 2018, I was elected to my first term in the South Dakota House of Representatives. The day that I stepped onto the floor of the State House, I looked up and saw a painting of the sort that is commonly found in many State Capitals, and done during a time when life was very different in South Dakota. It depicts the typical images of immigrants during the settlement of what was Native homelands for centuries. In the painting above my desk on the House floor, is a Native woman with braids covering her bare chest. There also exists a similar painting of non-tribal women in another location at the Capitol and neither would likely be chosen today to portray the women of South Dakota.It was very clear to me that this place wasn’t built with me in mind. As a woman in the United States during the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, I would not have been able to vote until the passing of the 19th amendment. As a Native American, I would not have been considered a United States Citizen until 1924. So as a society, we continue to grow and change as needed.In America, when we know better, we do better.Senate Bill 789 does just that. It represents the acknowledgement of a past that created hardship and even devastation for indigenous people in the United States.As a historian, when I relay the history of Native Nations it corresponds directly with Federal Indian Policies such as the Indian Removal Act. My Dakota tribe was removed from the state of Minnesota in 1863 after the Dakota War where Governor Ramsey called for the extermination of the Dakota.From that era of Genocide, we moved into a period known as Assimilation. It is from this era that some of the laws identified in the proposed legislation come from. The era of boarding schools where many Dakota children were forcibly removed from homes and families to be placed in schools as far away as Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The impacts of this policy are still found within our families today.In 1889, one Indian Commissioner numbered several ways in which assimilation would be carried out. Things that separated children from communities and outlawed such things like traditional languages and spirituality. The last paragraph stated that “the autonomy of the individual will be enforced above all”, meaning that a person is stripped bare of all the things that identify them as a Native American or Indian person.When these children returned home, they often were disconnected from their people and families. As one elder once told me, “I knew I did not belong with my people or with white people, I did not belong anywhere,” OR “how do you show love or connection when you’ve never experienced it?” AND “this affected my every relationship from marriage to parent.”These are the same policies that resulted in a loss of spirituality or prayer. Due to the consequences of these antiquated and overtly racist laws against Native Americans, that are still on the federal books today mind you, you can imagine how much Native people have had to overcome in order to be here today.We can’t change the past, but we can recognize that today we as a nation know better, and can do better. With these things in mind, I ask you to please vote in support Senate Bill 789 and let’s get this legislation to the President’s desk. Thank you.”###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-cruz-and-colleagues-oppose-bidens-doj-expanding-firearm-definitions-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and 20 colleagues have introduced a Congressional Review Act Joint Resolution of Disapproval (CRA) to prohibit President Biden’s Department of Justice from implementing a new rule to expand firearm definitions.The Biden administration wants to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms, meaning they would not be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer having to undergo a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain records permanently. The current rule, which the Biden administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  “This particular proposal uses no common sense whatsoever,” said Rounds. “Our Constitution says, ‘the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.’ Unfortunately, the Biden administration continues to play by the D.C. Democrat playbook of gun control. As a supporter of the Second Amendment, I oppose any efforts to restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners.”“For the past two years, we’ve seen crime rates skyrocket all across the country, aided by Democrats’ soft-on crime policies and left-wing district attorneys operating like progressive activists instead of law enforcement officers,” said Cruz. “Democrats would love nothing more than to shift the blame and stoke anti-gun sentiment, and create a permanent national gun registry in the process. By introducing this resolution, we’re pushing back—we want to stop the Biden administration from issuing the final rule expanding the definition of firearms and instituting a national gun registry, we want to stop the false narrative that links the rise in crime to ‘ghost guns’ and firearms, and we want to protect law-abiding citizens who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.”Senators joining Rounds and Cruz are James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Risch (R-Idaho), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Tom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Click HERE to read the resolution.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-bill-protecting-veterans-unanimously-passes-senate,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds’ (R-S.D.) legislation to reduce the cost burden faced by veterans for emergency care received outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs has unanimously passed the Senate.The Veterans’ Emergency Care Claims Parity Act would prevent veterans from being held liable for payment of medical bills due to errors by the VA or by non-VA health care providers in submitting emergency care claims. The measure would also legislate a 180-day deadline from the date of treatment for non-VA health care providers to submit emergency care claims for care given to eligible veterans. Under current regulation, the VA has a 90-day deadline for these claims.“Our veterans risked their lives to protect our country and have earned the best care possible,” said Rounds. “Right now, veterans are facing expensive emergency care bills either because their provider failed to submit a claim on time under the VA’s current regulation or because the claim was mishandled by the VA. This legislation would give providers more time to submit veterans’ claims and would protect our veterans from having to pick up the tab for thousands of dollars in emergency care bills through no fault of their own.”Click HERE for full bill text.###"

This bill will prohibit the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) from entering into a conservation easement with a term of more than 50 years. It will also give owners of existing easements the option to renegotiate, renew or buy out the easement.“The Landowner Easement Rights Act protects the private property rights of South Dakotans,” said Rounds. “By ending the practice of permanent, non-transparent easements, this bill will make certain the power is with our farmers, ranchers and other landowners across the state, not federal bureaucrats.”“For far too long farmers and landowners have been subject to the heavy-handed and punitive enforcement of conservation easements managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service,” said Cramer. “Too often, these bureaucrats have overstepped the legal bounds of their contracts and turned a blind eye to the appeals of North Dakotans. Our bill acknowledges private property owners’ grievances and provides them the opportunity to make decisions on the land they live and work on.” “Following our efforts to provide regulatory relief for landowners under the FWS easement process, this legislation would help further reduce the burden that long-term easements have on our producers,” said Hoeven. “By limiting easements to 50 years and giving landowners the ability to renegotiate or buy out existing easements that have existed beyond that timeframe, our bill provides greater flexibility and empowers farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to make the best use of their property.”In March, U.S. Congressman Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) and Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.You can read the full bill HERE.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-johnson-introduce-travelers-gun-rights-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced the Traveler’s Gun Rights Act. This bill would update federal law to account for various residency-related issues facing full-time Recreational Vehicle (RV) travelers, individuals with multiple physical residences, active duty military personnel and military spouses. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.).“The Traveler’s Gun Rights Act removes an unfair prohibition facing Americans with unique living situations,” said Rounds. “This legislation will make certain that law-abiding citizens do not face a burdensome roadblock when trying to exercise their Second Amendment rights.”“An address is an address – individuals who rely on a P.O. Box as their primary mailing address shouldn’t have their right to possess a firearm compromised,” said Johnson. “Our bill fixes that problem.”Currently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires firearm buyers to fill out paperwork listing an address. However, the ATF prohibits buyers from listing a P.O. Box or Private Mailbox (PMB) on this form. This prohibition unfairly hurts full-time travelers, many of whom live in their RV year round and utilize a P.O. Box or PMB in order to receive mail. These alternate addresses are able to be listed on driver’s licenses, but they cannot be used on the ATF paperwork.Rounds led a group of 17 senators in introducing this bill, including Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Thune (R-S.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). Additionally, Johnson’s companion legislation is cosponsored by 28 Members of Congress, including Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), Greg Steube (R-Fla.), William Timmons (R-S.C.), Randy Weber (R-Texas), Pete Sessions (R-Texas), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Jake LaTurner (R-Kan.), Brian Babin (R-Texas), Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), Ben Cline (R-Va.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Chris Stewart (R-Utah), Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), August Pfluger (R-Texas), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Roger Williams (R-Texas), Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Thomas Tiffany (R-Wis.) and Austin Scott (R-Ga.).You can read the full bill HERE.###"

We request that when you receive the final recommendations from the AIR Commission you consult our offices on a state-by-state basis for our feedback before you decide to approve or deny them.”The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) released its preliminary recommendations for the AIR commission to consider on Monday, March 14, which would significantly alter services provided to rural Veterans across the United States. On March 15, Rounds and Manchin led a bipartisan letter urging President Biden to make certain rural perspectives were taken into consideration by the AIR Commission.“For many elderly Veterans, VA facilities are the only place they seek care. The reasons Veterans often cite are that they are better understood, respected, and cared for at their local VA Medical Center (VAMC). VA facilities often serve as the crux for elderly Veterans’ community…Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return.

They build networks of friends and VA staff that serve as support groups and keep them connected with their service. In an increasingly digital world, we cannot discount the importance of the human interaction and connection our Veterans find at VA facilities, particularly with in-person services.We have been disappointed and concerned by the VA’s lack of assessment of qualitative data and how its recommendations will specifically impact elderly Veterans. Receiving feedback from Congress, local VA staff, and most importantly local Veteran communities must be a crucial step in your assessment of the AIR Commission’s final recommendations.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-calls-on-va-secretary-to-address-failure-at-sioux-falls-va,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) sent a letter to Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough this week expressing his concerns with the failure in leadership at the Sioux Falls VA (SFVA) and the Veterans Integrated Services Network 23 (VISN 23). The letter follows up on a recent meeting between Rounds and McDonough, where they discussed ongoing issues at the SFVA. Specifically, Rounds made McDonough aware that whistleblowers who have contacted his congressional office with concerns of a hostile work environment have alleged retaliation by their superiors. This type of behavior would violate federal law. In the letter, Rounds calls for McDonough to appropriately address these concerns which ultimately result in diminished patient care.You can read the letter HERE and below.  +++The Honorable Denis McDonoughSecretaryDepartment of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20420Dear Secretary McDonough:I’d like to follow up with you on the meeting that took place in my office on March 21, 2022. As I expressed during our discussion, I am deeply concerned with the failure of leadership at the Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs Health Care System (SFVA) and the Veterans Integrated Services Network 23 (VISN 23). This failure is causing employees’ rights to be violated and quality patient care to suffer. Our veterans have earned and deserve the best health care our country can provide. The SFVA was once known as the “Gem of the Prairie” for the first-class health care it provided to our veterans, but unfortunately those days have disappeared. Veterans now wait days to schedule an appointment and months to see a doctor. According to whistleblowers who have contacted my office, the SFVA medical center is a hostile work environment, where employees are mistreated and veteran care is not a priority.Quality patient care is at risk because of these leadership issues. Over the past two years, the SFVA Care in the Community (CITC) office has experienced severe turnover, and my staff has recorded that at least 46 employees have left, with more than a dozen departures in just the last several months. This has caused a negative impact on veterans who rely on this office to schedule appointments with community care providers. Furthermore, my office has seen evidence of poor communication from CITC schedulers to veterans, provider faxes being lost and weeks-long gaps between VA provider referrals and appointments in the community. Veterans and SFVA employees are desperate for change.In response, I raised these concerns personally with the VISN 23 Director, Robert McDivitt. Mr. McDivitt stated he took these allegations seriously, would conduct an internal investigation and turn over complaints to the VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).According to the whistleblowers who contacted my office, they have faced retaliation by their superiors for coming to my office with concerns about the workplace. They have also been accused of possible Hatch Act violations by speaking to their Member of Congress about these concerns. Petitioning Congress is a protected First Amendment Activity that should be taken seriously. If my constituents don’t feel safe in sharing their concerns with me, how can they be expected to trust in the branch of government that is there to represent them? This type of behavior undermines constituent service and violates the Whistleblower Protection Act as well as other federal statutes. Specifically federal law grants civil service employees the right to petition their Member of Congress, stating: “The right of employees, individually or collectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied.” 5 USC 7211. Federal employees have the right to express their concerns to Congress without being accused of violating the Hatch Act. You must make certain the VA training materials properly educate employees and supervisors about how whistleblower complaints are distinct from violations of the Hatch Act. My office has attempted to provide the VA at the VISN 23 level the opportunity to address these issues. Unfortunately the problems persist, and in many cases, have deteriorated. Mr. Secretary, I have lost faith in the VA’s ability to reconcile these issues. Employee rights must be protected in the workplace and veteran care cannot suffer as a result of poor leadership. The men and women who have served our country, and the VA employees charged with supporting them, should not have to endure what’s happened at the SFVA. The poor leadership and lack of proper care is unacceptable. Our veterans have risked their lives to protect our country, and the least we can do now is serve them through quality health care delivered in a timely fashion.I look forward to hearing from you about steps you are taking to address these issues.Sincerely,###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-delivers-opening-remarks-at-subcommittee-hearing-on-rural-transit,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development, today delivered opening remarks at a subcommittee hearing on public transportation in rural communities. Video of the remarks is available here.Rounds’ remarks, as prepared for delivery:Thank you, Madame Chair, and thank you to our witnesses for taking the time to attend today’s hearing and share your expertise.Last year, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which allocated an unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars to transit systems across the country. This law provided a 67 percent increase in annual federal funding for public transportation when compared with the annual amount provided in the previous authorization. This is not including the $69.5 billion for transit in response to COVID-19 nor the $340 million provided through the Public Transportation Relief Program. Of the $108 billion authorized and appropriated through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for public transportation, it is important to note that just $4.56 billion was allocated for the Rural Formula Program. All the while, states like New York and California are estimated to receive $11 billion and $10 billion respectively. With this investment comes a need for critical oversight to make certain that this money is spent on fixes that will make the most impact. Therefore, as we move to implement this legislation, it is important to discuss the challenges facing rural communities in offering safe, affordable and reliable methods of transportation. Rural areas cover 97% of US land area and most rural residents still rely on their own vehicles as their main means of transportation. Overall, rural residents travel about 33 percent more, rural workers travel 38 percent more and lower-income rural workers 59 percent more annual miles than those in urban areas. Rural residents spend more time and money on transportation and are more vulnerable to transportation problems like vehicle maintenance issues, they lose their ability to drive or fuel prices spike as they are now.Therefore rural roads are heavily traveled and critical for maintaining the way of life in South Dakota and the rest of rural America. The frequency of travel on some of these rural roads has further increased over the past years as tourism has become a growing business in the rural U.S. Most of the country's national parks are located in rural regions, like Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, which draws a large number of visitors each year. In addition, with agriculture dominating most rural communities, much of the nation's food industry relies on the transportation of products over long distances on rural roads and highways. The safety and structural integrity of these roads is important to maintain an interconnected transportation system.With few communities in South Dakota having an actual fixed-route bus system, a majority of rural transit offerings are modes of paratransit which provide transportation for the elderly and/or persons with disabilities. Roughly 31% of the populations in rural communities are either elderly or disabled and these two demographics within a community often need transportation services for doctor’s appointments or to complete grocery shopping.Due to the need to travel long distances, driver shortages and lower ridership, providing on-demand rides in rural areas can be extremely expensive. As we implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I think we should explore ways to utilize public-private partnerships to make local, state and federal dollars go further. We should also be looking at new ways to use technology.  For instance, in in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the Sioux Area Metro, known as SAM, is trying out a “SAM on-demand” phone app – which allows riders to request rides on their smartphones to increase ridership and efficiency.During implementation of the infrastructure law, it is also critical to reduce the regulatory burden as much as possible for the truly small communities around the country. In South Dakota, our rural transit agencies servicing small towns do not have the capacity to wade through endless red tape. Rural communities must have the freedom to use the funding in ways that serve them, not be forced into a one-size-fits-all approach.To manage these issues, resources must be allocated to the most vital areas of the transport system and I think our subcommittee should remain focused on the oversight of those resources. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and learning more about ways rural America can best utilize the resources from the infrastructure law.###"

As part of my deliberation on this nominee, I reviewed her record of judicial decisions and met cordially with Judge Jackson in my office. I believe her judicial approach would promote legislating from the bench, rather than applying the law as written. Based on her written decisions and my personal conversations with her, I will not support her nomination.”"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-submits-comment-on-product-of-usa-label,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) responded to a solicitation for comments from the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regarding the “Product of USA” label in the Federal Register. FSIS is currently seeking feedback to determine the value consumers place on the “Product of USA” label. Full text of this comment can be found below. Interested parties can submit their comments on this petition here. “While I am pleased that the USDA is undertaking a review to strengthen the “Product of USA” label, I am concerned that the department is not acting quickly enough to adopt new standards for this label,” Rounds said. “Consumers deserve to know where their food is coming from. When South Dakota families purchase beef labeled “Product of USA,” they should know with certainty that it is coming from one of our top-quality domestic producers. The solution to this problem is simple – only beef born, raised and slaughtered in the United States should receive the “Product of USA” label. This issue must be resolved for the sake of consumers and our hardworking producers. I urge you to take action to update the “Product of USA” label as quickly as possible.”Full text of his comment:I write today regarding the Notice of Request for a New Information Collection published in the Federal Register by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) on February 1, 2022, entitled “Analyzing Consumers' Value of ‘Product of USA’ Labeling Claims” (Docket No. FSIS-2021-0031). Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on an issue of critical importance to both consumers and producers.While I am pleased that the USDA is undertaking a review to strengthen the “Product of USA” label, I am concerned that the department is not acting quickly enough to adopt new standards for this label. In particular, I fail to see the need to develop a consumer survey, and to request comment on the methodology of this survey, to confirm what even the White House has acknowledged:  a new label is necessary so “consumers can better understand where their meat comes from.”[1]Our farm and ranch families work hard to deliver the safest, highest-quality and most affordable food products in the world. American consumers recognize this, and are demanding to know where their food is coming from. For far too long, South Dakota producers have been exploited as their high-quality, American-raised beef has lost value as it is mixed with foreign products that are raised and processed under different, and often subpar, standards. This attempt to intentionally deceive consumers in regard to a beef product’s rearing and country of origin is wrong.Additionally, the survey proposed by the USDA and for which comments are being requested is unnecessary since it is clear that consumers value knowing the source of their meat. As noted, even the White House has acknowledged the need to provide consumers greater information about the meat they buy.  As a result, this survey, and the current request for comment on the methodology for this survey, should be scrapped in favor of a more direct rulemaking that accomplishes the simple goal of achieving fair and accurate truth in labeling standards for beef products that enter the U.S. market.   FSIS notes it is seeking information on the following questions, the answers to which are either already known or are unknowable until greater information is provided. Yes, it is clear that consumers notice the “Product of USA” labeling claim, or producers would not utilize this voluntary label. Consumers want to know the true source of their food. It is long overdue to fix the “Product of USA” label to restore transparency and fairness for consumers in the marketplace.Consumers often do not fully understand the current “Product of USA” definition and deserve greater transparency when making purchasing decisions. South Dakotans frequently contact my office expressing frustration with the gaping loophole that is allowed under the current standard for a product to bear the “Product of USA” label. The most accurate way to describe “Product of USA” would be to allow its use only if the product is born, raised and slaughtered in the United States. The USDA’s allowance for foreign beef to continue to use a “Product of USA” label simply because it is processed in the U.S. defies logic, and I urge the USDA to use this opportunity to make a meaningful change for American consumers and producers alike.We will not know for sure until we have greater transparency and proper labeling standards in place. The value in more comprehensive beef labeling stems from the consumer’s ability to understand the origin of the product, the culture and practices associated with raising the animal and the ultimate quality and safety of the final meat product. Consumers spending their hard earned money in the grocery store deserve to have accurate labeling that allows them to make the most informed purchasing decisions possible for themselves and their families.Consumers deserve to know where their food is coming from. When South Dakota families purchase beef labeled “Product of USA,” they should know with certainty that it is coming from one of our top-quality domestic producers. Unfortunately, without clear parameters, the current “Product of USA” label is misleading and can result in imported beef being labeled as though it is of U.S. origin. The solution to this problem is simple - only beef born, raised and slaughtered in the United States should receive the “Product of USA” label. This issue must be resolved for the sake of consumers and our hardworking producers. I urge you to take action to update the “Product of USA” label as quickly as possible.###[1] FACT SHEET: The Biden-Harris Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain, January 3, 2022."

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-introduces-legislation-to-increase-capital-investment-opportunities,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, introduced the Increasing Opportunities for Retail Investors Act. This legislation would increase both access to capital for new companies and opportunities for retail investors.“Companies need a way to raise capital without the regulatory burden of a traditional Initial Public Offering,” said Rounds. “Additionally, individuals, not just investment firms, need more opportunities to invest. By giving the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to raise the statutory exemption thresholds, like those governing offering size, more opportunities will be created for new businesses and everyday investors.”The Increasing Opportunities for Retail Investors Act would authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to increase any statutory exemption ceiling to reduce regulatory burdens, such as those governing offering size, if the SEC deems appropriate. This would make it easier for the SEC to open up more capital to new companies and allow retail investors more access to new opportunities.You can read the full bill HERE."
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-reintroduces-legislation-to-increase-access-to-capital-for-startups,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, reintroduced the Developing and Empowering our Aspiring Leaders (DEAL) Act this week. This legislation would work to increase capital for small businesses by encouraging more investment by venture capital firms. The DEAL Act is supported by both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).“South Dakota entrepreneurs and startups need access to capital to grow,” said Rounds. “Small businesses are the foundation of our communities. They create local jobs and support their neighbors. The DEAL Act would encourage more investment by venture capital firms into new businesses, further fueling growth in our communities.”“As Americans work to recover from the pandemic, the economy needs every resource available to grow businesses and create jobs,” said Tom Quaadman, Executive Vice President of the U.S. Chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. “Emerging Growth Companies are an important part of that equation as they represent the future of opportunity in our capital markets, which is why the U.S. Chamber applauds Senator Rounds for introducing the DEAL Act. This important piece of legislation will allow more investment in bright new ideas and future public companies that will power the next generation of American economic success.”“This bill will support the next generation of high growth American companies and expand entrepreneurial activity into more regions of the country,” said Bobby Franklin, NVCA President and CEO. “U.S. startups are this country’s jobs and innovation engine, and improving their chances of success will generate economic opportunity and support America’s technological leadership in the world.”The DEAL Act would remove current regulatory burdens by directing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exempt certain investments by venture capital funds from SEC registration requirements. Specifically, the bill allows investments acquired through secondary transactions to be considered as qualifying investments for venture capital funds. This fix was originally suggested by SEC’s nonpartisan Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee.Senator Rounds first introduced the DEAL Act on October 11, 2018 in the 115th Congress. Representative Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) is the House sponsor of this legislation which was reintroduced on June 29, 2021.You can read the full bill HERE.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-kaine-boozman-and-hassan-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-boost-hiring-of-military-spouses,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) introduced the Military Spouse Hiring Act, legislation which would amend the tax code to incentivize businesses to hire military spouses. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.-19).“Our service members and their families are willing to sacrifice so much for our country,” said Rounds. “One of these sacrifices includes moving from one assignment to the next, which can make it difficult for military spouses to secure a job and for employers to hire them. We owe it to our service members and their families to remove obstacles hindering their financial well-being. Expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to include military spouses will help remove one barrier, giving our military families the opportunities they deserve.”“Congress has a responsibility to take care of our service members, veterans, and their families,” said Kaine. “That means helping America’s talented military spouses, who consistently make enormous sacrifices for our safety and security, access a wide range of work opportunities. Expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit is a commonsense step to help make that happen.”“Military spouses make countless sacrifices as they support their husbands and wives, and our nation’s defense,” said Boozman. “We can help reduce the burdens they face in the process of finding gainful employment by expanding this tax credit so businesses have an extra incentive to hire these unsung heroes.”“Military families make immeasurable sacrifices for our country as their loved ones work to keep us safe, secure, and free,” said Hassan. “Unfortunately, the unique set of challenges that military spouses face, from relocation to child care, makes it harder for many to find a job. This bipartisan legislation will work to strengthen employment opportunities for military spouses and support our military families. I look forward to working across the aisle to move this commonsense bill forward.”Military spouses consistently experience unemployment rates substantially higher than the national rate, and two-thirds of employed active duty military spouses report underemployment. Frequent moves often stall military spouses’ upward career progression and force them to find new jobs.This legislation would address the issue by expanding the Work Opportunity Tax Credit program—which incentivizes employers to hire individuals who experience unique employment barriers—to include military spouses.The Military Spouse Hiring Act is supported by: Air Force Association (AFA), Air Force Sergeants Association (AFSA), Association of the United States Army (AUSA), Commissioned Officers Association of the US Public Health Service (COA), Chief Warrant Officers Association of the US Coast Guard (CWOA), Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), Fleet Reserve Association (FRA), Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America (JWV), Marine Corps League (MCL), Marine Corps Reserve Association (MCRA), Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America (MCA), Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH), National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), National Military Family Association (NMFA), National Restaurant Association, Non Commissioned Officers Association (NCOA), Reserve Organization of America (ROA), Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN), The Enlisted Association (TREA), Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), United States Army Warrant Officers Association (USA WOA), USCG Chief Petty Officers Association (CPOA), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), VetsFirst, Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) and Work Opportunity Tax Credit Coalition.“The military spouse unemployment rate has remained too high for too long. When military spouses can’t find work, it’s a problem for their family’s financial stability and wellbeing,” said Besa Pinchotti, Executive Director and CEO of the National Military Family Association. “The Military Spouse Hiring Act will encourage more employers to hire military spouses, investing in our military spouses, our military families, and our military as a whole.""“Military spouses make tremendous sacrifices for our country yet continue to face significant burdens when it comes to employment opportunities. The continued high rate of unemployment and under employment among military spouses not only impacts the financial stability of military families, but also hurts military retention. More than a third of military families cite spouse employment challenges as a reason for leaving active duty,” said MOAA president and CEO Lt. Gen. Dana T. Atkins, USAF (Ret). “We appreciate Sens. Kaine, Boozman, Hassan, and Rounds’ efforts to incentivize the hiring of military spouses which will benefit this great community, the local economy, and employers alike.”Full text of the legislation is available HERE. ###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-hagerty-and-senate-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-take-action-to-lower-record-high-fertilizer-prices-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) and 17 Senate colleagues are raising their concern to President Joe Biden regarding record increases in fertilizer prices approaching the spring planting season.As ongoing supply-chain bottlenecks and the rising cost of energy, among other factors, send fertilizer prices soaring, and with the potential of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to create additional disruptions, the senators are urging the Biden administration to immediately take all necessary steps to curtail the rising costs impacting American farmers and consumers.“We are writing to express my serious concern regarding record-high fertilizer prices impacting American farmers going into the spring planting season. Fertilizer is a primary input and major expense for producers across the country, and price increases will have a significant effect on farm profitability and the prices of food and consumer products,” the senators wrote.“Considering Russia’s role as a key producer of fertilizer and necessary inputs of fertilizer, its invasion of Ukraine and sanctions imposed on the country are likely to cause shortages and price increases of fertilizer. These potential disruptions, coupled with skyrocketing energy prices precipitated by President Biden’s war on the American oil and gas industry, will harm American farmers and in turn, American consumers.”“We are therefore urging your administration to review all available options to lower the cost of fertilizer, including but not limited to: eliminating the cross-border vaccine mandate for transporters of essential commerce; engaging stakeholders to prevent a Canadian Pacific Railway strike; ensuring agricultural minerals like phosphate and potash are part of the Department of the Interior’s List of Critical Minerals; increasing U.S. gas production; and approving pending export permits at the Department of Energy for Liquefied Natural Gas,” the senators concluded.You can read the letter HERE and below.+++Dear Mr. President:We are writing to express our serious concern regarding record-high fertilizer prices impacting American farmers going into the spring planting season. Fertilizer is a primary input and major expense for producers across the country, and price increases will have a significant effect on farm profitability and the prices of food and consumer products.Since January 2021, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agricultural Marketing Services, the prices of key fertilizer sources have substantially increased as follows: anhydrous ammonia (by 203%); Urea (by 141%); liquid nitrogen (162%); monoammonium phosphate (MAP) (by 74%); potash (by 125%); and farm diesel (by 95%).Ongoing supply-chain bottlenecks and the rising cost of energy are among the factors sending fertilizer prices soaring, and disruptions stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will only compound the problem. As a result, Americans will pay more at restaurants, grocery stores, and other places.We are therefore urging your administration to review all available options to lower the cost of fertilizer, including but not limited to: eliminating the cross-border vaccine mandate for transporters of essential commerce; engaging stakeholders to prevent a Canadian Pacific Railway strike; urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use its existing authorities under the food supply chain and pandemic response resources to provide support for farmers facing financial difficulties ensuring agricultural minerals like phosphate and potash are part of the Department of the Interior’s List of Critical Minerals; increasing U.S. gas production; and approving pending export permits at the Department of Energy for Liquefied Natural Gas.Quickly undertaking such measures is the most immediate—and perhaps only—near-term opportunity to partially remedy the high costs of fertilizer impacting American farmers and ultimately American consumers.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-rounds-to-president-biden-absence-of-rural-representation-on-va-air-commission-is-concerning,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), members of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC), are leading the effort to make certain rural perspectives are taken into consideration by the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission. In a letter to President Biden, the Senators expressed their concerns that all those who have been nominated to serve on the AIR Commission are from heavily populated urban areas. Additionally, the Senators request that the AIR Commission take into consideration metrics that demonstrate the impact on Veterans in rural communities.The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) released its preliminary recommendations for the AIR commission to consider on Monday, March 14, which would significantly alter services provided to rural veterans across the United States. In 2019, Senators Rounds and Manchin introduced legislation which would have eliminated the AIR Commission.“Rural communities have historically suffered the most from initiatives such as the AIR Commission. We are concerned that history will repeat itself,” began the lawmakers. “The last time there was a similar asset review, the CARES Commission in the early 2000s recommended closing or moving critical medical services in a number of states including West Virginia, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Oklahoma, Washington, and Iowa. With the VA’s expressed purpose on expanding private care through the MISSION Act, we must prevent the closing of existing facilities or relocation of services in areas that have no viable alternative.”“Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return. That’s the promise we made to these brave men and women when they took their oath to serve, and that’s the promise we intend to keep,” said the lawmakers.Background on the AIR Commission:The full letter is available below or here.Dear President Biden:We write to you today with regard to your role in considering the recommendations to be made by the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission, as prescribed in Subtitle A of Title II of the VA MISSION Act. Specifically, we request that at least one of the nine commissioners appointed have a background working in or for rural health care systems. We also request you not act on recommendations from the Commission until verifying that they will not disadvantage rural communities with limited access to healthcare options.Rural communities have historically suffered the most from initiatives such as the AIR Commission. We are concerned that history will repeat itself. The last time there was a similar asset review, the CARES Commission in the early 2000s recommended closing or moving critical medical services in a number of states including West Virginia, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Oklahoma, Washington, and Iowa. With the VA’s expressed purpose on expanding private care through the MISSION Act, we must prevent the closing of existing facilities or relocation of services in areas that have no viable alternative.Currently, there is no requirement for any of the nine-member AIR Commission appointees to have experience with rural health care systems. Additionally, none of the current nominees have any significant experience in rural health. A lack of representation for the over two million rural Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare places them at an acute disadvantage during the AIR process. With six established requirements for appointees, there are three remaining spots that we request be filled with at least one rural health expert.Rural communities are home to a greater percentage of older Americans, with 17.5% of the rural population being 65 years and older, compared to 13.8% in urban areas. Rural communities also have higher rates of chronic illnesses. In addition to these challenges, health care staffing challenges in rural communities are particularly severe. Ensuring veterans in rural communities have access to care is vital.In order to mitigate the risks to rural veterans and healthcare providers, the AIR Commission must consider the implications of moving or closing services at any rural VA facility. To do so, we request that you not implement any recommendation that hasn’t been vetted by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Rural Health Council within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Third party verification will make certain that no substantial burden is placed on rural communities. Additionally, any recommendations should utilize the Health Professional Shortage Area metric, which is maintained by HRSA, and the Medically Underserved Area/Population metric to demonstrate that moving or closing VA health services will not result in making it more difficult for veterans or the general public to access healthcare.COVID-19 highlighted that neither the VA nor other government agencies can always predict the health trends that will impact veterans and the care they need. As our Vietnam and post-9/11 veterans age and experience illness related to military service, the VA must proactively anticipate their needs as well as the burdens that future conflicts may place on the existing healthcare system. We encourage the AIR Commission to adopt our bipartisan, commonsense proposals that will ensure we do not close critical VA facilities today that leave our veterans, their friends, their families, and their communities underserved and unprepared for tomorrow.Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return. That’s the promise we made to these brave men and women when they took their oath to serve, and that’s the promise we intend to keep.  ###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-thune-and-johnson-fight-to-keep-va-medical-facilities-open-despite-biden-administrations-plans-to-close-or-downsize,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) and U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) today expressed their frustration and concern with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission to close or downsize several VA health care facilities in South Dakota.“The VA’s recommendations to the AIR Commission should seek to expand and improve access to health care. Instead, the VA has issued proposals that would reduce access to health care and impose serious hardships on rural and tribal veterans,” the delegation wrote. “Removing services from the Hot Springs and Fort Meade facilities, and consolidating health care services in Rapid City and Sioux Falls, would substantially reduce high-quality care options for those veterans who have benefited from access to rural VA services in South Dakota.” The delegation also issued statements after the Biden administration notified the VA facilities in Hot Springs, Fort Meade, and Wagner that its proposed recommendations, which are part of a multi-year nationwide review of VA health care infrastructure, include plans for them to close or be downsized. The delegation’s decade-long fight to save the Hot Springs VA culminated in October 2020 when then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie notified them that the VA had formally rescinded its earlier record of decision to realign the VA Black Hills Health Care System, which would have significantly reduced services at the Hot Springs VA Medical Center.You can read the letter HERE and below.+++The Honorable Denis McDonoughSecretaryU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420Dear Secretary McDonough: We write concerning the adverse impact that the March 14, 2022, Veterans Affairs’ (VA) recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission would have on the VA Black Hills and VA Sioux Falls Health Care Systems. The AIR recommendations call for a realignment of the VA Black Hills Health Care System, transitioning the full-service VA hospitals in Hot Springs and Fort Meade into community-based outpatient clinics, and relocating many of those services to a new VA medical center in Rapid City. The VA medical center in Sioux Falls would lose its inpatient medical and surgical services, and the outpatient services site in Wagner would close.The VA’s recommendations to the AIR Commission should seek to expand and improve access to health care. Instead, the VA has issued proposals that would reduce access to health care and impose serious hardships on rural and tribal veterans. Removing services from the Hot Springs and Fort Meade facilities, and consolidating health care services in Rapid City and Sioux Falls, would substantially reduce high-quality care options for those veterans who have benefited from access to rural VA services in South Dakota. While vital to rural South Dakota communities, the Hot Springs and Fort Meade VA hospitals serve more than just South Dakota. Our neighbors in Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota have benefitted from the high-quality care and unique healing environment in these VA hospitals for years. Removing services from Hot Springs and Fort Meade would put accessible care out of reach for many veterans, regardless of whether a new VA medical center is established in Rapid City. Just two years ago, then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the Hot Springs VA would remain open and increase services to veterans, rescinding a 2017 record of decision to close the facility. You can imagine our surprise following the release of the AIR report to find that the VA is now recommending services be reduced at the Hot Springs VA. One of the reasons why the VA rescinded the earlier decision to close the Hot Springs VA is due to the first-class rehabilitation programs for veterans, including the residential rehabilitation treatment program that provides work therapy programs and recreational and retreat opportunities for veterans receiving treatment for PTSD and substance abuse. Abandoning these services would be a total reversal of the VA’s previous commitment.For nearly a decade, we fought tooth and nail to defend the Hot Springs VA and the surrounding communities. We stood side-by-side with veterans, health care professionals, and community leaders as we made our case to previous administrations about the significant benefits that these facilities provide to veterans throughout the multi-state area they serve. We can assure you that we will continue that fight to defend them and make our case to the AIR Commission that the VA’s misguided recommendations to close and downsize several VA facilities in South Dakota are a mistake and should not be implemented. Thank you for your continued attention to this important matter. Sincerely,###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-and-republican-colleagues-tell-president-biden-an-iran-agreement-without-broad-congressional-support-will-not-survive,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined 48 Republican senators today declaring they will not support the revived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, which, according to public reports, will weaken sanctions and lessen restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program.“According to press reports, the Biden Administration may soon conclude an agreement with Iran to provide substantial sanctions relief in exchange for merely short-term limitations on Iran’s nuclear program. “By every indication, the Biden Administration appears to have given away the store. The administration appears to have agreed to lift sanctions that were not even placed on Iran for its nuclear activities in the first place, but instead because of its ongoing support for terrorism and its gross abuses of human rights. The nuclear limitations in this new deal appear to be significantly less restrictive than the 2015 nuclear deal, which was itself too weak, and will sharply undermine U.S. leverage to secure an actually ‘longer and stronger’ deal. What is more, the deal appears likely to deepen Iran’s financial and security relationship with Moscow and Beijing, including through arms sales.“The administration has thus far refused to commit to submit a new Iran deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty, as per its constitutional obligation, or for review under statutory requirements that passed on a bipartisan basis in response to the 2015 deal. Additionally, despite earlier promises to the contrary, the administration has failed to adequately consult with Congress.“Republicans have made it clear: We would be willing and eager to support an Iran policy that completely blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear weapons capability, constrains Iran’s ballistic missile program, and confronts Iran’s support for terrorism. But if the administration agrees to a deal that fails to achieve these objectives or makes achieving them more difficult, Republicans will do everything in our power to reverse it. Unless Iran ceases its support for terrorism, we will oppose removing and seek to reimpose any terrorism-related sanctions. And we will force the Senate to vote on any Administration effort to do so.“We strongly urge the administration, our Democrat colleagues, and the international community to learn the lessons of the very recent past. A major agreement that does not have strong bipartisan support in Congress will not survive.”Rounds was joined on the statement by Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).###"

The letter references past Russian cyber operations –such the SolarWinds attack – as evidence of their history of engaging in malicious cyber activities that target the United States. In addition to Rounds and Rosen, the bipartisan letter was signed by Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Capito (R-W.Va.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Angus King (I-Maine), Joseph Manchin (D-W.Va.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “The Russian government often engages in malicious cyber activities, including espionage, intellectual property theft, disinformation, propaganda, and cyberattacks, that target the United States. In response, the United States government has imposed sanctions on Russian security personnel and agents for various cyberattacks, including the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign, and for acts of disinformation and interference, including Russian government-directed attempts to influence U.S. elections,” wrote the senators.“Given Russia’s history of disruptive cyber and disinformation activities, we are concerned that the United States may be targeted in retaliation for actions taken to impose costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine,” the senators’ letter continued. “As we stand with the Ukrainian people, impose crushing sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime, and push for additional security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself, we also must work to secure the homeland from retaliatory cyber activities.”You can read the letter HERE.###"

The VA MISSION Act also included provisions to include this BRAC-style process, which we learned today will negatively impact much of rural SD. The VA MISSION Act was bad public policy then and it’s gotten no better with age. While the provisions of this BRAC will not be released publicly until March 14th – the threat has become clear to our local veterans. As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I’ll fight like hell to make sure veterans in South Dakota receive the care they’ve earned. I call upon all veterans organizations to help us defend these services in rural South Dakota.”“For nearly a decade, I’ve fought tooth and nail to defend the Hot Springs VA and the surrounding communities,” said Thune. “I’ve stood side by side with veterans, health care professionals, and community leaders as we made our case to previous administrations about the significant benefits these facilities provide to America’s veterans throughout the multi-state area they serve. That’s why I’m extremely disappointed by the Biden administration’s proposal to close these facilities. I’m frustrated, and I’m angry, and I know these communities are too. Let me put this as plainly as I can: The VA is wrong, period. This is a massive mistake, and I will do everything within my power to show the administration, by working with the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission, why it would be in everyone’s best interest, especially South Dakota’s veterans’, to immediately change course.”“Nearly two years ago to the day, former VA Secretary Robert Wilkie came to the Hot Springs VA and announced that the VA would remain open and there would be no reduction in services for veterans,” said Johnson. “In South Dakota, promises mean something. This is a betrayal to the Hot Springs community and its veterans. If the commission is going to move forward with reducing services, they should face the people of Hot Springs, Wagner, Fort Meade, and Sioux Falls and explain why they believe these services should be scaled back. We’ve worked together to fight harmful VA decisions in the past, and we are ready do so again.”BACKGROUND:The delegation’s decade-long fight to save the Hot Springs VA culminated in October 2020 when then-VA Secretary Robert Wilkie notified them that the VA had formally rescinded its earlier record of decision to realign the VA Black Hills Health Care System, which would have significantly reduced services at the Hot Springs VA medical center. ###"

Rounds nominated Luke Jegeris of Rapid City as his principal nominee to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point; Aiden Kasten of Brandon as his principal nominee to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis; and John Costello of Sioux Falls as his principal nominee to the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs.“It’s a privilege to nominate our nation’s future military leaders to U.S. service academies,” said Rounds. “The U.S. service academies are among the most elite educational institutions in the world. After receiving a top-notch education, these South Dakotans will courageously serve our country as active-duty military members. We’re proud of Luke, Aiden and John for their desire to answer the call of duty to serve our nation.”“I am blessed to be receiving a principal nomination to the United States Military Academy from Senator Mike Rounds,” said Luke Jegeris. “It has always been my dream to have an occupation where I am in a position to serve others. Serving in the Army will grant me this opportunity, and will allow me to be part of a team that strives for perfection.”""Receiving a nomination from Senator Rounds is a great honor to me and my family,” said Aiden Kasten. “My grandfather served our country during Vietnam and inspired me to pursue a military career path. Going to the United States Naval Academy and becoming a commissioned officer would truly make my country and grandpa proud.""“To me, serving in the armed forces is about contributing to a higher purpose in life,” said John Costello. “Defending our country through service in the Air Force is a part of my desire to put service before self.""Each year, Sen. Rounds nominates South Dakota students to the U.S. service academies. Each academy then gives full and fair consideration to these nominations when selecting applicants. Students interested in attending a service academy go through a rigorous application process. Because the academies are highly competitive, students must meet eligibility requirements in leadership, physical fitness, character and scholarship. The young people joining the military directly from the academies are among the highest caliber our country has to offer—a result of the challenging training and education they received at U.S. service academies. Students applying for service academies are required to receive a Congressional nomination as part of the application process. The students listed below have now fulfilled that requirement and their names have been submitted to the respective academies. Each service academy admission board will determine final appointments. Those appointed receive a scholarship and military appointment and are required to serve in the military for at least five years upon graduation. Principal nominees are guaranteed admission if they meet all of the requirements of the academy to which they are nominated.Luke Jegeris of Rapid City, S.D.—Principal Nominee, U.S. Military Academy (West Point)Luke is the son of Karl and Jill Jegeris of Rapid City, South Dakota. A senior at Stevens High School, Luke is a team captain in varsity football and catcher for Post 22 baseball. Luke is involved in Raiders Respect Club, National Honor Society and Economics Club. Luke frequently participates in volunteer service including mission trips to Tijuana, Mexico, regular snow removal at his church and holds a 4.14 GPA.Aiden Kasten of Brandon, S.D.—Principal Nominee, U.S. Naval Academy (Annapolis)Aiden is the son of Travis and Amy Kasten of Brandon, South Dakota.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-submits-comment-to-protect-integrity-of-meat-and-poultry-product-labeling-standards,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) submitted a comment to the proposed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) rulemaking that could allow terms such as “meat”, “steak” or “poultry” to be used on foods that are artificially produced. Rounds argues allowing these terms to be used on lab grown food products is confusing and misleading to consumers, and puts ranchers and farmers’ reputations and livelihoods at risk. In his comment, Rounds urged the USDA to provide transparency and accuracy in its labeling of cell cultured foods.In his comment to the USDA, Rounds writes, “Simply put, lab grown food products are not equivalent to meat and poultry products born, raised and harvested in the traditional manner. Pursuant to applicable federal laws, the FSIS should promulgate clear, accurate and fair regulations governing the labeling of these cell cultured foods so they cannot be confused with traditional meat and poultry products.”Rounds continues, “As public servants, we can never forget our solemn responsibility to assist – not harm – those that we have been called to serve. We must remember that regulatory decisions can have far reaching consequences not only for America’s farm and ranch families but for consumers and the entire economy.”Read Rounds’ comment to the USDA by clicking here.Background:Since he was elected to the Senate, Sen.

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) released the following statement after a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee (SVAC) hearing on Wednesday where he questioned VA Secretary Denis McDonough on claims the VA’s Care In The Community administrators are purposely limiting a Veteran’s ability to seek care from a local healthcare provider.“The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is changing its existing referral process by implementing the Referral Coordination Initiative (RCI). According to the VHA’s RCI guidebook, this initiative “shifts the referral responsibility from providers to Referral Coordination Teams (RCTs) which include clinical and administrative staff.” said Rounds.A recent USA Today news investigation published on November 1, 2021, shows a disturbing trend of VA administrators overruling decisions made between veterans and their providers to seek care in the community. The article states: “A review of thousands of pages of department manuals and medical records, along with interviews with dozens of patients, advocates and providers, shows that VA administrators are overruling doctors’ judgments and preventing them from sending their patients outside the VA health care system.”“I think it goes back down to dollars and cents,” said Rounds. “I have concerns that these examples are not isolated and that they could be the result of the implementation of the RCI in a way that diminishes a veteran’s ability to receive care from a local healthcare provider.”To watch the full exchange, please visit: https://youtu.be/x9P6szNOJHEIf you or a family member are being restricted by the VA from using the Care in the Community Benefit you’ve earned, please contact one of our local offices.

A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10:00am on Saturday, November 6th at Ss. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Pierre with private family burial to follow at Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Pierre. The family will be hosting a luncheon at Drifters Bar & Grille following the funeral mass.Jean's Funeral can be viewed by visiting: rounds.senate.gov/JeanJean Renae Vedvei was born on October 4, 1956, in Lake Preston, South Dakota, to Alec and Helen Vedvei. The oldest of four siblings, she spent most of her childhood on a farm north of Lake Preston. She initially attended country school near the farm before later going to school in town. She excelled at academics and sports, and was an accomplished musician. Her father especially enjoyed hearing her play the accordion.After graduating from Lake Preston High School in 1974, she attended South Dakota State University in Brookings. She soon graduated with a degree in office management and went to work at the university. It was at SDSU where she met her future husband, Mike. They were married at the North Preston Church near her hometown on April 22, 1978, and subsequently made their home in Pierre.The couple had four children: Christopher, Brian, Carrie and John. All were active in sports and extracurricular activities, and Jean loved watching and supporting them in every way possible. She was absolutely committed to their success and documented every minute of it in her amazing scrapbooks.Jean was an incredible typist—even winning a vacation with her typewriting speed. She used her talents at several positions in state government, including working at the State Planning Bureau and as the office manager for the Secretary of the Department of Transportation.When Mike decided to run for Governor in 2001, she supported him with two conditions: that he never run a negative ad and never make her give a speech. He followed through on the first condition, and she took on her new role as South Dakota’s First Lady in 2003. Over the next eight years, Jean was most proud of her advocacy for childhood literacy and women’s heart health as well as her help in designing the new Governor’s Residence.More recently, she was a member of the Catholic Daughters, P.E.O., and the U.S. Senate Spouses’ Club. She also served on the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Committee. She enjoyed creative hobbies—especially cross-stitching, quilting, and scrapbooking—with many of her best friends. One of her favorite activities was camping at Okobojo, and she was still waterskiing at the age of 60.As she battled cancer for the last several years, she would often say, “if you have Faith, you have hope.” Her faith and family were her focus. She opened her home every year on Christmas Eve to host more than a hundred close relatives. All four of her children lived close by, and her 10 grandchildren all had the opportunity to get to know their grandma.Jean is survived by her husband Mike; her parents Alec and Helen Vedvei; her mother-in-law Rosemary Rounds; her children Chris (Lindsay) Rounds, Brian (Kerry) Rounds, Carrie (Justin) Larson, and John (Ashlee) Rounds; her grandchildren Ian, Elaina, Micah, Isabel, Hendry, Andrina, Beckett, Cohen, Natalie, and Maverick; her brothers Al (Deb) Vedvei, Charlie Vedvei, and John (Jerrie) Vedvei; her sisters-in-law Michele (Randy) Brich and Michelle (Rob) Julian; her brothers-in-law Dennis Rounds, Douglas (Jackie) Rounds, Timothy (Kristin) Rounds, Daniel (Wendey) Rounds, Thomas (Shelly) Rounds, Patrick (Michelle) Rounds, Steven (DeeAnn) Rounds, Scott (Kara) Rounds, Jamison (Cathy) Rounds, Marc (Pam) Scarborough, and Ryan (Patricia) Scarborough; her uncle Vernon Vedvei; her aunts Beatrice Krahn and Mary Ann (Ed) Hall; and many nieces and nephews. She also greatly appreciated the help and support of close friend, Dawna Leitzke, who often travelled with her to Mayo Clinic and supported her and the family in her last few days.She was preceded in death by her grandparents Sam and Andrina Vedvei and Harol “Joe” and Alma McLain; her father- and mother-in-law Don and Joyce Rounds; and her aunts Beverly Gullickson, Signe Anderson, and Joanne Vedvei.Condolences or memorials may be sent to P.O.

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-nominates-the-lee-family-of-colman-for-angels-in-adoption-award,"PIERRE—U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) announced that he has nominated Sandra and Chad Lee of Colman for the 2021 Angels in Adoption Award, presented by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption (CCAI). Sandra and Chad, along with their children Adam and Amanda, adopted Daniela, Christopher and Mikano from Haiti in 2010. “Every year, I have the great honor of recognizing a South Dakota family who has made a life changing impact on the lives of children,” said Rounds. “Sandra, Chad, Adam and Amanda answered a calling from God to change the life of not one child, but three. More than a decade after adopting Daniela, Christopher and Mikano from Haiti, the Lee family continues to advocate for orphans and the importance of reducing barriers to adoption. Today, the Lee children are engaged in a variety of school activities, including academics, sports and their church’s youth group. I am proud to recognize this inspirational family.”“We are so honored to have been selected to receive the Angels in Adoption Award this year,” said Sandra Lee. “Adoption is near and dear to our hearts! Many blessings that we just take for granted are life-changers for children from tough places. In addition to the basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, children also desperately need and deserve stability, security, and a place to always belong.  Adoption is a great way to climb outside ourselves to be the hands and feet of Jesus.  We are so thankful that God has chosen to use our family in this way!  Likewise, we want to encourage others to consider the impact they can have in the life of a child—mentoring, foster care, adoption, or supporting those who do—everyone can make a difference.”In January 2010, the world witnessed the destruction and devastation in Haiti following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake. Sixteen months into the rigorous adoption process, the Lee family was not immediately aware of the children’s well-being or the status of the orphanage. Thankfully, the children were safe.  It was not until a month after the earthquake, through the work of South Dakota’s congressional delegation and adoption agency staff in-country, that Daniela, Christopher and Mikano boarded a plane to the United States. Their evacuation from Haiti, prior to completion of the adoption, was made possible when Humanitarian Parole approval for Haitian orphans was granted. Then on November 30, 2010, the Lee family officially made Daniela, Christopher, and Mikano members of their family, joining Sandra and Chad’s twins, Adam and Amanda.  Today, the Lee family are active members in Katelyn’s Fund Orphan Ministry and The Gathering Well, two organizations that support families who foster or adopt, and advocate for the cause of orphans around the world. The Lee family has appreciated their community’s support and encouragement throughout the past decade.  Rounds is a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. Each year, Members of Congress are invited to nominate an outstanding family or organization from their state to receive an Angels in Adoption award. CCAI is a 501(c)3 nonpartisan organization dedicated to raising awareness about the tens of thousands of orphans and foster children in the United States and the millions of orphans around the world in need of permanent, safe and loving homes through adoption.

I am committed to helping tribes in South Dakota restore their historical and cultural ties to buffalo herds and make certain that this is a meaningful step for Native American communities.” “The American buffalo, or bison, is central to the culture and history of many of our tribal nations, including a number in New Mexico,” said Heinrich. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Rounds to provide Tribal communities with access to additional resources and opportunities to manage these revered animals and restore their habitat.”“The Indian Buffalo Management Act will restore the cultural, historical, spiritual and traditional connection between buffalo and tribal people; create employment and economic opportunities; and provide the Tribe with access to traditional, healthy and self-sustaining food source,” said Clyde Estes, Chairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. “We thank Senator Rounds for working with us and listening to our request of introducing this important legislation in the United States Senate.”“Our goal has always been to expand our buffalo herd to produce one large enough to supplement our Food Distribution Program, to assist our elders when they need buffalo meats or parts for a ceremony and to work with our local schools to aid in the educational benefits of buffalo restoration,” said Mike Faith, Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Vice Chairman of the InterTribal Buffalo Council. “We greatly appreciate the leadership of Senator Rounds and his colleagues in introducing this legislation that will help us reach those goals.  As the Lakota Holy Man, John Fire Lame Deer once said, ‘The Buffalo gave us everything we needed.’ This legislation is therefore a very positive development.”“Senators Rounds, Heinrich and the others who have stepped up to introduce this bill are to be commended,” said Ervin Carlson, President of the InterTribal Buffalo Council headquartered in Rapid City. “It is simply impossible to overstate both the importance of the buffalo to the Indian people and the damage that was done when the buffalo were nearly wiped out. By helping tribes reestablish buffalo herds on our reservation lands, the Congress will help us reconnect with a keystone of our historic culture as well as create jobs and an important source of protein that our people truly need.”“For Indigenous peoples, the restoration of buffalo is as much about healing our people and reviving our culture as it is about healing the land,” said Jason Baldes, board member of the InterTribal Buffalo Council and Tribal buffalo program manager for the National Wildlife Federation. “The Indian Buffalo Management Act not only expands capacity and reaffirms Tribal sovereignty but ensures we can continue working with Tribal, federal and conservation partners to establish prolific populations of buffalo across the country.”Maria Sam, the herd manager for the Picuris Pueblo of New Mexico said, “Recently, I was able to discuss the status of our buffalo herd with Senator Heinrich and I was so appreciative to hear his enthusiasm for assisting our Pueblo and others to grow our herds and provide an important cultural and dietary resource for our people and others throughout New Mexico. His interest in this legislation has been longstanding and we look forward to this basic but important bill becoming law.”  Phillip Perez, Governor of the Pueblo of Nambe said, “We are delighted that Senators Heinrich and Lujan will be joining Senator Rounds and others in introducing this legislation.  Our buffalo herd is very small as is the land we have been able to set aside for it.  When implemented, this bill could allow us to allocate more land so our buffalo could really stretch their legs and we could grow the herd.  Being able to distribute more buffalo meat to our people would be wonderful.”Cosponsors of the bill include Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).The Indian Buffalo Management Act provides secure, consistent funding for tribes and tribal organizations that have an established buffalo herd and management program, as well as provides the opportunity to expand the program to other interested tribes.

This bipartisan resolution also highlights the need for an all hands on deck approach to prevent hackers from breaching American networks and compromising our national security.”U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Angus King (I-Maine) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) are cosigners of the resolution.The National Cybersecurity Awareness Month Resolution will designate October 2021 as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.

Rounds also spoke in detail about President Biden’s decision to reject the professional advice of his military advisors to complete a conditions-based withdrawal rather than a date certain withdrawal. Read or watch Rounds’ full remarks below.Senator Rounds’ remarks as delivered: Madam President,Tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of the day the United States entered Afghanistan – the beginning of “Operation Enduring Freedom.”On October 7, 2001, the U.S. military conducted its first strike on the terrorists responsible for attacking our nation on 9-11.As President Bush said on that day: It was not a mission we asked for, but a mission that we would fulfill.For the past two decades, brave men and women have answered the call and put on the uniform of our country to fight terrorists in the name of freedom.We were a beacon of hope in a region of chaos.Our presence made a difference.As I travel my home state of South Dakota, I’ve heard from many people who were disturbed by the events that unfolded during our final days in Afghanistan.I share their frustrations.Together, we watched the Taliban forcefully regain control of an entire country that we worked so hard to keep free from terrorist groups.We watched the credibility of the United States on the world stage diminish as we carelessly left our friends and allies behind.We watched civilians hopelessly cling to the wings of aircraft in desperate hope of escape.And we watched 13 brave men and women in uniform lose their lives while helping others seek freedom.As we mourn the loss of their lives, we recognize and appreciate their service to our nation. We also remember all those who fought by our side for twenty years, many of whom remain trapped in Afghanistan. Brandy Roseland, a veteran from Belle Fourche, South Dakota, worked as a contractor in Afghanistan.That’s where she met her interpreter.According to Brandy, her interpreter served with the highest distinction and faced great personal risk, often putting himself in harm’s way to aid and protect Americans and his fellow Afghans.On one such occasion, Brandy’s interpreter discovered an American contractor who died in an accident outside of Kabul.The interpreter singlehandedly returned the contractor’s body, as well as sensitive equipment and documents to the US Embassy.That took courage.Brandy returned to the United States, but she stayed in contact with her interpreter.When Afghanistan began to fall to the Taliban, she knew she needed to do all she could to help get him to safety.That’s when Brandy called us and asked if we could help him escape the clutches of the Taliban.For weeks, our office worked relentlessly to maneuver his application for a Special Immigrant Visa through the bureaucratic process at the State Department. Our work was ultimately successful from an administrative standpoint, but the overall mission was a failure.While we had done all we could to help the interpreter receive his visa, our forces had exited before he could get on a plane to safety. Today, he remains in hiding in Afghanistan. If he is found by the Taliban, his fate will certainly be sealed.We all know that there were no easy decisions regarding Afghanistan.But there was clearly a wrong one.For months, we had warned of the perils of making an arbitrary decision based on the calendar as opposed to an assessment of the conditions on the ground.And we weren’t alone.As the only Republican member of both the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, I’ve had the opportunity these past few weeks to hear from the senior military officers who advised President Biden – General Milley, Secretary Austin and General McKenzie.Their message to the president was clear: A withdrawal on a date-certain without conditions would lead to the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban.Despite receiving the best military advice in the world, President Biden decided to use his own judgement and made the wrong decision.His directive to withdraw on a date certain - without regard for the conditions on the ground – needlessly put American soldiers in harm’s way and forced our military to undertake an assignment destined for failure.Our military simply ran out of time.They could not get all of our Americans out.  And they could not get all of our Afghan allies out, including Brandy’s interpreter. But it didn’t have to end this way.Our military leaders offered President Biden the correct path forward.Their commander-in-chief failed them.Lately, the president has blamed a lot of people for his failure. This includes the Afghan security forces and his own generals who he falsely claimed advised him to make this decision.But this does not fall on any of them.President Biden owns this debacle and history will not judge him kindly.Because of his error, al Qaeda now has a breeding ground.America is less safe.The world is less safe.I’ll close with a message for our veterans:While I was governor, I attended 31 funerals of South Dakotans who died fighting in the war on terror.We will not forget their sacrifice and their family’s loss.While freedom may not endure in Afghanistan today, for twenty years you protected our nation and kept the fight away from our doorstep.Your service was not in vain. Your sacrifice made a difference.You represent the best of our country and your nation is grateful.Always remember, it’s not the politician who protects our right to vote. It’s not the journalist who protects our freedom of speech.It’s not the preacher who protects our freedom of religion. All of our freedoms are defended and protected by the men and women who wear, and have worn, the uniform of our great nation.God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.###"

Congress has an opportunity to act and address the many consequences of the president’s botched withdrawal. Our legislation prioritizes the safe evacuation of Americans and Afghan partners still stranded in Afghanistan while holding the Taliban accountable for their terrorist acts and human rights abuses. I will work with my colleagues to keep Americans safe and terrorism at bay,” said Rounds.“I’ve asked the administration for a plan and while they say they have one, they have not revealed any details of a plan. My office is still working with Special Immigrant Visa applicants who supported America’s effort in Afghanistan. Now families, including children, of these Afghans are in danger of execution. We have a responsibility to get them out. Congress has an obligation to engage in oversight of these activities. I hope the administration would work with us in passing this essential legislation in an expedient, bipartisan manner,” added Rounds.In addition to Rounds, other cosponsors of this bill include Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Todd Young (R-Ind.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.). This legislation:Text of the legislation can be found here.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-smith-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-promote-tribal-self-governance-for-federal-food-assistance-programs,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.), members of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, introduced bipartisan legislation that would allow tribes in South Dakota and across the country to have greater control over how federal hunger programs are administered. The SNAP Tribal Food Sovereignty Act would give tribal governments the ability to administer the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly known as SNAP) through self-governance contracts. The bill would make sure that SNAP is run in a culturally-appropriate way that promotes the health and economic well-being of tribal communities. Approximately 25 percent of Native Americans receive some type of federal food assistance, and in some tribal communities, participation is as high as 80 percent.“Our legislation would allow tribes the ability to administer SNAP to meet the specific needs of their communities,” said Rounds. “This added flexibility would create additional opportunities for tribes to strengthen local food economies and promote the inclusion of indigenous foods. I am glad to join Senator Smith to remove some of the federal bureaucracy that hinders tribal communities in South Dakota and across the nation.”“Tribal governments understand what works best in Tribal communities and should have more say over how SNAP is administered,” said Smith. “The SNAP Tribal Food Sovereignty Act is about promoting Tribal sovereignty and helping Tribes fight hunger in a way that works best for them.”The legislation is supported by the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Association and the Four Bands Community Fund.“American Indians and Alaskan Natives need the opportunity to administer their own federal food programs. Our Tribes are proximate to the resources, cultural knowledge, families and are uniquely vested in the long-term health of Indian Country.  This important legislation will provide localized control over our food ecosystems and enhance our economic well-being as well as our community health,” said Lakota Vogel of Four Bands Community Fund which is headquartered on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. Four Bands Community Fund is a Native CDFI and the only entity in South Dakota that is a member of the Native Farm Bill Coalition.You can access a summary of the legislation here.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-crapo-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-protect-taxpayer-rights-and-privacy,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) joined U.S. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Senate and U.S. House of Representatives colleagues to introduce the Tax Gap Reform and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Enforcement Act.“I have heard from thousands of South Dakotans concerned about the proposed expansion of the IRS and the impacts it has on Americans’ financial privacy—I share their concerns,” said Rounds. “Rather than seeking massive funding increases and unprecedented access to taxpayer bank accounts, the IRS should focus on improving its internal policies to close the tax gap. The Tax Gap Reform and IRS Enforcement Act establishes critical safeguards to help prevent IRS abuses and protect taxpayer privacy.”Background:Under the guise of closing the “tax gap,” Democrats are seeking to increase IRS funding by a massive $80 billion over the next 10 years to expand “enforcement and compliance activities” at the IRS, and to create a “comprehensive financial account information reporting regime,” under which gross inflows and outflows of taxpayers’ financial accounts are reported by banks and other financial intermediaries to the IRS, effectively forcing them to act as IRS agents.In addition to Rounds, other original Senate cosponsors include John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).Key provisions of the Tax Gap Reform and IRS Enforcement Act:The legislation is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform and the Center for a Free Economy.“This legislation is a strong alternative to recent proposals that would write an $80 billion check to the IRS with too little forethought,” said Pete Sepp, President of the National Taxpayers Union.  “If lawmakers move forward with an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) budget boost anyway, these reforms and more should be considered prerequisites for any major proposed increase in the IRS budget, and would both safeguard taxpayers’ rights and support taxpayers’ interest in an effective, modern, and agile IRS.”“Democrats want to give the IRS $80 billion and hire 87,000 new agents so they can harass and audit taxpayers and create a new reporting regime that targets any bank account, Venmo account, or financial account exceeding $600 in gross inflows and outflows,” said Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform.  “This should be alarming given the IRS has a long history of failing to do its job and targeting taxpayers based on their political beliefs. The Tax Gap Reform and IRS Enforcement Act…takes steps towards protecting taxpayers by implementing important safeguards against potential new IRS targeting and abuse.”“Congressional Democrats' answer to Americans' frustrations with the IRS is to hire more tax bureaucrats to audit them,” said Ryan Ellis, President of the Center for a Free Economy.  “This bill provides a welcome reform-based alternative. People are fed up with being told they are tax cheats by academics and bureaucrats who have never signed the front of a paycheck, and that they must become the subject of fishing expedition audits in service to a fabricated ‘tax gap.’  Reining in the tax gap estimation and audit process gives taxpayers a fair shake if the tax man comes knocking. Congress should focus on getting the IRS to answer phone calls and correspondence in a timely manner, not on new audits.”###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-announces-112-million-grant-awarded-to-south-dakota-school-of-mines-and-technology-for-dod-cold-weather-research,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today announced that South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been awarded a $11.2 million grant to partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Engineer Research and Development Center’s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). This new project called “Materials and Manufacturing for Cold Regions” will be conducted over a five-year time span, with funding going to faculty and student research at the School of Mines from multiple engineering and science disciplines. The team will develop advanced materials and manufacturing technology in support of the U.S. Army’s global military objectives in cold and remote regions.“I congratulate South Dakota School of Mines and the Army Corps of Engineers on this important collaborative research effort,” said Rounds. “Thanks to the work that has already begun, the conditions have been set for the research team to design enduring systems and processes for use in cold and remote conditions. The success of this vital program is critical to the joint force’s ability to meet National Defense Strategy objectives to fight and win in extreme cold weather environments.”“U.S. Senator Mike Rounds along with members of the US Senate Armed Services Committee and other members of our congressional delegation have been instrumental in supporting this sort of research that is critical for our military to protect the nation’s interests in cold regions of the world,” said Dr. Grant Crawford, professor of materials and metallurgical engineering at South Dakota Mines. “Through this partnership we will apply materials and manufacturing research expertise and infrastructure, developed over the past two decades by numerous Mines faculty, staff and students, to support the critical needs of our nation’s armed forces. It’s a perfect opportunity for us and we look forward to the new partnership.”“This research has the potential to be a win-win,” said Dr. Jim Rankin, President of the South Dakota Mines. “It will aid our nation’s defense and it will lead to new technology, new materials and new manufacturing processes that will spin-off into start-up companies right here in the Black Hills. This translates to more local high-paying jobs for our graduates and an economic boost to our community.”Background:CRREL solves interdisciplinary and strategically important challenges for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, Department of Defense (DoD) and the nation by advancing and applying science and engineering to complex environments, materials and processes in all seasons and climates, with unique core competencies related to the Earth’s cold regions.School of Mines faculty and students will focus on three main research areas in support of CRREL.Advanced Materials: This includes lightweight composites that offer thermal insulation and low temperature ballistics capability to support armor for soldiers, equipment, vehicles and structures. This also includes multifunctional shape memory materials that can be used for damage tolerant devices and energy harvesting in cold environments. Advanced Repair and Manufacturing Technologies: This includes friction stir welding/processing and cold spray technologies that can be used to repair broken parts and produce lightweight structures in cold regions.Advanced Coatings: This includes both thick and thin film coatings that offer advanced wear and corrosion resistance, anti-icing capability, and are tailored for use in earths cold regions to extend the lifetime of equipment, structures and devices.School of Mines faculty and researchers involved in the project include Dr. Grant Crawford, Dr. David Salem, Dr. Bharat Jasthi, Dr. Nick Bruno, Dr. Forest Thompson, Dr. Satish Bhattiprolu, Dr. Leila Sorkhi, Joshua Hammell, Todd Curtis, Michael Carter and James Tomich. Thirteen members of CRREL and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) joined Mines researchers for a meeting on the Mines campus last week.###"

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-presses-secretary-of-state-on-lack-of-strategy-in-afghanistan-withdrawal-decision-pushes-for-plan-moving-forward,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, pressed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the lack of strategy in the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan. When pressed by Senator Rounds, Secretary Blinken failed to provide insight into the United States’ strategy to combat adversaries and uphold American interests abroad. Rounds also requested a classified briefing with the Secretary of State to gain a better understanding of the department’s plans. Watch Senator Rounds’ questioning here.Excerpts from today’s hearing below:ROUNDS: Our adversaries, Mr. Secretary, are celebrating the departure of U.S. troops, and they are most certainly celebrating the creation of a power vacuum. Most certainly they are also prepared to take this opportunity and use it to their advantage. China has announced last week that it will send $31 million worth of aid to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. There have also been reports that they are looking at Bagram Air Base for their own use. The Russian Embassy in Afghanistan has remained opened and the ambassador met with Taliban leadership after the takeover. Pakistan is considering the Taliban government as a partner to counter India, and the Iranian president openly called this an “American military defeat” and is considering working with the Taliban. Did the Administration consider all of these foreign policy implications before such an abrupt withdrawal? And, if they did, does the Department [of State] have a strategy to counter our adversaries malign influence in the region?BLINKEN: We certainly did. We factored everything into the decisions we made, including the impact it might have on the neighboring countries, regional countries and others with various interests in Afghanistan. A number of the countries that you cited have a whole series of different interests in Afghanistan, to include making sure that it is not a place for terrorism directed against them, to ensure that it is not a source of drugs flowing out into their countries, to make sure that it is not a source of potential refugees flowing out into their country as well. So all of those things are in play and countries are looking to take steps that they need to take to protect some of their basic interests. At the same time, we’ve established, across more than one hundred countries and in the UN through a security council resolution, basic expectations of the Taliban-led government. And if those expectations are not met—and other countries and aiding and abetting so that the Taliban is able to not fulfill those expectations—there will be consequences for that too.ROUNDS: Well, Mr. Secretary if I could, what I’m really curious about is do you have a strategy you’ve established? Did you have enough time before this withdrawal to actually establish a strategy knowing there would be a void in Afghanistan?BLINKEN: The work that we’ve done to bring together, across dozens of countries, very active contact groups, looking as we work together across these countries with NATO, the EU as well as the UN. We have a collective strategy on the way forward…ROUNDS: Does our country—do we have a strategy? If this has been laid out, and based on the need to move out as quickly as we did, did you have time to actually establish a strategy to take care of what will be this power void? Simply to say that you’re working on it with other countries looks to me that we need our own strategy here. And it doesn’t sound like you’re in a position to share with us that that strategy exists today.BLINKEN: I’m happy, Senator, to follow up with you…but we have organized several dozen countries that are collectively working on and implementing a strategy…ROUNDS: What I hope is that, if you would, whether it be in a classified setting or publicly, if you could share with us in a week to ten days, what that strategy is, and if it needs to be in a classified setting, I’d ask the chairman [of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations] to provide us with that opportunity but most certainly I think it’s important that we have a strategy to combat what will be a void in Afghanistan, which is a void now, and most certainly something that we should be in a better position, I believe, than what it sounds like you’re able to articulate today.###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-rounds-on-fox-news-president-biden-made-a-very-serious-mistake-that-cost-american-lives,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, joined Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino on Fox News’ America’s Newsroom this morning to discuss the upcoming Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing with Secretary of State Blinken on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The hearing begins this morning at 10 AM ET/ 9 AM CT/ 8 AM MT.Excerpts from Senator Rounds’ interview below:PERINO: What have you not heard the administration answer so far that you would like to get to the bottom to?  ROUNDS: Right now they said they have about 124,000 individuals that they’ve helped get out. The problem is that out of the 124,000, about half of them, we don’t know who they are. There’s between 5,000-6,000 Americans they said they’ve helped out. There’s about half of the remaining 124,000 that are SIVs—Special Immigration Visas. But the remaining numbers, we don’t know who they are. We want to find out who those individuals are and how they were allowed to come out. We’ve got literally 100,000 more individuals who helped our men and women in uniform over the last twenty years. Their lives are at risk. We don’t know where they’re at. We are not getting good answers from the Department of State as to how we are going to help them get out of Afghanistan alive.…HEMMER: …this whole idea about the deadline—that was moved by the current administration and so the debate goes to what was their plan to get out?ROUNDS: The previous administration, under President Trump, was set up to do a conditions-based withdrawal. There were changes being made. The Taliban has not lived up to their side of the deals that were being made. This administration had every opportunity to modify a withdrawal. When Joe Biden decided to arbitrarily set a date and set it without regard to whether or not the Taliban was honoring their side of the commitment so far and was not based on conditions on the ground, he made a very serious mistake and it’s cost American lives.…ROUNDS: …today with the Secretary of State, I think we need to focus on moving forward, how are we going to help get the remaining Americans out? What’s your plan? What about the other individuals who helped our young men and women in uniform—what’s your plan to get them out? And how are you going to respond to China and to Russia and to Iran and to Pakistan who now see this void in Afghanistan…what’s your plan moving forward? Why is it that after this arbitrary date, how do you except to be able to respond accordingly in that area now that you’ve withdrawn our forces and you have very little to negotiate with?###"

I voted against this partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill that reads more like a liberal wish list than targeted pandemic relief.“Up until this point, we have always found a way to work together on a bipartisan basis to provide COVID-19 relief for the American people. None of the previous five pandemic relief bills received fewer than 90 votes in the United States Senate. This is the first bill that did not pass either chamber with bipartisan support. In fact, it had bipartisan opposition in the House of Representatives.“My colleagues and I offered a reasonable conservative alternative that targeted relief to those directly impacted by the pandemic and was one-third the price. Unfortunately, Democrats were unwilling to compromise. The legislation passed today is not targeted and is not specific, but rather includes many giveaways to left-wing causes.”###"

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-and-colleagues-urge-president-biden-to-withdraw-becerra,"WASHINGTON— Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Representative Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) and 72 other members of Congress sent a letter urging President Joe Biden to withdraw California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s nomination to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).“We write to express our grave concerns regarding the nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),” the members wrote. “Mr. Becerra’s lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust, and especially for HHS Secretary.”Full text of the letter:Dear President Biden,We write to express our grave concerns regarding the nomination of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Mr. Becerra’s lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust, and especially for HHS Secretary.At your inauguration, you spoke about uniting the country and the need to address the pandemic. As these are your stated priorities, we request that you withdraw Mr. Becerra’s nomination and offer the American people a nominee equipped to successfully combat the COVID-19 pandemic and safely reopen our country.Our nation cannot afford to lose valuable time in this battle by installing an HHS Secretary who is not up to the challenges we face. But that is exactly what you propose to do by nominating Mr. Becerra, a man with no meaningful experience in healthcare, public health, large-scale logistics, or any other areas critical to meeting our present challenges.Mr. Becerra’s lack of qualifications is particularly alarming given the important role the HHS Secretary will play in efforts to develop and distribute vaccines, coordinate research efforts, and draft critical regulations to carry out recovery legislation.Compounding our concerns over Mr. Becerra’s lack of experience is his ardent support of radical policies that will inflict great harm on millions of Americans. At a time when Americans can least afford it, Mr. Becerra enthusiastically supports eliminating the private health insurance market for 160 million Americans, only to replace it with a government takeover branded as Medicare-for-all. The resulting reimbursement cuts would devastate rural health care providers working to stay solvent during the pandemic and would be a slap in the face to the doctors, nurses and other health care workers keeping our communities healthy and safe.This radical position is not a recent or passing fancy. As Mr. Becerra proudly told California Healthline in 2019, “I’ve been a single-payer advocate all my life.” As the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc on our nation, Mr. Becerra’s determination to strip Americans of their private health insurance isn’t just bad policy, it’s dangerous.Meanwhile, Mr. Becerra seeks to decriminalize illegal immigration, which would extend expensive government benefits like Medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders.Mr. Becerra’s radical views extend to his ardent support of abortion until the moment of birth. He opposed the 2003 partial-birth abortion ban and cosponsored legislation that would force religious employers like Hobby Lobby to cover the morning-after pill, even in the face of sincerely held religious objections.Indeed, Mr. Becerra has long shown contempt for anyone who doesn’t agree with his radical leftist agenda. As California’s Attorney General, Mr. Becerra targeted social conservatives and religious groups with legal challenges and prosecution. He unconstitutionally forced houses of worship into lockdown while Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended dinner parties at the French Laundry. He prosecuted pro-life activists who documented Planned Parenthood executives’ conversations about selling the body parts of aborted babies. Finally, he defended a California law that targeted pro-life crisis pregnancy centers while exempting clinics focused on birth control.   Mr. Becerra’s extremism and contempt for those who take a different view contradict your calls for unity. His appointment would sow further division at a time our country needs to heal and would endanger lives at a time our citizens need life-saving treatments, vaccinations, and the freedom to work and worship together.  We ask that you put our country over radical partisan objectives by withdrawing Mr. Becerra’s nomination for HHS Secretary.Thank you for your immediate consideration of our request.###"

Our Founding Fathers intended the process of impeachment to remove public officials from office, not to punish private citizens. After carefully listening to every minute of the presentations made by the House Managers and the former president’s legal team, I am convinced that the Senate does not have jurisdiction to render a judgement against the former president.

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) joined Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and a group of senators in a letter urging the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Acting Director Robert Fairweather to withdraw the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) final rule on the importation of sheep, goats and certain other ruminations.The final rule would remove brain disorder-related import restrictions on sheep, goats, and most of their products. Currently, the import restrictions function as a necessary protection against brain disorders such as scrapie or mad cow disease.“The federal government has invested over $200 million into scrapie eradication since the early 2000s,” the senators wrote. “This investment has yielded tremendous results, lowering the percentage of scrapie-positive cull sheep at slaughter by 99 percent since FY2003. By allowing scrapie positive animals and genetic materials into the United States, we risk reintroducing the very disease we have nearly eradicated. If the disease is reintroduced into domestic flocks, opportunities for export will rapidly decline.”In addition to Rounds, the letter was signed by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), John Thune (R-S.D.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.).Full text of the letter:Dear Acting Director Fairweather,We write to urge you to withdraw the final rule on the Importation of Sheep, Goats, and Certain Other Ruminants (APHIS-2009-0095) until its impact on current market conditions has been fully evaluated. The rule seeks to remove bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) related import restrictions on sheep, goats, and most of their products. The existing BSE-related import restrictions function as a necessary protection against the introduction of other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), such as scrapie.TSEs are a group of rare degenerative brain disorders. Scrapie and BSE are both TSEs. BSE, commonly known as “mad cow disease,” is a progressive neurologic disease of cows. Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease which affects the central nervous system of sheep and goats. There is no cure or treatment for either disease.The federal government has invested over $200 million into scrapie eradication since the early 2000s. This investment has yielded tremendous results, lowering the percentage of scrapie-positive cull sheep at slaughter by 99 percent since FY2003. By allowing scrapie positive animals and genetic materials into the United States, we risk reintroducing the very disease we have nearly eradicated.If disease is reintroduced into domestic flocks, opportunities for export will rapidly decline. Prior to a domestic BSE occurrence in cattle in 2003, Japan was the primary export market for U.S. lamb. Japan quickly closed American access to its market and the U.S. did not recoup it until 2018.The rule should not precede accomplishing increased market access for American lamb, goats, and their products. By removing BSE-related restrictions, the United States would be increasing foreign imports while trade obstructions from countries such as the United Kingdom, European Union, and China remain in place.For these reasons, we urge you to withdraw the final rule on the Importation of Sheep, Goats, and Certain Other Ruminants.

Donald Trump is no longer in office and is now a private citizen. Therefore, in this instance, impeachment is a moot point.”###"

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) today announced that Mitchell Walker, a senior at Sioux Falls Christian High School, has received a fully qualified offer of appointment to the U.S. Military Academy (USMA). Rounds nominated Mitchell to USMA. He is the son of Randy and Christine Walker of Brandon, South Dakota. “Congratulations to Mitchell on receiving an offer of appointment to the U.S. Military Academy,” said Rounds. “Mitchell’s application to my office certainly stood out, and I was proud to nominate him to the Military Academy. Mitchell has been involved with Junior Reserve Officer’s Training Corps (JROTC) and has served as the Cadet Commanding Officer of Lincoln High School Marine Corps JROTC.  In addition, he holds leadership positions as student body president and football team captain, as well as being active in high school basketball, track, his church youth group and band and volunteering in his community.  We wish Mitchell all the best at West Point!” ""I am extremely blessed to have the opportunity to represent South Dakota at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and I would like to thank all those who have made this possible,” said Walker. “Over the years, my parents, my teachers, my coaches, and my mentors have molded me into the young man that I am today. I would also like to thank Senator Rounds for believing in me and bestowing upon me this opportunity to serve in the United States Army. I am deeply honored to serve our nation as a commissioned officer and I look forward to what the future holds.” Each year, Sen. Rounds is able to nominate a select group of qualified students from South Dakota to attend our nation’s four service academies: The U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy.

On the Armed Services Committee, we’ve worked to bolster our national defense, improve our nation’s cybersecurity capabilities and support Ellsworth Air Force Base – the future home of the first two B-21 bomber squadrons. We will continue to focus on this work.”""My new role on the Committee on Foreign Relations will go hand in hand with my work on Armed Services and also give me the added opportunity to promote access to international markets for South Dakota farmers and ranchers. In addition to standing up for our producers overseas, my work on Foreign Relations will help unlock new opportunities for South Dakota across the globe.""“I will remain a member on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. South Dakota consumers must have access to adequate credit and financial services. Furthermore, our state is home to many recognized financial institutions who add significantly to our economic base. I look forward to promoting good public policy that assures our citizens adequate access to competitive business and personal credit services.”“South Dakota is home to one of the largest populations of veterans per capita in the country. Throughout my time serving on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, we have worked to save the Hot Springs VA and improve the care our veterans receive. But there’s still more work to be done to make sure our veterans are getting the benefits they’ve been promised. In a typical year, over half of all the requests for assistance my office receives are veteran related. Our veterans made a commitment to serve our country. Now it’s our turn to make sure they receive the benefits they’ve been promised.""“The Native American population is an important part of our South Dakota community. But too often, the federal government has failed to maintain a working relationship with the tribes. I am pleased to be joining the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I look forward to working with tribal leaders. I believe we can improve the communications between tribes in South Dakota and provide equal access for Native Americans if we work together.”# # #"

Vilsack previously served as Governor of Iowa and Secretary of Agriculture under President Barack Obama.“South Dakota’s farm and ranch families are among the best producers in the world,” said Rounds. “They are great stewards of the land and need to be recognized for their efforts in feeding a growing population.“Today, I had a productive conversation with Governor Vilsack. I expressed to him the need to re-engage in trade discussions so we can bring back Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (MCOOL) and other issues related to beef markets. For example, we must close a current loophole so that only beef born, raised and slaughtered in the United States should receive the “Product of the U.S.A.” label. He agreed with me that consumers have the right to know where their meat comes from.“Additionally, we discussed the importance of ethanol, creating new markets for state-inspected meat processing facilities and the need to reform the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service.“I thank Governor Vilsack for taking the time to meet with me today and I look forward to working with him to address these issues critical to South Dakota should he be confirmed.”# # #"

It’s important to be in these discussions to advocate for our state and work to keep out the bad policies that will hurt our families and businesses. As the saying goes – ‘if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.’“Even though President Biden and I disagree on many issues, I’m grateful for his willingness to listen to our ideas and be open to compromise. Everyone in today’s meeting has shared goal of eliminating COVID-19 and providing relief to families who are truly struggling. It is better to build consensus and find a bipartisan path forward, rather than a massive, partisan bill that congressional Democrats are currently proposing.“My primary goal in any COVID-19 relief package is to make sure that it is targeted and directly addresses the pandemic itself. And we must keep out provisions unrelated to COVID-19 – such as raising the national minimum wage – that will kill jobs and hurt the economy, especially at a time where we’re trying tirelessly to get people back to work.“We agreed to keep talking on these important issues and I look forward to continue working together on areas in which we can find consensus.” ### "
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-king-reintroduce-legislation-allowing-local-meat-and-poultry-products-to-be-sold-across-state-lines,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Angus King (I-Maine) reintroduced the New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act. The bipartisan bill would allow meat and poultry products inspected by state Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs to be sold across state lines. Rounds and King introduced this legislation in the 115th and 116th sessions of Congress.“South Dakota farmers and ranchers produce some of the highest-quality meat in the nation,” said Rounds. “However, currently cattle, sheep, swine and goat products are limited to markets within the state even though they are required to go through inspection at an FSIS-approved state facility. This makes no sense considering state inspection programs are required to be ‘at least equal to’ or better than federal state inspection standards. Our bill would allow these high-quality products that pass state inspection standards to be sold across state lines, opening up new markets for our producers and giving consumers greater choice at the grocery store.”“If Maine farmers have already proven the quality of their meat and poultry products processed under federally-approved state programs, they should not have to jump through extra hoops to expand into new markets; this is almost the textbook definition of redundancy,” said Senator King. “This legislation will reduce unnecessary barriers in order to support small businesses and increase the availability of high-quality products that meet or exceed federal standards. This is common sense legislation that will support local agricultural leaders already meeting high standards, and increase choice for consumers – it’s a win-win, and I hope that the 117th Congress will seize this opportunity.”“The challenges of the last year have brought a spotlight to the significant bottlenecks and obstacles of our nation’s food system,” said Julie Ann Smith, Executive Director of the Maine Farm Bureau. “Our farmer’s first priority is feeding our neighbors, whether they live down the street or in another state. Rather than watch our neighbors suffer with empty shelves, this legislation ensures that safe, inspected, and high-quality protein can be provided to consumers, giving them increased access and choices. We applaud Senator King’s efforts and his persistent support of agriculture.”This legislation is supported by the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association, South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, South Dakota Farm Bureau, Maine Farm Bureau, the South Dakota Pork Producers, the South Dakota Meat Inspection Program Director and the South Dakota Stockgrowers.Currently, there are 27 states with inspection programs, certified by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), which meet or exceed federal inspection standards. However, products processed at these FSIS approved state MPI inspected facilities are not currently allowed to be sold across state lines.Original cosponsors include U.S. Sens.

In the early days of the Biden presidency, we are watching some of our progress be destroyed.“Obamacare led to higher premiums, fewer options for consumers and caused millions of Americans to lose the health insurance they preferred. We eliminated Obamacare’s individual mandate giving patients better control of their health insurance. Today’s steps to expand Obamacare are steps reversing our progress. They do not move us forward, only backward.“Additionally, I am deeply disappointed in President Biden’s decision to overturn the Mexico City Policy. This decision will allow federal taxpayer dollars to be spent to fund abortions overseas. This is flat-out wrong - an attack on life anywhere is an attack on life everywhere.“President Biden has said he wants to be a president for all Americans. But actions speak louder than words. These actions prove that he is only interested in furthering a left-wing agenda.”###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-wotus-was-illegal-power-grab-new-rule-must-be-upheld,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, joined Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and a number of their colleagues to introduce a resolution that expresses the need for the U.S. Senate to stand with workers, farmers, ranchers, landowners, manufacturers and businesses by upholding the Trump administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which replaced the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule.  “We must uphold the previous administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which gives farmers, ranchers and landowners the clarity they need to know when the Clean Water Act applies to them and when it does not,” said Rounds. “The Obama administration’s Waters of the U.S. rule was an illegal power grab by the federal government, which was why it was tied up in the court system for so long. It infringed upon the rights of South Dakota landowners. We strongly urge the Biden administration to keep the Navigable Waters Protection rule in place.” In addition to Rounds and Ernst, the resolution is supported by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), James Risch (R-Idaho), John Barasso (R-Wyo.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Background:In 2015, the Obama administration finalized a rule that expanded the definition of the Waters of the United States. This rule created confusion and burdensome red tape for South Dakota’s agriculture industry and many others. When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the WOTUS rule, Rounds introduced legislation, which was passed by committee, to stop it. In 2018, the Trump administration released a proposed rule to replace the Obama administration’s 2015 WOTUS rule with a new rule that provided much-needed predictability and certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” The new Navigable Waters Protection Rule was finalized last year.  On day one of his administration, President Biden signed an executive order that would roll back the Trump Administration’s executive order which began the process of rescinding Obama’s WOTUS rule. This is why Rounds joined the resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Navigable Waters Protection Rule should not be withdrawn or vacated. ###"
https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-manchin-smith-hassan-king-shaheen-call-on-fcc-to-prioritize-small-rural-providers-for-covid-19-telehealth-program,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assure small rural providers receive their fair share of the COVID-19 Telehealth Program funding authorized in the recent year-end stimulus package. The senators said in part, “All across the country our healthcare providers, first responders, and Americans of all walks of life have adjusted to a new way of receiving and giving care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few months, we have seen that telemedicine can provide a lifeline to essential health care services through specialized connected care that was previously only available in person… It is critical that all areas across the United States have access to telehealth and telemedicine during this difficult time. In order to assure that funding reaches the areas across our country that need help the most, and need it now, we call on the FCC to target funds to small providers in rural areas.” The letter can be read in full below: Dear Chairman Rosenworcel: We write to you today regarding the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) invitation for public comment on how to administer another round of the COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which received $249.95 million in funding through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (P.L. 116-260). We welcome the chance to provide input on how to strengthen the program and ensure that this next round of funding goes to the places and organizations that need it the most. All across the country our healthcare providers, first responders, and Americans of all walks of life have adjusted to a new way of receiving and giving care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few months, we have seen that telemedicine can provide a lifeline to essential health care services through specialized connected care that was previously only available in person and. This is especially important in rural areas where healthcare services are often further away and require extended travel over difficult terrain. Linking rural emergency medical providers with specialists in real time can keep emergency department patients at home and more efficiently identify and treat patients who need more immediate care. Telehealth video also allows primary care providers to use remote patient monitoring devices to improve total quality outcomes and keep the most at-risk patients from exposure to COVID-19. That’s why a bipartisan, bicameral group of Senators and Representatives included robust funding for another round of funding for the FCC’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program in the Bipartisan COVID-19 Emergency Relief Act of 2020. That bill also included a 20% set-aside for small, rural providers to ensure that those who needed the most help could compete with larger providers. We were pleased that funding for FCC telehealth made it into the end-of-year spending bill, as well as language requiring the equitable distribution of these funds across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and we ask that this round of funding include targeted funds for rural areas. The point of the FCC telehealth program is to help build out telehealth infrastructure among providers that currently lack capacity. Unfortunately, a majority of funding in the first round of the pilot program went to larger providers with more substantial requests, while many smaller providers who serve an essential role in our rural communities across the country were unsuccessful. Further, some providers – while critical to their communities – already had telehealth capabilities prior to the pandemic, while Rural Health Clinics (RHC), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) only started expanding telehealth services after May 2020. These smaller providers have faced struggles with resources and capacity to set up their own telehealth infrastructure quickly. For example, the average CAH has an annual revenue of $25 million while operating in critical roles in our communities. Our proposed set-aside would help resolve these structural issues and ensure that small, rural providers receive the help they need. In addition to a focus on committing funds to small, rural providers, we urge the FCC to provide as much technical assistance and be as communicative with health care providers, especially rural providers, as is feasible. Standing up a new assistance program during the pandemic is a difficult task, and we believe that effective communication and transparency throughout all phases of the process will result in the effective, efficient use of taxpayer dollars to improve health outcomes across our country. Rural areas are being hit particularly hard during this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus first spread most quickly in large metropolitan areas, data released by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) shows that it has since sharply increased in rural communities. CDC data also shows that rural Americans are also more susceptible to the virus, and death rates in the country’s least-populated areas are currently higher than in urban areas. Even before the pandemic, the disparity between rural and urban mortality had doubled from 1999 to 2017. Rural Americans are more likely to be older, more likely to suffer from underlying conditions, and have access to fewer hospitals – many of which were struggling financially even before the pandemic. In our states, we have seen rural hospitals – already struggling to make ends meet prior to the pandemic – enter bankruptcy or close their doors permanently. It is critical that all areas across the United States have access to telehealth and telemedicine during this difficult time. In order to ensure that funding reaches the areas across our country that need help the most, and need it now, we call on the FCC to target funds to small providers in rural areas. Thank you for your attention to these matters. Sincerely,###"

Donald Trump is no longer in office and is now a private citizen. Impeachment is intended to be the legislative branch’s check on the executive and judicial branches of government- not a check on our constituency. “Our Founding Fathers did not intend to put private citizens on trial in the Senate. Why, then, would we hold an impeachment trial of which the immediate consequence upon conviction – removal from office – is something that has already happened? Removal from office implies that the subject to be impeached must be in office. It doesn’t make sense.” Article 2, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution states: “The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”  Donald Trump is neither the President, Vice President, nor is he a civil officer of the United States. ###"

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and a group of senators in a letter urging U.S. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza to prevent Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving illegal loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as they did last year. “Planned Parenthood affiliates are well aware that they are ineligible to receive PPP loans, on the basis of SBA’s letters and the frank admission of their political-action committee,” wrote the senators. “Their attempts to apply for PPP loans are naked attempts to defraud the United States government.” In addition to Rounds and Cotton, the letter was signed by U.S. Sens.

Eligibility requirements for these “second-draw” loans are similar to the requirements for initial loans authorized under the CARES Act. Generally speaking, applicants for the initial waves of PPP loans had to employ no more than 500 employees across all of their affiliates in order to be eligible for a loan; applicants for a second-draw loan must have no more than 300 employees across all of their affiliates. As before, applicants for a second-draw loan must self-certify that they are eligible to receive such a loan; the Small Business Administration has written that “incorrect or false eligibility certifications by borrowers are subject to severe penalties.” Planned Parenthood employs about 16,000 people nationwide. The group’s national organization, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, jealously exercises control over local affiliates, subjecting them to uniform bylaws, accreditation, frequent reviews, and mandates about what services they must provide to remain part of the Federation, such as on-site abortion. Planned Parenthood affiliates thus are ineligible to receive PPP loans, as part of an affiliated group that employs far more people than the number allowed for an initial or second-draw PPP loan. This fact was admitted by none other than Planned Parenthood’s political-action committee, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which wrote that the CARES Act “gives the Small Business Administration broad discretion to exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates and other non-profits serving people with low incomes and deny them benefits under the new small business loan program.” Nonetheless, at least 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates illegally obtained more than $80 million in taxpayer funds during the initial rounds of PPP by self-certifying their eligibility for the program. In response, the SBA determined that these affiliates were ineligible to receive PPP loans and issued letters informing them of the consequences of false certifications of eligibility, including repayment of loans, loss of loan forgiveness, and other civil and criminal penalties. Members of this body previously have urged you to investigate these false certifications of eligibility, recover the more than $80 million in funds, and seek appropriate penalties against Planned Parenthood affiliates that broke the law. An equally urgent task is to ensure Planned Parenthood affiliates do not receive additional PPP loans intended for struggling small businesses and non-profits. We therefore urge you to inform participating lenders that Planned Parenthood affiliates are ineligible to receive second-draw PPP loans, and encourage them to immediately notify SBA if a Planned Parenthood affiliate applies for such a loan through their institution. Furthermore, we urge you to refer any Planned Parenthood affiliate that applies for such a loan to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Planned Parenthood affiliates are well aware that they are ineligible to receive PPP loans, on the basis of SBA’s letters and the frank admission of their political-action committee. Their attempts to apply for PPP loans are naked attempts to defraud the United States government. Thank you for your tireless efforts to help small businesses and non-profits survive the Covid-19 pandemic. With appropriate precautions, we can ensure that additional relief funds go to those that need it, in accordance with the law, rather than to unscrupulous organizations like Planned Parenthood. Sincerely, ### "

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) made the following statement on the formal count of the Electoral College votes by Congress:“Going into the joint session, I said I would keep an open mind and listen to the objections and evidence presented. Despite the unacceptable attack on the U.S. Capitol, we pressed forward and I kept my promise.“I take very seriously Congress’ role in certifying the Electoral College, as outlined in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act. After much consideration, it was my determination that the objectors did not present the necessary evidence or actions profound enough to gain my support. In fact, they presented no new facts whatsoever.“Absent overwhelming evidence of constitutional violations in an election process, objecting to the Electoral College vote count is dangerous and unwise. It flies in the face of our Founding Fathers, who intended individual states to operate their own election processes and entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts.“I’ve talked to many South Dakotans and heard many of the concerns about the irregularities in this election, ranging from fraud to technological errors and questionable processes.“In South Dakota, we do our elections right. Our voters can trust the integrity of our election process and know their vote will be counted.  However, this is also a states rights issue, a constitutionally-protected issue. Asking the federal government to upend state elections would have profound and negative consequences on every American.    “As I said previously, my decision was based on the Constitution, not political expediency. The reality is that refusing to certify the election results had no viable path to actually changing the outcome of the election. Even so, Americans’ faith in our electoral process is in jeopardy, and we must get to the bottom of the allegations of voting irregularities that continue to exist. That is why I support a full, comprehensive investigation into the 2020 election.“I recently agreed to cosponsor a bill to create a 2020 Bipartisan Advisory Committee that will study the integrity and administration of the election of November 2020 and make recommendations to state legislatures to improve the security, integrity and administration of federal elections.”"

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-statement-on-the-formal-count-of-the-electoral-college-votes-by-congress,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) made the following statement on tomorrow’s formal count of the Electoral College votes by Congress:“Tomorrow’s vote will be one of the most consequential votes I’ll likely take as a U.S. Senator. “If you’ve noticed, I have not joined the chorus of those for or against an objection. Today, those objections do not exist, they have not been shared, and there’s literally nothing to consider until we have a chance to hear the arguments for and against. The bottom line is that I’m keeping an open mind and I look forward to seeing the evidence to support the objections that are being proposed. Ultimately, the Constitution, not political expediency, will guide my decision making. “I wholeheartedly support an independent investigation into the 2020 election. Since the current approach from several of my Republican colleagues requires the Democrat-controlled House to agree with them, it is dead on arrival. I’m interested in restoring faith, certainty and transparency for the American voter. And, unless we get to the bottom of these allegations, I fear Americans’ faith in our electoral process is in great jeopardy.”"

https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/grabbing-the-bull-by-the-horns,"I heard a story recently about a government bureaucrat from DC visiting real America for the first time. He worked on agriculture policy but grew up in the city so his only experience with food involved his plate. He bought a pair of shiny new boots and headed off to cow-calf country.When his plane touched down, he was greeted by a man with a cowboy hat and a firm handshake. They jumped in the rancher’s F-350, a vehicle so big the city slicker couldn’t figure out how you’d parallel park it, and headed out to his ranch. When they arrived at the rancher’s pasture, the bureaucrat thought he’d ask a tough question to impress the tough cowboy: “Why doesn’t that cow have any horns?”“Well,” the rancher said, “there are many reasons why a cow doesn’t have horns. Ya see, some don’t have horns because we dehorned them as calves and some, like Angus, are a polled breed that naturally never grow horns. But the reason that cow doesn’t have any horns is because it’s a horse.”This joke illustrates a broader point: ranchers in cow-calf country work hard every day to produce the best beef in the world, but continue to lose hundreds of dollars per head because the deck is stacked against them. DC lobbyists and bureaucrats, who have never been to a sale barn or stepped foot on a ranch but still think they know better, continue to rig the system and line the pockets of the big packers. They’re ripping off our ranchers, small processors and, ultimately, our consumers. That needs to stop now.As we enter a new year and a new Congress, it would be easy to get discouraged, see the situation not changing and give up. But these issues are too important to quit on. There is fire in my belly and I’m going to fight like hell until we get this done.When I meet with ranchers in South Dakota in places like Wall or St. Onge or Ft. Pierre, it’s clear they know what’s best for their operation. They demand greater market transparency, new markets for state-inspected facilities, Product of the U.S.A. labeling and Mandatory Country of Original Labeling (MCOOL). Those are the people I am fighting for in Washington.Over the last year, I’ve introduced bipartisan, commonsense legislation that touches on each of these issues. We formed coalitions with folks on both sides of the aisle who care about the needs of our ranchers and processors. And while you’d think that’d be enough, it’s not. When we attempted to force votes on these issues, our attempts were denied. The stranglehold on certain members of Congress is still too strong. DC dysfunction at its finest.But the good news is that momentum is on our side. Every day we are continuing to win senators and members of Congress over to our way of thinking. They are beginning to understand that what’s best for the consumer, in this case, is also what’s best for the producer. It’s going to take all of us working together to get this done. I don’t care who I have to talk to - Republican or Democrat.This is a priority for me now more than ever. We cannot stand idly by and watch our ranching community continue to suffer. As we enter a new year, it’s time to discard DC dysfunction, grab the bull by the horns and deliver results.###"
