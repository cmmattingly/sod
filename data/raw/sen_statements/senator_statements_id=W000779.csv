https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-nearly-23-million-to-address-the-opioid-crisis,"
Washington,
D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that a
total of $22,972,499 in Department of Health and Human Services grants to
combat the opioid crisis is coming to the State of Oregon and Tribes. 
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2021, Oregon overdose deaths increased 41%, compared to a 16% increase nationwide. In 2020 non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Black, male and people experiencing houselessness were among the highest risk for unintentional drug overdose death. 
“I’ve heard heart-wrenching stories from Oregonians who have lost loved ones after a prescription for an injury or treatment turned into an addiction,” said Merkley. “The impact of this crisis across communities is immeasurable, but these funds will have a real impact on our continued fight to beat this epidemic. I won’t stop working to deliver resources, solutions, and support to address the needs of those suffering and their communities.” 
“Every corner of Oregon has been slammed by the opioid crisis that’s ripping apart lives, with the human devastation rippling out as well to victims’ loved ones, employers and communities,” Wyden said. “This scourge demands a comprehensive response and this
federal investment in prevention, treatment and more will help. But there’s
obviously much more to be done, and I’ll keep battling to provide all the
resources needed to attack this crisis with the urgency it requires.”
Recipients and awards can be found below: 
·       $498,228 to the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon  
·       $15,474,271 to Oregon Health Authority Directors Office of Financial Services 
·       $6,750,000 to Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board 
·       $250,000 to the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians 
These awards are intended to address the opioid overdose crisis by providing resources to
states, territories, and Tribes for increasing access to FDA-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), and for supporting the continuum of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for opioid use disorder (OUD) and other concurrent substance use disorders. 
“Every day opioid addiction takes lives and destroys families,” said Cheryle A. Kennedy, Chairwoman for the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. “With this funding from Health and Human Services we will be able to provide critical services through our clinic, Great Circle Recovery, and support patients on their path through recovery.” 
“Our tribe is so thankful for the
funds we will receive,” said Delores Piglsey, Chair of The Confederated
Tribes of Siletz Indians. “The opioid crisis has affected our
community. The funds will be used for wellness programs, mental health
treatment, and every preventative measure that we have been unable to perform
without the funding. Recovery efforts are severely needed in rural
communities. We thank our Senator for his active participation in
recognizing our unique needs.”

governments in the metro area will receive a combined more than $1.37 million
from the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) to continue to provide
temporary housing, victim services and criminal intervention after sexual
violence.
“Addressing the
atrocity of sexual violence in our communities couldn’t be more urgent,” Wyden said.
“I am gratified to see local organizations and Oregon counties get more
resources to continue to provide services to victims of sexual violence. While
more needs to be done at every level to prevent such violence, I will not stop
fighting so that victims can get the support and protection they deserve as
they heal and seek accountability for their attackers.”
“We must do
everything in our power to protect people from sexual assault and abuse,” Merkley said.?“This funding
to Portland Community College, the Domestic Violence Resource Center in
Beaverton, and Clackamas County will support the crucial work of these
organizations to keep people safe, ensure resources are available to provide
these vital services and hold perpetrators accountable.” 
The
OVW grants provide funding and resources for local organizations and
governments to respond to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,
sex trafficking, and stalking. These grant funds will be allocated as follows:

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-100-million-investment-into-climate-smart-commodities-and-rural-projects-for-oregon,"
Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s
U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced four Oregon based
organizations will be receiving awards totaling $100 million to foster partnerships around Oregon to support the production
and marketing of climate-smart commodities. These projects are intended to expand markets for
commodities that are produced with smaller or no carbon footprints, helping
reduce the carbon pollution driving climate chaos and supporting both Oregon
climate-friendly agricultural producers and the businesses that help producers
with climate-smart systems.
 “Agriculture producers play a huge role in Oregon’s economy, and as the stewards of the land and we need to help make sure they have the means and incentives to continue producing and farming
in a sustainable, climate-friendly way,” said Merkley. “These climate-smart awards are an important step forward for Oregon’s agriculture producers—and for our climate.”
“Oregon farmers, ranchers and wood producers have long generated jobs statewide, as well as quality goods sought after nationwide,” Wyden said. “This significant federal investment ensures they can continue to produce those jobs and goods using fresh strategies that fight the climate
crisis in a smart and sustainable manner.”Projects and recipients can be found below:
·       $15 million to Oregon Climate Trust for its TRACT Program Traceable Reforestation project:
A project that addresses the need to expand and recover the nation’s forest
estate to balance the demand for wood products with the increasing need for
forests to serve as carbon reservoirs. Every acre planted & the volume of
forest products generated will have a quantified and verified climate benefit
in metric tons of CO2e.
·       $10 million to Sustainable Northwest for its Building a Regenerative Ranching Economy in
the West project: This project will implement climate-smart grazing practices
in beef production for 120 operations across thirteen states and over 7 million
acres of public and private rangelands, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
increasing market returns for participants.
·       $50 million to Oregon State University (and other universities) for its Climate Smart
Potatoes project: This project will build climate-smart markets and advance
adoption of climate-smart management systems in the Pacific Northwest states of
Idaho, Washington and Oregon where more than 62% of U.S. potatoes are grown and
15% of the domestic supply of seed potatoes are produced.
·       $25 million to Sustainable Northwest for its Building the Climate Smart Wood Economy project: This project brings together Tribal, small family forest, and nonprofit wood producers with data scientists and the design and construction industry to manage and restore tens of thousands of
acres in Oregon. The project will quantify the positive impacts of climate-smart management on carbon sequestration, wildfire intensity, and cultural values, and will also build resources for project teams to navigate climate-smart markets through pre-design, design, and construction phases and
support sale.
Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities is part of USDA’s broader strategy to position
agriculture and forestry as leaders in climate change mitigation through voluntary, incentive-based, market-driven approaches.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-16-million-to-oregon-tribes-to-address-sexual-violence,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that three Oregon tribal
organizations will receive a combined more than $1.6 million from the Office
on Violence Against Women (OVW) to continue to provide victim and intervention
services after sexual violence on tribal land.
“Addressing the
atrocity of sexual violence on tribal land couldn’t be more urgent,” Wyden said.
“I am gratified to see tribal governments getting more resources to build even
stronger services to victims of sexual violence, especially reaffirming tribal
criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian perpetrators. Native Americans are
experiencing sexual assault at twice the rate of any other
racial group. More needs to be done at every level to prevent such violence,
and I will not stop fighting so that victims can get the support and protection
they deserve as they heal and seek accountability for their attackers.”
“Tribal
communities in Oregon are
facing disproportionate
rates of sexual violence. We must do everything in our power to protect people
from sexual assault and abuse, and provide crucial resources to support these
efforts,” Merkley
said.“This funding to
the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Confederated Tribes of
Siletz Indians, and the Klamath Tribes will help provide Tribal governments
with the tools they need to respond to sexual assault and abuse cases, and
ensure perpetrators are held accountable.” 
The
OVW grants provide funding and resources for tribal governments to respond to
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and
stalking in their communities. These grant funds will be allocated as follows:
1.     
The
Klamath Tribes: $447,256 for criminal justice system programs ensure that
victims find safety and justice and that non-Indians who commit sex crimes on
tribal lands are held accountable.
2.     
Columbia
River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission: $650,617 for culturally competent victim
services to prevent, address and adjudicate sexual violence.
3.     
The
Confederated Tribes of the Siletz: $525,000 to create, maintain, and expand
sustainable Tribal sexual assault services.
“We are very
appreciative of the grant funds,” Siletz Tribal Chair Delores Pigsley
said. “VAWA has been underfunded since its inception. The tribe will be more
proactive in our assistance for our members. Thank you Senator Wyden and
Senator Merkley for recognizing the needs of the tribes.”
“Native people who live and fish along the Columbia
River face many social challenges, a situation that is unfortunately common
throughout Indian Country,” said Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish
Commission Executive Director Aja DeCoteau.
“This funding will allow us to continue providing victims of sexual violence
with essential supportive services and culturally-informed prevention programs
that help support stronger, healthier, and safer communities. We appreciate
Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley for their work to secure funding for this
important and much-needed program.”

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced an investment in Eastern Oregon from
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development totaling about $20.5
million to support high-speed internet in Baker, Grant and Malheur counties.
“Quality of life
in rural Oregon requires quality Internet connections that link children
reliably and quickly to educational opportunities as well as small businesses
and farms to their customers,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified that
Baker, Grant and Malheur counties will benefit from this federal investment,
and I’ll keep battling to ensure all of rural Oregon gets the topnotch Internet
access that’s so vital to everyday commerce and convenience.” 
 “I've been
fighting for years to bring broadband to rural Oregon, and with the ways the
COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world, access to reliable, affordable
broadband has become more crucial than ever to the success of our workforce,
students, and communities,” said Senator Merkley. “Improving and
investing in access to high-speed internet—a fundamental need in today’s
connected world—will improve the economy, education, and quality of life for
folks in Baker, Grant, and Malheur counties. I am pleased for these communities
on winning this critical grant, and will continue to work to secure the means
and resources needed so all of Oregon is connected.”
The $10.26
million loan and $10.26 million grant from USDA Rural Development to Oregon
Telephone Corporation will connect an estimated 1,163 Oregonians, 41 businesses,
70 farms and four educational facilities in the three rural counties.
""We have
had plans to build out to these remote, rural communities, and with the
programs offered by USDA through the Rural Utility Service we are able to
greatly accelerate our buildout timelines,” said Dee Dee
Kluser, General Manager for Oregon Telephone Corporation. “We look forward
to providing a reliable, robust fiber service to customers in small communities
including Juntura, Brogan, Dayville and Unity as well as the outlying area
between Mt Vernon and Dayville. We know that fiber connectivity greatly
improves the standard of living, and opens up lots of new doors and
opportunities for people living here.""

Washington, D.C. – U.S.
Senator Ron Wyden this week with Congressman Marc Veasey introduced a
resolution to recognize September as “National Voting Rights Month.”
“The right to
vote in free and fair elections is under increasing threat from Republican
politicians looking to win power at all costs – even if it means
disenfranchising qualified voters,” Wyden said.“Congressman Veasey
and I are standing up for the principle that ensuring all Americans can
exercise their right to vote is the bedrock of democratic government.”
The resolution
will encourage voter registration in the month of September and push Congress
to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to preserve the right to vote amid
Republican-led voter suppression attempts.
This resolution
has been endorsed by five voting rights and civil rights organizations, civil
justice groups, and voting rights activists, including GALEO, League of Women
Voters, Stand Up America, Color of Change, and Voters of Tomorrow.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-25-million-to-oregon-in-housing-vouchers,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that 21 public housing authorities
throughout Oregon will receive a combined more than $2.5 million in additional
housing choice vouchers. These 251 vouchers are in addition to the 44,500
vouchers already in use by Oregon households.
“As we head into
fall and winter, I’m gratified to see more Oregonians get a roof
overhead,” Wyden
said. “Housing is a basic human need. These permanent housing vouchers,
paired with critical services, will help many Oregon families get into
long-term housing. I will continue to fight so that in the wealthiest,
strongest nation on earth, all Oregon families have a warm, safe, affordable
and stable place to call home.” 
“We all need a
safe place to live that we can afford, and Oregonians should not have to
struggle in order to find affordable housing,” Merkley said. “That's
why I'm glad to see these new housing vouchers going to areas that need them
the most. Every Oregonian deserves the right to have a home, and I will continue
fighting to make that a reality in every corner of our state.”
Housing
choice vouchers allow very low-income families to choose and lease decent, and
affordable privately-owned rental housing. The Housing
Choice Voucher (HCV) Program provides housing assistance to over 2.3
million American families. These funds will be added to the funding Oregon
already receives for vouchers, which help house tens of thousands of low income
Oregon households, and will be allocated as follows:

“Our
housing affordability crisis demands a response from all levels of government,” says Clackamas
County Commissioner Sonya Fischer. “I am so pleased that HUD will be
providing additional vouchers that will help families who experience
homelessness or domestic violence find safe, stable housing. It is only by us
all working together that we will make homelessness rare, non-reoccurring, and
brief.”
“The
flexible Housing Choice Voucher Program, that places the choice of housing in
the hands of the individual family, is critical in the fight against
homelessness. Thanks to Sen. Ron Wyden’s steadfast efforts and those of the
rest of Oregon’s federal delegation, more of our most vulnerable neighbors in
Washington County will receive the support they need to find an affordable
home,”
Washington County Chair Kathryn Harrington said.
“This
is a fantastic and timely opportunity for the affordable housing community
overall to provide assistance to more households that qualify for rent
assistance. There is such need in our communities, and this is one great way to
help meet it. We applaud the work to make it happen,” said Monica
Foucher at Home Forward.
“Homes
for Good has always been proactively supported by Senator Wyden and Senator
Merkley and this new allocation of Housing Choice Vouchers is another example
of the support we will continue to receive that addressed the affordable
housing crisis that people in our community are experiencing,” said Jacob Fox,
Executive Director of Homes for Good. "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-three-oregon-fire-departments-to-receive-about-38-million-in-federal-aid2022,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that the Scappoose Rural Fire
District as well as the cities of Portland and Albany will receive a total of
about $3.8 million in federal funds to support local firefighting operations.
“Firefighters
put their lives on the line protecting Oregon communities, and deserve both
modern equipment and properly staffed departments to do the risky work that
Oregonians count on,”
Wyden said. “I’m gratified these communities have secured this crucial
federal investment, and will keep fighting to secure similar resources that
protect lives and livelihoods throughout the state.”
“Oregon’s firefighters are on the front lines of
protecting our homes, communities, and businesses when fires and emergencies
happen, and it is crucial they have enough staff and the right up-to-date
equipment to safely and effectively do this important work,” said Senator Merkley. “This funding will help
ensure that the dedicated firefighters in Albany, Portland, and Scappoose are
well equipped and staffed to keep Oregonians safe year round.” 
From the
Department of Homeland Security, the city of Albany has secured a $1.33 million
award from the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER)
program to hire firefighters, and the city of Portland has secured $2.07
million from the same SAFER program also to hire firefighters.
“The City of Albany is experiencing significant
growth, and we continue to face pressures on our budget,” said Albany City
Manager Peter Troedsson.  “We’re
grateful for these federal funds which will help us to keep up with growth and
continue to provide important emergency services to the people of our
community.”
“Portland Fire
& Rescue is grateful to Portland City Council, Portland Firefighters
Association, and Senators Wyden and Merkley for their support of our 2021 SAFER
grant application,” said
Portland Fire & Rescue Chief Sara Boone.  “These funds will enable
PF&R to hire six firefighters to fully staff Station 23 with an engine
company which will strengthen our system of emergency response service
delivery.  Station 23 was shut down in 2010 and partially reopened in 2017
with a two-person rescue unit to address priority medical calls. With the SAFER
grant we will be able to restore fire protection capabilities to this fire
management area.” 
“Our
firefighters step up in every way they are asked to serve Portlanders, so I am
incredibly excited that we will be bringing in over $2 million in federal funds
to Portland Fire & Rescue,” said Portland Fire & Rescue
Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty. “Senator Merkley and Senator Wyden have once
again delivered for our city and have my thanks for securing dollars that will
allow us to fully reopen Station 23 in Southeast Portland, as well as hire six
new firefighters to bolster our ranks.”
The Scappoose
Rural Fire Department has earned a $399,038 grant for vehicle acquisition from
the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-11-million-to-metro-area-schools-for-on-campus-child-care,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S.
Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that Portland State
University (PSU) and Portland Community College (PCC) will receive a combined
more than $1.1 million from the U.S. Department of Education to provide
on-campus child care for low-income students who are parents.
“Parenting
while pursuing higher education is incredibly challenging,
so alleviating the added cost and
commute time of off-campus child
care provides parenting students a lifeline at PSU and
PCC,” Wyden
said. “With the costs of child care skyrocketing and scarce supply of
licensed care slots in the Portland Metro region, families without means are
often left scrambling. On-campus child care will really make the difference for
many Oregon families.”
“Higher
education has the ability to connect students with opportunities to thrive and
build stronger communities and economies, but far too often obstacles keep
people from taking this route, including finding affordable child care,” Merkley said.
“This funding for on-campus child care at PCC and PSU will provide many Oregon
parents with the peace of mind in knowing that their children are being well
cared-for so they can pursue higher education.” 
The
U.S. Dept. of Education’s Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program
supports low-income parenting students in postsecondary education by providing
campus-based child care services. PSU will receive $572,360 and PCC will
receive $618,556.
“Portland
Community College is grateful to receive CCAMPIS funding, for many
parents, affordable childcare is a barrier to higher education and
graduation. This funding will bolster childcare programs on PCC
campuses and provide additional wrap-around support, allowing more
student parents to persist and complete their degrees and attain greater
economic mobility,”
said PCC President Dr. Adrien Bennings 
""Portland
State University serves a richly diverse student population in terms of race,
age and background,"" said PSU President Stephen Percy. ""A
quarter of our student population have children so providing on-campus options
for child care is extremely important for their success in the classroom.
We're grateful for this funding to support those students and help PSU to
continue to provide safe and engaging environments for their children.""

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-crapo-stabenow-daines-unveil-mental-health-workforce-enhancement-discussion-draft,"
Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Senator Debbie Stabenow
(D-Mich.) and Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) today released a discussion draft
of legislation aimed at expanding the mental health workforce to make it easier
for Americans to get mental health care when they need it. The Senators also
committed to pursue opportunities for public-private partnerships to help meet
the nation’s mental health care needs. 
“There is an enormous need all across
the country for mental and behavioral health care, but there aren’t nearly
enough providers to meet that demand. These proposals are about training new
providers and finding opportunities to do more with the mental health workforce
we already have,” Wyden
said. “I’m excited about what organizers
of an innovative public-private partnership between the University of Oregon
and Connie and Steve Ballmer are working on to build out.  They are
launching a four-year program in my hometown of Portland that has the potential
to take a big bite out of the provider shortage we are seeing in Oregon and all
over the nation.”
“This approach will be instrumental in
solving this challenge by getting private contributions into the game and
wringing more value out of taxpayer dollars,” Wyden said.
“Both sides of the Finance Committee are committed to this mental health
initiative—both addressing emergent mental health issues and building a
foundation to provide mental health support in Oregon’s youngest—and I want to
thank Ranking Member Crapo and Senators Stabenow and Daines who were
instrumental in writing this draft. The committee’s going to keep at it in the
coming weeks and months ahead to release drafts related to crisis care and
making mental health parity a reality in federal programs.”
“Maintaining a strong mental health workforce with the
capacity to care for all who need services is crucial, particularly as health
care professional burnout, steep regulatory demands, and other strains
jeopardize long-term provider retention and capacity,” Crapo said.  “By
investing in our workforce, we can foster a more resilient, accessible mental
health system.”
“Earlier this year, we came together to pass
transformative community mental health care for the country. Now we must invest
in the workforce that is needed to achieve our goals of quality mental health
and addiction services for all Americans who need them. Thank you to Senator
Daines, Chairman Wyden, and Ranking Member Crapo for being great partners and
committing to get this done,” said Stabenow.
“Access to mental health services is critical for our
rural communities and veterans—especially in states like Montana, where we
unfortunately have one of the highest suicide rates in the nation,” Daines
said. “We must ensure our health care workforce have the tools and resources
they need to serve Montanans across our state. I’m glad to work on a bipartisan
plan to empower and expand the mental health care workforce which will help
ensure that no matter where you live, you have access to life-saving mental
health services.”
The discussion draft includes policies that would:
This discussion draft on the
mental health workforce is the third legislative draft the Finance Committee
has released since kicking off its bipartisan mental health initiative. The first, released
in May, focused on telehealth policies. The second, released
in June, focused on youth mental health. Other discussion drafts may be
released. The committee is committed to fully paying for any mental health
package with bipartisan, consensus-driven offsets.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-urges-for-senate-passage-of-the-disclose-act,"I’m pleased to join several of my Democratic colleagues on the floor to talk about the DISCLOSE Act. There’s one element of the bill that I want to focus on briefly this afternoon. The country is now about a month and a half out from election day. In Oregon and all across the country, Americans are getting bludgeoned with political advertising each and every time they turn on the television or the radio or watch a video online. It is a nasty, aggravating, inescapable part of life in America ever since John Roberts and the other Republicans on the Supreme Court opened the floodgates to dark money in our elections. In fact, all this toxic political advertising is no longer confined to the weeks or months before election day. It’s year round, all the time. It’s ad after ad predicting doom based on a bill up for debate in Congress, or a candidate running for election. I can tell you firsthand. This year, Big Pharma threw the kitchen sink at me with their attack ads because of the effort here in the Senate to finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. In short, the bill I proposed, and that the Senate eventually passed, was an effort to do something about the years and years of price gouging by drug companies. It was overwhelmingly supported by health policy experts and by the American people. But based on Big Pharma’s attack ads, you’d think the bill was going to send us back to the medicine of the Dark Ages, bloodletting and leeches. Absolute nonsense beamed directly into everybody’s living rooms and offices. And this is happening all the time. A little of my own history on this issue. Twenty years ago I wrote the original “Stand By Your Ad” law. It said that politicians would have to put their name behind their attack ads going after their opponents. That law worked well, and it’s still on the books today. But it means less in the era of Dark Money. The people paying for Dark Money ads aren’t required to put their names behind what they’re saying. That’s a huge blow against transparency in our democracy. Oregonians and people all across the country are rightfully disgusted by it. Those of us who are here having these debates every day recognize a Big Pharma ad when we see one. But the people back home are just looking for some entertainment at the end of a long day of work. They shouldn’t be forced to wonder what corporation or special interest is funding the ads that come from murky groups with names like “The Coalition for Prosperity and Justice.”If you believe in your argument, you ought to stand up and put your name behind your ad. Otherwise the American people are left in the dark, and that’s not how democracy is supposed to work. The DISCLOSE Act includes an expansion of my Stand By Your Ad law. It would require the heads of corporations, unions or other organizations to identify when they’re behind political ads the same way politicians do under the original version of the law. It treats everybody the same — groups on the right, groups on the left. This is just common sense stuff — hardly a radical, left-wing proposal. The American people ought to know who’s trying to influence their votes.  Considering that Stand By Your Ad used to be a bipartisan proposition, it’s shameful that Republicans have protected dark money and blocked the DISCLOSE Act for a decade. I’m happy to join my colleagues to talk about this issue today. We’re going to keep fighting to get this bill passed. And the American people need to vote this November for more transparency in our government. ###Keith Chu (Wyden) (202) 224-5244"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-government-watchdogs-must-investigate-warrantless-purchases-of-americans-internet-browsing-data-by-federal-agencies,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today requested the inspectors general for the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice to investigate the warrantless purchase and use of American’s web browsing records, based on evidence in public records and from a government whistleblower.In a letter to three Inspectors General, Wyden revealed that public contracting records and a Defense Department whistleblower provided new details about the extent of federal internet record purchases.  Although the Defense Department previously refused to provide Wyden with public answers about whether it purchases browsing records, publicly available government contracts show multiple federal agencies have purchased access to internet metadata, including U.S. Cyber Command, the Army, the Navy’s Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.S. Secret Service also has contracts with the same data broker, according to public records.“According to the whistleblower, NCIS is purchasing access to data, which includes netflow records and some communications content, from Team Cymru, a data broker whose data sales I have previously investigated,” Wyden wrote.Netflow records reveal which servers users connect to, which can often reveal the specific websites they visit. Public records indicate multiple other agencies purchase and use netflow records from the same data broker, Wyden wrote. “I request that your offices investigate the warrantless purchase and use of Americans’ internet browsing records by the agencies under your jurisdictions,” Wyden wrote. “Your independent oversight must ensure that the government’s surveillance activities are consistent with the Supreme Court’s Carpenter decision and safeguard Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights.”Wyden has spent years investigating how government agencies purchase Americans’ private information. His efforts confirmed that the Defense Intelligence Agency, Customs and Border Protection and other federal agencies purchased personal data without warrants or court oversight.Read the full letter here. ###Keith Chu (Wyden) (202) 224-5244"

Eshoo, D-Calif., today led a bicameral effort urging the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to upgrade its privacy practices to protect the personal information of .US users.Domain registration information contains highly sensitive personal information. These records include names, email addresses, physical addresses and phone numbers. Domain name users can be anyone, including journalists, activists and public interest, political and religious organizations.“It is highly concerning that NTIA, since at least 2005, has not directed its contractors administering .US to adopt any protections for this sensitive information. The automatic public disclosure of users’ personal information puts them at enhanced risk for becoming victims of identity theft, spamming, spoofing, doxxing, online harassment, and even physical harm,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent to NTIA Assistant Secretary and Administrator, Alan Davidson. “.US should be a model of the United States’ values with regard to online privacy and expression. In addition to putting users at risk of abuse of their information, the current lack of privacy protections chills vibrant expression and important speech online. Anonymity is a necessary component of the American right to free speech.”There is little evidence that the continued public disclosure of this information makes the global internet any less safe or secure. In fact, despite the domain industry increasing privacy protections for users over the last several years, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has recently observed that the number of domains responsible for phishing, malware, spam and botnets has declined.  In their letter, the lawmakers highlighted appropriate measures NTIA could implement to correct for decades of inaction to protect privacy in .US, including:NTIA has the opportunity to model a more secure and private system for registering internet domains through its control of .US, the members wrote. Adding new privacy protections to .US could provide a global model for privacy best-practices for protecting domain name user data.The letter was co-signed by U.S. Senators Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and U.S. Representatives Ted Lieu, D-Calif., Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., and Stephen F.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/on-national-voter-registration-day-wyden-merkley-co-sponsor-legislation-to-make-registering-to-vote-easier-for-all-americans,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley joined with colleagues today on National Voter Registration Day to co-sponsor two pieces
of legislation that would make it easier for Americans to register to vote and
to know their registration status. 
The Same
Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same-day
registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop
Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE
VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting
rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter
is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is
removed. These bills were included as part of the Freedom to Vote Act,
voting rights legislation led by U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and supported by
Wyden, Merkley and all Democratic senators.
“A vibrant and thriving democracy in our country needs a
voter registration system that encourages participation,”
Wyden said. “These bills achieve that goal by removing outdated and unjust
roadblocks that limit the opportunities for Americans to cast a ballot for the
candidate of their choice and to weigh in on local and state measures that
directly affect their lives.”  
“Voting is at the heart of our democracy, yet
Americans continue to face voter suppression that makes it harder for people to
engage in the process, especially when it comes to registering and staying
registered to vote,” said
Senator Merkley. “Creating same-day
registration and prohibiting the purging of eligible voters will help protect
every American’s opportunity to cast a vote no matter where they live in the
country.”
The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: ·            
Require states to offer same day registration at polling locations
on Election Day and during any early voting period; ·            
Require states to offer same day registration at all polling
places by the 2026 general election, but create a waiver process to give states
until the 2028 general election to comply if earlier compliance would be
impracticable.·            
Mandate that states have at least one location per 15,000
registered voters with same day registration by the 2024 general election; and·            
Ensure that centralized same day registration locations are
reasonably located to serve the voting population equitably. 
In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the Same Day Voter
Registration Act introduced by Klobuchar is cosponsored by Senators Ed
Markey (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth
Warren (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD),
Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory
Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA),
Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Angus King (I-ME), and Dianne
Feinstein (D-CA).
The SAVE VOTERS Act would:·            
Amend the National Voter Registration Act to prohibit states
from removing people from voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective
and reliable evidence that a person is ineligible to vote. The legislation
would clarify that failure to vote or respond to election mail would not
constitute objective and reliable evidence of a voter’s ineligibility to vote;·            
Allow election officials to use state records to remove voters who
have died or permanently moved out of the state;·            
Require election officials to send a notice explaining the grounds
for removal within 48 hours of removing voters from the rolls and provide
public notice within 48 hours after any general program to remove voters; and·            
Revise the voting procedure for a voter who failed to report a
change of address by allowing a voter who moved within a state to vote at the
polling place of the voter's current address or at a central location in the
jurisdiction of the local voter registration office.
In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the Save Voters Act introduced
by Klobuchar is cosponsored by Markey, Warren, Casey, Smith, Van Hollen,
Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Sanders, Hirono, Booker, Murphy, Kaine, Menendez, and
King.
Both bills are endorsed by Democracy 21, Transparency
International U.S., End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Common
Cause, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic
Social Justice, 20/20 Vision DC, Voices for Progress, and League of Women

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-demand-answers-about-the-collection-and-potential-disclosure-of-womens-reproductive-health-information,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator
Ron Wyden today joined Senate colleagues to call on Heartbeat International, an
anti-abortion organization that supports thousands of crisis pregnancy centers
(CPCs) across the country, to answer questions about its collection and
use of women’s personal data, including sensitive health care information.
 “Heartbeat International – which is
explicitly opposed to abortion rights – appears to be in a position to collect
a significant amount of personal information from women about their pregnancies
and potential plans for managing their care, but it is not under any legal
obligation to maintain the confidentiality of this information, or keep it out
of the hands of abortion bounty hunters,” Wyden and colleagues wrote to
the President of Heartbeat International, Jor-El Godsey. 
“We fear that, in the wake of the
Supreme Court’s Dobbs
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that stripped women
of their right to an abortion, this information may be used to put women’s
health and freedom to choose in jeopardy, and to put them and their health care
providers at risk of criminal penalties,” Wyden
and colleagues warned.
Heartbeat International’s vision “is to
make abortion unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations.” To
accomplish that goal, the organization has invested in a data collection system
to keep track of personal information, including individuals’ names, addresses,
phone numbers, and reproductive health information. CPCs and similar
organizations are not legitimate medical facilities and therefore are not
subject to the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), raising
significant privacy concerns.
Following the Supreme Court’s decision
to overturn Roe v. Wade
and the introduction of a national abortion ban by Senator Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., Wyden and colleagues expressed concern about the sensitive health
information Heartbeat International and its affiliate CPCs collect from women
who believe they can seek legitimate abortion and reproductive health care
services at these facilities.
Wyden is also the co-lead of the My
Body, My Data Act, which would create the strongest-ever protections
for reproductive health data.
The letter was led by U.S. Senator
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Alongside Wyden, the letter was signed by U.S.
Senators Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Cory Booker, D-N.J., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Ed
Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

residents of Lake, Wheeler and Wallowa counties.
Heading into these
upcoming virtual town halls, Wyden has held 1,024 town halls statewide in
fulfillment of his pledge to hold at least one town hall each year in each of
Oregon’s 36 counties.
“Listening to Oregonians’
priorities in town halls like these in Lake, Wheeler and Wallowa counties is
crucial to public service and representing every part of our state,” Wyden
said. “Thanks to Oregonians’ commitment to direct democracy, I’ve been
honored to keep my promise to hold town halls each year in each of Oregon’s 36
counties. I had my 1,000th town hall in Oregon earlier this
year, and I’ll always keep providing these opportunities for any Oregonian to
ask me any question.”
“Our democracy is stronger
and better when lawmakers meet regularly with their constituents, and we
congratulate Senator Wyden on his 1,000th town hall earlier this year
representing the people of Oregon,” said Nathan
Williams of People's Town Hall, a virtual town hall series from the founders of
Town Hall Project. “People's Town Hall invites all constituents in
these three Oregon counties, regardless of party affiliation, to join the
upcoming substantive conversations so vital to our democracy.""

U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announced a total of $3,282,231 in
federal grants to help protect Oregonians from domestic violence and stalking
and to support survivors.  
 “All of us want to feel safe in our homes and as we go about our lives, and these grants will help protect
more Oregonians from domestic violence,” said Merkley.? “I’ll continue working to secure resources that provide safety, support, and protection for people in these situations.” 
?“The awful threat of domestic violence undermines the safety of far too many households and
communities in Oregon and nationwide,” Wyden said. “I’m glad Grant and Clatsop counties as well as the state have earned these federal funds to reduce the risks of these crimes, and I’ll keep battling to secure similar resources throughout Oregon.”

Formula Grant Program 
The STOP Formula
Grant Program encourages partnerships between law enforcement, prosecution,
courts, and victim services organizations to enhance victim safety and hold
offenders accountable in cases of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual
assault, and stalking. The goal of the grant program is to develop and
strengthen law enforcement, prosecution, and court strategies to combat violent
crimes against women and to develop and strengthen victim services, including
community-based, culturally specific services, in cases involving domestic
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. ? 
1.      $636,815 to Grant County — Rural Program 
2.      $695,519 to Clatsop County — Rural Program 
?Rural Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Program funds are used
to support programs that: a) identify, assess, and appropriately respond to child, youth, and adult victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in rural communities; b) establish and expand victim services in rural communities for child, youth, and adult victims; and/or c) increase the safety and well-being of women and children in rural communities by dealing directly and immediately with domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and creating and implementing strategies to increase awareness and prevent these crimes.  
Grantees must use at least one of the following strategies in implementing their projects: a)
implement, expand, and establish cooperative efforts and projects among law enforcement officers, prosecutors, victim service providers, and other related parties to investigate and prosecute incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; b) provide treatment, counseling,
advocacy, legal assistance, and other long- and short-term assistance to adult and minor victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in rural communities; c) work in cooperation with the community to develop education and prevention strategies directed toward such issues; d) develop, enlarge, or strengthen programs addressing sexual assault; and e) develop programs and strategies that focus on the specific needs of victims who reside in remote rural and geographically isolated areas. ?? 
“Heart of Grant County is grateful for this funding as it will expand our ability to provide much needed support to survivors of domestic and personal trauma, especially those who have been sexually assaulted,” said Beth Simonsen, Executive Director, Heart of Grant County. 
 “It's an honor to be awarded this funding from The Office for Violence Against Women, and The Harbor is so excited to partner with the Astoria Birth Center to increase programs, services, and access to
culturally-responsive care for Clatsop County survivors of sexual assault. Survivors are often told that they will need to go to Portland—over 2 hours one way—in order to receive care because there isn't a qualified medical professional available at either hospital in Clatsop County. This funding and
partnership will help ensure that sexual assault survivors have 24/7 access to trauma-informed, confidential forensic and medical exams, including access to medical providers that speak Spanish, and LGBTQIA+ affirming care,” said Terri Steenbergen, Executive Director of The Harbor.“With overwhelming gratitude, because of this grant Astoria Birth Center & Family Medicine
will be able to offer an unprecedented level of support to this community. For the first time, sexual assault survivors in this region will have the opportunity to receive 24/7 access to English or Spanish SANE examinations and support in a calm, peaceful, out-of-hospital setting. This grant furthers the
important work carried out by certified nurse midwives, survivors, and the advocates at The Harbor who work together to break cycles of abuse and create healthy families,” said Rebeckah Orton, Founder/Owner, Astoria Birth Center & Family Medicine.

Worse, these devices are searched without warrants, and travelers are often not informed of their rights before their phones are searched. Calling these procedures “egregious violations” of Americans’ rights, Wyden demanded immediate reforms to searches at the border. “Innocent Americans should not be tricked into unlocking their phones and laptops,” Wyden wrote. “CBP should not dump data obtained through thousands of warrantless phone searches into a central database, retain the data for fifteen years, and allow thousands of DHS employees to search through Americans’ personal data whenever they want.”Sensitive information, including text messages, call logs, contact lists, and in some cases, photos and other private records are stored in the CBP database, CBP officials told Wyden’s office. Despite the sensitive nature of these records, government personnel searching the data are not asked to record the purpose of the search, which is an important safeguard against abuse, Wyden wrote. CBP did not provide Wyden’s office with statistics on the total number of Americans whose data has been stored in this database or how frequently the database is searched by government personnel.Wyden has led efforts to protect Americans’ rights and privacy, both from unnecessary government surveillance and from unscrupulous corporations.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-speaks-out-against-republican-proposal-for-nationwide-abortion-ban,"M. President, there’s a lot to say about the latest radical proposal restricting the right to an abortion for every woman in this country. I’m going to focus on a few key points. First of all, Senator Graham and the Republicans want the American people to believe this is a “moderate” proposal. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This is a national abortion ban. This is exactly what Republicans had in mind when they hand-picked Supreme Court nominees to overturn Roe versus Wade. Senator Graham’s bill restricts abortion rights even earlier than my Senate Republican colleagues have proposed in the past. Even earlier in pregnancy than many of the most life-threatening complications are discovered. This bill puts women’s lives in danger. There’s nothing moderate about it. A moderate bill would not institute criminal penalties for doctors providing life-saving medical care. This bill does. A moderate bill would not take rights away from American women, no matter where they live. This bill does.A moderate bill would not create a presumption of women’s guilt by requiring them to report a rape or seek counseling before they can get an abortion. This bill does. Think about that. Under Senator Graham’s new restrictions, a 12 year old rape victim -- regardless of the terror she feels or the danger she faces -- could have to find a way to report her assault to police before she could get the care she needs. That is a shocking and unconscionable overreach. Colleagues, the reality is, this is an extreme proposal that is WAY out of step with the overwhelming opinion of the American people on women’s rights and abortion. Let’s remember, most of my Republican colleagues used to talk about the importance of states’ rights -- leaving the decisions on abortion to the states. Well, Senator Graham has shown that all that talk about states rights was every bit as disingenuous as Democrats warned. His bill tramples on the rights of Oregonians, and people in many other states, women and men, who have voted to protect abortion, women’s health care and women’s individual freedoms. Senator Graham’s bill is about government having control over women’s bodies.It’s also clear that what comes next is a nationwide ban on all abortions, criminalization, and women and doctors locked behind bars.  It’s election season, and Senator McConnell wants everybody to forget that Republicans' top priorities include passing these extreme restrictions through Congress and the courts. The American people know better. When it comes to Republican legislation on abortion rights, the far right calls the shots. They want a total ban, they want criminalization, and they want women’s freedoms curtailed.Senator Graham’s bill is the next step in that direction for Republicans. Introducing his proposal, Senator Graham said:“If we take back the House and Senate, I can assure you that we’ll have a vote on our bill.”On that issue, people ought to take him at his word. And that means the American people must vote in November to guarantee that this bill never sees the light of day. I yield the floor. ###"

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that four Oregon fire departments

Firefighters Grants (AFG) for crucial operations, safety and vehicle costs.
“Local
firefighters who have been working hard this past week and year-round to
protect lives and livelihoods throughout Oregon deserve topnotch equipment to
stay safe while they’re putting themselves at risk,” Wyden said. “This
federal investment in Oregon is especially timely given firefighters’ heroic
work this summer battling blazes, and I’ll keep fighting to make sure
firefighters have the resources they need to continue to protect communities
across the state.”
“Oregon’s

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-colleagues-push-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care,"
Washington,
D.C. –
U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today with colleagues called on the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to strengthen federal
privacy protections about abortion and other reproductive services, bolster
enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and
ensure patients understand their rights. 
“Our nation
faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have
already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is
critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy
and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” the
senators wrote in their letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.
The senators
urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under
the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly
restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information
without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal
proceedings over accessing abortion care. The push from the senators comes as
legislators and prosecutors across the country have sought to enforce
Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and
providing abortion care. In the wake of theDobbs decision,
Becerra pledged in June to work to protect
patient and provider privacy.
“To safeguard
the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel
safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to
quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for
reproductive health information,” urged the senators.“In particular,
HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities
from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit
consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings
premised on the provision of abortion care.”
Since the Dobbs decision,
the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among
health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’
health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion
fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking
the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be
weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought
to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care.

Murray, D-Wash., led the letter. Along with Wyden and Merkley, the letter was
co-signed by Senators Baldwin, D-Wis., Blumenthal, D-Conn., Booker, D-N.J.,

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-180000-to-oregon-state-university-for-pest-control-research-in-hops-plants,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced that Oregon State University (OSU)
will receive more than $180,000 to research and develop management strategies
for the fusarium canker fungus killing hops in Oregon, Washington and
Idaho.
“Since 98% of
U.S. hops are grown right here in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon State
University’s topnotch researchers are well-positioned to provide key insights
into how to manage the growing threat this fungus poses,” Wyden said.
“I am gratified to see these dollars go toward protecting hops production, as
Oregon’s thriving hop production and brewing industries are key players in our
state’s job creation, economic growth and tourism.” 
 “If you like beer,
you should love this grant,” said
Senator Merkley. “Oregon’s thriving hops industry
supports brewers large and small here in Oregon and across the nation and is a
strong driver of Oregon’s economy. I look forward to seeing how OSU uses this
funding to study the fungus that is threatening hop crops to help protect this
vital industry for our state and beyond.” 
A fungus
called fusarium canker has been an increasingly greater threat to hop
production in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, which produce 98% of U.S. hops.
OSU will use the $182,633 in federal funds to study the fungus in order to manage its spread in
commercial yards and propagative rootstock material. Researchers will work with
hop producers to reduce the fusarium canker threat for U.S. hop
production in the Pacific Northwest.
“A fungus that causes a disease
called fusarium canker has been an increasingly greater threat to hop
production in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, which produce 98% of U.S. hop
cones that are used for brewing beer,” said Dr. Cynthia Ocamb, Extension Plant
Pathologist in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology at OSU. “There
is very little known about the disease, so these funds will allow OSU to study
the fungus alongside USDA scientists and hop growers in order to manage its
spread in commercial hop yards and propagative rootstock material throughout
the Pacific Northwest.”

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-oregon-the-first-state-to-earn-federal-approval-for-medicaid-reimbursement-of-mobile-crisis-intervention-services,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator
Ron Wyden today announced that Oregon is the first state to earn federal
approval for Medicaid reimbursement of community-based mobile crisis
intervention services that help people struggling with mental health and
substance use disorders. 
The
approval by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of Oregon’s
Medicaid state plan amendment to provide qualifying mobile crisis intervention
services is the first since the American Rescue Plan became law last year. 
And
this approach reworking law enforcement by sending trained mental health
responders to a mental health crisis instead of police marks another key step
in Wyden’s work to extend the successful mobile crisis intervention model
pioneered in Eugene -- with the CAHOOTS program operated by the White Bird
Clinic -- throughout Oregon and the country.
 “This
great news for Oregon clearly demonstrates how our state continues to lead the
nation when it comes to reimagining a more humane and effective response for
people in a mental health crisis,” said Wyden, Chair of the Senate Finance
Committee. “In the true spirit of the “Oregon Way” focusing on smart
solutions, CAHOOTS has long proven a success at de-escalating these crises by
getting people the mental health help they need without involving law
enforcement.”
 “I
worked to get federal resources in the American Rescue Plan so state Medicaid
agencies like Oregon’s could secure planning grants that put them in position
for major milestones like today’s that advance on the groundbreaking path
pioneered in Eugene,” Wyden said. 
Wyden
said today’s CMS announcement means Oregon is the first of the 20 states that
received those planning grants to qualify for a higher federal Medicaid match
of 85 percent for the next three years to reimburse mobile crisis services
delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries.
 
“That
stepped-up federal investment makes it much easier and cost-effective or local
communities to build CAHOOTS-like programs tailored to their needs,” he said. “And
I’m going to keep working with the state and the federal government to ensure
Oregon cities and counties interested in this fresh approach to crisis response
continue to get the resources they need.”

especially timely given firefighters’ heroic work this summer battling blazes
that still threaten our state. I’ll keep battling to make sure firefighters
have the resources they need now and in the years ahead.”
“Oregon’s firefighters work tirelessly, risking
their lives to keep our homes, businesses, and communities safe— it is
imperative that they receive the federal support needed to do this important
work,” said
Senator Merkley. “This funding will help ensure that the dedicated
firefighters across the state are well equipped and prepared to keep protecting
the Oregonians they serve in every corner of our State.”

people, though, that’s reality. This funding for Centro will strengthen the
ability of farming communities in Washington County to deliver the nutritious
food that families need right there in their own communities for years to come.
I am looking forward to seeing the benefits this funding brings.” 
The
$366,150 grant for Centro Cultural is from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture Community Food
Projects competitive grant program. The federal program works to meet the food
needs of low-income individuals through food distribution, community outreach
to assist in participation in federally assisted nutrition programs, or
improving access to food as part of a comprehensive service. 
""Centro is thrilled to build a partnership
with the USDA to continue our mission of serving working people in Oregon
with quality services,” said Maria Rubio, Executive Director of Centro
Cultural. “This award from the USDA will
give us the ability to meaningfully increase access to culturally specific organic
foods in our Centro Mercado food pantry year round.""

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-over-41-million-to-strengthen-oregons-mass-timber-industry,"


















Washington, D.C. – Today, Oregon’s U.S. Senators
Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden announced that the Oregon Mass Timber Coalition will
receive over $41 million from the federal Economic Development Administration
(EDA) as one of 21 American Rescue Plan Build Back Better Regional Challenge
(BBBRC) winners.  
Oregon Mass Timber Coalition, led by the Port of Portland, will use the funding to implement
projects across the state to expand the regional mass timber industry cluster,
which creates engineered high-value building materials from wood. Mass timber
has the potential to substantially reduce carbon pollution compared to concrete
and steel and is seismically resilient and fire resistant.
The coalition is
planning projects to research, prototype, and commercialize prefabricated mass
timber housing systems. The proposed projects
are primarily focused on creating a manufacturing facility, workforce education
and training, and building facilities that support research and development. Together,
these efforts will create good jobs and economic growth while addressing the
shortage of affordable housing. 
“Mass timber is an exciting innovation with huge
untapped potential. Accelerating affordable housing production, providing good
jobs, sequestering carbon, and restoring forest health will provide immense
benefits for Oregonians as we seek to construct more energy efficient buildings
for the future using all tools available to us,” said Merkley. “I’m glad
to see the federal government step up to support this quintessential Oregon
project, bringing together a broad group of partners to address multiple
challenges at once with an innovative solution that will support jobs in our
woods, our timber mills, and our cities alike.” 
“This
federal investment shows how Oregon continues leading the way in modernizing
wood products, generating jobs and economic opportunities in communities
statewide,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified that the Oregon Mass Timber
Coalition has earned these resources from the American Rescue Plan for fresh
approaches to our state’s signature timber industry. And I’ll keep fighting for
similar investments in Oregon to support these valuable new sources for jobs,
affordable housing and building materials.”
These awards are intended to assist the Oregon Mass
Timber Coalition in using mass timber to accelerate affordable housing
production, provide good jobs, and restore forest health. The projects funded
as part of this award include working with forest-dependent rural communities
to grow access to wood fiber, facilitate a wood-based products workforce
development program, provide resources to university R&D programs
conducting design and prototyping of new construction materials, and assist
state agencies in creating a favorable regulatory framework to accommodate
modular mass timber homes in rural and wildlife-impacted communities. 
The BBBRC is an unprecedented competitive federal
grant program that provides each regional coalition with significant
investments to tackle a wide variety of projects – including entrepreneurial
support, workforce development, infrastructure, and innovation – to
drive inclusive economic growth.

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden
and Jeff Merkley today announced that three Oregon fire districts will receive
a combined nearly $100,000 in federal Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG).
“Every day, firefighters in local
fire districts—both union and volunteer—put their lives on the line to protect
our communities in Oregon,” Wyden
said. “Local firefighters have been on the front lines of fire season
this year and every year. They deserve the equipment and training to do their
jobs to the best of their abilities so that our friends, neighbors, and loved
ones can continue to stay safe.”
“Oregon’s
firefighters work tirelessly, risking their lives to keep our homes and
communities safe. It is crucial for local fire districts to have the resources
they need,” Merkley said.  “This
funding will ensure that the dedicated firefighters in Coos Bay, Siletz, and
Sheridan are well equipped and prepared to keep protecting the Oregonians they
serve.”
AFG grants help firefighters and
first responders obtain essential resources to enhance their response
capabilities and to more effectively protect the health and safety of the
public and emergency response personnel from fire and other related hazards. The
Oregon communities receiving these grants are as follows:·       City of Coos Bay - $32,380
·       Siletz Rural Fire Protection
District - $34,238
·       Sheridan Fire District - $35,238
“Without
this support, many communities – including Coos Bay – would be forced to
utilize tools that are obsolete. Coos Bay Fire Department will replace our
outdated Thermal Imaging Cameras (TIC). These TICs allow firefighters to see
through smoke and low light environments to find hot spots or even victims by
using the temperature differences to create a picture. The firefighters of Coos
Bay are keenly aware of the value of this tool since it was 20 years ago
(November 25, 2002) that three Coos Bay firefighters were killed in a fire. The
following investigation revealed that having Thermal Imaging Cameras may likely
have prevented this tragedy.  The FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grant
program is a vital partnership with our nation’s fire service agencies;
providing the support needed to serve their communities. I would like to thank
Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, as well as our other elected officials
that have fought to continue funding this important FEMA grant,” said Mark R. Anderson, Fire
Chief Coos Bay Fire Department

I am also deeply troubled by accusations that foreign companies and governments may have had access to Americans' private data. I've introduced bipartisan legislation to address the national security risks of foreign companies getting our data, and remain deeply committed to passing it in light of these new accusations.""###Keith Chu (202) 228-2717"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announcemajorinvestments-in-the-klamath-basin,"
Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and
Ron Wyden today announced that the Department of the Interior (DOI) is
investing nearly $26 million in the Klamath Basin through the first
year of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The projects include nearly $16
million for ecosystem restoration and $10 million to expand the Klamath Falls
National Fish Hatchery.
The Bureau of Reclamation, in
collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, will also fund
an additional $2.2 million in grants to improve fish and wildlife habitat for
coho salmon in the basin.
This historic federal funding comes at a critical time in the
Klamath Basin, as water deliveries for irrigation are ceasing amid another year
of extreme drought. The investments mark a major step forward for federal
agencies, state partners, Klamath Basin tribes, and agricultural producers who
are working together to realize long-term solutions.
“The Klamath Basin has fought
to survive back-to-back summers of the worst drought in memory. From businesses
and families to fish and wildlife, the impact of the drought throughout the
basin is deep,” said Merkley, who serves as Chairman of the Interior
Subcommittee on Appropriations which oversees funding for USFWS. “This funding is
key to supporting priorities in the region that will make the water we have go
further for the farmers, households, and ecosystems in the basin, including
infrastructure improvements and habitat restoration. We still have a long way
to go, but I am glad the Department of Interior is actively engaging in the
basin and putting the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to good use. It’s
proof that when local leaders, state and federal partners, and tribes work
collaboratively, we can make a real difference.”

“This federal investment comes as welcome
news to help Oregonians in the Klamath Basin weather the historic drought
that’s devastated the region,” Wyden
said. “With no rain in
immediate sight this summer, there’s obviously much more work to be done during
this brutally tough water year.  But I’m gratified the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law that I and Senator Merkley supported has generated these
federal resources for species recovery and habitat restoration to
make sure every precious drop of water goes as far as possible in the Basin.
Today’s announcement provides a solid building block to continue working with
the federal agencies and the state on a long-term, sustainable solution for
farmers, Tribes and everybody in the community. I’m all in on being a part of
that team until that solution is achieved.”
Among today’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law investments impacting Oregon:

In total, Chairman
Merkley secured $162 million in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for habitat
restoration efforts in the Klamath Basin. Today’s investments come in addition
to $15 million in annual funding that Merkley secured for fiscal year 2022 to
support ongoing activities in the basin that are based on priorities identified
in the 2018
Sucker Summit that he convened.
Together,
Senators Merkley and Wyden are committed to supporting collaborative,
community-generated solutions to this complex issue as they continue to urge
for unity in the region.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-extend-public-service-loan-forgiveness-waiver-deadline,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator
Ron Wyden today joined colleagues urging the Biden Administration to extend the
Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver deadline until at least July 1,
2023, when the Department’s proposed rules to improve and expand federal
student debt relief programs, including PSLF, are currently on track to take
effect. 
 Extending the
waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the
historic waiver that has already resulted in more than $9 billion in
forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million
borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The
extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while
it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its
proposed PSLF rule.
“The
PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’
the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments
by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or
payment plan,’”
wrote the lawmakers  in a letter to U.S. Department of Education
Secretary Miguel Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been
overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF
relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received
forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.”
The
lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the
public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As
of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF
borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the
9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center
identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF.
“For
many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and
deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October
31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of
deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR)
and PSLF programs,” added
the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver
before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent
them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.”
The
lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more
military service members and federal employees to make progress towards
achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service
members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment
for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service
members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF
waiver. 
“[W]e
also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and
borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand
eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being
communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers.
The
letter was led by Senators Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Tim
Kaine, D-Va., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Along with Wyden, the letter is
co-signed by Senators Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Richard
Blumenthal, D-Conn., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Ben Cardin,
D-Md., Bob Casey, D-Pa., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Mark Kelly,
D-Ariz., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Ed Markey, D-Mass., Alex
Padilla, D-Calif., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Jeanne Shaheen,
D-N.H., Tina Smith, D-Minn., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.,
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.
“The
Biden administration’s temporary waiver for Public Service Loan Forgiveness has
been a game-changer for so many people who have dedicated their lives to public
service and have been struggling under the crushing weight of student loans.
But it is just that—temporary—and it leaves borrowers in limbo as we wait for
new regulations to take effect next year,” said Randi Weingarten, President
of American Federation of Teachers. “Let’s be clear, everyone who received
the debt relief was promised it. This waiver was a critical step toward healing
a broken student loan system that has pauperized a generation. We need to take
it one step further and extend it. The people who are benefiting from this
moment of relief are the same people who carried us through a pandemic—we need
to honor their commitment and extend the deadline for the PSLF waiver.”  
“No
matter what we look like, where we live, or what’s in our bank accounts, all of
us should be able to pursue our dreams at an affordable college or university.
But for too long, the cost of college has forced many students and families to
forego their education goals or be trapped in a lifetime of debt. When
educators are unable to repay their student debt, it means fewer educators in
the profession, and more disruptions for their students,” said Becky Pringle,
President of the National Education Association. “We are overwhelmingly
grateful for the waiver that has allowed thousands of educators to receive the
promise of PSLF, but there are simply too many educators who have been left out
to end the waiver now. We implore the Biden Administration to keep the promise
of PSLF and extend the waiver deadline.” 
“Public
service workers make incredible sacrifices every day to strengthen their
communities – and never more so than during the last two and a half years of
this pandemic. The least we can do is ease their overwhelming student debt
burden, much of which they have incurred while getting the skills and education
they need to be better at their essential jobs,” said President
Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME. “So many AFSCME members have benefitted
from the Biden administration’s temporary waiver that expanded eligibility for
loan forgiveness. But we are only scratching the surface of the need. It is
time to extend the deadline and give more public service workers the time to
learn about the program, apply for loan forgiveness and get the relief they
need.”
“The
Administration's overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is
just hitting its stride--delivering debt relief to educators and healthcare
workers who are still reeling from the pandemic and its aftermath,” said Mike
Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “We
strongly urge President Biden to listen to Senators Menendez, Murray, Kaine,
and Gillibrand, Representatives Sarbanes, Courtney, Hayes, Manning, and more
than 100 of their colleagues: keep your promise to cancel student debt for
every public service worker who is eligible, no matter how long it takes.”

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-press-for-answers-to-allegations-of-retaliation-against-inmates-at-federal-prison-in-sheridan,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators
Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week asked federal officials to respond to
“significant and troubling” reports about retaliation against inmates at the
federal prison in Sheridan, as well as significant
delays in access to treatment and evaluation for defendants in the federal
criminal justice system in Oregon and nationwide with mental health conditions.
“We write today with deep concern about allegations of
retaliation by guards against inmates at the federal correctional institution
in Sheridan, Oregon (FCI Sheridan) and also about issues hurting the mental
health of federal inmates nationwide,” Wyden
and Merkley wrote federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Colette Peters, the
former head of Oregon’s Department of Corrections. “We respectfully request
an update about both of these significant and troubling issues.”
Wyden and Merkley cited recent news
reports about retaliation and violence at FCI Sheridan against
inmates for speaking out about unaddressed medical needs; small cell
confinement; and limited access to family and lawyers as a result of the
pandemic. 
“Inmates’ claims of retaliation for speaking out include violence,
targeted cell shake downs, and the tossing of personal items, such as
medications,” Wyden and Merkley wrote. “The fact that these actions coincide
with the inmates’ ongoing federal petition alleging conditions at FCI Sheridan
violate their constitutional rights make these reports more troubling.”
Wyden and Merkley asked the BOP to answer these questions about
Sheridan:
·      
What procedures is the
BOP taking to ensure humane conditions at FCI Sheridan, including permitting
access for inmates to meet and speak with their families, counsel, and other
support systems?
·      
 What steps is the
BOP taking to ensure that inmates are not confined in small spaces for long
periods of time?
·      
 How is the BOP
ensuring that the health needs of inmates at FCI Sheridan are being addressed,
and what is being done to ensure that inmates are not waiting too long to be
examined and treated by medical professionals?
·      
 Is the BOP
investigating claims of retaliation by guards either from FCI Sheridan or from
elsewhere against inmates at FCI Sheridan? If so, please provide:
o   The actions that have already been taken by the
BOP;
o   The actions that the BOP is planning to take or
considering; and
o   Any other information relevant to this request.
·      
 What information
or directives has been shared with staff and inmates at FCI Sheridan about
these allegations of retaliation?
·      
What procedures are in
place to prevent retaliation by staff against inmates?
·      
Which specific
positions, if any, are currently vacant at FCI Sheridan?
·       Are you considering recommending direct hire
authority for FCI Sheridan to address urgent staffing needs?
The senators
also asked about reports they have received that a Special Operations Response
Team (SORT) was brought in to FCI Sheridan. The requested the following
information from the BOP:
·       Is there a SORT or other out of district officers at the FCI
Sheridan currently or in the last several months? 
o  
If so, how many officers are involved?
Are inmates able to visually identify the names and badge numbers of involved
officers? 
·       Why was this team brought to the FCI Sheridan? What is their
role? Under what conditions will they be removed?
Wyden
and Merkley also wrote in their letter about reports of significant delays in
access to treatment and evaluation for defendants with mental health conditions
in the federal criminal justice system in Oregon and nationwide. The senators
noted that the Insanity Defense Reform Act requires the Department of
Justice to “hospitalize [a] defendant for treatment in a suitable facility . .
. for such a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four months, as is
necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the
foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go
forward.” 
In
response to those concerns about “competency restoration” and the BOP’s
responsibility to meet that requirement, Wyden and Merkley asked for answers to
the following questions:
·      
How is the BOP planning to expand
capacity at its current competency restoration facilities and what is the
timeline for taking this step?
·      
 Is the BOP considering
expanding the number of facilities that offer treatment and evaluation by
creating units in other federal facilities and by contracting with state and
private facilities to implement programs that meet the federal
requirements? 
o   If so, what is this plan and what is the timeline for
implementing it?
·      
Is the BOP considering the
cost-effective and often successful option of engaging with local resources for
in-community competency restoration? 
o   If so, what is this plan and what is the timeline for
completing it?
·      
Are there any other options the BOP
is considering to address this issue, and what are they?
Wyden
and Merkley asked Peters for responses to all their questions by September 19,
2022.

entire letter is here.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-announce-emergency-rural-health-care-grants-headed-to-oregon,"
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and
Jeff Merkley today announced a total of $346,000 in federal funding from
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) headed to three Oregon communities to
upgrade facilities so they can better serve families and increase access
to essential medical services.""No matter your zip code, every Oregonian should have easy
access to the care they need,"" Wyden said. ""This
money will go a long way in addressing hunger, keeping mental health care
available and making visits to the pharmacy easier in rural communities across
our state.""
 “It is essential for Oregonians in every corner of the state to
have access to the resources they need to be safe and healthy,” said Merkley.
“This crucial funding will better equip Clatsop, Lane, and Union Counties
with the tools needed to address hunger and improve health in the community, by
updating existing food distribution facilities, making treatment facility
improvements, and ensuring easy and reliable access to pharmacies for our rural
communities.”
 The projects include:
Clatsop Community Action, Clatsop County -- $237,900
This Rural Development investment will be used to purchase two new
food distribution trucks, a new refrigerator and walk-in freezer, and remodel
the existing dry storage area. Clatsop Community Action's food distribution
facility is located in Warrenton, a small community in Clatsop County, Oregon
and they are organized to operate throughout the county. The existing facility
was built in 2010 and is in good condition, however, increased demand for
services resulting from the impacts of the pandemic have made it necessary to
increase both dry and cold food storage capacity. The project will ensure that
this rural area will have the storage equipment required to enhance its food
distribution capabilities to benefit county residents for years to come.
  South Lane Mental Health, Lane County -- $58,200
This Rural Development investment will be used to purchase a
covered gazebo, picnic tables and chairs to facilitate outdoor COVID safe
therapy sessions, HEPA air purifiers for offices to further protect clients and
clinicians and a new key fob system to increase security and the ability to
screen visitors for COVID. South Lane Mental Health has several care facilities
in the community of Cottage Grove. These facilities do not currently have an
air filtration system or outdoor meeting areas. These improvements are needed
to reduce the impact and spread of COVID by allowing for safer meeting spaces,
healthier air quality in offices and the ability to more safely screen for
symptoms upon entry into the facilities. Overall, this project will ensure that
this rural area will have the needed funds to purchase equipment and enhance
its capabilities to respond to COVID for the residents of Cottage Grove and the
surrounding area for years to come.
 Elgin Health District, Union County -- $49,900
This Rural Development investment will be used to help purchase
equipment to start a tele pharmacy and enhance capabilities to respond to
COVID-19. The residents of Elgin have been without a pharmacy for 15 years and
must drive into La Grande, 20 miles away to get their prescriptions. The Elgin
Health District built the clinic in 2008 and currently offers medical, dental
and limited behavioral health services in rural Elgin, but it has no pharmacy.
The health care clinic will purchase and install tele pharmacy equipment at the
clinic location and at Grande Ronde Hospital in La Grande. This project will
ensure that this rural area will have the needed funds to purchase tele
pharmacy equipment and enhance its capabilities to provide enhanced medical
services to the residents of Elgin and the surrounding area for years to come.
 ""Due to the pandemic, the need for food in Clatsop County has
increased drastically, just as everywhere else. Thanks to the funding we have
received from USDA RD, CCA will be able to have on hand more food for distribution
in our community. We are extremely grateful to everyone who has helped CCA to
acquire this funding. It is so needed and will be well used to reach those in
need. Our organization and our community greatly appreciates the
assistance,"" said Clatsop Community Action Executive Director Viviana
Matthews.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-over-13-million-in-federal-awards-to-revamp-mcgilchrist-street-in-salem,"
Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s
U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced the City of Salem will
be receiving $13,299,320 in Fiscal Year 22 Rebuilding American Infrastructure
with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) Grants to fund construction for the McGilchrist Complete Street Project. 
 “McGilchrist Street already plays a crucial role for Salem transportation and infrastructure, and with a face-lift it can play an even bigger role,” said Merkley. “This investment will transform the
current roadway into a safer street for bicyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles. I’m grateful this funding is headed to Salem to revamp this important road, foster economic development, and make the neighborhood safer.”  
 “I know firsthand how Salem has long needed this federal investment to improve and
update McGilchrist Street so residents and commuters can have a safe and modern
transportation artery,” Wyden said. “I’m gratified the years of teamwork
with city officials have paid off with these federal funds that will help to
generate economic development in Salem and provide bike and pedestrian options
to share the road safely with vehicles.”
 McGilchrist Street is designated a major arterial in the Salem Transportation System Plan. McGilchrist Street is located in an olderindustrial area that has significant opportunities for infill development. The current condition of the road restricts investments and business development
along the roadway. Additionally, the roadway lacks any infrastructure for pedestrians or bicyclists and its current condition cannot withstand Oregon’s wet weather.  
The City of Salem has been trying to fund this important transportation project for more than five years. This project will widen McGilchrist Street, add travel and turn lanes, construct bicycle lanes
and sidewalks, install new traffic signals and streetlights, and improve drainage to prevent seasonal flooding. “For 15 years residents of Salem have been working to get this project funding. The impacts of this
investment will be felt quickly as new developments are already beginning to take shape along McGilchrist St. Salem residents should be excited about improving commutes, bicycle and pedestrian safety, and the positive environmental impacts delivered by this project,” said Kristin Retherford,
Salem Interim City Manager.

this funding will better support students in all of Oregon’s communities and help break down barriers to higher education.” “Many young Oregonians face tough hurdles climbing the next rung of the higher education ladder as they pursue knowledge to serve them well in a career and throughout their adult lives,” Wyden said. “I’m
gratified these federal investments in Oregon recognize those difficult challenges for students in both rural and urban settings. And I’ll keep fighting for similar investments that help Oregon students working hard to overcome similar circumstances in our state.”

Washington, D.C. – U.S.
Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has joined U.S. Senator Patty
Murray, D-Wash., and colleagues in commenting on the Department
of Education’s proposed
rules to expand and improve student debt relief programs. 
 
In a letter
to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, the senators applauded the
Department’s efforts to provide and expand relief to borrowers whose schools
closed or defrauded them, borrowers working in public service, and borrowers
who are totally and permanently disabled. The senators encouraged additional
steps to improve the Department’s student debt relief programs and ensure
borrowers can access the relief they are owed.
 
“The Department’s
proposed rules will help to provide additional relief to struggling borrowers,
protect students and taxpayers from fraud and abuse committed by institutions,
and ensure our federal student loan program fulfills its promise to put higher
education within reach for more students without subjecting them to complex,
burdensome, or punitive requirements that make it harder to get the relief they
are owed,” wrote the senators. “This proposal represents an enormous
step forward for students and borrowers, and, when finalized, it will help
ensure government benefits and programs function as Congress intended.”
 
In their letter,
the senators commended the Biden administration’s proposals to deliver and
expand relief for these borrowers—steps Wyden, Murray and their Democratic
colleagues urged
the Department to take in a letter last year.
 
They also
detailed additional steps the Department should take to strengthen its
proposal. In particular, the senators recommended steps to further strengthen
its borrower protection rule, further expand relief for borrowers seeking a closed
school discharge and eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness
program, eliminate interest capitalization on all loan types, and further
protect students’ right to seek relief in court. The senators also urged the
Department to continue working to fix the income-driven repayment system, crack
down on bad actors, and provide as much relief as possible to borrowers.
 
“As the
Department works to finalize these regulations, we urge you to build on this
progress by strengthening rules in other vital areas, including income-driven
repayment and gainful employment,” added the senators. “We also
urge the Department to continue efforts to protect borrowers outside the
rulemaking process, including by immediately and efficiently using its current
oversight and enforcement authorities to rein in bad actors and provide as
much relief as possible to borrowers.”
 
In addition to
Wyden, the letter --  which was led by Murray
-- was also signed by U.S. Senators Schumer, D-N.Y.,
Baldwin, D-Wisc., Markey, D-Mass., Reed, D-R.I.,
Coons, D-Del., Hirono, D-Hawaii, Cardin, D-Md.,

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-renew-request-for-fda-to-address-concerns-about-dangerous-pulse-oximeter-inaccuracies-affecting-communities-of-color,"
Washington,
D.C.
– U.S. Senator Ron Wyden this week with colleagues Senators Elizabeth Warren,
D-Mass., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.,
implored the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a post market
study of pulse oximeters to ensure they are effective across racially diverse
patients and consumers. 
Recent
studies have shown that inaccurate results from pulse oximeters are more likely
when used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with darker skin.
The device’s inconsistency could have life threatening consequences for
patients, and this may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. One
particular study found that patients of color received less supplemental oxygen
than their white counterparts due to pulse oximeters’ inaccurate measurements.
Wyden has also introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act to
address bias in automated systems. 
“There
are decades of research showing inaccurate results when pulse oximeters are
used to monitor people of color, particularly patients with darker skin,” Wyden and the
lawmakers said in a letter to Dr. Robert Califf, Commissioner of Food and Drugs
at the FDA. “Therefore, we are seeking information from the FDA on your
clearance of pulse oximeters and urge the FDA to initiate a post market study
for these devices to understand what improvements to the technology will make
the devices effective on the full range of human skin pigmentation.”
The
lawmakers commended FDA’s new safety communication about pulse oximeter
accuracy and welcomed the recent news that FDA is planning to convene a public
meeting of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee later this year. This request
follows up on a previous letter sent by Wyden, Warren and Booker in
January of last year. However, FDA has yet to respond.
In
addition to a post market study, the lawmakers request that the FDA respond
fully to a series of inquiries no later than August 26, 2022.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-clean-energy-prescription-drug-pricing-legislation-passes-senate,"
Washington, D.C. –  Legislation authored by Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., today passed the Senate as part of the historic Inflation Reduction
Act.
The linchpin of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy
package is Wyden’s Clean
Energy for America Act, first
introduced in 2015, which reforms the energy tax code to incentivize emissions
reductions rather than specific technologies.  
The Clean Energy for America Act would reduce carbon emissions
in the power sector by about 70 percent over the next decade, and is the main
driver of the overall 40 percent reduction in emissions achieved by the Inflation
Reduction Act. 
“This historic clean energy package has been a decade in the making.
When clean energy legislation failed in 2010, we regrouped to ensure success
the next time Democrats had an opportunity,” said
Wyden. “We turned to emissions-based, technology-neutral tax incentives, and
spent nearly a decade preparing this bill. My lodestar has been achieving the
greatest emissions and cost-savings possible with 50 votes. That’s why the Inflation
Reduction Act’s clean energy tax package is about 90 percent of the Clean
Energy for America Act that the Senate Finance Committee approved in May
2021. We built the support needed over time.  
Wyden continued, “This bill will reduce energy costs, secure our
energy independence, and drastically cut carbon emissions. For the first time,
the tax code is going to reward emissions reductions, and encourage the
development of new clean energy technologies as soon as they come online. No
longer will Congress need to legislate technology by technology, making it
easier to innovate and bring new technologies to market. Importantly, this is
permanent energy policy. Congress will no longer need to extend these
incentives every few years, giving companies and states certainty to plan clean
energy projects and create jobs. This is among the most consequential bills of
my service in the Senate.” 
 On health care, the Inflation Reduction Act includes the culmination
of Wyden’s work on the Finance Committee to address the high cost of
prescription drugs.
The bill would finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices,
particularly for the most expensive drugs that have no competition after being
on the market for years. The bill also includes an inflation rebate that limit Big Pharma’s ability to price gouge year after year, and it creates strong
protections for seniors including a $2,000 per year out-of-pocket cap.
 “For too long, Medicare has been forced to contend with Big Pharma
with one hand tied behind its back – that ends when this bill is signed into
law,” said Wyden. “Ever since I became the top
Democrat on the Finance Committee, I have been spotlighting how the drug
pricing system is broken top to bottom. At last, the Senate has begun to
redefine the relationship between Medicare and Big Pharma. That work began last
Congress on a bipartisan basis, and virtually the entirety of the Finance
Committee’s work two years ago is included in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Democrats have taken the critical next step by lifting the curse that has
prevented Medicare from negotiating lower prices.
 “Medicare negotiation is the centerpiece of the Inflation Reduction
Act’s drug pricing reforms. No longer will drug companies be able to string
Medicare along for years or even decades while taxpayers foot the bill. This
policy targets the most expensive, most used drugs that have had zero
competition for years on end. It lowers prices in a way that is fair and designed
to promote innovation, not stifle it. Those negotiations will begin next year.
It creates a limit on Big Pharma’s ability to price gouge with the Medicare
inflation rebate, requiring drug companies to pay a fee to Medicare if they
raise their prices faster than inflation. Critically, the bill will protect
seniors from high out-of-pocket costs in less than a year and a half with a
$2,000 out-of-pocket cap on drug costs, which will spare more than a million
seniors from financial peril. Taken together, these policies represent a
seismic shift in how Medicare pays for medicine, and it does so in a way that
will greatly lower costs for seniors and taxpayers.”
 The Inflation Reduction Act also provides the following for
Oregon and the country:·       More than $20 billion for farmers and ranchers to support
climate-smart agriculture practices
·       $14 billion for rural electric cooperatives in the state and country
to make the transition to cleaner energy
·       $5 billion to protect communities from wildfires by investing in projects on public and private lands, increase carbon
sequestration, and reforestation 
·       More than $4 billion for drought mitigation
·      
$3
billion to EPA for grants to reduce air pollution at ports, which could benefit
Oregon’s 23 ports.
 “With temperatures today throughout Oregon near or topping 100
degrees, these investments in wildfire prevention, drought mitigation and
supporting our state’s farmers and ranchers are timely and welcome news to
fight the devastating impacts of the climate crisis in our state,” Wyden said.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-delivers-floor-speech-after-republicans-block-the-womens-health-protection-act,"Mr. President, earlier today the Senate took one the most significant votes I have been a part of in all my time in public service.While the Women’s Health Protection Act did not pass today, this vote made it very clear on which side every senator stands. The Republicans unanimously voted for criminalized abortion in more than half the states in just a few weeks. Democrats voted to stop the Alito Court from turning the clock back on women’s health by a century. Let’s be one-hundred percent crystal clear about the consequences of this ruling when it becomes final.It will immediately criminalize abortion in many states.It will allow the Republicans to pass a law criminalizing abortion in all 50 states. It will throw out the constitutional right to privacy — a right upon which marriage, choice, and many other civil rights depend. And it will put governments in control of women’s bodies. This is truly a terrifying outcome for millions and millions of people all across the country. It is no secret that people have been considering what would happen if and when this far-right Supreme Court would throw out Roe. Less than a month ago, I was on this floor talking about the end of Roe and the danger to Griswold v. Connecticut, the case that affirmed the right of married people to use contraception. However, it is still a shock — a gut punch — to see how eager Republican lawmakers are to strip women of their constitutional freedoms and endanger their lives. They are going a lot further than simply overturning Roe. All the talk about states’ rights has gone out the window — the goal is a federal abortion ban — federal criminalization. Already Republicans including governors and statehouse leaders are talking about banning birth control. I will say that again — they are talking about banning birth control!Already, there are plans to restrict people’s freedom of movement, criminalizing women who travel to other states for an abortion, and even the person who gives them a ride. Let’s not sugarcoat what that means. They are talking about enacting laws that reach beyond state borders, harkening back to the darkest parts of our history. This far-right Alito Court has already given far-right lawmakers a green light to do whatever they want when it comes to abortion. There is no reason to trust this court will draw the line at restricting women’s freedom of movement. Another closely related issue that frightens me deals with data. With abortion criminalized, women’s personal data is going to be weaponized against them by bounty hunters and the government. I have been sounding the alarm for years about the abuse of location data taken from people’s cell phones. In a world where Sam Alito is in charge of abortion laws, that becomes a massive, massive crisis.Shady data brokers are already tracking women who go to Planned Parenthood clinics, and they will sell that data to anybody with a credit card.  Imagine for a moment what not just prosecutors, but these deranged rightwing vigilantes, will do with this data. The apps women use, the websites they visit, the places they go. All of that can and will be used against them by prosecutors. In short, this is “uterus surveillance.” That’s what’s coming down the pike unless Congress acts and gets serious about consumer privacy and prohibiting the government from making end-runs around the fourth amendment. It is a shock to me how little concern there seems to be for these major issues. It is a full-out sprint toward massive government overreach and severe restrictions on women’s freedom and privacy. There’s zero thought given to victims of rape. There’s zero thought given to victims of incest.There’s zero thought to women being exploited after being forced to seek backroom abortions.There’s zero thought given to how many more women will die as a result of this ruling…Complications during pregnancy could become a death sentence.  In states like Texas where law enforcement have already shown the willingness to arrest a women for having a miscarriage, a woman’s tragedy of losing a baby will be compounded by the very real threat of criminal prosecution.  Through all of this, abortions will still happen, they will just happen in conditions that are less safe than they are today. I know there are members on the other side who say they care about these issues. They have been saying that for years, and yet we have arrived at this moment. Not a single Republican senator voted to protect the law as it stands today.  The vast, vast majority of people in Oregon and all across the country oppose what the Alito Court is inflicting on them by tossing out Roe. This is extreme judicial radicalism — proof that these justices were blowing smoke when they told senators they would respect precedent if they were confirmed. The bottom line is this: if you don’t have control over your own body, you are not free. The Alito Court is denying women control over their own bodies. This is an attack on their freedom, and a denial of Americans’ right to privacy. Criminalizing abortion is wrong, plain and simple. How can we let this stand? Today is not the end of this fight.  The Senate has taken its vote.  Now every American must cast their vote and make clear whether they want to be part of this new Republican reality.  A video of Wyden’s remarks is here.###Nicole L’Esperance 202-224-5244"

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-seek-better-pay-for-federal-wildland-firefighters-s,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden this week joined colleagues from both parties in urging federal officials to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters in Oregon and nationwide that would address urgent staffing shortages in the wildland firefighting workforce.“As the 2022 fire season begins, we urge you to take necessary steps to avert critical staffing shortages in the wildland firefighting workforce,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Agriculture Secretary Thomas J. Vilsack, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Office of Personnel Management Director Kiran Ahuja. “By using existing authority to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters, we can directly address the recruitment and retention crisis, and ensure that the pending “wildland firefighter” occupational series reflects the professional capabilities of our wildland firefighters.”The lawmakers’ May 10 letter noted how years of low pay and other issues have hollowed out the federal wildland firefighting workforce to the point that fire officials last year could not fill an unprecedented 1,800 interagency requests for wildland firefighting crews, and more than 1,900 requests for fire engines.“This is an urgent threat to natural resources, public safety, and taxpayer dollars, as the Federal Government pays a premium to contract and borrow firefighting resources from state and local authorities when federal resources are unavailable,” they wrote. “The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must use its authority to stop further attrition in the wildland firefighting workforce. OPM has the authority for special pay rates to address staffing problems caused by significantly higher non-Federal pay rates, the remoteness of the area or location involved, the undesirability of the working conditions or nature of the work involved, and any other circumstances OPM considers appropriate. All these criteria appear applicable in this case.”In addition to Wyden, other senators signing the bipartisan letter led by U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are U.S. Sens.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-critical-step-forward-to-modernize-oregons-waterways-and-ports-for-those-who-rely-on-them,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced a raft of critical projects and policy initiatives for Oregon that have been written into the Water Resources Development Act?(WRDA) of 2022 which passed out of a key Senate committee today. The bill will next head to the Senate floor for a full vote.“Every one of us wants to know that we can rely on safe water coming from our taps and that other key water infrastructure will be there to keep us and our families safe and healthy,” said Merkley, who serves on the committee that wrote the bill. “From modernizing drinking water systems, to making sure breakwaters and jetties protect our ports and their communities, to shoring up dams and levees so we don’t face floodwaters in our streets, the provisions of this bill will keep Oregonians safe while expanding economic opportunities and putting folks to work with good-paying jobs. Passing these provisions through the committee was a key first step, and I’m looking forward to moving this bill through the Senate.” ?“Oregonians know water is intrinsic to our state’s quality of life -- whether it’s confidence that what’s coming out of the faucet is safe to drink or the knowledge that investments in ports, jetties, levees and breakwaters have been made to generate jobs and keep communities safe,” said Wyden. “This bill provides those protections throughout Oregon while also taking essential and long-overdue steps to replace tribal housing along the Columbia River. I’m glad this legislation has earned committee approval and will work hard to get it through the entire Senate.”The WRDA bill provides authorizations for studies and projects that upgrade infrastructure like jetties, levees, and breakwaters in Oregon’s communities, such as West Linn and Coos Bay-North Bend, as well as critical funding for ports, such as the Port of Astoria, Port of Bandon, and Port Orford. It also continues Merkley’s work to require the federal government to finally fulfill its promise to replace tribal housing that was flooded by the creation of the Dalles Dam in the 1950s. Merkley and Wyden have consistently fought to make sure small ports in Oregon and throughout the country receive a share of HMTF funding for dredging and other critical projects. This year’s?WRDA?bill includes language that allows, beginning in October 2022, up to $5 million of HMTF funding for Emerging Harbors—which includes most of Oregon’s ports—to be available for up to 10 maintenance dredging projects in marinas or berthing areas in harbors located adjacent to, or accessible by, a federal navigation project. This will bolster small ports’ access to funding for maintenance projects. In keeping with experts’ warnings that the destruction of waterway ecosystems could hamstring local economies and threaten the health of countless species, the senators fought to ensure that the?WRDA?bill authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to carry out efforts to restore salmon and steelhead habitat. The bill also authorizes a number of studies that will support Oregon’s small ports and fish hatcheries. Accepted projects and policy initiatives can be found below:  Columbia River Tribal Housing  Following the 2018 WRDA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was required to create tribal housing for displaced tribal people of the Columbia River caused by the development of The Dalles Dam. The Corps responded to a 2018 congressional authorization by producing replacement village options that were not mutually acceptable to Columbia River treaty tribes. The 2022 WRDA would require the Corps to revise and then carry out the village development plan for Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Washington and Oregon to address the impacts to Indian villages and housing sites that resulted from construction of multiple dams by the Corps in the Columbia River Basin. ?Portland Metro Levee System - Authorization of Portland Metro Levee System Chief’s Report Authorization of the Army Corps of Engineers Portland Metro Levee System Chief’s Report will reduce flood risk and increase the resiliency and reliability of the 27-mile levee system along the Columbia River in the Portland metro area. The total cost of the project is $110, 498,000 and it has a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.7 to 1. ?Ecosystem Restoration General Investigation Feasibility Study for the Mill Creek Levee Project on the Walla Walla River, Authorization  The Army Corps of Engineers constructed the Milton-Freewater Levee project for flood control purposes in 1951. The project reduced the historic 5-mile floodplain width to approximately 200 feet and has since impacted ecological functions within the reach. To address these ecological impacts, a feasibility study is requested to identify actions to improve floodplain-riverine processes, stop channel incision, enhance fish passage and rearing habitat, and decrease surface water seepage while having no negative impacts and likely improving flood risk management.? ?Nationwide Low-Head Dam Inventory Low-head dams are engineered structures built into and across stream and river channels for a variety of important purposes. In the 1800s, low head dams were constructed across rivers and streams nationwide to provide services such as diverting water for irrigation or municipal and industrial water uses. Others are in place to prevent erosion of embankments or to control flooding impacts. The structures are numerous and widespread. Nicknamed “drowning machines,” low-head dams have proven over time to be extremely hazardous to public safety, as well as having negative impacts on fish populations and ecosystems. The bill would establish a Nationwide Low-Head Dam Inventory and a State Low-Head Dam Inventory and Rehabilitation Program to be administered by the USACE in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Bureau of Reclamation. ?Lane County Environmental Infrastructure (Sec. 219) Authorization  The bill adds Lane County to the list of eligible entities to receive Section 219 (Environmental Infrastructure) funding from the USACE. This authorization will allow Lane County to pursue critical USACE assistance and funding to support water supply and storage, treatment and distribution systems, and wastewater treatment systems. ? ### "

These opaque and burdensome practices run counter to the goals of the ACA—ensuring access to prescription birth control that is free at the point-of-sale,” the senators wrote CVS Caremark, OptumRx, and Express Scripts, which make key coverage decisions about 80% of the prescriptions filled in the U.S.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that companies fully cover patients’ birth control with no out-of-pocket costs or extra steps, but despite these protections, top companies continue to force patients to jump through harmful, unnecessary hoops or pay out-of-pocket to get the birth control they need to stay healthy. In their letters to CVS Caremark, OptumRx, and Express Scripts, the senators called on the PBMs to fully cover patients’ birth control and clearly detail their policies related to contraception coverage.“Patients should not have to jump through burdensome hoops or pay extra just to get the birth control they need to stay healthy and plan a family on their own terms,” they wrote. “We therefore ask you ensure your policies are compliant with the law and provide the requested information so we may better understand the scope, evolution, and impact of your policies.”Recent reports have made clear that despite the ACA’s clear contraception coverage requirement, some insurers and the PBMs they hire to manage drug benefits on their behalf are forcing patients to pay extra for birth control or jump through unnecessary and harmful hoops to get their chosen birth control method covered. In some cases, patients have been asked to demonstrate they have failed with as many as five different birth control options before they can get their birth control covered.The senators’ letters to the PBMs come following efforts by Senators Murray and Wyden and Senator Hassan urging the Biden administration to make clear to insurers their obligation to fully cover birth control with no out-of-pocket costs—and to take action against those failing to comply. In January, the Biden administration issued guidance clarifying that insurers must cover all FDA approved, cleared, or granted birth control that are determined by a patient’s provider to be medically appropriate.Read the senators’ full letters to CVS Caremark, OptumRx, and Express Scripts. "

Wade:""The Republican party has set the stage for a total erosion of Americans’ constitutional rights. They have made clear they won't stop at gutting the right for a woman to make decisions about her own body. Republicans know that the majority of Americans don’t support eroding fundamental rights like privacy, so instead, they packed the Supreme Court with right-wing extremists willing to do their dirty work behind closed doors,"" said Wyden. ""This is a five alarm fire. If this is the final decision, the United States will be one of a handful of countries in the world moving backwards on women’s rights. The overturning of Roe would mark a devastating loss of constitutionally guaranteed bodily autonomy and privacy for more than half of America. Let me be clear: abortion is health care. Ending this protected and established right — a right generations of women have now known and that the overwhelming majority of Americans support — would harm the health, safety, and lives of millions of women and families. This is going to be the fight of our lives, and we must use every tool at our disposal to stop this attack on constitutionally guaranteed rights."" ###Nicole L'Esperance, Office of Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore. "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-1-million-to-oregon-for-conservation-efforts-and-to-protect-vulnerable-wildlife,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week announced Oregon has earned more than $1 million for conservation and protection of vulnerable wildlife from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.“From preserving the habitats of the Western pond turtle to mapping wildlife connectivity corridors, I am gratified to see more federal dollars go toward the conservation of some of the animals, plants and insects that inhabit Oregon’s world-renowned natural treasures,” Wyden said. “These investments are crucial to protect what makes our state’s outdoors unique and to be a responsible steward of nature so future generations of Oregonians can always have these special places to enjoy.”“As Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds these important efforts, I understand how integral it is to protect lands and waters so the vibrant ecosystems that support countless species and enhance our lives are there for future generations,” said Merkley. “Human actions are threatening the permanent loss of plants and animals that have defined Oregon, from vulnerable salmon species to the beloved Western Monarch butterfly. We have to save these and other species, and I’m pleased these federal funds will be used to protect Oregon’s precious legacy and to conserve and restore critical habitats and ecosystems around the state.”The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has distributed $56 million to state wildlife agencies through the State Wildlife Grant (SWG) Program to support natural resource stewardship efforts and to conserve imperiled wildlife and their habitats. These funds benefit species of greatest conservation need based on factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation, competition from non-native species, and stressors related to climate change. The $1.04 million for Oregon and all the funds are granted to states and territories based on population size and geographic area. Conservation is carried out through partnerships among universities, industry, non-profit conservation organizations and private landowners. "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-support-biden-proposal-to-reverse-harmful-trump-immigration-rule,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Senate colleagues today sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in support of the Biden administration’s proposal to better support immigrants by updating the “public charge” regulation. The Biden administration’s proposed regulation would replace the public charge rule enacted by the Trump administration in 2019, which made it significantly more difficult for many immigrants to become lawful permanent residents by lowering the threshold for a person becoming a “public charge.”“In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration proposed a new definition and implementation of the public charge rule, which was used to advance an anti-immigrant agenda and intimidate immigrant communities,” Wyden and colleagues wrote in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Ur Mendoza Jaddou, Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “While the 2019 public charge regulation took effect just as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, the rule undermined the United States’ overall pandemic response by deterring immigrant families from participating in public health measures and community support programs, thereby amplifying COVID-19’s disparate impact on the health and well-being of families of color.  The updates in the current proposed rule are essential to prevent a recurrence of such devastating events, both in the current pandemic, as well as in future national emergencies.” Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an individual seeking permanent residency in the United States can be inadmissible if they are a determined to be a “public charge.” The INA does not define public charge and prior to the Trump administration, the DHS only looked at whether an immigrant received cash assistance and government-funded institutionalized care to determine whether they were likely to become dependent on public assistance in the future.In 2019, the Trump administration lowered the threshold for becoming a public charge, making it more difficult for many immigrants, including many with U.S. citizen children, to become lawful permanent residents. The Trump rule counted assistance from many more programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), housing and transportation benefits, most medical care and more. The Biden administration’s updated regulation would roll back the Trump-era standards and exclude benefits related to public emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.“Finalizing a responsible public charge policy is critical to ensuring that our country has a humane immigration system,” Wyden and colleagues continued in their letter. “We urge you to speedily approve this rule to minimize the ongoing chilling effect of public charge on our constituents and families. As you work to finalize the rule, we also urge DHS to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure a consistent and accurate dissemination of information to affected agencies and families.”In addition to expressing their support for the overall proposed regulation, Wyden and colleagues provided three additional key recommendations to help ensure the updated rule does not further contribute to chilling or discriminatory effects on immigrants and their families. The Senators stated that the rule should,The senators also called on the Biden administration to take additional steps to better support immigrants seeking permanent status in this country.The letter was led by U.S. Senators Mazie K.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-irrigation-project-funding-headed-to-rural-oregon,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced the Tumalo, Owyhee, East Fork, and Ochoco Irrigation District projects will be receiving critical federal funding that will help drought-stricken communities make the most of limited water supplies.  These projects—funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations bill, both of which Senators Merkley and Wyden strongly supported—will combine strategies supporting efficient irrigation methods with better resource management to ensure consistent water flow to support agriculture, protect and restore wildlife habitat, and improve water quantity and quality. With climate chaos driving more frequent and more intense drought, these projects are critical to helping ensure that family farms and ranches can access the water resources they need to survive. “Across rural Oregon, everyone feels the stress of dwindling water supplies caused by grinding drought, which is why we need smart solutions to make sure we’re using water as efficiently as possible,” said Merkley, who called USDA personally to advocate for these continued investments in Oregon. “These important projects will help conserve water, improve irrigation conditions for rural Oregon farmers, and ensure critical habitats for trout and salmon are protected. I’ll continue to do all I can to secure the federal resources needed for Oregon’s world-class agriculture sector to grow and thrive.” “I have heard from rural communities around Oregon about their desperate need of resources to respond to the high levels of drought that are hurting agriculture and conservation efforts,” said Wyden. “I am gratified to see these important investments in water conservation work for the Owyhee, Tumalo East Fork, and Ochoco districts go toward increasing efficiency, improving biodiversity and helping farmers and ranchers better plan and prepare for droughts.”As a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Senator Merkley has secured over $168 million in federal funding for irrigation projects around Oregon over the past six fiscal years. These upcoming modernization projects will help establish climate resilient solutions to offset the impact of drought throughout the regions of Deschutes River, Tumalo Creek, Snake River, and Hood River watersheds. Existing open irrigation canals will be converted to pipes, which will help conserve and preserve critical water where it is needed to restore habitats for specified trout and salmon species. The implementation of water pipe conveyance will reduce evaporation and seepage loss, divert less water from rivers, and increases flow downstream.  ###  "

The FBI must also be transparent about the particular circumstances in which it conducted a staggering 1.9 million additional queries in 2021.

More than 100 local newsrooms were forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 30 percent of local television stations reporting budget cuts and staff reductions. The resolution affirms the significance of local news in increasing civic engagement and strengthening democratic norms and practices, and acknowledges the valuable contributions of local journalism towards the maintenance of healthy and vibrant communities.The resolution is endorsed by the Alliance for Community Media, California Black Media, Common Cause, Free Press Action, National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), National Press Photographers Association (NPPA), Native American Journalists Association (NAJA), Online News Association, PEN America, Public Knowledge, Society of Professional Journalists, Theatre Communications Group, Writers Guild of America, East, AFL-CIO, National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry, National Newspaper Association, Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO, The NewsGuild – Communications Workers of America (TNG-CWA), and National Writers Union.The resolution is led by U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii.

An unexpected tax burden should not be one of them. Passage of our bill, which ends tax penalties on survivors, will help survivors afford the legal costs of punishing individuals who have committed such heinous crimes,” Wyden said.“Survivors of human trafficking often have to relive their abuses when they pursue justice. This legislation provides relief to survivors without the fear of being penalized or audited,” Cornyn said. “It would also allow survivors who go through civil proceedings to receive the same treatment as those compensated through the criminal justice system. The last thing survivors should expect is to get stuck with a bill from the IRS.” Under the Internal Revenue Code, civil damages awarded to human trafficking victims are considered taxable income. This legislation would exempt civil damages from federal income taxes, allowing survivors to file their taxes without worry of penalties or fees for not reporting awarded damages as income. It also would provide parity between criminal restitution, which is tax-exempt through IRS Notice 2012-12, and civil damages, which are not. Often, human trafficking survivors’ only recourse to pursue justice against traffickers is through civil litigation. Finally, the bill codifies IRS Notice 2012-12, ensuring that restitution payments made in criminal case remain tax-free.   The Human Trafficking Survivor Tax Relief Act is supported by the Freedom Network USA, the Polaris Project, & Rights4Girls. Other organizations who have supported past efforts include the End Child Pornography and Trafficking (ECPAT), the National Association to Protect Children, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), Shared Hope International, the National Children’s Alliance, Freedom Network USA, the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking (ATEST), and the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking (CAST).The legislation was cosponsored by U.S. Senators Tom Carper, D-Del., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Tim Scott, R-S.C., James Lankford, R-Okla., Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla. "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-to-ftc-publicize-fraud-hotline-so-consumers-can-report-price-gouging-and-fight-back-against-corporate-greed,"Washington, D.C. – Amid numerous allegations of corporations padding their profits by raising prices to gouge consumers, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure Americans are aware they can report suspected price gouging to the FTC, either at ReportFraud.FTC.gov or the fraud telephone hotline at 877-382-4358, or via traditional mail. “I write to express my concern that large corporations, particularly those in consolidated industries, appear to be taking advantage of inflation to pad their profits at the expense of American consumers,” Wyden wrote to FTC Chair Lina Khan. “As the federal agency tasked with protecting consumers, the Federal Trade Commission has a powerful tool already at its disposal: the ReportFraud.ftc.gov hotline. I encourage you to ensure consumers are aware they can report inflation-related price gouging at this hotline, and to examine how best to share those reports with the state enforcement agencies responsible for targeting corporate profiteers.”Once tips about fraud, scams and price gouging are sent to ReportFraud.FTC.gov, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are able to view those reports and investigate or prosecute corporate wrongdoing. Wyden asked the FTC to review whether that system can be improved to ensure state enforcers can easily find and pursue price gouging reports from people in their states. News reports indicate corporations have taken advantage of headlines about inflation to raise prices and pad profits, in some cases contributing to high prices and inflationary pressures for consumers. For example, several carmakers reportedly reduced production in order to keep prices high. Similarly, as The New York Times reported, meat processing conglomerates are racking up massive profits — with gross margins that are up 50 percent, net margins that are up 300 percent, and billions of dollars in new dividends and stock buybacks. Meanwhile the farmers and ranchers who supply those companies saw no such gains. Read Wyden’s full letter to the FTC here.###Nicole L’Esperance (202) 224-5244"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-lead-colleagues-in-push-to-extend-federal-purchasing-of-west-coast-seafood-,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today led colleagues in a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) urging the Department to continue purchasing seafood from the West Coast. Senator Merkley and Wyden were joined by Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Patty Murray (D-WA), and Representatives Jared Huffman (D-CA), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Kurt Schrader (D-OR), and Derek Kilmer (D-WA) in pushing USDA Secretary Thomas Vilsack to make sure West Coast fishermen and seafood processors remain supported and a priority for USDA commodity purchasing programs. “On average, commercial fishermen on the West Coast deliver more than $500 million in ex-vessel value per annum, accounting for 13% of the value of total U.S. seafood production,” wrote the lawmakers. “A quarter of all American seafood processing and wholesale jobs are located in Washington, Oregon, and California, representing the largest employment opportunity among all seafood-producing regions in the U.S. The domestic seafood sector is also a critically important component of America’s food production system, supporting more than 1.2 million jobs, generating more than $144 billion in sales impacts, and contributing more than $61 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product.  “As with rural economies everywhere, but perhaps most acutely in small coastal communities, COVID-19 had a devastating impact and a primary driver of that impact was the effect on the fishing and processing industry,” they continued. “According to a report issued by NOAA Fisheries in December 2021, ex-vessel revenue fell by 27% from 2019-2020 and seafood dealers and processors sustained a decline in value added of $598 million (or 13.47%) as well.? The West Coast saw a larger decline in revenue from commercial fishing landings than all regions as a whole, with a dip of 24% in 2020 as compared to a five year baseline (2015-2019).? NOAA found that a significant part of the lost value was due to restaurant closures and reduced export.” Senators Merkley and Wyden have been long-time advocates leading the push to ensure the USDA includes Pacific Northwest fishermen and seafood processors in important purchasing programs. Most recently the Senators secured $16.5 million in Pacific seafood purchases. Full text of the letter can be found here and below:  Dear Secretary Vilsack, ? Commercial fishing and seafood processing on the West Coast is a significant contributor to U.S. seafood production and also a key part of our country’s agricultural and food production system as a whole.? Perhaps more importantly, the industries are the economic and community backbone of the small ports and vibrant rural towns that dot our Pacific shorelines.?  ? On average, commercial fishermen on the West Coast deliver more than $500 million in ex-vessel value per annum, accounting for 13% of the value of total U.S. seafood production. A quarter of all American seafood processing and wholesale jobs are located in Washington, Oregon, and California, representing the largest employment opportunity among all seafood-producing regions in the U.S. The domestic seafood sector is also a critically important component of America’s food production system, supporting more than 1.2 million jobs, generating more than $144 billion in sales impacts, and contributing more than $61 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product.  ? As with rural economies everywhere, but perhaps most acutely in small coastal communities, COVID-19 had a devastating impact and a primary driver of that impact was the effect on the fishing and processing industry.? According to a report issued by NOAA Fisheries in December 2021, ex-vessel revenue fell by 27% from 2019-2020 and seafood dealers and processors sustained a decline in value added of $598 million (or 13.47%) as well.1? The West Coast saw a larger decline in revenue from commercial fishing landings than all regions as a whole, with a dip of 24% in 2020 as compared to a five year baseline (2015-2019).? NOAA found that a significant part of the lost value was due to restaurant closures and reduced export.2  Last year under your leadership, USDA purchased just over $16 million in West Coast seafood products, providing a significant boost for the industry and our coastal communities.? We are very thankful for that purchase but note that other regions have received significantly more support during the pandemic.? USDA’s procurement programs are critical for ensuring that our food production systems remain robust, essential workers remain employed, supply chains keep operating, and America’s nutritional needs are met. ?We thus request that you include appropriate Pacific Northwest and West Coast seafood products that are currently being produced in large volumes, are easily accessible, and easily transportable for immediate distribution to food assistance programs. ? Thank you very much for USDA’s assistance in assisting our region’s coastal economies.  ? Sincerely,  ###"

The announcement follows letters sent in 2021 and 2022 by the lawmakers urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of the Interior to include protection for old growth and mature forests as part of the agencies’ carbon reduction planning efforts. Text of the letters are here and here.“This is welcome news for our entire state heading into wildfire season with Oregonians counting on the Forest Service to marshal all its fire-reduction efforts ASAP as the needed complement to the fire reduction investments I got into the American Rescue Plan,” Wyden said. “Simply put, President Biden’s Earth Day announcement takes on the climate crisis increasingly threatening Oregon’s mature forests. This inventory and assessment will provide concrete, science-based data and give solid information for where to focus fire reduction efforts in the urgent need for more active management to restore forest health and resilience before we lose these treasures entirely.”“Protecting old growth and carbon-rich mature forests is critical to our nation’s climate mitigation strategy. These forests are our most efficient and effective carbon sinks. They also provide critical habitat for wildlife, protect water quality and quantity, and increase wildfire resiliency. I am pleased the Administration recognizes this and is advancing protections for old growth and mature forests,” said Blumenauer.“One of the best tools we have in the fight against climate change is protecting our natural world, particularly our old growth forests which are a leading source of carbon sequestration,” said DeFazio. “Millions of acres of old growth thrive in Oregon, and it should remain that way. I’m glad to see the Biden Administration take a step today to strengthen protections for the old growth and mature forests as part of their carbon reduction plan.”### "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-18-million-to-grant-county-to-increase-broadband-connectivity,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week announced that the City of John Day has earned a $1.8 million CARES Act Recovery Assistance grant to increase broadband connectivity in Grant County.“Reliable broadband is essential infrastructure for Eastern Oregon, just like the Rural Electrification Act opened new opportunities across the nation nearly a century ago,” said Wyden, who supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which included $65 billion to expand broadband to more rural, remote and low-income communities. “This federal investment in fast, dependable internet and a coworking space from the COVID relief package will allow Grant County to take a solid step toward connecting Oregonians to remote work, distance education and homework, telemedicine and more as we build more robust broadband connections for communities in every nook and cranny of our state.”“High-speed internet is a critical need in today’s connected world, especially in our recovery from COVID-19, but also in supporting continued economic development in rural communities,” said Merkley. “I am pleased this federal funding is heading to the John Day and Canyon City region to bring enhancements to broadband infrastructure. This funding will create and retain jobs to support business, education, and underserved communities, all while strengthening the region’s economy.” This project will support community broadband enhancements in the cities of John Day and Canyon City, as well as the acquisition of a coworking space for use by small businesses, distance learners, and residents without reliable broadband service.“The lack of high speed internet has become a deterrent to economic growth and recovery in John Day by restricting opportunities for job creation and business expansion. With this award, they can now compete for businesses and residents who depend on the Internet for their employment,” said John Day City Manager Nicholas Green. “By funding this project, we’re helping provide internet access to over one fifth of John Day’s residents that lack access today, helping to permanently close the digital divide in this rural-frontier community.”"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-12-million-to-columbia-gorge-community-college-,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced a total of $1.2 million in CARES Act funds will be headed to Columbia Gorge Community College to expand their health science workforce. These federal funds will be used to train, support, and fund the health care workforce in the Columbia Gorge Region.  “Health care workers have been the cornerstone of our COVID-19 response over the last two years,” said Senator Merkley. “I’m pleased this federal funding is headed to Columbia Gorge Community College in The Dalles to help bring new dedicated individuals into this important work. This Economic Development Administration grant will provide valuable workforce development programs, ensuring that new health care workers entering the profession are best prepared to keep the community safe and healthy.”?? “I’ve heard from hardworking health care professionals all over Oregon how serious the need is for more colleagues to help care for Oregonians’ well-being in rural communities and statewide,”?said Senator Wyden. “As our state works together to put this public health crisis in the rearview mirror, these federal funds provide crucial support to Columbia Gorge Community College to build out the health care workforce and provide career training for rural Oregonians wanting stable, good-paying and much-needed work opportunities.” This federal investment will help support the Columbia Gorge Community College’s effort to expand training opportunities for students to be qualified staff in the healthcare field, help the region recover from the Coronavirus pandemic, and meet local healthcare needs. When completed, this project is expected to introduce around 800 new healthcare professionals into the field to meet immediate regional needs or to continue their medical study that will lead to higher-level jobs— contributing to the region's local workforce, creating and retaining jobs, and advancing economic resiliency throughout the region. ?“Healthcare workers are a critical force in our region and CGCC is fortunate to be part of the solution,” said Dr. Marta Yera Cronin, Columbia Gorge Community College president. “These funds will allow us to increase our capacity to train more highly-qualified healthcare professionals to serve the Mid-Columbia. Sen. Merkley and Sen. Wyden recognize the incredible stress the COVID pandemic has placed on healthcare workers. Our Senators’ support was instrumental as we expand our ability to train the healthcare workers our region needs so desperately.” ? ### "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-over-40-million-in-federal-funds-headed-to-central-oregon-to-combat-extreme-wildfires,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced a total of $41.3 million headed to Central Oregon to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Senator Merkley, as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the U.S. Forest Service, and Senator Wyden, who is a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, had a key role in authoring wildfire-related sections of the bipartisan infrastructure law, which is the source of this funding.“Oregon’s forests and surrounding communities have been devastated by catastrophic wildfires, which have threatened homes and businesses and severely impacted Oregonians’ quality of life,” said Merkley.  “Healthy forests sustain our economy, protect our drinking water, and provide places for recreation throughout the state. This funding will fill a critical gap in wildfire response and recovery by investing in restoring these landscapes and making it harder for wildfires to explode into megafires. I’ll keep fighting to make sure Oregon gets the support it needs to reduce the risk of severe wildfire to our communities and businesses.”“Central Oregon families and small businesses know all too well how wildfires have ripped through their communities, threatening lives and livelihoods,” said Wyden. “These urgently needed federal resources will help reduce these risks by investing in smart and scientifically proven strategies to prepare for and respond to these destructive blazes. And I’ll keep battling to provide similar investments throughout our state.” The Deschutes National Forest will receive $4.5 million in funding this year to treat an additional 5,000 acres or land, and expects a total of $41.3 million between fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 to fund the treatment of more than 50,000 acres. The Deschutes National Forest is one of 10 landscapes the Department of Agriculture and U.S. Forest Service selected to receive $131 million in investments from the bipartisan infrastructure law to launch the implementation of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy, beginning fiscal year 2022. ### "

The funding that the administration made available this week, which we fought to secure, will go a long way toward helping the region meet the challenges ahead, as we continue to work in close collaboration with federal agencies, state partners, the Klamath Basin tribes, and agricultural producers to realize long-term solutions to end the crisis.  “We know that everyone would prefer to have more water, but when there isn’t enough to go around, we need to find creative ways to help, while laying the groundwork toward more comprehensive solutions. That is why we have worked to ensure this increased funding would be made available for drought relief, habitat restoration efforts, and infrastructure modernization. Because of our efforts, there is an unprecedented amount of funding available to help the Klamath Basin, but it will require collaboration to take advantage of it. ? “All of us must remain united to help the Klamath Basin chart a better path forward through the severe drought and build toward a more resilient future together.”   ###"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-153-million-to-oregon-for-largest-ever-federal-investment-in-transit,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week announced a $153 million investment in Oregon transit, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The apportionment of these dollars represents the largest-ever investment in transit, giving riders better service while creating good-paying jobs in Oregon and nationwide.“A federal investment in transit systems is critical for Oregonians to get easily from Point A to Point B when they’re commuting to work, heading to school, running errands and more,” Wyden said. “These resources helping transit riders in Eugene, Salem and Portland also combat climate change by supporting mass transit options while generating good-paying Oregon jobs in the process.”“Our public transportation systems keep Oregonians connected and have kept vital services within reach for all our communities,” said Merkley. “This federal funding will help make our transit districts stronger, support good paying jobs, and help cut down on toxic air pollution and improve public health. I’ll continue working to ensure that all transit systems across Oregon have the resources they need to keep our communities connected and transport Oregonians where they need to go safely and efficiently.”The funding increases authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that Wyden and Merkley supported, allows transit agencies to buy new buses and railcars, address their repair backlogs, modernize their fleets, and make the transition to new technologies to address the climate crisis. These upgrades will support the expansion of U.S. manufacturing due to Buy America requirements that apply to steel, iron and other materials used in public transportation projects that receive federal assistance. Oregon’s $153 million has been apportioned to municipal transit authorities as follows:“Every day, transit connects millions of Americans to jobs, schools, groceries, hospitals, resources, and countless other opportunities – all while helping to reduce pollution, congestion, and traffic,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. “Now, thanks to the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making the largest investment in public transit in our nation’s history.”“As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Cherriots will see an increase of about 28 percent in its federal transportation funding,” said Cherriots General Manager Allan Pollock. “This will allow us to accelerate infrastructure improvements as we transition to a zero emission bus fleet in the coming years.”"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-jackson-nomination,"Madam President, I’ve already announced that I will support Judge Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson’s character and her qualifications are unassailable, but that hasn’t stopped Senate Republicans from treating her disgracefully. Too often behavior in the hearings was simply shameful. It doesn’t have to be this way and it wasn’t always this way. For example, even though I disagreed with him on plenty of issues, I voted for Chief Justice Roberts, and he was treated very fairly by Democrats. Serious questions were asked and answered. And there wasn’t anything resembling the over-the-line juvenile theatrics like that shown for Judge Jackson. Things changed when President Obama’s final nomination was stolen by the Republicans — when they refused to hold a hearing or consider the sitting president’s nominee on totally fabricated grounds. Democrats are trying to maintain a laser-focus on legal questions and personal qualifications. Republicans launch a sideshow of disgusting personal attacks — and it should be noted they launched those attacks against somebody they voted for unanimously when she was nominated to a lower-level court. The radicalization of the Supreme Court and Supreme Court nominations is poisonous to our democracy, but that’s exactly what was on display when Republicans attacked Judge Jackson in her hearings last month. Let’s get something straight right here at the outset — Judge Jackson was squarely within the sentencing norm for cases involving child sexual abuse material. Senator Hawley smeared her anyway as going soft on predators. It was a gross and baseless accusation — more of a dog whistle to conspiracists than an attempt at honestly vetting a nominee. Even the National Review, nobody’s idea of a liberal publication, published a column that called his attack “meritless to the point of demagoguery.”There’s a big and tragic difference between talking about protecting child victims and really doing the work. Far too many Republican members come down on the wrong side of that divide. It’s true that the government and institutions at every level have failed to protect children from exploitation online. That failure has had a lot of causes. One is that the Justice Department — for reasons I will never understand — has consistently declined to put enough manpower and funding behind this cause. Another reason is that members of Congress talk a big game and then disappear when there’s serious legislation to protect children. I’ve got a bill called the Invest in Child Safety Act. It would put billions of new dollars into tracking down child predators, prosecuting those monsters and protecting the children they target and abuse. It would also create a new executive branch position, a Senate-confirmed director, to raise the level of this work and strengthen our capacity for oversight in Congress.Instead of supporting that legislation, which puts more law enforcement on the beat, Republicans spend their time going after Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Yet again, vulnerable children are being used as pawns by politicians to advance their agenda.Child abuse and exploitation is too serious an issue for US Senators to cheapen it with baseless accusations and ill-conceived legislation. This is the absolute last subject on which members ought to be playing politics. I want to address another issue that’s come up in this debate. It deals with the fundamental right to safe, legal abortion, and Republicans’ desire to obliterate that fundamental right by throwing out long-established law. People understand how Republicans feel about Roe v. Wade. The Roberts Court has effectively overturned Roe already for millions and millions of people living in red states. They did it on the shadow docket by allowing an obviously unconstitutional bounty law in Texas to go into effect. Now states all over the country are passing similar laws — and in some cases they’re going even further to restrict the fundamental right of women to control their own bodies. The fact is, this debate is not just about Roe. It is becoming commonplace for Republicans to say — right out in the open — that the Supreme Court ruled incorrectly in Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 case that affirmed the right of married people to use contraception. Let me repeat that so that it’s perfectly clear what this is all about. It’s not just about the right to a safe and legal abortion.  This is also about rolling back the right to birth control. Republicans are saying that the case that affirmed the right to use birth control was wrongly decided. That’s what Senator Blackburn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said ahead of the hearings on Judge Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court. It’s enough to leave you wondering, what year is this? What century is this? Connecticut’s ban on contraception was based on a federal law from the 1870s — a law from a time when women’s rights were few. They couldn’t even vote. For Connecticut to have that kind of law on the books in 1965 was a ridiculous infringement on the liberty and body autonomy of American women. Estelle Griswold, the women’s rights activist whose name is atop the case, once half-joked that the state would have to “put a gynecological table at the Greenwich toll station” to prevent women from going to New York to get the contraception they needed. But the history in Connecticut shows, as is often the case, this old restriction on personal liberty fell hardest on women without means, even when the law was badly out of date. The Supreme Court ruled correctly when it struck down Connecticut’s law in 1965. To say otherwise is appalling and alarming. The Court recognized that the government ought to stay out of people’s private decisions about family planning. A few years later the Court correctly applied the Griswold precedent to single women, too. A year after that came Roe. All these cases are linked. Put together, the attacks on Roe, and now Griswold, are about letting the government control when someone decides to start a family. It’s about rolling back over 80 years of basic human rights.Prior to her appointment to the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that in these debates over Roe, quote, “Also in the balance is a woman's autonomous charge of her full life's course … her ability to stand in relation to man, society, and the state as an independent, self-sustaining, equal citizen.”When the Court upheld Roe in the 1992 case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the majority ruled that, “The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.”If women can’t legally obtain birth control and they can’t legally obtain abortion care, they no longer have legal control over their bodies. The government does.If women do not control their own bodies, they do not control their own lives. And if Americans do not control their own lives, they are not free and equal under the law. Tossing out Roe — the way the Roberts Court effectively has — is already an act of judicial radicalism. Every Republican Supreme Court nominee swears up and down that they respect precedent, and they won’t legislate from the bench. Then they go and toss out Roe on the shadow docket. For Republicans now to be going after Griswold is simply staggering — and dangerous. For Senators to be attacking this ruling fifty seven years after the case was decided is ridiculous.It’s not just because the government ought to stay out of the exam room and the bedroom. It’s not just because birth control is a part of basic health regimens. It’s because women in America have an equal right to chart the course of their own lives, including if and when to be pregnant.Republicans try to cover for the radicalism of their position on Roe and Griswold by saying it’s about states’ rights. Wrong. If Republicans believed in states’ rights, they’d respect the right of Democratic states to pass gun safety laws. They’d respect the right of states to legalize marijuana. They’d respect the right of states to ensure we have clean air and water. But Republicans oppose all of those priorities, challenge those laws in federal court and undermine them in Congress. It’s also important to consider these debates about reproductive freedom and women’s equality in the context of what’s happening in statehouses around the country. Republican legislatures are effectively banning abortion. They’re passing laws that do more to protect rapists than rape victims. They’re criminalizing abortion care in some cases, and in other cases they are criminalizing the act of helping women obtain the health care they need. Some Republican state lawmakers are attempting to restrict freedom of movement by making it a crime to get abortion care in a state where providers are still operating. Some states want to make it impossible to obtain or use mifepristone to safely end pregnancies early. A Republican lawmaker in Missouri recently proposed forcing women to carry ectopic pregnancies to term, which is effectively a death sentence. The bottom line is, what’s happening today, in 2022, is collectively the most extreme attack on reproductive health, freedom and equality in America I can remember. This is not just the same old debate over Roe and choice. State-level Republicans are already way beyond that point. For Republicans here in Congress to be going after Griswold — after birth control — is a shocking escalation. American lives and liberty are at stake. Nothing less. Americans need to be prepared to fight for freedom and equality in the months and years ahead, and I will be right there with them. In the meantime, I’m confident that Judge Jackson will make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice and a bulwark for the rights of women and all Americans. This is a truly historic confirmation — one that’s long overdue. I’ll be proud to give Judge Jackson my vote, and I urge all my colleagues to support her nomination as well. A video of Wyden’s floor remarks is here.###Ashley Schapitl (Wyden) 202-224-5244"

They ensured the water quality and public health of Lane County remained safe during this destructive event as they protected the only source of drinking water for the entire Eugene metro area. I’m pleased these funds headed to Lane County will help cover the costs of these essential measures, and I’m thankful for FEMA’s continued support for the McKenzie Valley region. I’ll continue to do all I can to ensure federal resources are available to all Oregon communities protecting against, responding to, and rebuilding from these extreme weather events.”   The Holiday Farm fire burned more than 170,000 acres and 1,100 buildings, posing an immediate threat to the water quality of the McKenzie River, a primary source of Lane County drinking water, notably for the cities of Eugene and Springfield. Lane County Emergency Management was able to limit the amount of burned materials, eroded soil and ash from contaminating the river. “The relationships and coordination between local jurisdictions and agencies made this possible. Through mutual aid support between Lane County and EWEB as well as many other partners we were able to support the watershed emergency cleanup effort immediately following the Holiday Farm fire,” Lane County Commissioner Heather Buch said. “The McKenzie River is the single drinking water source for a large population in Lane County and its purity is a regional priority.”   "
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-over-22-million-in-federal-funds-headed-to-mid-willamette-valley-community-action-agency,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has awarded the Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency (MWVCAA) a $2,225,000 grant to update its existing veterans’ shelter. This award comes after the announcement of MWVCAA’s acquisition of a new property immediately adjacent to the existing shelter, a community project Senators Merkley and Wyden supported and requested funds for and which was later approved and funded through the government spending bill Senator Merkley helped write and was signed into law earlier this month.“There are big and important things happening at Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency, including the acquisition of a new property to expand shelter space and service capacity for veterans in Marion, Polk, and Yamhill counties experiencing homelessness,” said Senator Merkley, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that secured funding for this project. “It’s great news that the Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency is now receiving additional funding from the VA to rehabilitate this building and expand on their support for veterans. I am thankful for Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency and the important work they are doing to help get our veterans off the streets.”“Veterans in the Willamette Valley and across Oregon deserve solid support when they make the transition to civilian life after their service to our country,” said Senator Wyden. “I’m glad the Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency has earned these VA resources with the local agency’s innovative approach to build that housing support for veterans struggling on the streets. And I’ll keep working to secure similar resources for veterans across our state.”This award is one of 36 grants the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded to community organizations under VA’s Grant and Per Diem program—a program intended to improve the quality of housing options for veterans experiencing homelessness. This award will allow MWVCAA grantee organizations to construct new buildings and renovate existing transitional housing facilities that provide more than 900 beds nationwide for homeless veterans. These grants are supported with funds authorized through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and are a part of limited series of capital grants designed to continue relief efforts in response to COVID-19.“The Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency (MWVCAA) recently received $2,225,000 in capital funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, one of only 36 awards given nationwide. The funds will expand their Grant and Per Diem program and improve housing options for Veterans experiencing homelessness in Marion and Polk County. More specifically, they will help MWVCAA’s Veteran-specific housing project, Tanner Project, protect the health of vulnerable Veterans by transforming their double-occupancy rooms into single occupancy ones. Tanner Project is a transitional housing project for veterans, and the only place between Eugene and Portland that has female-specific veteran beds available. It features a number of on-site supportive services, including case management, mental and behavioral health groups, food resources, peer support, and community activities, all of which Veterans can choose to access as they move towards permanent housing.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-fix-supply-chain-and-ease-shipping-backlogs-passes-senate,"Washington, DC -- U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden said today that bipartisan legislation he co-sponsored to help fix supply chains and ease shipping backlogs in Oregon and nationwide has passed the Senate by voice vote. “Oregon farmers and all other businesses exporting our state’s world-renowned products need a level playing field to do what they do best -- compete successfully in a global economy so they can continue generating jobs here at home,” Wyden said. “And all Oregonians need relief from supply chain snarls driving up prices.  I’m glad the Senate passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act this week to help Oregon and the entire country by making it harder for ocean carriers to collect record profits in part by unjustly refusing goods ready to export from U.S. ports.”The Ocean Shipping Reform Act earned the endorsement of the American Association of Port Authorities, which represents more than 130 port authorities across North and South America. The bill is also endorsed by more than 100 organizations including the Association of Port Authorities, the Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC), the National Retail Federation, and the American Trucking Association.In addition to Wyden, other co-sponsors of the legislation written by U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune (R-SD) are U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), John Hoeven (R-ND), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Todd Young (R-IN), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Tina Smith (D-MN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), Mike Braun (R-IN), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), James Risch (R-ID), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Boozman (R-AR), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO).Companion legislation was led in the House by U.S. Reps.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-colleagues-call-on-department-of-education-doj-to-follow-through-on-pledge-to-improve-handling-of-student-debt-bankruptcy-claims,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have joined colleagues in asking the federal Departments of Education and Justice for an update on efforts to improve how the agencies handle undue hardship claims by student borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings. “The undue hardship exception (11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8)) currently serves as the only option in the bankruptcy code for discharge of student loans, and that exception has been narrowly construed by most courts.  The federal government’s aggressive litigation challenges against students who pursue undue hardship claims further exacerbates this situation,” the senators wrote in their letter this week to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Attorney General Merrick Garland. “All too often, [Department of Education] ED and [Department of Justice] DOJ oppose undue hardship discharges in adversarial bankruptcy proceedings, requiring debtors to effectively demonstrate a certainty of hopelessness before they can obtain relief. Clearing this statutorily unnecessary high bar is challenging enough for individuals who are represented by experienced attorneys.  It is virtually impossible for those without representation.”More than 45 million Americans hold more than $1.7 trillion in student loan debt, and cumulative student loan debt is the second largest category of consumer debt after mortgages. While most forms of debt can be discharged through the bankruptcy process, student loan debt is currently treated as non-dischargeable except in extremely rare cases of “undue hardship.” The term “undue hardship” has been interpreted by courts to establish high hurdles for borrowers to meet—a challenge made even more difficult by federal agency policies that encourage aggressive challenges in bankruptcy court when student borrowers bring undue hardship claims.In the letter, Wyden and Merkley called on Secretary Cardona to follow through on his public statement that the Department of Education (ED) would change the Department’s approach to “undue hardship” claims to make it a more attainable option for discharging student debt in bankruptcy. The Senators also called on the Department of Education to promptly release a long-awaited update to guidance it issued in 2015 on handling undue hardship claims, and asked if the Justice Department (DOJ) has issued guidance to its attorneys to carry out the Department of Education’s directive to pause active bankruptcy litigation while the policy changes are implemented.Wyden and Merkley also questioned DOJ on what steps had been taken to inform student borrowers currently in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings that they could pause their litigation so as to benefit from policy changes the Department of Education implements around “undue hardship.”“Secretary Cardona also revealed that ED has asked DOJ to pause any active bankruptcy litigation if the student borrower wishes, in order to ‘ensure that every borrower can benefit from these changes.’  Has DOJ issued guidance to its attorneys handling active bankruptcy cases consistent with ED’s request that stays be available to borrowers?  What public outreach has ED or DOJ done to ensure that borrowers and their legal representatives are aware of the option for a stay?” Wyden and Merkley asked.The letter concluded with Wyden and Merkley stating they look forward to working with ED and DOJ to promptly implement the goals articulated by Secretary Cardona and to help bring clarity, fairness, and cost-effectiveness to the federal government’s approach on undue hardship claims.The letter was led by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. Alongside Wyden and Merkley, the letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I, Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Jack Reed, D-R.I., Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Bob Casey, D-Pa., Ed Markey, D-Mass., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Tina Smith, D-Minn., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and Angus King, I-Maine.The text of letter is here."
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-extend-student-loan-payment-pause-and-cancel-student-debt,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden cosigned a letter to President Joseph R. Biden urging the administration to act now to extend the pause on federally-held student loan payments until at least the end of the year and to provide meaningful student debt cancellation.“Given the fast-approaching deadline for borrowers to resume payments, your administration must act as quickly as possible to extend the pause and make clear to the American public your intention to cancel a meaningful amount of student debt. We look forward to supporting your administration in getting it done,” wrote the lawmakers. The payment pause has made a significant difference throughout the pandemic, providing essential relief to millions of families during the economic and public health crisis, and saving borrowers an average of $393 per month. Borrowers have greatly benefited from the ongoing payment pause, taking the opportunity to pay down other debt, relieve financial pressures from lost jobs or decreased earnings, and support their families' needs. Restarting repayment will financially destabilize many borrowers, and will cause hardship for many who cannot afford repayment. Most borrowers are not financially prepared to shoulder another bill as they face skyrocketing costs for necessities like food and gas.Black students in particular borrow more to attend college, borrow more often while they are in school, and have a harder time paying their debt off than their white peers. They are more than three times as likely to go into default within four years on their federal loans as white borrowers – and face wage garnishment, tax refund withholding, and federal benefit offset. Latino borrowers are more likely to struggle in repaying their loans and have some of the lowest post-education earnings among all racial or ethnic groups. For example, even when controlling for educational attainment, Latinos with bachelor’s degrees earn 21% less than their white peers do. When looking at disparities in default, twenty percent of Latino borrowers defaulted on their student loans compared to 13% of white borrowers six years after starting college. On top of that, communities of color have also had higher rates of illness and death from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.“Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues. The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap,” they continued. “Student debt cancellation must be one of the key actions in your comprehensive approach to advance equity as our nation works to rebuild a stronger and more equitable economy.”Full text of the letter can be found hereThe letter is led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), along with Representatives Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and House Majority Whip James E.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-announces-statewide-town-hall-schedule-for-april,"Portland –  U.S. Senator Ron Wyden today announced he will have 12 live on-line town halls hosted by People’s Town Hall in April for residents of Coos, Curry, Yamhill, Clatsop, Linn, Benton, Polk, Gilliam, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa and Morrow counties.Heading into this month’s virtual town halls, Wyden has held 1,007 town halls statewide in fulfillment of his pledge to hold at least one town hall each year in each of Oregon’s 36 counties.“Keeping my commitment for town halls each year in each of our state’s 36 counties has been essential to my public service because it provides any Oregonian the opportunity to ask questions and share their ideas,” Wyden said. “And coming off my 1,000th town hall earlier this year, I want all Oregonians to know I’m going to keep my promise to continue these direct discussions that help to shorten the distance between our state and Washington, DC. That’s the Oregon Way and I very much look forward to these upcoming conversations at home in Oregon.”""Our democracy is stronger and better when lawmakers meet regularly with their constituents, and we congratulate Senator Wyden on his recent 1,000th town hall representing the people of Oregon,” said Nathan Williams of People's Town Hall, a virtual town hall series from the founders of Town Hall Project. “People's Town Hall invites all constituents in these twelve Oregon counties, regardless of party affiliation, to join the upcoming substantive conversations so vital to our democracy.""The upcoming virtual town hall schedule is as follows:For Oregonians in those counties who want to submit questions for Senator Wyden, here’s the link."
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-co-sponsor-bill-to-extend-summer-meal-flexibilities-to-feed-children-,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley said today they are co-sponsoring bipartisan legislation that would extend federal school meal flexibilities for children in Oregon and nationwide from June 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023.These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And with 90 percent of schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities give schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food service issues and keep kids fed. The Support Kids Not Red Tape Act also would help schools make the transition back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture requested this authority be extended in the omnibus.“Hunger doesn’t take a vacation and neither can the year-round work to fight this scourge facing far too many children in Oregon and throughout the country,” Wyden said. “Meals in the summer and throughout the school year provide essential help for students needing nutritious breakfasts and lunches so they can have the best opportunity to learn and lead healthy lives. The importance of these meals became magnified as families weathered the economic fallout from the pandemic, and these flexibilities should be extended while schools continue working hard to make the transition back to operations before COVID.”“Every child—regardless of the color of their skin, the town they live in, or where their parents work—deserves nutritious meals all year long,” Merkley said. “Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, over half a million people in Oregon, including one in five children, struggled with food insecurity. As kids transition back into schools, the last thing they should be concerned about is their next meal. My colleagues and I have the opportunity to extend federal school meal flexibilities in Oregon and around the country, and I’m proud to be working in a bipartisan manner to make that happen. I will continue fighting for Oregonians and supporting legislation that brings us closer to ending hunger in Oregon and beyond.”In addition to Wyden and Merkley, others senators co-sponsoring the bill introduced by U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Robert Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Rafael Warnock (D-GA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Carper (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Charles Schumer (D-NY), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA).Anti-hunger and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and applauded the bill to keep critical flexibilities for school nutrition programs to feed children.“School meal programs, a crucial source of nutritional support for millions of families nationwide, face tremendous immediate and long-term challenges in the absence of these child nutrition waivers,” said Beth Wallace, president of the School Nutrition Association. “Acute supply chain disruptions, persistent labor shortages and escalating costs make it impossible for these programs to return to normal operations next school year. This legislation is absolutely critical to sustaining school meal programs, ensuring children have access to nutritious school meals and preventing substantial financial losses for schools nationwide.”“Without Congressional action, the child nutrition waivers will end on June 30, 2022, causing millions of children to face a hunger cliff when they lose access to summer and school meals. Furthermore, schools and community-based organizations that feed our nation’s children need time to recover from the impact of the pandemic,” said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research & Action Center. “We applaud Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this issue and strongly endorse this bill which would extend waiver authority through September 30, 2023. Hungry children can't wait."" “The sooner the USDA is authorized to extend child nutrition waivers, the sooner schools and community organizations can plan meal programs for summer and next school year,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Schools and community meal providers continue to face extreme pandemic-related challenges like supply chain disruptions, rising food prices and staffing shortages. Without waivers, they will have a difficult time responding to these challenges in real-time, impacting their ability to safely and effectively reach kids with the nutrition they need and stunting their ability to transition to normal operations as those challenges subside.”“Nearly 12 million children struggle to know where their next meal will come from, disrupting their ability to reach their full potential. Fortunately, child nutrition waivers have helped provide year-round access to much-needed nutrition. If the waivers aren’t extended, millions of children will lose that access, with Black, Latino, and Native American children, and children in rural areas, being hit hardest,” said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer, Feeding America. “Because of the delay in extending the waivers, some site sponsors will have to close summer and after-school meal sites, translating to taking away meals that families are relying on to keep their kids nourished. Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, applauds the introduction of this bill to extend child nutrition waivers, continuing this critical lifeline for children. We urge Congress to act immediately to ensure our children don’t face hunger this summer and beyond.” A broad spectrum of groups sent in letters to Congress to extend the child nutrition waiver authority.

In particular, we had a good discussion about when judges should defer to the executive branch on national security matters. “Judge Jackson is one of the most qualified Supreme Court nominees I’ve seen, and I am dismayed by the offensive attacks she was subjected to by my Republican colleagues looking to boost their potential 2024 campaigns by appealing to conspiracy theorists and wingnuts. She handled the smears with poise and determination that showcased her impeccable character.  “The Supreme Court’s credibility is on shaky ground, with the Court increasingly open to wild theories that would entrench minority rule, gut the Voting Rights Act, and overturn women’s constitutional right to abortion. Judge Jackson will be a critically important voice on the Court.”### "

I know many communities will benefit greatly as their homes become more energy-efficient—keeping their families safe and lowering energy costs.”The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) reduces energy costs for low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, while ensuring health and safety in extreme weather events. The program provides weatherization services to approximately 35,000 homes every year so that they can save an average of $372 in annual energy costs.  "

My EDGE Act would help set the course for a clean energy future while creating good-paying jobs on American soil.”Earlier this month, Wyden introduced the American Energy Development and Growth Enhancement (EDGE) Act to help expand the processing and manufacturing of critical minerals. The legislation would create a grant program under the Department of the Interior to aid the cleanup and modernization of existing processing sites, while maintaining strong environmental protections.As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Wyden is also the author of the Clean Energy for America Act, which would help end outdated tax subsidies for dirty fossil fuels and create new tax incentives for clean energy production.Video of Senator Wyden’s remarks is here.The full video of today’s hearing is here.###Emily Zahnle-Hostetler (Wyden) 202-224-5244"

As our fire seasons continue to grow longer and fiercer, I’ll keep fighting to make sure Oregon gets the support it needs to reduce the risk of severe wildfire to our communities and businesses.”“Federal investment in lowering wildfire dangers and managing forest health is a must for Eastern Oregon and our state to build a stronger rural economy and healthier environment so Oregonians aren’t breathing in smoke,” said Wyden. “I’m gratified the La Grande Valley West Resilience Project has secured these federal funds, and will continue battling for similar investments statewide that grow jobs, protect communities and support quality of life throughout rural Oregon.”This announcement comes after Senator Merkley issued a letter in September 2021 to Joint-Chiefs Terry Cosby and Randy Moore requesting federal funds and resources to be allocated towards the La Grande Valley West Resilience Project.“The Joint Chiefs funding will allow for much needed restoration work to take place.  This particular project is a keystone to multiple other projects on adjacent properties. It really is a portion of a much larger landscape wide, all lands effort,” said Paul Anderes, Union County Commissioner.“These types of projects meet multiple needs for our landscapes, communities, and associates.  We appreciate these investments in our landscapes because they have multiple social, ecological, and economic benefits.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-call-on-fda-to-change-discriminatory-blood-donation-policies-to-address-national-blood-supply-shortage-,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week joined colleagues to call on federal officials to act on the most up to date science and update its discriminatory blood donor deferral policies for men who have sex with men (MSM). With the Red Cross declaring its first-ever national blood shortage that is posing risks to patient care, with as much as one-quarter of hospital blood needs not currently being met, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  can take the long overdue step to remove the discriminatory practice, increasing the eligible blood donor base and helping address the crisis.“In light of the nation’s urgent blood supply crisis and to ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions during the pandemic, we urge you to swiftly update your current blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, based on individualized risk factors, and allow all potentially eligible donors to do so free of stigma. We also request a briefing in the next 30 days on the agency’s plan to update its MSM blood donation policies,” the senators wrote Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra and FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock.In addition to decreasing the eligible donor base and depriving patients of needed blood, the current three month donor deferral blood donation policy for MSM unnecessarily stigmatizes and harms the LGBTQ+ community. The broad consensus among the medical community indicates that the current scientific evidence does not support these discriminatory restrictions, and that a policy focused on individual risk assessment rather than an effective ban on gay and bisexual men would be far more appropriate.“Every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs a blood transfusion to survive. But right now, the FDA continues to use archaic, discriminatory criteria to determine an individual’s eligibility to donate blood based solely on their sexual orientation – not their individual risk factors – which is not rooted in science, limits access to crucial blood products, and stigmatizes one segment of society,” said David Stacy, Government Affairs Director of the Human Rights Campaign. ""The FDA instead should focus its considerations for blood donor deferrals based on risky behavior by any potential donor, regardless of one’s sexual orientation.

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued the following statement after voting no on obstructionist legislation by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, related to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline:""Senator Cruz had an opportunity to come up with serious legislation dealing with Nord Stream 2, but instead he wrote a bill that would hogtie the Senate with procedural votes and obstruct progress on all the other issues that matter to American families. This is the latest example in a pattern in which Senator Cruz tramples on the important American principle of leaving politics out of U.S. national security matters. I strongly oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and support sanctioning the Putin allies constructing it, which is why it’s a shame that Senator Cruz’s overtly political legislation prevented the Senate from having a real debate on those priorities.""###Keith Chu 202-224-5244"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-join-colleagues-to-introduce-legislation-to-give-every-american-lifesaving-masks,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and more than 50 Democratic colleagues in the Senate and House to reintroduce lifesaving legislation to manufacture and distribute highly-protective N95 masks to every person in Oregon and nationwide.  Under Sanders’ Masks for All Act – first introduced in 2020 and developed in consultation with health experts including Andy Slavitt, former COVID-19 advisor to President Biden and the former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President Obama – every person in the U.S. would receive a free package of three N95 respirator masks. This includes individuals who are experiencing homelessness or living in group settings such as prisons, shelters, college dorms, and assisted living facilities, as well as all workers in health settings, from administrative and janitorial, to food service, doctors, and nurses.“This public health crisis demands an immediate response that equips everybody in Oregon and throughout the country with the high-quality masks that have proven effective in the defense against infection,” Wyden said. “A comprehensive science-based approach is what’s urgently needed to get past the pandemic as soon as humanly possible, and this bill provides a key tool in the fight to achieve that goal.”“As we continue to combat the recent surge of COVID-19, Oregonians should have every tool at their disposal to protect their families and themselves from possible exposure,” said Merkley. “N95 masks have proven to save thousands of lives and limit potential risk for so many others. I am proud to support the Masks for All Act to ensure that every American – regardless of income or status – doesn’t have to face a financial burden to get high-quality protection while trying to navigate this global pandemic.”In addition to Wyden and Merkley, other senators co-sponsoring Sanders’ Masks for All Act include U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). U.S. Reps. Ro Khanna (CA-17), Lori Trahan (MA-03), and Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) are co-leading the legislation in the House, with more than 30 additional cosponsors.  “As we face the rapidly spreading omicron variant, we should remember that not all face masks are created equal,” Sanders said. “Congress must demand the mass production and distribution of N95 masks, one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of the Covid virus. It is an absolute scandal that in the richest country in the history of the world, high-quality masks are not more readily available to frontline workers, health care workers, and all Americans. We are proposing that we do what our public health experts and scientists say we must do: provide all of our people with high-quality, N95 masks without cost, which could prevent death and suffering and save huge amounts of health care dollars.”  This legislation would require the federal government to use all available authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to eliminate shortages of N95 respirator masks and distribute them to the public as soon as possible. The proposal would use the United States Postal Service for distribution and set up pick-up sites at convenient community locations that are already providing essential services, such as Post Offices, pharmacies, schools, public transportation stations, and COVID-19 testing sites. It would also end the U.S. reliance on China and other countries for this essential lifesaving equipment.  According to recent reports, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering updating its mask guidance to recommend N95 or KN95 masks. When the CDC initially issued mask guidance in 2020, N95 masks were reportedly not recommended for the general public out of concern for shortages for health care workers. Health officials now say there is not a N95 shortage. However, counterfeit masks and general access remain an issue, for the public and in hospitals and health care facilities around the country.  Studies have shown that the widespread use of face masks could prevent tens of thousands of COVID-19 deaths, while other studies indicate universal mask wearing could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. Today, the benefits of widespread N95 use would be even greater. According to recent data, an N95 respirator mask provides the individual wearer with at least 2.5 hours of protection against an unmasked person infected with the Omicron variant, compared to just 20 minutes of protection if they are wearing a cloth mask or 30 minutes if they are wearing a surgical mask.  To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 60 million Americans and killed more than 835,000, and just this week the U.S. reported a record-breaking 1.35 million new coronavirus infections in one day – the highest daily total in the world.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-colleagues-call-on-biden-administration-to-make-permanent-oshas-emergency-covid-19-protections-for-health-care-workers,"Washington, D.C. –As the rise of the Omicron variant continues to threaten the safety of our nation’s health care workforce, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden today joined colleagues in a letter calling on the Biden administration to continue and make permanent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) emergency COVID-19 protections for health care workers in Oregon and nationwide.“We are  writing  to urge  you to move  forward with  a  permanent,  enforceable  standard that  would require  employers  to protect  workers  in  health  care  settings  and to  keep the  emergency protections  in  place  until  a  permanent  standard is  issued, which should be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible,” Wyden and the lawmakers wrote. “Given the  emergence  and  rapid spread of the  Omicron  variant,  health care  workers  need to retain  strong, enforceable  protections  now;  these  protections  cannot  lapse. This  is  necessary to adequately  address  the  emergency  context  of the  present  situation  health  care workers  are  facing.”The letter addresses OSHA’s announcement at the end of 2021 that it would allow the Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to lapse, despite the fact that health care workers still face serious safety challenges and workplace risks.In June of 2021, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect the workers who have shouldered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide clear standards detailing health care employers’ responsibilities to the safety of their workers. The standard requires employers to identify and control COVID-19 hazards in the workplace, provide access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and adequate ventilation systems, and ensure workers are notified of workplace exposures to COVID-19. This standard also gave health care workers a tool against which to measure their workplace practices, and recourse to OSHA if they felt their workplace was out of compliance.On December 27, 2021, six months after promulgation of the ETS, OSHA announced it was not ready to issue a permanent rule and would let the non-recordkeeping portions of the temporary standard expire. When OSHA issued the ETS in June 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that 491,816 health care workers had contracted COVID-19 and 1,611 had died. Today, those numbers have nearly doubled, with the CDC reporting that 848,028 health care workers across the nation have contracted COVID-19. Without a permanent rule, the health and well-being of our nation’s health care workers are at risk.This letter is led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and along with Wyden is co-signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Tina Smith, D-Minn., Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Ed Markey, D-Mass., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Cory Booker, D-N.J., Gary Peters, D-Mich., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn.

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-merkley-more-than-36-million-for-fire-suppression-efforts-during-white-river-fire,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley this week announced that more than $3.6 million from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) will go toward recovery from the White River Fire that burned in the Mt. Hood National Forest in August 2020.“The White River Fire demonstrated how quickly wildfire can spread with a changing climate causing high winds and drought,” Wyden said. “Wildfire season is starting earlier, lasting longer and destroying more of our treasured natural spaces, homes and businesses, not to mention killing people trapped in the blazes. I will continue to fight every day for nationwide efforts to battle climate change and prevent wildfire by caring for the health of Oregon’s forest land.”“Like so many other wildfires that devastated communities and forests across the state, the White River fire put lives in jeopardy, homes in harm’s way, and left thousands of forest acres in serious need of restoration,” said Merkley. “I am pleased that Oregon will receive federal reimbursement for fire suppression efforts, and I will continue fighting for resources that ensure Oregon stays prepared and resilient against climate chaos and wildfire disasters.”  This award provides $3,678,520 in federal reimbursement to the Oregon Department of Forestry for fire suppression measures. On August 17, 2020, the White River Fire began from lightning in Mt. Hood National Forest, threatening more than 1,700 residences and burning more than 17,000 acres. "

https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/merkley-wyden-announce-reimbursement-of-more-than-15-million-in-federal-funds-for-oregon-national-guards-wildfire-response,"Washington, D.C. – Oregon's U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced $1,560,777.06 in federal funds to cover the deployment of the Oregon National Guard (ORNG) in response to the catastrophic wildfires Oregon experienced in 2020. These funds, allocated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will reimburse ORNG’s efforts in assisting the overwhelmed staff of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management, state and local law enforcement, and emergency first responders during these disasters.“Responding to the unprecedented wildfire seasons is an all-hands-on-deck situation. I am grateful for the quick and dedicated response of Oregon’s National Guard when we needed their support,” said Merkley. “I’m pleased these expenses will be federally reimbursed, and I will continue to work towards ensuring Oregon will be supported when our communities are in need of state, local, and federal assistance.”“The Oregon National Guard stepped up in a big way to protect lives and communities statewide during the devastating 2020 wildfires, and I’m gratified the federal government is covering the costs of that heroic response,” Wyden said. “I’ll keep working both to reduce the risk of wildfires in our state and to make sure the federal government responds when these blazes strike in any corner of Oregon.”During the incident period, catastrophic wildfires and hurricane-strength, straight-line winds raged throughout the state of Oregon causing widespread damage to property, human suffering, financial loss, and loss of life, requiring extraordinary emergency response and protective measures. In 2017, Merkley created the National Guard wildfire fighting training program and continues to secure funding for these invaluable teams. ###"
https://www.wyden.senate.gov//news/press-releases/wyden-delivers-floor-speech-on-protecting-democracy-and-expanding-the-right-to-vote,"Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., delivered the following remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate in support of protecting democracy and expanding the right to vote.“A year ago today, not far from where we stand this afternoon, domestic terrorists tried to beat our democracy to the ground. They might have been successful were it not for the police officers who defended our democracy as they were viciously attacked and beaten. Before anything else we must salute these officers, and all those who work, day in and day out, alongside them in the Capitol. For their courage, we should all be eternally grateful. The insurrection on January 6th was an attack instigated by the former president who wanted to undo the results of a democratic election. Let’s also understand that inciting the mob wasn’t the end of it, and Donald Trump didn’t walk quietly off into the sunset after the Biden inauguration. The effort to undermine our democracy -- to end free and fair elections in America -- is ongoing. Support for the Big Lie is essentially unchanged from where it was a year ago, and an awful lot of Republicans who said on January 6th that they were done with Donald Trump have cozied back up to him twelve months later. The only reason the mob is not here today is Donald Trump didn’t summon them back. Now it's our job to ensure that another attack like this, or by any other means, never succeeds. There will be more to say about these issues in the days ahead. In my view, protecting the vote is step one in protecting democracy. A guiding principle for this Senate must be that while politics may guide a citizen’s vote, it should never determine whether they are allowed to vote. To act otherwise, would undermine the very foundations of a representative democracy. Empowering voters with a system built on integrity and accountability. A system that promotes participation rather than discourages it. A system with a history of bipartisanship. That’s the kind we have in my home state of Oregon. Oregon believes so strongly in the right to vote that everyone gets a ballot straight to their home. I’m proud to say that I was the first US Senator elected in an all vote-by-mail election. Back then, it was Republicans pushing to expand vote-by-mail. A Democratic governor even vetoed a vote-by-mail bill in 1995. Right after my election, the Republicans flipped and vote-by-mail was suddenly bad, bad, bad. Everything flipped again a few months later when Gordon Smith, a Republic from eastern Oregon, became the second Senator elected in an all-mail election. The voters liked it so much, a ballot measure to make Oregon’s elections all vote-by-mail passed with 70 percent of the vote in 1998. Oregon’s experience with voting by mail started out forty years ago with a few local elections in Linn County, a mostly rural county in the Western part of the state. It grew and grew from there. Election officials learned that when you let people vote at home, participation goes up and costs go down. One of the biggest defenders of Oregon’s vote at home system was the late Dennis Richardson, who served as Oregon Secretary of State. Dennis was a Republican with a capital-capital-capital R. He was about as conservative as they come, but in the Trump era when people criticized Oregon’s elections or spouted lies about fraud, Dennis always stood up and cleared the record. He even wrote to Donald Trump in 2017 that, quote, “we are confident that voter fraud in last November's election did not occur in Oregon.” Every election, young Oregonians watch their parents vote around kitchen tables—inspiring the next generation of committed voters. Voting at home gives you the opportunity to be more informed. If there’s an initiative on the ballot or a race you haven’t researched, you can take time to study the options. When you’re done, your ballot goes into a security envelope and you sign the outside. For me, that’s when I head down to the Sellwood branch of the Multnomah County Public Library, drop my ballot in the collection box and go home. No long lines, no glitchy touch-screen systems. No hassle whatsoever.A recent analysis in the Election Law Journal said that out of all 50 states, voting is easiest in Oregon. We get some of the highest turnout rates in the country. Oregon has also been a leader in terms of increasing turnout among black and Latino voters. Voter registration is automatic - as easy as a trip to the DMV. I’ve been pushing for universal vote-at-home legislation since 2002. I have a bill called the Vote at Home Act that would give every American the right to vote the way my neighbors and I do in Oregon, automatic registration included. I guarantee it would be a hit nationwide. Letting people vote at home is also the best defense against some of the most insidious methods of voter suppression. For example, what we’ve seen over the last few years -- state and local governments shuttering polling places, particularly ones that serve Black and Latino voters -- is absolutely unforgivable. These days, in some areas, Republicans are making it illegal to give water and food to people standing in line to vote. Nobody should have to wait hours in line. It shouldn’t be a test of physical stamina -- going without food and water. Nobody should have to wonder if they’ll be able to vote if they step out of line to go to the bathroom. Nobody should have to sacrifice an entire day to participate in their own democracy. That’s why I’ve also introduced the People Over Long Lines Act -- the POLL Act. That bill says state governments have to guarantee that everyone who votes in person can do so within 30 minutes. Anybody who’s forced to wait longer than that can sue. If they win, it’s 50 bucks for waiting longer than 30 minutes, and 50 bucks more for every hour after that. A free bit of advice to states who don’t want to get hit with those penalties, the best way to make sure nobody has to wait in line for hours is to let them vote at home. It’s not just Oregon that votes by mail. If you need another example, let me point you toward a group called the United States armed forces. Most service members and their families vote by mail in every federal election. It's been that way for decades.The bottom line is that Oregon’s system works. It raises voter participation. It lowers the costs of running elections. It helps voters get more informed. It’s a safe and secure approach. And if you’re resisting safe and efficient elections with higher voter turnout, then you’re suppressing democracy in America. Oregon shows the way on preserving America. I’ll close this afternoon on a personal note: My German family who fled their homeland were deeply rooted in that nation’s society, as my great grandfather was a member of Parliament and served on the Berlin City Council. My family was forced as Jews to flee the fascists who had taken over their democracy. They fled to America as the last remaining beacon of freedom. With that freedom my dad chose to serve in our army that fought the German fascism and has been recognized for his unique contributions. If my dad was alive today he would tell us, “Senators make sure that the light in America’s beacon of freedom never goes out.”Video of Wyden’s floor remarks are available here.Keith Chu (Wyden)"
