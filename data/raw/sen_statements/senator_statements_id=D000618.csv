However, Citi has had no problem doing business with Russian oil companies and was the last to announce a pullout from Russia. In fact, Citigroup did not even stop soliciting clients in Russia for three weeks after the February 24th invasion into Ukraine,” Daines said.Lastly, Senator Daines questioned the banks on the makeup of their boards, which claim to be diverse but lean heavily Democratic.

The Gordon Butte Pumped Storage Hydro Project is a perfect example of how Montana is leading in all-of-the-above solutions,” Daines said.Daines also called for more domestic mining to allow America to become less dependent on China for critical minerals.Click HERE to watch and download“The United States is import dependent on China for 31 of the 50 minerals designated as critical…. As we move forward with more renewable sources of energy, China… could constrain the supply chain and our ability to keep energy storage supply chains moving forward – [China], a country that has slave labor, has far lower environmental standards than the United States. Meanwhile, we have these radical environmental groups in the ninth circuit court who use litigation to tie up the domestic mining of the materials needed for responsible renewable energy development…. These constant delays are a threat to our national security, they hurt our economy, and they hold back the future of renewable energy technology,” Daines said.###  Contact: Rachel Dumke, Blake Kernen"

We may have as many as 14 people crammed into a single-family home. The importance of addressing this shortage cannot be overstated. We must find solutions to help Montanans house their families and loved ones,” Daines said.Senator Daines also highlighted how proper forest management could ease skyrocketing lumber costs for homebuilders. Click HERE to watch and download.“I will just note that last spring in the midst of soaring lumber prices and shortages nationwide lumber prices rose about 100%, they crest in April at 300%…During the same period lumber production in Montana actually decreased by 11% and our national forests failed to meet timber harvest targets…Montana could have offset some of these market dynamics had we simply been managing our forests,” Daines said.###  Contact: Rachel Dumke, Blake Kernen"

The CEOs decision came at the recommendation of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which has no authority over the affairs of American businesses. “…This decision, which is already being hailed by radical anti-gun activists, is he first step towards backdoor gun control on law abiding Americans. Any change that seeks to impact a United States citizen’s ability to legally purchase a firearm belongs with Congress, not payment networks, international standard setting organizations, or the financial institutions that some of you serve,” Daines wrote.“To be perfectly clear, your hand is not being forced. Creating a new merchant code for gun transactions is a choice being made by each of your companies. You are choosing the side of gun control advocates over the privacy and Second Amendment rights of millions of law-abiding Americans. You are choosing to insert yourselves into this political debate – which should only be fought at the ballot box and in Congress – and in doing so you are making clear that you are more than unbiased network operators seeking to maximize value for your customers and shareholders.

Reported delays in providing care, lost health care forms, and use of the wrong equipment have all stood in the way of the United States fulfilling its healthcare obligations to tribal nations.

Many Montanans worked hard to pay off their student loans, spent years saving for their education or chose a path other than college, and now they will be forced to foot the bill of wealthy elites’ education,” said Senator Daines. “This plan will supersize our national debt and pour fuel on the inflation fire at a time when Montanans are already facing a recession and sky-high prices on everything from gas to groceries.”A recent Penn-Wharton study estimated that “forgiving federal college student loan debt will cost between $300 billion and $980 billionover the next ten years.The Committee for Responsible Budget (CRFB) notes that “…debt cancellation gives a much higher proportion of its benefit to top earners. For example, a report from the University of Chicago showed that the top 10 percent of earners receive more from cancellation than the entire bottom 30 percent of earners.”CRFB also found that cancelling debt will not help the economy, rather it will drive prices up even more. Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Blake Kernen"

Watch his remarks HERE.Important facts to debunk the Democrats’ misinformation about their bill: It increases taxes on millions of low and middle class taxpayers. According to analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2023 alone, those earning less than $200,000 per year will see a $16.7 Billion tax increase. By 2031, nearly two-thirds of the increased tax burden under the Democrats plan will fall on those earning less than $400,000 per year.It supersize the IRS by spending over $45 BILLION to add over 80,000 new IRS agents to audit small and medium-size businesses and assert control over the lives and finances of Montanans.  It gives thousands of dollars in tax credits to RICH PEOPLE for electric vehicles. Individuals making up to $150,000 are eligible for a $7,500 check—paid for by taxpayers—to buy expensive EVs.It enacts massive taxes on local oil and gas producers, raising costs for Montanans fueling up their vehicles to get to work.   Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Blake Kernen"

I am aware that is precisely what this administration wants, however, with the recent developments with the Russia/Ukraine war, we are proving to the world we cannot survive without fossil fuels. This bill will cause energy prices to increase, as well as, the price of every commodity made with coal or petroleum. It doesn’t just stop with fossil fuels. Mining for raw materials to produce wind turbines and solar panels will also be affected. I believe this will add to inflation rather than reduce it,” said Doug Martins, Rosebud County Commissioner. Read the full letter HERE.“The Montana Chamber of Commerce joined other business advocacy organizations across the country in signing letters through the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the US Chamber of Commerce expressing concern for changes in tax policy and increased taxes on business… Additionally, the sudden emergence and rush to pass this legislation has caught all businesses and business advocacy organizations by surprise. Good legislation requires input from affected parties, thoughtful consideration, and analysis to evaluate the intended and unintended consequences. Rushing to vote on this legislation fails to provide opportunity to evaluate any deals that may have been struck and denies a full understanding of the consequences of raising taxes or significant changes to tax policy,” said Todd O’Hair, President and CEO of the Montana Chamber of Commerce. Read the full letter HERE.“We are asking you to reject this legislation as it will do nothing to lower inflation. The legislation as proposed will raise taxes on businesses, unleash IRS agents to harass small business who can neither afford the cost of higher taxes nor expensive audit related costs. These costs will end up being passed on to customers of these businesses so I ask you, “How will this lower inflation?” Small businesses like ours have seen costs increases of between 50 and 100 percent for many of the inputs we use. Further tax increases will serve as a disincentive to reinvest what meager profits we have back in to the business.

The Chinese share of global manufacturing is projected to reach 24% by 2030, which would make it the world leader. This bill will:The bill includes Daines’ “FABS Act,” “Endless Frontier Act,” and “National Science, Innovation and Technology Strategy Act.” It also includes funding for “Chips for America Act” which Senator Daines championed in the NDAA.Semiconductors are used in many everyday items including cars, televisions, phones, refrigerators, radios and computers as well as advanced technologies important for our national security. Quotes of Support:“Applied Materials applauds Senator Daines for his support of the CHIPS and Science Act.  This critical legislation will bolster chip manufacturing and innovation, create jobs and strengthen the semiconductor supply chain in Montana and the United States – all at a time when semiconductor leadership is more important than ever to the economy.” – Gary E. Dickerson, President and CEO, Applied Materials, Inc.“The Montana University System is grateful for Senator Daines’ support of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which directly benefits rural states such as Montana. Institutions like Montana State University and the University of Montana work every day to advance cutting edge research that supports vital state and national interests. This is a big win for Montana and for our state’s growing innovation economy.” – Clayton Christian, Montana Commissioner of Higher Education Background:On June 17, 2021 Daines introduced the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors (FABS) Act to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains by incentivizing domestic manufacturing of this critical technology. On June 8, 2021, Daines’ bipartisan bill to boost American innovation and combat China passed the  U.S. Senate.On April 21, 2021, Daines helped introduce a bipartisan bill, the “Endless Frontier Act,” which is the leading proposal in the U.S. Senate to promote American tech jobs and American innovation, research and development in the race against China.On December 11, 2020, Daines voted for the “National Defense Authorization Act” or the “NDAA,” which created the CHIPS for America Fund and prioritized strategic competition with China and Russia.   Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Blake Kernen"

https://www.daines.senate.gov/news/press-releases/three-major-daines-bills-one-step-closer-to-becoming-law,"U.S. SENATE – Today three bills sponsored by U.S. Senator Steve Daines passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee, including one of Daines’ top forest management priorities that would stop frivolous litigation from holding up forestry projects.Download Daines’ remarks HERE. “My bipartisan bill would put an end to a procedural loophole being abused by fringe groups in the courts to block important forest restoration work that is critical for what I like to call the 4 W’s: reducing wildfire, protecting wildlife, improving watersheds, and supporting workers,” Daines said.Daines’ bill to reverse the disastrous Cottonwood decision will help increase active forest management by finally aligning consultation requirements in Montana with the rest of the country. This bill passed committee for the first time by a vote of 16-4 and is the first time in years a major forest management bill has passed out of the ENR Committee with such bipartisan support. It is a major win for Montana that will help reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, restore Montana’s forests, and support good-paying timber jobs.After it passed, Daines said, “We must manage our forests before they manage us. My forest management bill passing out of committee is a big win for Montana and the West, and I will keep working until it becomes law.”Forest management has been a top priority of Senator Daines’ since his first day in Congress. Click here for a recap video of his efforts. “Root & Stem Act” Daines’ bipartisan “Root & Stem Act” to empower non-federal groups to collaborate and find creative solutions to improve the health of our forests passed out of committee as well. “Collaboration is key—when we work together to design, develop and implement forest management projects we create healthier environments and healthier rural economies. Glad to see this important bill move forward,” Daines said.“Sun River Hydropower Authorization Act” Daines’ bipartisan “Sun River Hydropower Authorization Act” also passed out of committee. The bill would authorize hydropower in the Bureau of Reclamation’s Sun River Project, including at the Gibson Dam.“In Montana we know the importance of an all-of-the-above energy portfolio, and that includes hydropower. This bill will tap into Montana’s hydropower potential and bring jobs and revenue to our communities,” Daines said. Statements of Support “Responsible, active forest management is crucial to the continued health of our forest systems, wildlife populations, and surrounding rural economies,” said Whit Fosburgh, president & CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “The Cottonwood fix agreement reached by Senators Daines and Manchin will allow for the Forest Service and local partners to move forward with collaborative work that reduces the risk of wildfire and improves habitat and outdoor recreation opportunities.”“We thank Senator Daines for his leadership and dogged pursuit of a workable solution to the disastrous “Cottonwood” issue. We need to return the decision making process to the “on the ground” professionals who have the local knowledge and scientific foundations to best implement good forest management. This bill will help alleviate the procedural and litigation grid lock of the past decade, which continually endangers the health and productivity of our public lands and adjoining communities.”— Paul McKenize, VP & General Manager of F.H. Stoltze Land & Lumber  “The Boone and Crockett Club sincerely appreciates the bipartisan efforts of Senator Daines and Senator Manchin for their persistence in legislatively overturning a misguided court ruling that has allowed litigants to stop locally-led, science-based forest restoration and hunter access projects time and time again. We applaud Committee approval of this most important legislation that will ensure the ability to manage our public lands to mitigate wildfire risk, improve habitat for wildlife and enhance opportunities for outdoor recreation” – Tony A. Schoonen, Chief Executive Officer, Boone and Crockett ClubIn the Intermountain West there is so much work to be done to address our forest health and wildfire crises.  The work of Senators Daines and Manchin to craft  a bipartisan solution that addresses litigious barriers to accomplishing this work is to be lauded. – Tom Schultz, VP Resources, Idaho Forest GroupFFRC Statement on Committee Action on Daines’ Cottonwood Legislation July 21, 2022: Today, the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee will consider S. 2561, legislation to prevent frivolous lawsuits from delaying critical forest management projects on public lands. FFRC Executive Director Bill Imbergamo released the following statement: “FFRC is pleased to see legislative action to address the wrongly decided Cottonwood precedent, which serial litigators have abused to needlessly delay critically important forest management projects on our National Forests. Today’s legislation doesn’t open a single new acre of land to harvest, it merely relieves the Forest Service and Fish & Wildlife Service of the burden of “consulting” on old Forest Plans, even when neither agency believes the project will harm any listed species. Unless Congress acts on this bill, radical environmental groups will continue to win pointless injunctions against needed forest management projects, like they did in New Mexico in 2019 and 2020. The delays in management there helped contribute to the fuel loads we’ve seen fueling this summer’s Hermit’s Peak Fire, which has devastated over 340,000 acres and cost more than $280 Million to suppress. We applaud the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee for moving this important bill and urge the full Senate to advance it as soon as possible.”“The National Wild Turkey Federation applauds Senator Daines’ and Manchin’s simple solution to reduce the negative impacts of legal challenges on critical forest restoration work while balancing citizens’ right to legally challenge their government. We greatly appreciate the bipartisan cooperation of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to move this much-needed legislation forward. As the largest stewardship partner of the U.S. Forest Service, too often, we’ve seen desperately needed collaborative forest management work halted by lawsuits initiated by groups opposed to forest management activities. Our national forests are in critical condition, and the costly delays caused by lawsuits are only making conditions worse for our forests, wildlife resources and local communities. In order to lessen the impacts of wildfire, create forests that are resilient to insects, diseases and climate changes, we have to manage these forests.  Management consistent with the forest plans removes hazardous fuels, thins overly dense timber stands, removes invasive species and helps replant burn-scarred landscapes and creates healthy forests.” – NWTF CEO Becky Humphries “The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation applauds Chairman Joe Manchin (WV), Senator Steve Daines (MT) and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for passage of legislation that will end frivolous lawsuits resulting from the 9th Circuit Cottonwood ruling in 2015.  Western wildlife advocates have been frustrated as habitat improvement and wildfire prevention projects have been halted by litigation, only to watch those same forests burn from catastrophic wildfires.  RMEF thanks the Committee for favorably reporting the “Cottonwood Fix” and looks forward to pushing for enactment of this critical, bipartisan measure.” – Kyle Weaver, President and CEO of Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation“The Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF) applauds the Committee passage of S. 2561, a bill to override the disastrous Cottonwood decision that is harming our nation’s fish, wildlife, and forests. CSF is proud to work with Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus Member Sen. Daines on S. 2561, and we are grateful for his commitment to secure a fix to this dire issue”,said CSF President and CEO Jeff Crane. “With wildfires increasingly devastating our country, this legislation is critical to allow habitat management projects to move forward without the Cottonwood decision looming over the heads of those tasked with managing our public lands.”Pyramid Mountain Lumber appreciates Senator Daines relentless efforts to fix the “Cottonwood” decision once and for all.  The endless delays in court and delays in process put more communities at risk from wildfires and further reduces forest health due to insect and disease infestations. We thank you for moving forward with a common sense solution that benefits all of Montana’s rural communities and our forest resources. – Gordy Sanders, Resource Manager “Today’s bipartisan vote will accelerate urgently needed forest restoration efforts, help ensure healthy ecosystems, and play a key role in addressing the wildfire crisis,” said Brian Yablonski, CEO of The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC). “Following years of research and analysis, PERC identified overturning Cottonwood as a top priority in our Fix America’s Forests report. Sen. Daines and his team have always understood the importance of the issue and thanks to their steadfast commitment, we are thrilled to see Congress advancing this critical step forward.“The Montana Chapter of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers thanks Senator Daines for his leadership in securing the bipartisan advancement of S. 2561 today from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator Daines’ legislation would fix the Cottonwood decision that has delayed and derailed the ability to complete forestry management activities including projects to enhance wildlife habitat and hunting opportunities. Both the Obama and Trump administrations previously attempted to solve this issue, now this legislation can do just that through a commonsense fix that will benefit all Montanans who enjoy our national forests.” – Kevin Farron, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers Montana Chapter Coordinator“The Mule Deer Foundation thanks Senator Daines and Senator Manchin for their work to pass S.2561 to address the challenges the “Cottonwood” ruling has caused with implementing needed forest management on our National Forests.  This commonsense legislation removes unnecessary barriers to completing projects in a timely manner and will help to end harmful and unnecessary delays in federal forest management, including those to be funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.    By passing this legislation we are one step closer to eliminating costly delays in forest management projects caused by “Cottonwood” litigation that continue to hinder critical forest management activities.” – Joel Pedersen, Mule Deer Foundation President & CEO   ### Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Blake Kernen"

Kuster said. “Dam owners and developers in New Hampshire and across the country are ready and willing to transform our nation’s water infrastructure to jump-start hydropower energy production. But, this progress is being stifled by a lengthy and inconsistent permitting review process. That’s why I am proud to support this bill to ensure that permits for hydropower dams receive a transparent and timely review so clean energy projects can get online and begin powering our nation’s grid.” Statements of support: “Adding hydropower generation to existing non-powered Army Corps dams has the potential to power more than 2 million homes with clean, renewable energy. Despite this immense potential, red tape and inconsistencies within the permitting process poses a major barrier to getting these projects over the finish line. Developing non-powered dams at federally-owned facilities will play a role in decarbonizing our nation’s grid, and this legislation will give hydropower developers the certainty they need to finance and construct these facilities. I commend Senator Daines, Senator Feinstein and Representative Kuster for their bipartisan leadership and for recognizing the critical need for hydropower.” – Malcolm Woolf, CEO and President of the National Hydropower Association “America holds the technical potential to expand the size of our hydropower fleet by 50%, but we must first improve our permitting process. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers is the largest owner of hydropower in the country, accounting for about 25 percent of the hydropower in America, and this bill makes permitting at their facilities more manageable so we can move towards increasing capacity.” – Rich Powell, ClearPath Action CEO “New, clean electricity is needed in every corner of the country right now, and even more will be needed in the near future. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns the dams that present the best opportunities to add new hydropower, enhancing infrastructure that is already paid for. Efficient, consistent, and coordinated development will speed the path to bringing reliable, round-the-clock clean energy – and economic development opportunities that rely on clean electricity – to river communities throughout the nation.” – Paul Jacob, CEO of Rye Development The bill will help the Army Corps of Engineers expedite the retrofitting of existing non-power dams for clean, renewable hydropower. It will also encourage the Army Corps of Engineers to increase power at existing hydropower dams. Read the bill text HERE.   Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Blake Kernen"

I’ll keep pushing to ensure that our law enforcement officers have the resources they need to target offenders and ensure survivors have access to critical services as they work to get back on their feet.” Daines also introduced this resolution in the 116th and 115th Congress.Quotes of Support:“The murder rate of Native women is more than ten times the national average in some tribal communities. Often, these disappearances or murders are connected to crimes of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and sex trafficking. The intersection of gender-based violence and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women is heavily intertwined. Our mothers and grandmothers took care of us with compassion and love. We must continue to raise our voices to help those missing, to stop the murders of our women, and find justice for those who did not survive. We don’t want to see any more women die, to see children watch their mothers killed, to meet our women coming home to our village in body bags. Until we reach the goals of the Not Invisible Act or Savanna’s Act we will not stop our advocacy.  We need to continue to raise awareness and a call to action.  This resolution is an example of unfinished business.” – Tami Truett Jerue, Executive Director, Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center“Whether the violence is coming from inside the home, or from strangers living near tribal communities or in urban centers, meaningful action must be taken to prevent more of our relatives from going missing or being murdered. Our relatives deserve justice. StrongHearts Native Helpline thanks Senator Daines for his work to bring awareness to the crisis of violence against Native people by introducing a resolution to designate May 5, 2022 as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls.” – Lori Jump, Director, StrongHearts Native Helpline” The MMIWBIKERUNUSA2021 team supports the families of Hanna Harris and Kaysera Stops Pretty Places, and all victims’ families of MMIW.

We are appreciative of the hard work of Senator Daines and Tribal Council Leaders and representatives and other key leaders in the legislative branch. We look forward to continued partnership and communication with Tribal Leaders, State officials, Tribal Elders and Youth to help end this unacceptable evil known as MMIW.  Our Native American women and all women are scared life givers they must be protected, honored and cherished.” – MMIWBikeRunUSA  “As the parent of a victim, I know all too well the pain that comes from the FBI’s persistent failure to investigate, and DOJ’s routine failures to prosecute. Indian Nations need to stand together and keep on fighting for what is right for our people. The MMIW crisis is real and is happening on a daily basis, local, state and federal need to be on the same page so our families don’t have to wonder why nothing is being done! The Fort Belknap Indian Community applauds Senator Daines’ efforts to shine light on continuing federal failures to protect Native American victims and families and to create real and lasting change that creates accountability and transparency and gets Indian Country law enforcement the resources we desperately need to keep our people safe and achieve justice for our missing and murdered relatives.” – President Stiffarm, Fort Belknap“On behalf of the MT MIP Task Force and the CSKT MMIP Work Group, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to both Senator Tester and Senator Daines for co-sponsoring a resolution recognizing May 5th as National Day of Awareness for MMIW.

May 5 was the birthday of Hanna Harris, a 21 year-old Northern Cheyenne woman who disappeared from her home in Lame Deer, Montana in 2013. On this day, we honor Hanna and the countless American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian women and girls who have been murdered or have gone missing, as well as the families and communities who continue to seek justice.

It would also nullify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mandate for all children two years of age and older to wear a mask, including when they are playing outside.“While Biden is still gung-ho on masking toddlers and forcing Montana teachers and workers out of a job because of his arbitrary mandates, I’m working to help get Montanans’ lives back to normal,” Daines said. “It’s past time we end all of Biden’s overreaching vaccine mandates, including those that are threating Montana families and children who depend on Head Start for childcare.”In February, Daines introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to strike down mask and COVID-19 vaccine mandates for Montana head start volunteers, students and staff. A CRA is a process for Congress to eliminate an executive branch rule that must be brought up for a vote by the full Senate and cannot be blocked by Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer. To pass, a CRA only needs a simple majority among senators voting.In December 2021, Daines sent a letter urging U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to rescind the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for Montana Head Start employees and volunteers that could force them out of their jobs and threaten access to childcare for families in need.  ###  Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Katie Schoettler"

Just as we take care of our outdoors, we must take care of the gateway communities surrounding them. I’m glad to see my bipartisan bill to support Montana’s gateway communities pass out of Committee with bipartisan support. I’ll keep working to get this bill across the finish line and signed into law,” Daines said.“Across our country, public lands provide Americans the opportunity to connect with incredible natural beauty and make memories that last a lifetime,” King said. “As parks from Maine to Montana experience record levels of visitation, Congress has a responsibility to help more people experience these treasures while preventing a crush of well-meaning outdoor enthusiasts from loving our lands to death. The Gateway Community and Recreation Enhancement Act is a critical step in this effort, creating a ‘Waze for Parks’ that would share data in real time so potential visitors can enjoy our nation’s natural beauty while avoiding crowds. I’m grateful that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee overwhelmingly saw the importance of the bipartisan bill, and hopeful that Congress can swiftly pass this legislation to support our national parks and the communities that rely on them.”During National Park Week, Daines shared a video featuring Terese Petcoff, Executive Director of the Gardiner Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Center, as she discusses the challenges facing our national parks and gateway communities.Click HERE to watch the video.

The reasons Veterans often cite are that they are better understood, respected, and cared for at their local VA Medical Center (VAMC). VA facilities often serve as the crux for elderly Veterans’ community. Time and time again, we have been told by elderly Veterans that they enjoy visiting their VAMCs. They build networks of friends and VA staff that serve as support groups and keep them connected with their service. In an increasingly digital world, we cannot discount the importance of the human interaction and connection our Veterans find at VA facilities, particularly with in-person services,” Daines wrote.“We have been disappointed and concerned by the VA’s lack of assessment of qualitative data and how its recommendations will specifically impact elderly Veterans. Receiving feedback from Congress, local VA staff, and most importantly local Veteran communities must be a crucial step in your assessment of the AIR Commission’s final recommendations. Veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. They deserve consistent, accessible, quality care when they return. That’s the promise we made to these brave men and women when they took their oath to serve, and that’s the promise we intend to keep,” the letter continues. Read Daines’ full letter to President Biden HERE.The Department of Veteran’s Affairs released its preliminary recommendations for the Asset and Infrastructure Review (AIR) Commission to consider last month. The report recommended closing the Plentywood, Glasgow and Browning clinics and the Miles City Community Living Center. It also recommended reducing service at the Billings-Majestic Health Care Center.These VA recommendations will carry considerable weight and be considered by a forthcoming AIR Commission which will then produce final recommendations for Congress and the President.Last month, Daines slammed reports of the VA quietly shuttering Montana veteran health care facilities and spoke directly with VA Secretary McDonough to share his concerns. On February 4, Daines sent a letter to the VA calling for transparency and answers on decisions impacting Montana veterans. This includes an investigation which found 1,600 potentially ineligible providers in the VA’s system, the VA consolidating Community Care offices and pending VA health care facility closures.  ###  Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Katie Schoettler"

Evidence suggests one or more of them may have lost their life through an illegal partial-birth abortion or may have been born alive and later killed.“ Last week, DC Metropolitan Police recovered the remains of five preborn children apparently from the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, DC, a facility operated by the late-term abortionist Dr. Cesare Santangelo. Instead of ensuring that the horrific deaths of these children were properly investigated, Metropolitan Police made the assumption that each child died as the result of a legal abortion. It is our understanding that the Metropolitan Police made this assumption without conducting any medical evaluations. We also understand from press reports that the D.C. medical examiner does not plan to perform autopsies on the children. This is completely unacceptable,” Daines wrote. “These five children, like all children, have inherent value and deserved better than abortion – they deserved life. But at a minimum, they deserve to have their deaths investigated to ensure that no DC or federal laws were broken. In light of this information, we demand that a thorough investigation is conducted into the death of each child. In order to accomplish such investigation, we request and fully expect the city to conduct autopsies on the children and preserve all collected evidence. Finally, at the conclusion of such examinations, we urge the city to properly and respectfully bury the babies,” the letter continues.Read Daines’ full letter to Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Chief of the DC Metropolitan Police Department Robert Contee, and US Attorney General Merrick Garland HERE. ###  Contact: Rachel Dumke,  Katie Schoettler "

Daines describes the action, which comes after years of his work on the issue, as a positive step with more action needed.  “Montana ranchers must be able to compete on a level playing field. I have long worked to address the unfair practices of the largest meat packers that are hurting Montana ranchers. While this is a welcome step forward from the Administration, we must continue to fight to ensure ranchers are treated fairly in the marketplace and that packers are held accountable. I’m calling on President Biden to ensure a full and thorough investigation into the packers and allegations of price fixing and market manipulation and to work with me to pass my bills that will strengthen Product of the USA labeling laws, increase transparency in the cattle market, and create a special antitrust USDA investigator. Montana ranchers produce the best beef in the world, they deserve to be recognized for it, and I will continue to work to ensure they can compete fairly,” Daines said.Daines is leading efforts in Congress to support Montana ranchers and has introduced or cosponsored: Background: In December 2021, Daines joined a bipartisan effort to help support Montana ranchers by calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to immediately suspend fresh beef imports from Brazil. In November 2021, Daines helped introduce the “Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act” to return fairness to the cattle marketplace.In October 2021, Daines cosponsored legislation to establish a special investigator at USDA regarding competition in cattle markets and ag more broadly.In August 2021, Daines introduced the “USA Beef Act,” to ensure only beef products from cattle born, raised and slaughtered in the United States can use the “Product of USA” label.In June 2021, Daines urged the Department of Justice and Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate allegations of price-fixing and market manipulation within the cattle market and the beef meatpacking industry and ensure antitrust laws are enforced.In March 2021, Daines cosponsored two bipartisan bills to increase transparency in the cattle market and cut red tape for Montana’s ag and livestock haulers, the “HAULS Act” and the “Mandatory Negotiated Cash Trade Bill.”  On July 22, 2020, Daines issued a statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) release of a report and update on the ongoing investigation into allegations of price-fixing and market manipulation within the cattle market and the meatpacking industry. In July 2020, Daines brought USDA Under Secretary Northey to Montana to hear directly from Montana farmers and ranchers in a roundtable discussion. On July 15, 2020, Daines sent a letter urging the USDA and the DOJ to actively coordinate and expand the scope of their efforts in the ongoing investigations into allegations of market manipulation and anti-competitive behavior by meat packers in the cattle industry.  In July 2020, Daines led a roundtable discussion with USDA Under Secretary Greg Ibach with some of Montana’s cattle industry leaders to discuss the important and ongoing investigations into meat packers and allegations of market manipulation and price fixing in the cattle markets. On May 12, 2020, Daines joined a letter in support of efforts by attorneys general across the country calling on the DOJ to move quickly in its investigation of allegations of price-fixing and market manipulation within the cattle market and the beef meatpacking industry. In April, USDA announced it was expanding its investigation into the divergence between box and live beef prices. Daines spoke directly with Secretary Perdue about this issue and the need for USDA and DOJ to investigate.On March 19th, 2020, sent a letter calling on the DOJ to investigate the ongoing allegations of price-fixing and market manipulation within the cattle market and the beef meatpacking industry. In September 2019, Daines sent a letter to the USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue urging a swift, thorough and transparent investigation into the impact of the fire that occurred at a Tyson Food beef processing plant in Holcomb, Kansas. ####Contact: Katherine McKeogh, Katie Schoettler "

The measure introduced by Daines and Senate Republicans would block Biden’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) vaccine mandate for Montana healthcare workers. “President Biden’s overreaching vaccine mandate for Montana healthcare workers threatens to cripple our hospitals and hurt our healthcare heroes who have been on the frontlines since the beginning of the pandemic. I’ve heard concerns from health providers across Montana that Biden’s vaccine mandate would further burden our healthcare system, which is already struggling with worker shortages. I will continue doing all that I can to block Biden’s vaccine mandates on behalf of Montanans,” Daines said. Daines’ effort comes after the courts issued a temporary injunction on Biden’s CMS mandate.  Daines and Senate Republicans introduced a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to strike down the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.  A CRA is a process for Congress to eliminate an executive branch rule and must be brought up for a vote by the full Senate regardless of an agreement by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats. To pass, a CRA only needs 51 votes. Daines’ effort to block Biden’s vaccine mandate on private businesses, which passed the Senate last week, was under the same CRA process. Recently, Daines shared a video from a rally in Bozeman where healthcare workers joined together to voice their opposition to Biden’s vaccine mandate, click HERE to watch. Background: Daines has been leading efforts in Congress against Biden’s vaccine mandates and while he is pro-vaccine, he is anti-mandate. On December 10, Daines led a group of his colleagues to push back against President Biden’s vaccine mandates that will impact truckers and other essential travelers trying to cross the U.S.-Canada border. On December 9, Daines is urged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to rescind the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for Montana Head Start employees and volunteers that could force them out of their jobs and threaten access to childcare for families in need.  On December 8, Daines legislative effort to rescind President Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate against private businesses passed the U.S. Senate.On November 15, Daines called on Biden to reverse the vaccine mandate for health care workers, which could cripple and even shut down some of Montana’s hospitals as nurses and other health care workers will be forced to leave their jobs. The most painful consequence will be the harm to Montana patients not able to receive care.  On November 5, Daines supported Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s lawsuit challenging President Biden’s vaccine mandate on Montana small businesses.On November 3, Daines moved to strike down Biden’s vaccine mandates under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

This is a direct result of President Joe Biden and the Democrats’ wasteful spending policies, which are hurting everyday Montanans’ quality of life. Their multitrillion dollar reckless tax and spending spree bill will only make matters much, much worse. Montana families cannot afford this,” Daines said. Montana families are paying more for almost everything from gas to groceries to heating their homes. The cost of groceries is skyrocketing including for items like, eggs, which is up 8%; bacon, which is up 21%; and apples, which is up 7.4%.

Any disruptions to the continuity of U.S.-Canada trade would likely have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond our shared border,” the Senators write.“…we fear that the imposition of vaccination mandates as a requirement to cross the land border will exacerbate the existing challenges facing our freight networks and supply chain, and could further fuel inflation and rising prices on top of what Americans are already seeing. Our nation’s truck drivers worked diligently during the pandemic to facilitate critical cross-border freight movements that helped to feed and clothe American communities. Now, implementing these policies could cost them their jobs,” the Senators continue.Daines also issued this separate statement after sending the letter: “President Biden imposing a vaccine mandate for essential American workers trying to cross the northern border for their job, while not imposing any sort of mandate for the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming across the southern border is beyond hypocritical. The President needs to stop putting illegal immigrants over American workers.”  Read the full letter HERE.  Biden’s restrictions on essential travel across the Canadian border will begin on January 22. Statements of Support: “Cross-border trade with Canada is a crucial component of our national supply chain, with thousands of truckload crossings every day that our economy depends upon. Ill-advised mandates imposed on our essential workforce threaten to impede this critical flow of freight, further disrupting key industries like auto-manufacturing at a time when supply is already extremely tight. We thank Senator Daines and his colleagues for recognizing the seriousness of this matter and working to resolve it. It’s imperative and in our mutual interest that officials on both sides of the border work to remove these costly and undue barriers to entry.” – Bob Costello, American Trucking Associations Chief Economist & Senior Vice President, International Trade Policy & Cross Border Operations. “TFI appreciates Sen. Daines’ leadership to protect America’s supply chains and farmers. As a global commodity, the fertilizer market is already beset by high energy prices, lingering delays from significant weather events, and export restrictions and sanctions from major fertilizer exporting countries. American farmers, for example, receive 80% of the potash they use from Canada. The cross-border vaccine mandate will further constrain fertilizer supply, especially in the northern states, and just before the Spring planting season.” – The Fertilizer Institute“NAMA is grateful to see members of Congress taking action on this issue and we fully support the sentiments of Senator Daines’ letter. Throughout the pandemic, critical infrastructure sectors have worked diligently to ensure that Americans have access to the goods they depend on every day. Transportation and weather challenges have already taxed the grain supply this year, and this policy will further impact the American miller’s ability to meet the consumer’s demand for everyday foods like oatmeal and bread.” – North American Millers Association President Jane DeMarchi“The members of the Motor Carriers of Montana appreciate Senator Daines’ and his staff’s efforts in understanding the impacts and helping to remove the Canadian border crossing vaccine mandate for truck drivers.” – Motor Carriers of Montana ### Contact: Katherine McKeogh, Katie Schoettler"
