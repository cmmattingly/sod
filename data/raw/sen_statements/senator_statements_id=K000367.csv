Klobuchar and Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) lead this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to address dominant online platforms’ power over news organizations. “The Senate Judiciary Committee has once again stood up to monopoly tech companies on a bipartisan basis. As the daughter of a newspaperman, I understand firsthand the vital role that a free press plays in strengthening our democracy. But local news is facing an existential crisis , with ad revenues plummeting, newspapers closing, and many rural communities becoming ‘news deserts’ without access to local reporting. To preserve strong, independent journalism, we have to make sure news organizations are able to negotiate on a level playing field with the online platforms that have come to dominate news distribution and digital advertising,” said Klobuchar. “Our bipartisan legislation ensures media outlets will be able to band together and negotiate for fair compensation from the Big Tech companies that profit from their news content, allowing journalists to continue their critical work of keeping communities informed. Now that this bill has advanced through the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get it passed by the full Senate and signed into law.”  The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which Klobuchar and Kennedy introduced alongside Representatives David Cicilline (D-RI) and Ken Buck (R-CO), would:### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/klobuchar-statement-on-judiciary-committee-passage-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-save-local-journalism"

The Election Worker Protection Act would provide states with the resources to recruit and train election workers and ensure these workers’ safety, while also instituting federal safeguards to shield election workers from intimidation and threats. The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Senator Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators.“Election workers are facing a barrage of threats from those seeking to undermine our democracy,” said Klobuchar. “We need to respond to these threats head on and make sure that election workers are able to do their jobs. This legislation would ensure that state officials and law enforcement have the tools and resources they need to protect those on the frontlines defending our democracy.” “In a recent survey, one in six election officials reported receiving threats because of their jobs on the frontlines of democracy,”said Durbin. “Donald Trump’s Big Lie not only encouraged these violent threats and the destruction of faith in our elections—it facilitated them. As we face this new, unfortunate reality, this bill is a common sense way to protect the safety of the public servants who administer our elections.”The Election Worker Protection Act has received the support of a bipartisan group of current and former election officials, including former Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, who testified before the Rules Committee last year about the threats he and his family received.“As a Philadelphia City Commissioner during the 2020 elections, my family and I received death threats simply for fulfilling my duty to certify legitimate election results,” said Schmidt. “I know that election workers across our country are facing similar harassment and intimidation on a daily basis from bad faith actors seeking to delegitimize our elections. That’s why it’s critical that Congress pass this commonsense legislation to protect election officials and safeguard our democratic processes.”A group of 15 Secretaries of State, led by Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, joined a letter supporting the Election Worker Protection Act and calling on Congress to take action to protect election workers.“Additional action is needed at the federal level to ensure that all election workers have the necessary support and protection to do their jobs. The Election Worker Protection Act makes clear that these attacks on election workers will not be tolerated,” wrote the Secretaries. “We know what tools are needed to protect election workers, and we look forward to working with Congress to advance this legislation.”The Election Worker Protection Act would: In addition to Klobuchar and Durbin, the Election Worker Protection Act is cosponsored by Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Angus King (I-ME), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Mark Warner (D-VA). The legislation is endorsed by Protect Democracy, End Citizens United / Let America Vote Action Fund, Democracy21, Issue One, Voices for Progress, Transparency International U.S., NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, and 20/20 Vision DC.As Chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee with oversight over federal elections, Klobuchar has long led championed efforts to protect the safety of election workers. Last fall, Klobuchar introduced the Freedom to Vote Act,  landmark legislation to strengthen our democracy, which included resources to recruit and train election workers as well as provisions to prevent the intimidation and harassment of election workers. All Senate Democrats cosponsored this legislation and voted to advance the bill in January. In June, she and Durbin led 20 of their colleagues in urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to notify state and local law enforcement of rising threats against election workers. Durbin also held a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing in August, that included testimony from officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on threats to election workers and the first formal update to Congress since DOJ’s announcement one year ago that it was launching a task force to address the rise in threats against election officials. Klobuchar and Senate Rules Committee Ranking Member Roy Blunt (R-MO) led successful efforts to call on the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to expand the use of federal Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funding to protect election workers and officials against threats. In April, Klobuchar and Blunt also requested an update on the EAC’s efforts to support state and local election officials with administering the 2022 midterm elections, including protecting election workers against threats. In October 2021, Klobuchar held a Rules Committee hearing on increasing threats directed at election officials and the ability of states and local governments to retain election officials and recruit workers to administer future elections.In June 2021, Klobuchar and Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) led bicameral legislation to prevent local election officials from being removed without cause while protecting the safety and security of election workers and volunteers. U.S. Representatives John Sarbanes (D-MD), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Nikema Williams (D-GA), and Colin Allred (D-TX) introduced companion legislation in the House.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/klobuchar-durbin-colleagues-introduce-comprehensive-legislation-to-address-the-rise-in-threats-targeting-election-workers"

Currently, Cubans seeking visas to the U.S. have to travel to the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana to have their applications processed. “I have long pushed to reform our relationship with Cuba, which for decades has been defined by conflicts of the past instead of looking toward the future. I’m encouraged that the Biden administration will soon expand our consular presence in Havana by restarting full immigrant visa processing services,” said Klobuchar. “This announcement will enable more Cuban nationals to legally and safely travel to our country, allowing them to fill critical workforce shortages and reunite with family living in the U.S.”Klobuchar has long worked to change U.S. foreign policy towards Cuba and has repeatedly urged senior administration officials to end the trade embargo and strengthen support for the Cuban people. In May 2021, she introduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to eliminate the legal barriers to Americans doing business in Cuba, boosting Cuban exports and allowing Cubans greater access to American goods. This legislation does not repeal portions of the law that address human rights or property claims against the Cuban government.Cuba relies on agricultural imports to feed the 11 million people who live there and the approximately 4 million tourists who visited in 2019 prior to the pandemic. The U.S. International Trade Commission found that if restrictions on trade with Cuba had been lifted, exports like wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans could increase by 166 percent within five years to a total of about $800 million.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/klobuchar-statement-on-u-s-embassy-in-havana-resuming-full-immigrant-visa-services"

The hearing featured testimony from Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan and the Assistant Attorney General of the  U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division Jonathan Kanter. “It's painfully obvious to me and to many other people that we have competition issues throughout our economy…Competition provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to start and grow new businesses, fueling economic growth. But if you look at our markets today, there are big cracks in the free market foundation,” said Klobuchar.“It's clear that there are places where we need new laws, but in many cases what we need is funding to make sure the antitrust agencies can enforce laws already in the books,” Klobuchar continued. “We want to make sure that our existing laws are being enforced, that anticompetitive mergers are stopped, that competitors aren't agreeing on prices, and that companies with market power aren't abusing it…Millions of consumers depend on [these] efforts to ensure that the economy is sufficiently vibrant to keep prices low, quality high, and innovation strong.”A transcript of Klobuchar’s full opening statement is given below. Video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Sen. Amy Klobuchar: I call this hearing to order and it’s a hearing of the Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights on the oversight of federal enforcement of the antitrust laws. Senator Lee and I have long presided over this subcommittee together. And once again, antitrust is an area of bipartisan cooperation. I know we've had hearings with the former administration, the Trump administration's head of the FTC and your former head of the DOJ Antitrust, Makan Delrahim. And I hope that our bipartisan goodwill will continue. I want to thank everyone here today. I know there's many interested parties, and we also thank the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I believe the chair will also be with us today, but Senator Grassley is here. It's painfully obvious to me and to many other people that we have competition issues throughout our economy. And what sometimes is unclear is how it impacts all Americans every single day. It is competition that is the great part of capitalism. It drives down prices for consumers. It pushes manufacturers to innovate and improve their products and forces companies to pay fair wages to compete for workers. Competition provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to start and grow new businesses, fueling economic growth. But if you look at our markets today, there are big cracks in the free market foundation. Now there's still very many areas of our economy where there is competition, but in a number of areas, we're seeing bigger businesses and fewer competitors and more dominant companies using their market power to suppress their rivals and line their own pockets.In over 75 percent of our industries, ranging from agriculture to pharmaceuticals to tech, a smaller number of large companies now control more of the business than they did 20 years ago. This is raising prices for Americans. The lack of competition is estimated to cost the median American household $5,000 per year. This is not the first time our nation has faced a competition problem. Our nation's fight for competitive markets goes back to the American colonists, who fled England seeking religious freedom, political freedom and yes, economic freedom from overbearing monopolies. It was these colonists who dumped all that tea into the Boston Harbor on December 16, 1773. They did this not only to send a message that they wouldn't support taxation without representation, but also to show that they wouldn't be forced to buy tea from a bloated monopoly like the East India Company, which could drive colonial tea market merchants out of business. Because to quote Adam Smith, the so-called godfather of our capitalist system, “the invisible hand of competitive entrepreneurship is the key to a strong economy.”  But only in his words, if we have a government that takes on the “overgrown standing of monopolists.” I'm quoting people well from the past, Senator Lee, a student of history himself. Consider this one from Senator John Sherman, a Republican from Ohio, Sherman of the Sherman Act, who famously said “if we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessaries of life.” So that's why this has always been a bipartisan issue. American prosperity stands on a foundation of open markets and fair competition. We know that government can protect the economy, consumers and entrepreneurs by making sure that we have a check on what Adam Smith called the “standing army, the overgrown army of monopolies.” Updating our antitrust laws is a bipartisan goal that we have talked about for years. We've held a number of hearings on how antitrust issues affect industry across our economy, both in the Senate and the House. We have one bill, Senator Lee's bill and I'm the lead Democrat on the bill, about making sure our state attorney generals are able to keep their venue, that is currently sitting over in the House. We have another bill, Senator Grassley and I have passed through the Senate as part of another bill, to finally update the merger fee, something he's wanted to do for a while, which would help our agencies. Senator Cotton and I have a bill. We have numerous bills on competition and especially in this area of tech for which we have not passed a competition bill since the advent of the industry. So while today we're going to be focusing on oversight of our antitrust agencies, I think it is very important for both parties to also turn the mirror back on ourselves in Congress and do more than just talk. It is time to legislate and get these bills done. We have many, many opportunities to create some common sense rules of the road to make sure that entrepreneurs and small businesses can compete on a level playing field and also to give those that appear before us today more tools to do their job in a modern economy. Of course, our country's competition problems go beyond our digital markets - just ask anyone who has ever had to choose between filling a prescription and filling their refrigerator. That's why a number of us have worked together on prescription drug market issues, including Senator Blumenthal and Cornyn. And a number of us on this subcommittee are looking at broad changes to our antitrust laws, as well. It's clear that there are places where we need new laws, but in many cases what we need, as I noted, is funding to make sure the antitrust agencies can enforce laws already in the books. I'm thinking of the case, that was actually the cases, started during the Trump administration. The FTC taking on Facebook, under your predecessor, Ms. Khan, and under your predecessor, Mr. Kanter, to take on Google. And I think about that because those are huge cases against some of the biggest companies the world has ever known. And you can’t take them on with duct tapes and band-aids, you actually have to have the resources, to have the lawyers to do it. While you are looking at all these other rampant number of mergers and other things that are going on across our country. We want to make sure that our existing laws are being enforced, that anticompetitive mergers are stopped, that competitors aren't agreeing on prices, and that companies with market powers aren't abusing it. I think there's basically bipartisan support for that, even though there may be differences on the means. That is why oversight of the antitrust agencies is a key function of this committee. Millions of consumers depend on your efforts to ensure that the economy is sufficiently vibrant to keep prices low, quality high, and innovation strong. Before I turn it over to Ranking Member Lee, my office received a statement from FTC Commissioners Wilson and Phillips which I would also like to add to the record unless anyone objects. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/video-at-judiciary-antitrust-subcommittee-hearing-klobuchar-highlights-need-for-vigorous-enforcement-of-antitrust-laws-to-boost-competition"

Kanter and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan also underscored the need for additional resources to enable their agencies to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws. “I'm concerned that Congress has held dozens of hearings on this issue related to your agencies but hasn't followed up with legislative reforms to address the gaps in antitrust law and new market challenges posed by dominant digital companies,” said Klobuchar, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. FTC Chair Khan concurred that antitrust agencies need a broader range of tools and resources to counter anticompetitive behavior and mergers. “In terms of the challenges…antitrust enforcement resources has not kept up with the size of the economy,” said Chair Khan. “It causes enormously difficult decisions for us about what types of unlawful deals we are challenging and are not challenging.”“The Department of Justice provided a full-throated letter in support of your AICOA legislation along with Senator Grassley, and we remain enthusiastic about the prospect of Congress exercising its authority to give us additional tools,” said Assistant Attorney General Kanter.In October, Klobuchar and Grassley introduced the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to set commonsense rules of the road for major digital platforms to ensure they cannot unfairly preference their own products and services. In January, the legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 16-6, making it the first major bill on technology competition to advance to the Senate floor since the dawn of the internet. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, Center for American Progress, Consumer Reports, the Consumer Federation of America, Public Knowledge, leading national security experts, leading antitrust legal scholars, small business organizations, and over 60 small and medium-sized companies and trade associations, including Spotify, Wyze, FuboTV and Quora. A transcript of Klobuchar’s full exchange with the witnesses is given below. Video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Thank you very much. We have a number of senators here. So I'll get started. As leaders of our antitrust agencies, I want to know your views on how market consolidation and market power are affecting competition. What do you see the biggest challenges right now in taking this on? I'll start with you, Mr. Kanter. Jonathan Kanter: Thank you, Senator. So, without a doubt as the economy becomes more concentrated, there's less competition. Less competition results in risks to the American public. Those risks include higher prices, lower wages, and less innovation. And it certainly can affect the marketplace of ideas and the free flow of information which is vital to the democratic process in the public discourse. In terms of the greatest challenge, there are a number of them, I think the most important is that we lack the resources, you mentioned, scotch tape and band aids. We certainly need more bandaids and more scotch tape, but I think we'd like a little krazy glue, if you can supply it. We need more resources. We have 352 fewer people today than we had in 1979. I think with those additional resources, we can bring more cases to conclusions, and bringing more cases to conclusions could help start creating precedent that will allow the law to evolve and keep pace with a modern economy. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: And as you said you bring money in, is that correct? To the Justice Department? Jonathan Kanter: We are a net contributor in so many different respects, Senator, including from our HSR fees but also in terms of penalties and other mechanisms. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Chair Khan, what's your view of the status of things in general with competition?Lina Khan: I think we've seen from a significant amount of empirical studies as well as our own lived experience that declining competition in sectors has caused major problems for the American people. Higher prices, lower wages, lower rates of new business formation, stagnant rates of innovation, as well as crippling resiliency and more fragile markets. This is something that we take very seriously. We, of course, in addition to our competition mandate, have a mandate to enforce consumer protection laws and we also see how increasing dominance and a lack of competition also enables consumer protection violations. In terms of the challenges, I mean, I would echo the AAG in terms of noting that antitrust enforcement resources has not kept up with the size of the economy. The number of people at the Federal Trade Commission today is around two thirds of what it was in the early 1980s - around 500 people fewer - and that causes significant strain. It causes enormously difficult decisions for us about what types of unlawful deals we are challenging and are not challenging. I think, especially when we had years like last year where deal volume was just phenomenally off the charts, it prompted extremely difficult choices for us and unfortunately made us realize that with the resources we have, we're going to do the best we can and fight to protect people the best we can, but fully delivering on the mandate that Congress has given us is extremely difficult. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: I'm well aware from this from just my work on antitrust in this building where the four big companies fighting the bill that Mr. Kanter referred to, on self preferencing and the like, have something like 2700, that's a minimum, lawyers and lobbyists. And we have three lawyers, two lawyers and our counsel. Here they are, they're very good. And so I know, I know that feeling. And I think that this is an outrageous situation, if we want to move forward at all.Lina Khan: And in our federal court Facebook litigation, we’re outgunned at least one to ten is what we calculated. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Mr. Kanter, you were sworn in at a time when the antitrust division had more pending grand jury investigations, that was in 2021, than at any time in history. The division also indicted 20 criminal cases since last November, more than any time since the 80s. Would you share with us your approach to criminal antitrust enforcement very quickly?Jonathan Kanter: Yes, I think there are three primary benefits, at least three, to criminal antitrust enforcement. First, practices such as price fixing and market allocation raise prices to consumers and deprive people of their hard working money. Competition to fix wages can deprive Americans the opportunity to earn a better salary. And finally, collusion, particularly with respect to the procurement, deprives taxpayers of dollars, wastes taxpayer dollars, and leads to fraud and abuse. And so, this area of criminal antitrust enforcement is absolutely critical to the work we do. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Thank you. And Miss Khan, in January 2022, that would be this year, Martin Shkreli was found liable for antitrust violations brought by the FTC and a group of seven state enforcers for interfering with the entry of a generic drug. We have good, strong feelings about generics here and the importance of competition. The court banned him for life from participating in the pharmaceutical industry, found him liable for $64.6 million in disgorgement. Do you believe this decision to hold him personally accountable sends a message to other executives about obeying the antitrust laws?Lina Khan: Absolutely. Senator, I think we've seen time and time again that when you just have fines as a remedy, certain firms can treat that as a cost of just doing business and so making sure that we're holding executives, including top level executives accountable, where appropriate, can be critical. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Okay, very good. My last question, I'm concerned that Congress has held dozens of hearings on this issue related to your agencies, but hasn't followed up with legislative reforms to address the gaps in antitrust law, new market challenges posed by dominant digital companies. I've talked often in recent months about putting the mirror on ourselves instead of just complaining about everyone else. Do you agree that as our economy changes and new threats to competition emerge, is it helpful for you if Congress gave you new tools in order to enforce that competition laws? Funding yes, but also new tools? Jonathan Kanter: The answer is absolutely yes. As you're aware, Senator, the Department of Justice provided a full-throated letter in support of your AICOA legislation along with Senator Grassley and we remain enthusiastic about the prospect of Congress exercising its authority to give us additional tools. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Thank you. I'll leave because I'm over my time. I will note, Senator Lee, that we have a famous person in our midst, Representative Buck, the ranking member on our sister committee, or brother committee, over in the House, is with us sitting somewhere in the back, I hear. There he is. We thank him for his courage and his really good work in this area, and we'd love to deliver a bicameral, bipartisan, set of legislation that we pass.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/video-at-judiciary-antitrust-subcommittee-hearing-assistant-attorney-general-kanter-reiterates-department-of-justice-support-for-klobuchar-s-bipartisan-tech-competition-legislation"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=B9417E84-15A4-4AD2-AFA2-D3326F157130,"WASHINGTON - On National Voter Registration Day, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee with oversight over federal elections, introduced two pieces of legislation to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and to know their registration status. The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is removed. These bills were included as part of the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Senator Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators.“Our democracy works best when our laws make it easier for people to vote,” said Klobuchar. “By ensuring states offer same day registration at polling locations and preventing states from unjustly purging voters from voting rolls, these bills will remove barriers that keep people from voting and make sure that every American can participate in our democracy.” The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: The Same Day Voter Registration Act is cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ed Markey (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Tom Carper (D-DE).The SAVE VOTERS Act would:The Save Voters Act is cosponsored by Senators Wyden, Markey, Merkley, Warren, Casey, Smith, Van Hollen, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Sanders, Hirono, Booker, Murphy, Kaine, Menendez, King, and Brown.Both bills are endorsed by Democracy 21, Transparency International U.S., End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, Common Cause, Public Citizen, People for the American Way, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, 20/20 Vision DC, Voices for Progress, and League of Women Voters.As Chairwoman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee with oversight over federal elections, Klobuchar has long been a national leader in the fight to strengthen access to voting. Last fall, Klobuchar introduced the Freedom to Vote Act, which would set basic national standards to make sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best for them, regardless of what zip code they live in, including by improving voting access, expanding early-in person voting and voting by mail, and modernizing election systems. All Senate Democrats cosponsored this legislation and voted to advance the bill in January. In July, she introduced the Register America to Vote Act, cosponsored by Senators Blumenthal, Wyden, Casey, Smith, Warren, Hirono, Booker, Merkley and Patrick Leahy (D-VT). This legislation would require every state to create a system to register all eligible citizens to vote when they turn 18 and ensure all eligible voters are covered by automatic registration through motor vehicle agencies. In May, she and Warren introduced legislation with Senators Smith, Wyden, Merkley, Sanders, Blumenthal, King, Booker, Feinstein, and Alex Padilla (D-CA) to provide federal resources to support states in administering elections and improve voting access in underserved communities. In March, Klobuchar successfully urged the Biden administration to prioritize funding for postage-free ballot delivery and election security in its Fiscal Year 2023 budget proposal.In 2017, Klobuchar first introduced the Register America to Vote Act to ensure that every state develops and implements a secure process to automatically register eligible citizens to vote when they turn 18. The same year, she also introduced legislation with Senators Leahy and Durbin to require states to automatically register eligible voters when they interact with certain state or federal agencies, unless the person declines. ### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/on-national-voter-registration-day-klobuchar-introduces-legislation-to-make-registering-to-vote-easier-for-all-americans"

Last month, Senator Blunt and I held a constructive hearing in the Rules Committee on the need for reform, where we heard bipartisan agreement that there are additional improvements that could strengthen the bill,” said Klobuchar. “I look forward to adopting these bipartisan changes at our upcoming Committee markup so we can continue to advance this critical legislation.” “There is bipartisan support for updating the Electoral Count Act, in both the Congress and among the American people,” said Blunt. “Many Members of the Senate and the House have had thoughtful discussions about what those reforms should encompass and I appreciate their engagement in this process. I’m hopeful this markup will move the bill forward in the same constructive, bipartisan spirit.”Last month, Klobuchar and Blunt held a Rules Committee hearing to examine the need to update the Electoral Count Act. At the hearing, the Committee heard testimony from Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Susan Collins (R-ME), the leaders of the bipartisan group that drafted the Electoral Count Reform Act, as well as a bipartisan panel of legal scholars. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/chairwoman-klobuchar-ranking-member-blunt-announce-rules-committee-markup-on-bipartisan-legislation-to-update-the-electoral-count-act"

These resources, provided through USDOT’s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program, will help rebuild eight bridges and restore two bridges along I-90. “Investments in our infrastructure serve as down payments on the long-term economic well-being of our state,” said Klobuchar. “This federal funding will reconstruct eight bridges and rehabilitate two across Austin and surrounding areas, helping reduce traffic and boosting transit connectivity. With these improved bridges, Austin residents will be able to more safely and conveniently access work, school, and more.”“Investments in infrastructure create good-paying jobs, boost local economies, and keep our communities safe and connected to schools, jobs, local businesses, and more. I-90 serves as an important national transportation route and critical connecting point for Austin, with places like the Mayo Clinic Health System, Riverland Community College, Hormel, and countless other important services, homes, and businesses just off the Interstate,” said Smith. “This is the largest competitive grant Minnesota has received from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act so far and will ensure I-90 is safe and accessible for decades to come.”This funding will also allow Austin to install connective ramps that integrate I-90 with the city, construct a network of accessible sidewalks and trails, and replace stormwater infrastructure. INFRA grants can be used by communities across the country for multimodal freight and highway projects of national or regional significance to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of freight and transit mobility. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Klobuchar and Smith supported and was signed into law last year, delivered a 50 percent increase in the amount of available funding for INFRA grants, as well as resources for improving the state’s roads, bridges, public transportation, and water infrastructure. ### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-to-strengthen-bridge-infrastructure-in-austin"

The Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act, which Klobuchar introduced in May 2021 with Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Joni Ernst (R-IA), would allow international doctors to remain in the U.S. upon completing their residency to provide essential health care for rural or underserved areas.“In rural Northwestern Minnesota, there's only one doctor for every 686 people. That is why I took on this bill…to allow for more doctors that are studying at our great medical schools throughout the country to be able to stay for their residency,” said Klobuchar. “Our bill updates and modernizes the [Conrad 30] program by allowing states to bring in more doctors and then additional incentives for doctors to continue serving in an underserved area for up to five years.”Klobuchar also emphasized that America’s outdated immigration system puts the country at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to recruiting talented doctors: “This is a problem for the U.S…not just we don't keep people here, we're losing them to other countries.”Minneapolis-based immigration attorney Sarah Peterson underscored that Klobuchar’s legislation will improve health care access in medically underserved communities. “28 percent of these international doctors who go into underserved areas stay there well past their five years,” said Peterson. “We have a shortage, it's documented, and we have the vehicle to immediately address it, which is your bill, Senator Klobuchar.Klobuchar has long led efforts to address workforce shortages. In July, she and Collins urged the Biden administration to address the current green card, visa, and work permit application backlogs. In March, Klobuchar joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging the Biden administration to quickly increase the number of available H-2B visas for seasonal workers. Following the Senators’ push, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) announced in May that a temporary rule had been finalized to authorize an additional 35,000 H-2B visas. Minnesota businesses, including the tourism and forestry sectors, rely on temporary workers during their busiest seasons. A transcript of Klobuchar’s full exchange is given below. Video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Sen. Klobuchar: Thank you very much, Chairman, and thank you very much for taking on this issue. This is something that  I appreciate Senator Tillis, Senator Cornyn, your support for a number of these immigration measures, including the Conrad 30 bill that Senator Collins and I introduced. We now have 26 bipartisan co sponsors, including Senator Ernst, Senator Rosen on this committee: the two of you, as well as Senators Durbin and Coons and Blumenthal, and I thank our witnesses. I really want to, I don't think our economy can withstand it if we don't move. My state has the lowest, as Ms. Peterson well knows, lowest unemployment rate in the country. We don't have enough workers all the way down the line and some combination. And I've been here your point Senator Cornyn, when we have been able to pass an immigration bill that would have fixed a lot of this. We got it through the Senate with bipartisan support, a comprehensive immigration bill and then unfortunately, it did not pass in the House. I've seen a bill pass in the House and not here. And I'm hoping that third time's the charm and we simply cannot wait.As pointed out by Senator Durbin, national shortage of as many as 124,000 physicians. In Minneapolis, there's one doctor for every 304 people and you know, we're the land of 10,000 lakes as well as 10,000 medical clinics, as you know, along with Mayo, so many University of Minnesota that we're so proud of, but in rural Northwestern Minnesota, there's only one doctor for every 686 people. That is why I took on Kent Conrad's bill many, many years ago to be able to allow for more doctors that are studying at our great medical clinics, medical schools throughout the country to be able to stay for their residency and the like. And I would like to expand that. The legislation reauthorizes and expands the Conrad 30 program that has brought more than 15,000 doctors to underserved areas, rural and urban in the last 15 years. Ms. Peterson by the way, thank you for graduating with degrees from the University of Minnesota working, I understand, at the law school. Where were you born in Minnesota?Ms. Peterson: Wisconsin, but lived in Minnesota my entire life.Sen. Klobuchar: Oh, did you see the Vikings and Packers game?Ms. Peterson: I did. Sen. Klobuchar: Okay. Well, you can imagine I was happy with the outcome. All right. My mom came from Wisconsin, so all is good. So could you talk about how in your experience, what role do immigrant doctors who've been trained in the U.S. play in providing essential medical care to rural and underserved communities?Ms. Peterson: Yeah, thank you, Senator Klobuchar. I mean, I think a statistic that's really telling is that 28 percent of these international doctors who go into underserved areas stay there well past their five years, as compared to 11 percent of U.S. doctors. And I think that's telling because we need to expand our programs to continue to reward and recognize international doctors who are going into these communities, like Dr. Alur, they're building lives. They are staying there long term, a doctor who came to my small town has been there for over 20 years. He's built his life there. And so we have a shortage, it's documented and we have the vehicle to immediately address it, which is your bill, Senator Klobuchar.Sen. Klobuchar: Okay. Can you talk about why reauthorizing the program would be in your words a “win-win?”Ms. Peterson: It gives states the ability to control the doctors that they can place. It also encourages and rewards physicians like Dr. Alur to work in underserved areas by helping them get over the H1-B numerical cap, which this year alone, we had over 480,000 people apply for 85,000 numbers. So it also rewards physicians on the green card side of things for going into underserved communities. And these are three very critical components to ensuring that Americans are getting the access to health care they need.Sen. Klobuchar: I note that recently, the United Kingdom introduced a health care visa program that fast tracks visas for health care workers, not just doctors, and Canada, which is very close to our borders, also offers an expedited pathway to permanent residency for doctors. I note that in Great Britain, they have a Conservative Prime Minister. They had one with Boris Johnson, they have won with Liz Truss, yet they're moving ahead on this. Could you talk about why this is a problem for the U.S. if you want to chime in, doctor, if we lose, not just we don't keep people here, we're losing them to other countries?Dr. Alur: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar for your leadership. Great question. My personal experience, I've shared my burdens here. If I was to talk to a doctor who is hoping to come here, or who's planning to stay after training, I will tell him it's fantastic to work here. My experience working with the veterans is very rewarding, very satisfying. But if they listen to my family's troubles, and if they have to talk to their family, and then say a doctor has been working here for 11 years, he has been in the country for 15 years, this is the prime of his youth when he can do a lot, should we go here? And I'll leave it to your imagination. What would their family say? As a physician, this is fantastic. As a family, the way the system is currently, how would it help? I want to extend this to say what would happen if people get green cards. I have an example of a pediatrician from my community, who finished his waiver in 2008, went on to build six practices, employ 18 providers, employ 48 employees and serve pediatrics in my community. Thank you.Sen. Klobuchar: And just to make clear, our bill updates and modernizes the program by allowing states to bring in more doctors, and then additional incentives for doctors to continue serving in an underserved area for up to five years. And I think that also would make a tremendous, tremendous difference. So I just, again, want to thank both of you, want to thank Senator Padilla and Senator Cornyn, for holding this hearing. We can't wait, whether we do a bill that's focused on parts of this. I know that Senator Rounds valiantly tried to do a bill during the, I was part of the group during the Trump administration, and we had a number of Republicans on board and then we were, in my mind, got punched by the administration, with many Republicans having been willing to support it here. This is our chance. We've got to move quickly. And thank you for bringing this, Senator Padilla, to our attention and then Ms. Peterson as well as Dr. Alur. Thank you very much.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/video-at-judiciary-committee-hearing-klobuchar-highlights-need-to-pass-bipartisan-legislation-to-address-doctor-shortages-in-rural-areas"

Klobuchar and Portman met with senior Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, to receive a firsthand account of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and brutal war on Ukraine. The senators also went to Bucha and Irpin, the sites of horrific Russian atrocities earlier this spring, as well as Hostomel Airport, where the Ukrainian people claimed an early and key victory against the Russian army.“President Zelenskyy was incredibly grateful. That was the first thing he wanted us to report back to the Senate and to the country. Incredibly grateful for all America has done to stand with Ukraine,” said Klobuchar. “We know that [Ukraine] is a country that has given its all…the people have put their lives on the line every day.” “I always think of that viral video that President Zelenskyy did…What he said that night was simply this: “we are here.” From that moment on, he and his people inspired the world,” Klobuchar continued. “So now it is our time to assure the Ukrainians…that we are here for them. That we know what they are up against and it is evil and we stand with their democracy.""Klobuchar has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. In March, Klobuchar traveled to Poland with a bipartisan group of colleagues where they met with diplomats, military leaders, American soldiers, Ukrainian refugees, and aid workers.In January, Klobuchar traveled to Ukraine with a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and reaffirm the U.S.’ strong bipartisan commitment to a sovereign Ukraine. A transcript of Klobuchar’s full remarks is given below. Video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Klobuchar: Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from the great state of Ohio, Senator Portman, to share with the Senate and the country some of the things that we learned from our recent trip to Ukraine. I want to thank Senator Portman. He comes to the floor every week, never gives up when things are good or bad to talk about what's happening in Ukraine. And President Zelenskyy was incredibly grateful. That was the first thing he wanted us to report back to the Senate and to the country. Incredibly grateful for all America has done to stand with Ukraine. We know that this is a country that has given its all. Sometimes we wonder in our own country what would we put on the line for democracy? Are we going to vote or things like that? The people in this country, they have put their lives on the line every day. Ballerinas who put on camo and go to the front line, exhausted workers at a nuclear plant trying to protect not just Ukraine but all of Europe in what is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe and supplies 20 percent of Ukrainian energy. The cellist playing beautiful melodies in the bombed out remnants of a town square, to remind people what Vladimir Putin did to the country, no matter what he did with his inhuman barbarism, that culture and love is there in Ukraine and it is not going away. Senator Portman and I visited the mass grave in Bucha and in Irpin we saw many, many apartment buildings completely blown apart from the bombs. We saw firsthand the strength of the Ukrainian people and their leaders. As Vladimir Putin has shown his true colors with the bombing and the shelling near a nuclear power plant, the people of Ukraine have shown their colors in a brilliant yellow and blue. Over the past six months since the invasion, their bravery and humanity consistently shines through. We had together traveled to Ukraine in the last group of senators that visited before the war started, with Senator Shaheen, Murphy, Blumenthal, Cramer, and Wicker, and we witnessed the incredible result of the people back then and it has only grown stronger. In our meeting with President Zelenskyy for over an hour and with Defense Minister Reznikov and the president's chief of staff, we heard time and time again the helpfulness of the HIMARs. In fact, the embassy staff told us that they went to that takeout place in Ukraine and the people who worked in the restaurant didn't even know they were with our embassy, but they knew they were American and gave them a bag of food and on the bag was written the words “thanks for the HIMARs.” That's how the people in Ukraine are focused day in and day out. We also talked about the counteroffensive and I know Senator Portman will talk in detail about what is happening and we know the fight is not over. Russia retaliated by striking infrastructure just in the last few days and Ukraine is still on the move. But if anything, this is certainly a sign that our humanitarian aid and our economic aid and military aid has been very helpful. The situation, of course, remains dangerous, especially in the Zaporizhzhya region where the nuclear power plant is located. We have a situation where the Russians have been bombing and shelling around that plant, where several times Ukrainians have lost power for the power that powers that plant. All of it is dangerous. We called for the IAEA, when we were there, they visited literally the next day, to be able to inspect that plant. They were able to have 14 inspectors, with two being allowed to stay on indefinitely. And we've called for a demilitarized zone as has our government. We also got to meet with the 101st Airborne in Poland and they again underscored our commitment to our NATO allies, the work they've been doing, including helping the Ukrainians remotely to make repairs on various missiles and various weapons and the like. It is an incredible story.Last week our administration reported that Moscow is in the process of purchasing rockets and artillery shells from North Korea. It shows how much trouble they are in. This Senate voted nearly unanimously to allow Finland and Sweden to join NATO. That must happen as quickly as possible because we want to see a united front. As Senator Portman pointed out many times on our trip, there are over 40 nations that are aiding in this effort. It is not America alone.I always think of that viral video that President Zelenskyy did. He not only knew the importance of staying in his country and not abandoning his post if the Russians invaded, if you think back to that day if he had done that, if he had left to a safer location, we would never be where we are today standing up for democracy. What he said that night was simply this: “we are here.” He said: “we are here.” From that moment on, he and his people inspired the world. So now it is our time to assure the Ukrainians, as we move forward with our next continuing resolution and supplemental with the budget, that we are here for them. That we know what they are up against and it is evil and we stand with their democracy. Again, I want to thank Senator Portman for his incredible leadership in working with our leadership, our military, but also the Ukrainian leadership. They know him well.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/video-on-senate-floor-klobuchar-voices-continued-support-for-ukraine"

Specifically, the resources will enable the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) to boost transit efficiency and upgrade its bus fleet and bus facility infrastructure on lines servicing Greater Minnesota.     “Investments in public transit help reduce traffic and make it easier for Minnesotans to get to school, work, and other destinations,” said Klobuchar. “This federal funding will make a real difference in rural communities across our state, modernizing buses and bolstering transit efficiency so Minnesotans can reliably get around. I’ll keep pushing for resources to ensure public transit is safe and accessible for all Minnesotans.”“Each day, transit systems connect Minnesotans to their jobs, schools, grocery stores and countless other opportunities – all while reducing traffic congestion and pollution,” said Smith, Chair of the Senate Transit Subcommittee. “This funding will help modernize public buses and public transit facilities in Greater Minnesota while improving air quality and helping combat climate change. I am proud of our work to help secure these grants and will continue working to support public transportation across Minnesota.”The FTA’s Buses and Bus Facilities grant program provides resources to help communities modernize bus fleets and bus facilities and support the purchase of more energy-efficient public transit vehicles. In April, Klobuchar and Smith secured $166.5 million in federal funding through the  bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to help communities across Minnesota expand transit services, modernize their fleets, and conduct necessary repairs. The law was enacted in November and makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. The legislation delivers significant investments to improve the state’s roads, bridges, public transportation, and water infrastructure. Earlier this year, Smith chaired a Housing, Transportation, and Community Development Subcommittee hearing on the bipartisan infrastructure law’s effect on smaller cities and rural areas. The hearing, which featured testimony from national and Minnesota experts, was particularly focused on how the federal government could most effectively implement the law in small and rural communities. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-to-strengthen-rural-public-transit"

Video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Klobuchar: Mr. President, I rise today to report back from a trip that Senator Portman and I took to Ukraine last week. And the number one thing I'd like to report is that President Zelenskyy personally asked us, and I know that Senator Portman addressed the Senate last night and reported this, but he personally asked us to thank the United States Senate, to thank the people of this country for the generous and unending continuing help that the Senate has given to the Ukraine in their fight for democracy. This is a country that has given it all. Sometimes we wonder in our own country, what are we going to put on the line for our democracy? Are we going to go over and vote today? How much do we care? There, the people of Ukraine are putting their lives on the line every single day. The ballerina who puts on camo and goes to the front lines, the exhausted workers at the nuclear plant trying to protect not just the country of Ukraine but surrounding countries because it is the biggest nuclear plant in all of Europe, supplying 20 percent of the electricity to the people of Ukraine. They go to work every day under incredible stress and pressure that we can't imagine, trying to keep their country safe while surrounded by 500 Russian troops. We think of a cellist playing beautiful melodies on the front steps of bombed out remnants of a town square to remind people that culture and love still exist in this country. I think of the mass grave that we visited in Bucha. In Irpin, the apartment buildings after apartment buildings burned out. But Ukraine goes on. We saw firsthand the strength of the Ukrainian people in the face of Vladimir Putin's inhumane barbarism. But just as Putin has shown his true colors, so have the people of Ukraine in brilliant blue and yellow. Over the past six months since the invasion, their bravery and humanity consistently shine through. When Senator Portman and I went to Ukraine last January as part of a group of senators, we were the last group that went in before the war started, with Senator Shaheen and Murphy and Senator Blumenthal and Senator Wicker and Senator Cramer, we witnessed the incredible resolve of the Ukrainian people. Last week we saw up close a nation defending its homeland in a way that few expected would even be possible. We had an excellent hour-long meeting with President Zelenskyy and the defense minister and the President’s chief of staff. Our country has helped them so much. We heard the story of how our employees at the embassy, we now have people located in Kyiv,  went to get takeout food from a Ukrainian restaurant. When they got the food back, they got the bag back, someone not even knowing who they were, where they were but knew they were American, had written on it: “thanks for the HIMARS.” Along with at least 42 nations from Japan to South Korea to Poland, we have stood with democracy. We have stood with Ukraine. We also discussed with President Zelenskyy the counteroffensive Ukraine is making to reclaim its territory in the Kherson region. This was one of the first cities Ukraine lost when the war began, but we’ve seen some initial signs of success. Ukrainians have also announced that they have recaptured a few villages and knocked out weapons and radar stations and a pontoon bridge the Russians built. We are working closely with the Ukrainians to tailor our security assistance to meet their immediate needs on the front lines of the conflict, something more difficult to do at the beginning. Now we have clear lines of communication with the Ukrainian leadership. Of course as I mentioned earlier, the situation on the ground remains incredibly dangerous, especially in the Zaporizhzhya region, home to the largest nuclear plant in Europe which was a central issue that we raised in our discussions with Ukrainian leadership, the plant which as I noted previously provided Ukraine with 20 percent of its power is at significant risk because of Russian shelling. Just today, Ukraine announced they may have to shut the plant down for fear of a nuclear disaster, as this skeleton crew constantly has to reconnect the lines that have been shelled to not only get the power out to Ukrainians, which Russians are trying to divert to their territories, Russian-held territories, to making sure they have the power to keep the reactor going and safe. We called on Russia to establish a demilitarized zone around the plant and to allow the team from the IAEA to inspect the plant. We were glad when the team of 14 inspectors visited the plant. Two inspectors will remain there indefinitely. This is all happening as we speak. The IAEA released its report yesterday and said, “while the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat of nuclear safety and security.” The agency which is full of nuclear safety experts from around the world noted extensive safety concerns. They urged an immediate stop to fighting onsite and in the vicinity. I continue to call for the demilitarized zone around the plant. We know that this nuclear incident wouldn't be just an incident. It would be a catastrophe. We all know this is a hard fight, but America must continue to stand with Ukraine. If Vladimir Putin had been allowed just to enter their country, take over an entire democracy, he would never have stopped there. We also held a meeting with U.S. military leaders at the 101st Airborne Division in Poland who are there to underscore our commitment to NATO allies in the defense of Europe. They affirmed the Ukrainians are making great use of the weapons they have supplied in their fight against Russia. In addition to the direct support we are providing to Ukraine, we're also seeing sanctions are working in Russia as just yesterday the administration reported, our administration, that Moscow is in the process of purchasing rockets and artillery cells from North Korea. It shows how much trouble Russia is in when they are purchasing military equipment from the country of North Korea. This type of desperate purchase says a lot about the state of Russia's supply chain.In fact, we have seen that as Russia has attacked Ukraine, its actions have been met with almost universal condemnation. It was a key factor in Finland and Sweden's decision to pursue NATO membership, a measure we here in the Senate supported on the floor with a 95-1 vote. The U.S. has provided economic, military, and humanitarian aid since the invasion. Our leadership has brought and continues to bring other nations to the table and has allowed Ukraine to continue to fight for its freedom.We remember that moments after the invasion began, when President Zelenskyy stood in Kyiv and said the simple words, “we are here, we are here,” that video went viral.

https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=254A8995-9AA8-4935-BDB5-A370380F7227,"LOS ANGELES – At a Code Conference interview with Kara Swisher, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) discussed the latest progress on her bipartisan legislation to restore competition online, her bipartisan bill to strengthen local journalism, and her recent bipartisan trip to Ukraine. Code, co-founded and hosted by Swisher, is an annual conference that convenes top business and technology leaders. Klobuchar expressed confidence about the passage of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, her bipartisan tech competition bill with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), despite technology companies’ misleading claims and advertising campaigns: “There has been an incredible amount of money that I’m up against. I’m not naive about the whole David v. Goliath thing… but I wouldn’t count us out for a minute.”Klobuchar highlighted the need to pass the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, her bipartisan bicameral legislation to address dominant online platforms’ power over news organizations: “We have to allow these news organizations to get better rates for content, and that means allowing them to band together…and negotiate…A little newspaper in Worthington, Minnesota…can’t exactly take on what those content rates are. Yet, we all want our towns to have some coverage of their city councils and high school football games.”Klobuchar also spoke about her trip to Ukraine with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) last week. The senators met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and traveled to Bucha and Irpin, the sites of horrific Russian atrocities earlier this spring. “We have kept their people fed, we have kept their economy going, and we have given them what they need to fight this war when everyone had counted them out,” said Klobuchar. “When you are there and you see the bravery of their people, you come back with a whole different perspective… because you see people that are willing to give it all.”In October, Klobuchar and Grassley introduced the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to set commonsense rules of the road for major digital platforms to ensure they cannot unfairly preference their own products and services. In January, the legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 16-6, making it the first major bill on technology competition to advance to the Senate floor since the dawn of the internet. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, Center for American Progress, Consumer Reports, the Consumer Federation of America, Public Knowledge, leading national security experts, leading antitrust legal scholars, small business organizations, and over 60 small and medium-sized companies and trade associations, including Spotify, Wyze, FuboTV and Quora. The legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Josh Hawley R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Jack Reed (D-RI).###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/icymi-at-code-conference-interview-with-kara-swisher-klobuchar-discusses-tech-competition-policy"

Many refugees wait months to receive an EAD, which prevents them from finding work to support themselves and their families. “Arriving refugees have too often faced months-long waits for an EAD. As of July, thousands of refugees who arrived in the United States in April were still waiting to receive work authorization. Some have been warned that it could take more than a year for them to receive work authorization,” the senators wrote to Ur M. Jaddou, USCIS Director. “These delays aren’t just devastating to refugees who are eager to provide for themselves and their families, they’re also a barrier to enriching their new communities with their skills and talents. This is all the more frustrating as businesses across the country continue to struggle to find the workers they need to operate.”“We appreciate the administration’s work to restore our country’s leadership in providing refuge for people in need, including by increasing the refugee admissions cap to 125,000. We also appreciate the steps that the administration has taken to extend work authorization for those renewing their permits and to streamline work-authorization processing for Afghan evacuees,” the senators continued. “As those fleeing war and violence continue to seek refuge in the United States, it is important that USCIS has the resources it needs to reduce backlogs and issue timely work authorizations so that refugees have the authorization they need to provide for their families.”Earlier this month, Klobuchar and Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chris Coons (D-DE), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) introduced the Afghan Adjustment Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation allowing Afghans with temporary status that undergo additional vetting to apply for permanent legal residency.Last September, Klobuchar and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) urged the Biden administration to prioritize resources for women refugees evacuated from Afghanistan. Additionally, Klobuchar and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) also encouraged the Biden administration to help Afghan journalists resettle and continue their important work. Klobuchar led successful efforts to sign the Liberian Immigration Refugee Fairness Act into law in 2019, allowing eligible Liberians living in the United States on temporary immigration status of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) to continue living legally in the U.S. and get on a pathway to earning U.S. citizenship. The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Director Jaddou:We are writing to inquire about steps that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is taking to address delays in employment authorization document (EAD) processing. Constituents have reported that delays in the processing of EADs have kept them from being able to work—in some cases, for as long as nine months.Over the past year, tens of thousands of refugees have fled to the United States to escape war, violence, and political turmoil. In the last year, the United States has welcomed more than 80,000 Afghans. As of July, more than 100,000 Ukrainians arrived in the United States, and more are expected to arrive in the coming months.Unfortunately, arriving refugees have too often faced months-long waits for an EAD. As of July, thousands of refugees who arrived in the United States in April were still waiting to receive work authorization. Some have been warned that it could take more than a year for them to receive work authorization.

President Zelenskyy presented them both with the Order of Merit, First Class, an honor given to individuals for personal achievement for building a sovereign state, active peacekeeping and charitable activity or achievements in economics, science, culture, military or politics. The senators also went to Bucha and Irpin, the sites of horrific Russian atrocities earlier this spring. They also visited Hostomel Airport, where the Ukrainian people claimed an early and key victory against the Russian army.Senators Klobuchar and Portman visited Ukraine with a broader Senate delegation in January, and in March they went to Poland and met with diplomatic leaders, aid workers, and refugees fleeing the fighting in Ukraine.“In the face of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked barbarism, we must continue to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for democracy. Senator Portman and I went to Ukraine and met with President Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Reznikov to discuss the status of the war and America's ongoing economic, humanitarian, and military assistance. One of the most pressing issues we discussed is the Russian capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency must be allowed to access the plant and Russia should agree to a demilitarized zone around it in order to prevent a catastrophe. “While in Ukraine we also went to Bucha and Irpin, as well as the Antonov Airport in Hostomel, the site where the Ukrainians pushed back Russian advances and ultimately saved Kyiv from Russian control. I saw firsthand the carnage that was inflicted by the Russian army. In Poland, we met with American members of the 101st Airborne Division to get updates on our troops’ coordinated efforts with our NATO Allies. “It is clear - the Ukrainian people are committed to protecting their homeland. They will not be beaten down by Putin’s evil, and the U.S. and our allies must continue to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russia,” said Senator Klobuchar.“The courage and bravery of the Ukraine people in the face of unjust Russian aggression is always encouraging from afar but even more inspiring to see it firsthand,” said Senator Portman. “Our trip to Kyiv not only offered the opportunity to witness the steadfast resolve of the people but also the leadership of President Zelenskyy and his team. Now more than ever the United States must stand with our ally Ukraine to send the message to Russia and the world that we will not stand by while sovereign countries are invaded.

The bill removes legal obstacles to news organizations’ ability to negotiate collectively and secure fair terms from gatekeeper platforms that regularly access news content without paying for its value. The legislation also allows news publishers to demand arbitration if they reach an impasse in those negotiations. The revised bill can be found HERE.“As the daughter of a newspaperman, I understand firsthand the vital role that a free press plays in strengthening our democracy. But local news is facing an existential crisis in our country, with ad revenues plummeting, newspapers closing, and many rural communities becoming ‘news deserts’ without access to local reporting. To preserve strong, independent journalism, we have to make sure news organizations are able to negotiate on a level playing field with the online platforms that have come to dominate news distribution and digital advertising,” said Klobuchar, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust and Consumer Rights. “Our bipartisan legislation ensures media outlets will be able to engage in good faith negotiations to receive fair compensation from the Big Tech companies that profit from their news content, allowing journalists to continue their critical work of keeping communities informed.”  “Local papers are the heart and soul of journalism, and they break the news that millions of Americans rely on every day,” said Kennedy, Senate Judiciary Committee member and original sponsor of the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. “However, tech giants like Facebook and Google are hammering local publications by keeping them from making a profit on Big Tech platforms—and it’s killing local journalism. This bill supports the little guy by allowing local news providers to better negotiate with tech companies for the earnings they deserve.”“Our democracy is strongest when a free and diverse press can inform citizens and hold power to account,” said Cicilline, Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. “But today, the free press is in economic freefall—especially local news—thanks to the free-riding of dominant online platforms, who seize news content to enrich their platforms but never pay for the labor and investment required to report the news. We would never expect a platform to stream movies without paying a film’s creators. But because Google and Facebook simply take news content for free and have monopolized the digital advertising market, newsrooms today are in dire economic peril—with regional and local news publishers downsizing or shuttering at alarming pace. The moment is urgent. At a time when journalism is more important than ever, the press is facing an extinction-level event. Congress must act.”“The Founders envisioned a free press informing democracy,” said Buck, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. “The Republic needs a media environment that features real information to allow voters to make informed decisions about its affairs. Allowing local news to band together to negotiate with Big Tech through the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is a reasonable step to ensure that these outlets remain available to provide fair, balanced information to the electorate.”“Across the country, local newspapers and broadcasters play a critical role in informing the public, ensuring accountability, and promoting civic engagement. Unfortunately, they lack the market power to negotiate with the dominant online platforms for ad dollars, leaving newsrooms with fewer resources to do their critical work,” said Durbin, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act will help solve this problem, allowing local newspapers and broadcasters to band together and level the playing field so we can ensure that local news remains a strong, reliable source of information for years to come.”“Today, more than half of the country has just one local newspaper or no newspaper at all,” said Nadler, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee. “The consequences are bad for everyone: fewer local news providers translates to unchecked governmental corruption, corporate misconduct, and widespread misinformation, plus a raft of other consequences for citizens, taxpayers, and our democracy. The free and diverse press needs a level playing field to do its job. This bill simply provides that level playing field, allowing news publishers to fairly negotiate with dominant online platforms. We have worked on a bipartisan and bicameral basis to strengthen and improve the bill over the past year, and I look forward to marking it up when Congress returns in September.”As revised, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would:###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/klobuchar-kennedy-cicilline-buck-durbin-nadler-release-updated-bipartisan-journalism-bill"

This builds on Klobuchar’s longstanding efforts to support veterans suffering from the effects of exposure to toxic substances, including burn pits.“We are writing to seek additional information about the outreach and structure of your comprehensive oncology care programs, specifically the Breast and Gynecological Cancers System of Excellence,” the senators wrote to Dr. Steven Lieberman, Deputy Secretary of Health at the VA. “For too long, access to oncology care for our nation’s two million female veterans has been overlooked. This problem has been particularly acute for women suffering from the after-effects of toxic exposure during their military service.”“The VA has noted that veterans are nearly 2.5 times more likely to live in rural areas, but only 11.6 percent of oncologists practice in those parts of the country. In states such as Minnesota and Arkansas, over two million residents live in underpopulated areas,” the senators continued. “We commend the VA for being proactive in its effort to care for our nation’s two million female veterans. As your partner in Congress, we hope to continue to be able to assist the development of these vital health programs. Our veterans deserve the best.”Klobuchar has long been a leading advocate for veterans and servicemembers exposed to toxic substances.Last month, two pieces of Klobuchar-led bipartisan legislation to help veterans exposed to toxic substances passed the Senate as part of the historic SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. The Toxic Exposure Training Act, which Klobuchar introduced with Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), will improve education and training for Department of Veterans Affairs health care personnel to treat illnesses related to exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. The Toxic Exposure in the American Military (TEAM) Act, which Klobuchar introduced alongside Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Jerry Moran (R-KS), will reform and improve how veterans exposed to toxic substances receive health care and benefits from the VA.In October 2021, Klobuchar and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a bipartisan letter to the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs expressing concern about how toxic burn pit exposure affects women’s health, including the potential increased risk of breast cancer. The letter encouraged the departments to work together to conduct research into the relationship between toxic exposure during deployment and breast cancer in post-9/11 servicemembers and veterans as well as make sure veterans are aware of the resources that are available to them so they can get the care they need.In January 2021, a provision based on the bipartisan Pandemic Care for Burn Pits Exposure Act led by Klobuchar and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The provision improves the care that veterans who were previously exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances receive during the coronavirus pandemic.Klobuchar has also led efforts to strengthen preventative health care services. Earlier this month, she joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of colleagues in introducing legislation to increase access to lifesaving cancer screenings.Last October, Klobuchar and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced the Preventative Care Awareness Act, bipartisan legislation to promote mammograms, screenings, and other preventative health care services.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Dr. Lieberman, We are writing to seek additional information about the outreach and structure of your comprehensive oncology care programs, specifically the Breast and Gynecological Cancers System of Excellence. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has recognized the need to provide further outreach and stability, noting that the department “must position itself to address the potential access needs for rural cancer care, ensuring that rural veterans receive the same state-of-the-art care as their urban counterparts.” For too long, access to oncology care for our nation’s two million female veterans has been overlooked. This problem has been particularly acute for women suffering from the after-effects of toxic exposure during their military service. The VA has noted that veterans are nearly 2.5 times more likely to live in rural areas, but only 11.6 percent of oncologists practice in those parts of the country. In states such as Minnesota and Arkansas, over two million residents live in underpopulated areas.In previous reports and briefings to Congress, the VA noted that a recently-established TeleOncology will help serve cancer patients across the country. This TeleOncology program received $4.5 million in grant funding and works in conjunction with the Breast and Gynecological Cancers System of Excellence and other VA cancer centers.Additionally, legislation like the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans in Combat Environments (SERVICE) Act and the Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options for Veterans (MAMMO) Act which were signed into law on June 7, 2022, directs the VA to expand mammography screening to veterans who served in locations with increased exposure to toxic substances and improve screening and early detection of breast cancer.We are encouraged that the Department has continued to transform cancer research, treatment, prevention, and outcomes for female veterans with the establishment of the Breast and Gynecological Cancers System of Excellence. As such, we request answers to the following questions: a. Similarly, how will the Breast and Gynecologic Systems of Excellence provide specific outreach to female veterans in rural areas?a. What is the percentage of oncology care that can be accomplished in-home versus care that must be conducted within a VA facility? We commend the VA for being proactive in its effort to care for our nation’s two million female veterans.

Specifically, the grant, provided through USDOT’s RAISE program, will allow the City of Plymouth to improve road safety and accessibility around a stretch of Highway 55, strengthening connectivity between Plymouth and the Twin Cities. “Investments in our infrastructure serve as down payments on the long-term economic well-being of our state,” said Klobuchar. “This federal funding will help make the roads safer and more accessible in my hometown of Plymouth, reducing traffic congestion and allowing Minnesotans to more easily get to work, school, and other destinations.” “Plymouth is one of the fastest growing cities in Minnesota, making this project a critical investment in reducing traffic, improving access to public transportation, and prioritizing pedestrian safety,” said Smith, chair of the Transit Subcommittee. “Investing in infrastructure is about more than just fixing roadways and bridges; it’s about improving people’s lives and that’s exactly what this project will do. I’m glad we’re able to be a partner at the federal level to ensure this gets done.”The resources will help construct a pedestrian and cycling route across Highway 55 in Plymouth, addressing the current safety hazards and accessibility obstacles that cause traffic delays, and enable better access to city parks, local businesses, transit stations, and the Twin Cities. RAISE grants can be used by communities across the country for a wide variety of projects with significant local or regional impact. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Klobuchar and Smith supported and was signed into law last year, delivered a 50 percent increase in the amount of available funding for the RAISE grants, as well as resources for improving the state’s roads, bridges, public transportation, and water infrastructure. ### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-for-infrastructure-improvements-in-plymouth"

This new bridge will help spur economic growth in downtown Rochester by alleviating traffic congestion, improving connectivity, and boosting safety and accessibility.  “Investments in our infrastructure serve as down payments on the long-term economic well-being of our state,” said Klobuchar. “This federal funding will enable the long-discussed construction of the 6th Street Bridge, which will strengthen downtown Rochester’s economy by helping reduce traffic and improve transit connectivity in one of our state’s fastest growing cities. With this new bridge, Rochester residents will be able to more safely and conveniently access work, school, and other destinations.” “Increasing accessibility while improving pedestrian safety is a worthwhile investment. A lot of hard work has gone into this project by city leaders and I’m glad we’re able to be a partner at the federal level,” said Smith. “This will establish a new connecting point across the Zumbro River, lessen traffic, and make it easier for people to enjoy downtown Rochester. The prioritization of bicycle and pedestrian use, enhancing safety, and creating new areas for community gatherings make this more than just an investment in infrastructure; it’s an investment in everyone who lives in the city.”These resources will allow Rochester to build a new bridge along 6th Street, two pedestrian walkways on 6th Street SW and 6th Street SE, a pedestrian trail on the Zumbro River’s west bank, and improve the walkway connection between 6th Street SE to the Zumbro River Trail.RAISE grants can be used by communities across the country for a wide variety of projects with significant local or regional impact. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Klobuchar and Smith supported and was signed into law last year, delivered a 50 percent increase in the amount of available funding for the RAISE grants, as well as resources for improving the state’s roads, bridges, public transportation, and water infrastructure. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-to-construct-6th-street-bridge-in-rochester"

From improving broadband access to supporting our veterans and fixing our supply chains, we’ve passed important bills to help address key issues. I’ve always been committed to finding common ground that will lead to real progress.”The Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy ’s Bipartisan Index measures how frequently each Member of Congress introduces legislation co-sponsored by members of the other party, or sponsors legislation first introduced from across the aisle. Other surveys have also found Klobuchar to be one of the most effective Senators. In 2019, the Center for Effective Lawmaking, a project sponsored by the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University, named Klobuchar as the single most effective Democratic Senator during the 115th Congress.Out of the 111 pieces of legislation Klobuchar has introduced this Congress, 82 have been bipartisan, including 20 that have passed the Senate.

We're hearing from them for the first time today. Anna Hansen was a grad student in Mankato when the invasion began. She wanted to get her mother out of Kharkiv,” KSTP detailed. “She reached out to Senator Amy Klobuchar's office to expedite her mother's visa and get her to the United States. And then last month, the mother and daughter were reunited. Her mom was even able to attend her daughter's graduation.”“A Ukrainian native in Minnesota was able to give her mother the very best Mother’s Day gift of all with the help of Senator Amy Klobuchar: she was able to bring her mom to Minnesota just in time for her graduation,” said KMSP.  “Separated by war but reunited just in time for Mother’s Day, a mother and daughter are back together after months apart…The story behind this reunion…shows us how Senator Amy Klobuchar helped make it possible,” WCCO highlighted. “It was Anna’s mission to get her mother out of Ukraine and then to Minnesota…Klobuchar’s office went through the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany to gain approval for Zinchenko’s visa petition…On April 28th, Valentyna arrived safely to her new home.” “Anna says she's grateful her mother was there for her graduation. The two even spotting their native flag at the [graduation] ceremony. They’re spending their first Mother’s Day together in the United States,” said KARE.“In a feel-good story just in time for Mother’s Day... a Ukrainian mother and daughter have been reunited in Minnesota,” KIMT shared. “Zinchenko hid in a cellar for nine days as [Kharkiv] faced constant bombardment. That’s when Hansen reached out to U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar's office which helped Zinchenko find safe passage to Germany, where she successfully secured an immigrant visa.” “A Ukrainian daughter and her mother are reunited in Minnesota, just in time for Mother’s Day. Anna’s mother, Valentyna Zinchenko, was living in a northeastern Ukrainian city targeted by Russian forces. With Klobuchar's help, she was able to come to Minnesota on April 28th, in time for her daughter's graduation and Mother’s Day,” KTTC featured. Last month, Hansen, a Ukrainian graduate student at Minnesota State University Mankato, reached out to Klobuchar’s office asking for assistance in expediting her mother’s pending visa petition. Her mother, Zinchenko, was living in Kharkiv, a city in northeastern Ukraine which has been targeted by Russian forces since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Klobuchar’s office reached out to the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany and successfully secured approval for Zinchenko’s visa petition. Following a 36-hour train ride from Kharkiv via Poland to Germany, Zinchenko and Hansen were reunited in Frankfurt. Hansen and Zinchenko applied for the immigrant visa together at the US Consulate in Frankfurt and Zinchenko traveled to Minnesota on April 28.Klobuchar has actively worked to help Minnesotans affected by Putin’s senseless invasion of Ukraine. In March, she helped secure the release of Tyler Jacob, a Winona native unjustly detained by Russian forces. Her office worked closely with Tyler’s family, the State Department, and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to locate Tyler and facilitate his safe return to Minnesota.In March, Klobuchar also successfully pushed the Biden administration to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Ukrainians living in the U.S. to prevent them from being forced to return to Ukraine during the ongoing conflict. Photos can be downloaded HERE.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/icymi-just-in-time-for-mother-s-day-klobuchar-helps-unite-ukrainian-mother-and-daughter-anna-hansen-and-valentyna-zinchenko"

As of Friday, the HPAI outbreak has impacted around 69 sites across Minnesota, with a flock inventory of approximately 2.8 million birds, mostly turkeys. “HPAI has been detected in 32 states across the country and has killed over 36 million birds. Although the virus poses minimal risk to human health, it has serious implications for U.S. poultry producers, rural communities, and our agricultural economy,” the senators wrote to Senate Appropriations Committee leaders. “Given the recent outbreak, the ongoing increase in confirmed HPAI cases, and the likelihood of further spread, we urge the Subcommittee to make funding for the APHIS avian health program a high priority. These funds are critical to continue HPAI response measures.”In addition to Klobuchar and Grassley, the letter was also signed by Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Bob Casey (D-PA), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Dick Durbin (D-IL). Klobuchar has long worked to provide Minnesota farmers with the resources to weather livestock diseases and economic disruptions. Last month, she, Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), and Governor Tim Walz (D-MN) received a briefing from state and federal agriculture officials on the status of the HPAI outbreak in Minnesota. In April, she urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help Minnesota farmers respond to the influenza outbreak.During the 2015 outbreak, Klobuchar led bipartisan efforts to ensure USDA had the resources necessary to fight the outbreak and compensate farmers for lost birds. In 2018, she successfully pushed to include a provision within the Farm Bill that created an animal disease and disaster response grant program to help fund projects to address risks to animal health, livestock export markets, and industry economic stability.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Chairman Baldwin and Ranking Member Hoeven:As you prepare the Fiscal Year 2023 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we request robust funding to address the ongoing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak. Since it was first confirmed in February 2022 in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana, HPAI has been detected in 32 states across the country and has killed over 36 million birds. Although the virus poses minimal risk to human health, it has serious implications for U.S. poultry producers, rural communities, and our agricultural economy.These are the first positive HPAI cases since the 2015 outbreak that killed more than 50 million birds, accounting for 12 percent of the egg laying hen population and 8 percent of the turkey inventory. The Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in partnership with state and local agencies, has responded quickly and applied the experience gained from the 2015 outbreak to better inform on-the-ground, rapid response efforts. The APHIS avian health program is responsible for avian influenza surveillance, reporting, and control efforts, as well as distributing indemnity payments to affected poultry producers. As the number of confirmed HPAI cases has increased, APHIS has ramped up its action in response, using significant resources to do so. The President’s budget request for the APHIS avian health program was $65 million for FY 2023, which reflects a small increase from the enacted level of $63 million in FY2021 and 2022. Given the recent outbreak, the ongoing increase in confirmed HPAI cases, and the likelihood of further spread, we urge the Subcommittee to make funding for the APHIS avian health program a high priority. These funds are critical to continue HPAI response measures. Thank you for your consideration of our request. ###  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/klobuchar-grassley-lead-bipartisan-push-for-funding-to-address-avian-influenza-outbreak"

I am proud of our work to pass the American Rescue Plan, which made this program possible.”Klobuchar and Smith have long worked to support local meat processing. Last month, they secured major federal funding through the Congressionally-Directed Spending (CDS) process to increase meat cutting and butchery career pathways in Central Minnesota. In December 2020, Klobuchar and Senator Jerry Moran’s bipartisan RAMP-UP Act, which Smith co-sponsored, was signed into law. This legislation provided grants to meat processors to make the improvements necessary for federal inspection, a prerequisite for being authorized to sell produce across state lines. The bill created the Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant (MPIRG), which helps small and midsized processors increase production capacity and access new market opportunities.### Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/klobuchar-smith-announce-federal-funding-to-strengthen-local-meat-processing"

The Rural Broadband Protection Act would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a more thorough vetting process to ensure that providers applying for federal funding are capable of delivering reliable broadband access to underserved, rural communities.“In 2022, we should be able to bring high-speed internet to every community in our country, regardless of their zip code,” said Klobuchar. “This bipartisan legislation will help Americans connect to work, school, health care and business opportunities by ensuring the companies that apply for federal funding to build out broadband infrastructure can get the job done. As co-chair of the Senate Broadband Caucus, I’ll keep fighting to close the digital divide and ensure families across our state can reliably access the high-speed internet they need.” “This bill is a product of many conversations I’ve had with small rural service providers and state and local officials in West Virginia,” said Capito. “The discussions I had with them made it abundantly clear the FCC needs congressional direction to ensure taxpayer money is being used properly to fund broadband deployment in rural areas. By verifying that providers can actually deliver on the promises made to bring high-speed internet to specific areas, we can maximize the influx of broadband dollars coming to West Virginia and move closer toward our goal of closing the digital divide in communities of all sizes across our state.” “Rural Americans deserve high-quality broadband access from providers capable of delivering on the promises they make in taking government funding to do so. NTCA has long advocated for proper vetting of those seeking funding, and on behalf of our small, community-based providers who have a proven track record of offering robust and reliable broadband, I thank Senator Capito for making sure that accountability is top of mind before new funding decisions are made. NTCA endorses this legislation and looks forward to continuing to work with Congress and the FCC to ensure effective use of universal service fund resources,” said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO of NTCA, The Rural Broadband Association.The legislation would:As co-chair of the Senate Broadband Caucus, Klobuchar has been a national leader in efforts to expand broadband access and bridge the digital divide. Her legislation with House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) to expand high-speed internet nationwide served as the basis for major broadband funding included in the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. In March, she and Senator John Thune (R-SD) led a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging the FCC to provide rural communities with guidance on their broadband funding status.She also secured significant federal funding as part of the government funding package to expand broadband access for rural communities in Northeast Minnesota, and led successful efforts to resolve a dispute regarding Red River Communications, helping bring high-speed Internet access to rural communities in the Red River Valley.In November, she and Thune introduced bipartisan legislation to expand rural broadband access by strengthening the funding mechanisms for the USF, which promotes universal access to broadband and other telecommunications services. Last July, she introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to expand rural broadband access by streamlining the funding process and removing barriers for broadband connectivity in hard-to-serve rural areas.In January 2021, Klobuchar and Thune led a bipartisan, bicameral of over 150 colleagues in pressing the FCC to ensure that broadband providers who received  RDOF funding were capable of delivering reliable broadband service.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/klobuchar-capito-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-strengthen-broadband-access-for-rural-communities"

The Ocean Shipping Reform Act, led by Klobuchar and Senator John Thune (R-SD), passed the Senate unanimously in March. Klobuchar emphasized the need to enact the Ocean Shipping Reform Act: “We have a winner here and we have a winner in terms of pushing the shipping industry and actually showing that the Congress speaks with one voice when it comes to shipping rates.” Buttigieg concurred, voicing his support for the swift enactment of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act: “Anything we can do to make shipping more efficient and effective is going to make a difference at a time when we're fighting inflation with everything that we've got. I want to recognize your leadership…in moving the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the sooner that it can be enacted and signed, the sooner the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) can get to work with support from my department in making good on those provisions.” The Ocean Shipping Reform Act was cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 29 senators and endorsed by more than 100 organizations, including the American Association of Port Authorities. The legislation will:Klobuchar’s full remarks are given below, available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Senator Klobuchar: Thank you, Secretary, for being here and for all your good work. You and I have discussed this bill a few times and I so appreciate your leadership on the shipping and supply chain. I think we know that we have to get this done. The past two years have highlighted significant supply chain disruptions. Price of shipping containers increased fourfold. Of course, that goes on the backs of consumers because the prices are passed down to them from manufacturers and farmers who are hurt by this. And that's why Senator Thune and I are joined together, and I want to appreciate the leadership of the Chair and the ranking member on this as well, to get our bill passed The Ocean Shipping Reform Act through the Senate, not just this committee, thanks to the chair and rankings leadership but also through the Senate floor. And now it's over in the House where there is a similar version. But I just want to get this done, as does Senator Thune, because I think the more that time ticks on, as we know anything can happen in this town, things get delayed, and we have a winner here and we have a winner in terms of pushing the shipping industry and actually showing that the Congress speaks with one voice when it comes to shipping rates. Could you talk about the urgency from your perspective of getting this done? Secretary Buttigieg: Thank you. Yes, we know we're in an urgent moment when it comes to our supply chains. Anything we can do to make shipping more efficient and effective is going to make a difference at a time when we're fighting inflation with everything that we've got. I want to recognize your leadership and that of others that you mentioned in moving the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the sooner that it can be enacted and signed, the sooner the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) can get to work with support from my department in making good on those provisions. Senator Klobuchar: Exactly. And I mean, there is some talk of putting it in another bill. I just, you know, whatever. But months and months can go by. A bill that has like 60, 70 conferees, and we actually have all of the groups that have endorsed this bill. And I really think it's time to move and work this through the House because the months go by and we don't send the message that we want to the international shipping conglomerate.The other thing I wanted to talk about was trucker shortages. You know, in addition to the congestion at our port. We've all faced a shortage of truck drivers. I think estimated the trucking industry was short a record 80,000 drivers in 2021. Could you talk about what the Department is doing on that front? Secretary Buttigieg: Yes, we view this as a major issue. We need to make sure we're acting to both recruit and to retain truck drivers. On the recruiting side, we've been working with the Department of Labor on registered apprenticeships, we've seen a huge swell of trucking companies and consortium joining that, we're working to recruit more veterans. We have the pilot for younger drivers to safely enter the workforce, and we need to do more to make sure more women thrive in trucking careers. So we have a whole body that's been set up now to work on that. And there's the retention piece. We lose about 300,000 truck drivers a year and so we need to look at everything from working conditions to compensation. Among the conditions I would mention, critically important truck parking, the sooner we can address those the sooner that we can not only bring people into the career, but have people stay and thrive in that vitally important part of our supply chains. Senator Klobuchar: Very good. Thank you for your emphasis on that. Distracted driving, I’ve long been working on that, including with Senator Hoeven. We've got, everyday eight people die and more than 1000 are injured in crashes. We've got money for it in the bipartisan infrastructure bill on that. Can you talk about the department's plans when it comes to distracted driving? Secretary Buttigieg: We made such gains as a country when it came to impaired driving, only to see the rise of distracted driving especially since the advent of the smartphone. We need to recognize this as a major source of risk and major factor in fatalities. And as we roll out our new national roadway safety strategy, attention to this will be one of the core elements of our work to save lives on our roadways. Senator Klobuchar: Okay, very good. Going a little more local, the Blatnik Bridge, which connects Minnesota and Wisconsin. In fact, the President the day after the State of the Union visited the Blatnik Bridge and earlier this year, your Department announced significant funding for a number of grant programs including Mega projects, projects that are too large or complex for traditional funding programs.How is the DOT coordinating and communicating with state departments of transportation to promote competitive grants. I appreciate the hope we've already gotten with the Congressionally initiated projects, as well as the grants you're already giving out and in my mind, a rapid pace as we all know from being home. But talk about some of these bridge projects and how important they are. Secretary Buttigieg: Thank you. We’ve made over $70 billion available. There's more where that came from in programs ranging from the bridge investment program to the award selections for programs like Mega which you cited. This is especially important for these large bridge projects that are simply bigger than what's contemplated by a lot of our competitive grant programs. We're in close touch with the state departments of transportation. I would add governors who are often enthusiastic about these major bridge projects and we're committed to making sure that there's a smooth process for those applications. ###  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/icymi-video-at-commerce-committee-hearing-secretary-buttigieg-expresses-support-for-swift-enactment-of-klobuchar-bipartisan-legislation-to-fix-supply-chains"

Wade. Highlighting the need for Congress to take action and protect women’s right to access reproductive health care, Klobuchar noted: “When one branch is…taking positions that reverse 50 years of precedent and against 80 percent of the American people, yeah, the other branch of government is supposed to step in. That's what our system of government was set to do. And not make women travel across state lines just to exercise their constitutional right to make decisions about their own healthcare.”Emphasizing the dangerous consequences of the reported Supreme Court ruling, Klobuchar continued: “If this happens…We'll have a patchwork of laws across the country. So the answer is not that. The answer is that a federal law is passed to codify Roe v. Wade into law so it is the law of the land.”Klobuchar’s full interview is given below and available for online viewing HERE.Noah: Welcome back to The Daily Show. Today, everyone is processing the shocking news that the Supreme Court is preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade. To discuss what that means and what can be done about that, we're joined now by Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is live in Washington D.C. Senator Klobuchar, thank you so much for joining us on the show.Klobuchar: Thanks, Trevor.Noah: Let's jump straight into it. Everyone was shocked, appalled, just really, you know, blown away by the possibility that this could actually be a decision. Especially because for 50 years, people have thought that this was settled law. Where do you stand now? Where does America go from here, as a sitting Senator?Klobuchar: Well, first, as a sitting Senator, let me say I am mad. I am pissed off. These justices, the nominees came before us-- of course I voted against them-- but they said, ""Oh, this is the law of the land. Oh, this is a case that has been affirmed over and over and over again."" And then what do they do when they get a chance? They're going to overturn it. And we predicted this was going to happen. But what this means right now, if this happens, over 20 states-- many of them have laws already in place-- will ban abortion. We'll have a patchwork of laws across the country. So the answer is not that. The answer is that a federal law is passed to codify Roe v. Wade into law so it is the law of the land.Noah: So, with that being said, how do you-- how do you begin to do that? Because I'm sure many Republicans out there right now are going, ""Well, that's why we voted. That's why we voted for Trump. That's why we're happy that McConnell is in power."" Because however they did it, they managed to get it done. And then I see a lot of Democrats, or people who voted for the Democrats saying, ""Well, are we going to get what we voted for?” Are the women who voted for this party going to see actions being taken or is it going to be a case of “we don't have the votes and we can't figure out how to make it happen?”Klobuchar: Well, two, people have to show where they stand and we have to have this vote. It's critical. And as you know, the vast majority of Democrats in Congress – this has already passed the House – support this bill. So that is going to happen very quickly. I agree with you. We should get rid of the filibuster. I don’t know if you know, there are over 100 exceptions to that filibuster, where, like everyone else, like the House of Representatives, like democracies across the world, we have majority votes. They have majority votes on things like the Trump tax cuts. They have majority votes on space accidents. They have majority votes on things like arms sales. And so you're going to tell me that we have to get 60 votes to change something that this right-wing Supreme Court has put in place, where in fact, they are against the wishes of nearly 80 percent of the American people? So if something's worth getting rid of the filibuster for, or making an exception to the filibuster, this is it. And by the way, if that doesn't work, you know that old line? ""Don't get mad, vote?” I say get mad and vote. We have to do both.Noah: Let's talk a little bit about strategy, then. There are two Republican Senators who have been on record as saying that they are pro-choice, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski. And they said, “Hey, we're pro-choice even though we voted for these conservative Justices.” Would this be a moment where you basically ask them to put their money where their mouth is, and say, “Well, if you said you are pro-choice, and now you see that these Justices have gone against what they said, do you think you can get them to vote with the Democrats?”Klobuchar: I can't predict what they're going to do, but I can tell you, yes, this is a moment where people have to make a decision. When you look at the history, all kinds of exceptions to that filibuster. And this is a moment where, one, we have to codify Roe v. Wade into law, especially if they have been betrayed by these Justices who they claim made one claim to them and then voted another way. And then, secondly, they've got to make their own decision. They're both independent thinkers, and so I don't rule that out. But I also look to the fall as part of this strategy. You can't just look at both things separately. As well as the fights that are going to happen in every single state legislature in the country. Because this is going to be battled out state by state by state. Because I think when these judges said -- and we always thought they wanted to go back to the 1950s -- I think what we didn't realize when they said the 50’s, it was the 1850s. And when one branch is screwing up so bad in taking positions that reverse 50 years of precedent and against 80 percent of the American people, yeah, the other branch of government is supposed to step in. That's what our system of government was set to do. And not make women get back-alley abortions and travel across state lines just to exercise their constitutional-- and I believe it's constitutional-- right to make decisions about their own healthcare. Noah: Do you worry at all... do you worry at all that the Supreme Court has lost its neutrality as an institution in America? There was a time when people said, “The Supreme Court rules on the laws that have been passed and the interpretation of those laws.” And, yet, now it feels very much like a seesaw. Is there a way you can see America fixing this, or is this just how it's going to be from now on?Klobuchar: First of all, I’ll note, I take this personally, because the Justice who was a Republican president appointed justice, that would be Justice Blackman was from Minnesota, and he is the one that maybe surprised those that had asked for him to be appointed by writing Roe v. Wade. That kind of independence is not what you're seeing with these conservative Justices. Now, you have seen it from time to time with Justice Roberts who voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act, who has taken a number of votes. And as if he’s some radical liberal. Not really. But it has gone so extreme that he has been siding with some of the liberal Justices. Sadly, if this leaked opinion and what we're hearing is true, that won't even matter if he did that because it was 5-4. So, as I look to the future, what do we need to do? Well, I think the first thing we need to do is to make sure that we're putting judges in place. And I will tell you, with the wonderful new appointment of Justice Jackson to that Supreme Court -- she will be starting soon -- that is a good beginning. And what a moment that was when she got out of the dark and musky Senate Judiciary cave that it was, and got out in that beautiful sunshine on the White House lawn. There was no Ted Cruz on that lawn. And that was her moment. But now, sadly, the Supreme Court has told us we will no longer allow women to make their decisions with their doctors, Trevor. It will be Ted Cruz that can make those decisions. But the bottom line right now is we are not going to be able to fix that Court before the fall. And I think your audience knows that right now. What we have to do is push these votes, show people where they are, show people where Democrats are and where Republicans are. And if we can't get this done because we have a tied Senate at 50-50, then we go straight to the ballot box. We march to that box. People turn out in record numbers. That is how we beat this, Trevor. That will be the last stand. Noah: Well, I know you took a window of your time to come and talk to us. I appreciate you for that, Senator. Thank you so much.Klobuchar: And you did a great job at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.Noah: Thank you very much.Klobuchar: Thank you for calling out Washington. It was amazing.

That's why this bill is so important. The Platform and Accountability and Transparency Act will make it so companies like Facebook can’t block researchers from looking into their platforms and algorithms.” This bipartisan legislation, which Klobuchar released in December with Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Rob Portman (R-OH), would require social media companies to provide vetted, independent researchers and the public with access to certain platform data.Klobuchar also underscored the need to establish new rules of the road and hold technology companies accountable: “What you see…is that the influence of these platforms is just simply unprecedented. The data shows that they make more money off of us than other industrialized nations, just simply because we don't have any rules of the road in place. And for so long, we've been hearing, ‘Trust us we've got this.’ And I think that that era of blind trust is coming to an end.”Klobuchar leads the American Innovation and Choice Online Act with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), bipartisan legislation to restore online competition by preventing technology companies from abusing their market power to harm competition, online businesses, and consumers. In February, the legislation was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 16-6 vote, making it the first major bill on technology competition to advance to the Senate floor since the dawn of the Internet.The American Innovation and Choice Online Act also earned the endorsement of the Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, and over 35 technology companies.A transcript of Klobuchar’s full opening statement is available below. Video is available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Thank you so much to both of you. And thank you, Senator Coons for your leadership on this bill. Senator Portman, thank you, Senator Sasse for that great description. I had one mom tell me that it's like she keeps trying to get control of what her kids are seeing. But it's like water that's coming out of a faucet that won't stop and it's overflowing and she's just standing out there with a mop trying to do it and she can't. And so, I think so much of this has to do with the magnification, the amplification, of what you have called this kind of polarized speech – I don’t want to get your words wrong, what you just said – political weirdos, yes. Okay, there you go.And I think what you see with that is that the influence of these platforms is just simply unprecedented. And even though these platforms are seemingly free, they're really not because you're seeing advertising and they're making money off of you, and then they use the information they have and then make more money off of you. And in fact, the number of - even looking at the data shows that they make more money off of us than other industrialized nations, just simply because we don't have any rules of the road in place. And for so long, we've been hearing, “Trust us we've got this.” And I think that that era of blind trust is coming to an end. And that's why you see the work that's going on on the competition side. I'm also on the Commerce Committee. That's why you see the work that's going on with updating some of the kids laws. And that's why you're seeing the work that's going on privacy, and then of course on algorithms and getting more transparency. You know, we all know that you can't yell fire in a crowded theater. That is not considered free speech. That's not considered okay. And the way I think about it is if you're in a theater, okay, someone yells fire, that’s not your fault, but you better have exits so people can get out of there. But if you had speakers and you amplify that guy yelling fire in all of your multiplex theaters deliberately, that would be a problem if you thought somehow you’d make more money. And that is kind of what we're talking about here with algorithms.This hearing is also about how quickly misinformation and disinformation can spread online. A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate identified a dozen specific content producers as the original sources of an estimated 65 percent of Coronavirus disinformation online.We are literally – people die when this stuff is not corrected. We need transparency because these tools can hurt millions of people. That's why this bill is so important. The Platform and Accountability and Transparency Act, it will make it so companies like Facebook can’t block researchers from looking into their platforms and algorithms. And I note that President Obama touted the importance of this legislation in his recent speech at Stanford. And I am committed, and I know Senator Coons is, to see this through. And so I want to thank all of you. I look forward to reading your testimony and I know my staff will be here as well. So thanks for coming before us today. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/video-at-judiciary-subcommittee-hearing-klobuchar-emphasizes-need-for-increased-algorithm-transparency"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=5BADFCE9-4769-4351-ABB6-DCBB74F20AEA," Klobuchar secures Coast Guard Commandant nominee’s commitment to prioritize acquiring a second icebreaker for Great Lakes portsWATCH KLOBUCHAR FULL REMARKS HERE WASHINGTON – At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to consider the nomination of Admiral Linda Fagan to be U.S. Coast Guard Commandant, U.S Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) highlighted the critical role of Coast Guard cutters and icebreakers in Duluth. Klobuchar underscored how cutters and icebreakers help boost the regional economy by making it easier for ships at the Port of Duluth to “transport goods to the rest of the world and bring [products] in the Upper Midwest.” Admiral Fagan committed that the Coast Guard would prioritize acquiring a second icebreaker to “ensure access to the critical ports in the Great Lakes, particularly during the winter, challenging winter months.”Klobuchar also highlighted how port congestion and shipping backlogs have slowed supply chains and posed a challenge to Coast Guard operations, pointing to her bipartisan legislation to fix supply chains and ease shipping backlogs. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which Klobuchar introduced with Senator John Thune (R-SD), passed the Senate unanimously last month. Klobuchar has long worked to secure critical resources for the Port of Duluth. Last week, Klobuchar visited the Port to celebrate the arrival of the new Coast Guard cutter SPAR. In February, she announced significant federal funding to help increase capacity and enable necessary repairs at the Port. In 2020, Klobuchar joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to urge the Trump administration to include adequate funding for the Coast Guard to acquire a second Great Lakes icebreaker. Klobuchar’s full exchange is available below, for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Klobuchar: Thank you very much, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wicker for holding this important hearing and I'm very excited by your nomination, Admiral. We spoke yesterday and we talked about the fact that my state includes the Port of Duluth. I was just actually there, as I mentioned, last week at the Duluth Coast Guard station at the Port of Duluth with Lieutenant Commander Joel Wright, and we are very excited about the new cutter SPAR, which is, as you know, named after the US Coast Guard Women's Reserve that was so active in World War Two. But a big part of our world up there, and we've got more than 35 million tons of cargo moving through the Port of Duluth each year. When it comes to the Great Lakes, actually, that port is the largest port by tonnage and one of the nation's top 20 ports, so we always find a way to be number one, and that is tonnage. So in your testimony and in our discussions, you mentioned your commitment to our nation's icebreaking fleet and the work in keeping the Great Lakes ports open and safe. Do you have the necessary resources and could you talk about the importance of these ice cutters for transporting goods to the rest of the world and bringing things in, in the upper Midwest?Admiral Fagan: Thank you, Senator. I am committed to fielding the icebreaking capacity that we need as a nation, particularly as it pertains to the Great Lakes and the waterway inland waterways system. Our priority is an icebreaker that is at least as capable as the current Mackinaw and we are working the requirements document for that investment and look forward to working with the committee to ensure that we're on a timeline to begin the acquisition of a cutter to ensure access to the critical ports in the Great Lakes, particularly during the winter, challenging winter months. That icebreaker is part of the system and again just look forward to having that conversation with the committee and we're committed as a priority to a heavy icebreaker in the Great Lakes. Klobuchar: Okay, just with the supply chain issues, Senator Thune and I've just passed a bill out of the Senate on this. Not going to focus on that right now. But what are some of your big challenges the Coast Guard is facing when trying to manage shipping vessels. There's been congestion, as we know at some of the ports and what more should Congress be doing.Admiral Fagan: Thank you. We're all familiar with the congestion particularly congestion that was experienced along the ports on the West Coast and the Coast Guard you know, in our roles as Captain of the Port, to ensure that the safety and security of our waterways has been working with the port community to reduce that congestion by getting earlier notice of ships’ departures. So that time can be adjusted and they arrived just in time for their berth and not needing to queue for extended periods of time. We've got a great set of authorities, a great set of port partners around the country, and are committed to ensuring the reliable safety operation of our American maritime transportation system.Klobuchar: As part of our, turning to the international broader efforts to help the country of Ukraine defend their democracy against an unprovoked attack by Russia. The President recently banned Russian flag ships from coming to U.S. ports. Can you talk about how under your leadership the Coast Guard will enforce this mandate?Admiral Fagan: We are actively engaged in monitoring that mandate. We're working with the interagency and we’re aware of the ban on Russian flag vessels and should they want to attempt to enter, we would use our authorities, Captain of the Port authorities, to deny entry to Russian Russian vessels. I'm confident that the system is in place to ensure we are able to not allow Russian flag ships to enter the US, and enjoy a great interagency partnership on that.Klobuchar: Thank you. Yesterday we talked about, one last question here on Canada. I co-chair, with Senator Crapo, the US-Canada Inter-Parliamentary Group, worked a lot on Canada, care a lot about it. In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch. Could you talk about the efforts of the Coast Guard to coordinate with our friendly neighbor to the north.Admiral Fagan: We enjoy an incredible relationship with our Canadian counterparts. There's Canadian Coast Guard, Transport Canada, or other other Canadian officials. We've got a great, great partnership in the Great Lakes as it pertains to the St. Lawrence Seaway Pacific Northwest. We could not have better partners with Canada and we the Coast Guard look for every opportunity to strengthen that partnership and work alongside our Canadian counterparts.Klobuchar: All right, well, thank you very much, Admiral, and look forward to supporting you. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/icymi-video-at-commerce-committee-hearing-klobuchar-highlights-critical-role-of-coast-guard-cutters-and-icebreakers-in-duluth"

The duo both grew up in Minneapolis, and met in 1973 at a University of Minnesota summer program. “Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are music pioneers and Minnesota legends who helped define the Minneapolis sound in the 1980s,” said Klobuchar. “Making iconic records and winning awards would have been enough to secure their place in the history books. But they have done so much more than that, giving back through philanthropy and advocacy, supporting music education, and rallying others in the music industry to enact change. Jimmy and Terry have shown us again and again the power of music to serve others.”Klobuchar was also recognized for her efforts to support the music industry and independent performance venues through pandemic hardships by securing over $16 billion in emergency grant funding.Klobuchar’s bipartisan Save Our Stages Act, which was co-led by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) was enacted into law in December 2020. The legislation created the Shuttered Venues Operating Grant program to help independent performance venues, museums, and theaters survive the pandemic and continue paying their employees. Additional funding for the Shuttered Venues Operating grant program was passed as part of the American Rescue Plan that was signed by President Biden in March 2021. The bipartisan legislation gained more than 50 cosponsors in the Senate, and the House version of Save our Stages, led by Representatives Peter Welch (D-VT) and Roger Williams (R-TX), gained over 170 cosponsors. Since its enactment, the Save Our Stages Act has helped over 250 Minnesota venues and organizations, including First Avenue.Klobuchar’s full remarks are available for TV download HERE, and for online viewing HERE.###  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/at-grammys-on-the-hill-klobuchar-presents-award-to-legendary-minnesota-producers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis"

Why? Because Big Pharma got a provision written into law that Medicare cannot negotiate less expensive drug prices for the seniors of this country,” said Klobuchar. “It is time to take this on and do something for the American people.” Klobuchar urged the passage of her bicameral legislation with Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) to allow Medicare to negotiate affordable drug prices for seniors. She also called for other steps to lower prescription drug costs, including ending outrageous price hikes, limiting out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and capping insulin copays at $35 per month.Klobuchar was joined by AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins; cancer patient and founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs Now David Mitchell; Doctors for America representative Rita Kuwahara, MD, MIH; National Multiple Sclerosis Society Executive Vice President of Advocacy and Healthcare Access Bari Talente; SEIU International Executive Vice President Valarie Long; Purchaser Business Group on Health (PBGH) Executive Director for National Health Policy Bill Kramer; fibromyalgia patient Meg Jackson-Drage from Magna, UT; and ankylosing spondylitis patient Jacqueline Garibay from Austin, TX. Klobuchar has long been a leader in the fight to lower prescription drug and medication prices. Last month, Klobuchar led a group of bicameral colleagues in calling out drug manufacturers for rapid and widespread price hikes on prescription drugs. In March, Klobuchar joined 18 of her colleagues to introduce the Affordable Insulin Now Act, legislation that caps out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month.In February, Klobuchar and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Cutting Medicare Prescription Drug Prices in Half Act, which would allow Medicare to pay the same prices for prescription drugs as the Veterans’ Administration (VA). The prices the VA pays for prescription drugs are roughly half the amount of prices paid by Medicare Part D for the same products.Klobuchar’s full remarks are given below, available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE. Senator Klobuchar: Thank you so much David. Thank you everyone. This is a lot warmer than Minnesota, I’ve got to say. I’m happy to be back and I'm especially honored to be with my friend [Senator] Catherine Cortez Masto, former Attorney General of Nevada. She has an understanding of what this really means to people in their everyday lives. I also want to thank JoAnn Jenkins who’s been tireless, maybe some of you have seen her on TV ads. She has not given up. And AARP, such a powerful organization, stands with us. We’re here to say this is it. This is game day. And I'm not just saying that because the Timberwolves are playing tonight. I'm saying that, for those of you that aren’t watching the NBA playoffs, we’re proud of our team, but I'm saying this because this is it. The next two months, we’ve got to get this done. And we were so close a few months ago. And so I am not going to be able to stay the entire time, but for those of you who are in the nitty-gritty of what's happening with the Senate procedures, yes. This is on the table big time. And as you know, we were very close to an agreement on the provisions between the House and the Senate for negotiations. So while we are undergoing bipartisan negotiations on the insulin issue and the insulin cap, right now, right now, and this is why Catherine and I are out here today on this beautiful spring day, we are working to get done the Medicare negotiation [of drug prices bill]. Why? The results are clear. Prescription drug prices in the U.S. are more than 250 percent than those in other industrialized nations. We have the highest cost in prices for drugs in the world. In the past 5 years, the cost of Lyrica, that’s nerve pain drugs, you know what it is, and Symbicort, a common asthma medication, those have increased almost 50 percent. The results are dire. Nearly 40 percent of patients did not take their drugs as prescribed due to high costs. And 20 percent of patients took on debt to pay their medications. Why? Well, years ago, Big Pharma got a provision written into law, let me make that clear, this isn’t some court case, it’s written into law that Medicare cannot negotiate less expensive drug prices for the seniors of this country. They’re banned, it's a ban for negotiations. While the VA can negotiate and get much better prices, and [while] we’re so happy they do that for the veterans, [it’s] not for the over 40 million seniors in the United States of America. Why? Well Big Pharma thinks they own Washington, but they don’t own me and they don't own JoAnn Jenkins and they don’t own AARP and they don’t own you. And this is the moment to make it clear. I am glad that we have been engaged in negotiations with our colleagues. I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues–more than disappointed–are not joining us on this very straightforward pro-consumer, pro-people provision. And yet, we were so close to getting it done just a few months ago in that archaic process called reconciliation, that no, I'm not going to get into right now. And we are close to doing it again. We must get this done.I don't know how else you'd help people like Claire from St. Paul. The cost of the prescription drug she relied on to manage her rheumatoid arthritis jumped from $60 per month to $1400 per month. After trying unsuccessful alternative medications, Claire began trying to self-medicate with the over-the-counter options. As a result her arthritis got so bad that she couldn’t even hold a fork. Or the other people I've met, seniors in Minnesota that literally take their insulin and they save it, the little drops of it, from day to day to day. A common drug that used to just cost a couple bucks, but in the hands of pharmaceutical companies that are trying to make a whole bunch of money on the backs of the seniors of this country, it skyrocketed up. Again the solutions: pass my bill and make some version of it part of reconciliation to unleash the power of 46 million seniors so they can negotiate for better prices. Number two: end the outrageous and unpredictable medication prices. Number three: limit the out-of-pocket cost for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. And number four: cap the insulin copays at $35 per month. A bill that my friend Senator Warnock has introduced and something that is currently in negotiation with the Republicans. That’s how you stand up to the lobbyists in every corner of that building. There are literally more than two lobbyists per member of Congress when it comes to pharmaceuticals. It is time to take this on and do something for the people of America. Running ads on it, talking about it all the time, okay fine. But at some point you have to get it done. And I call on my colleagues to do that. Thank you very much.               ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-over-70-affordable-health-care-groups-highlight-urgent-need-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices"

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Klobuchar recently fought to confirm Andy Luger to be U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. Luger, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote of 60-36 on March 24, 2022, has committed to counter increases in carjackings and other violent crimes.Klobuchar was joined by St. Paul Chief of Police Todd Axtell; Bloomington Chief of Police Booker Hodges; Minneapolis Police Department Special Crimes Investigation Division Commander Giovanni Veliz; Richfield Chief of Police Jay Henthorne; Moorhead Chief of Police Shannon Monroe; and Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association Executive Director Jeff Potts.Recently, Klobuchar urged the U.S. Department of Justice  to prioritize resources for state and local law enforcement to address increases in carjackings. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month, Klobuchar emphasized the need to address recent increases in carjackings. She also highlighted the importance of passing her bipartisan COPS Reauthorization Act, which would provide grants for local law enforcement to hire and train new officers.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-holds-roundtable-with-law-enforcement-leaders-highlighting-efforts-to-combat-violent-carjackings"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=7F33D7D6-11E5-4D42-B7B2-1F7DBC9B8CEF,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) issued the statement below following the Biden administration’s announcement that it will expand disability and health benefits to veterans suffering from nine rare respiratory cancers due to potential exposure to toxic substances:“When we ask people to defend our nation, we make a promise to be there for them when they return home. That is why I have fought for years to ensure our veterans and servicemembers who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, receive the care and benefits they need. Today the Biden administration announced that it will expand eligibility for disability and health benefits. This important action builds on my bipartisan bill with Senator Thom Tillis to improve treatment for individuals exposed to burn pits, which became law in September 2018 as the first major federal action on this issue. I am glad to see this progress in getting our veterans and servicemembers the care they’ve earned, and I will continue to work to move additional efforts forward.”Klobuchar has been a leader in advocating for veterans and servicemembers exposed to toxic substances.In February, Klobuchar’s legislation with Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) to provide health care personnel with improved education and training to identify, treat, and assess the impact of illnesses related to exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances passed the Senate as part of the Health Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act. This legislation also requires the Veterans Benefits Administration’s Compensation Service to establish and mandate an ongoing national training program to help prevent veterans from wrongly being denied disability claims related to burn pits.In October 2021, Klobuchar and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a bipartisan letter to the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs expressing concern about how toxic burn pit exposure affects women’s health, including the potential increased risk of breast cancer. The letter encouraged the departments to work together to conduct research into the relationship between toxic exposure during deployment and breast cancer in post-9/11 servicemembers and veterans as well as make sure veterans are aware of the resources that are available to them so they can get the care they need.In March of 2021, alongside Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Klobuchar reintroduced the Toxic Exposure in the American Military (TEAM) Act, bipartisan legislation that would reform and improve how veterans exposed to toxic substances receive health care and benefits from the VA.In January 2021, a provision based on the bipartisan Pandemic Care for Burn Pits Exposure Act led by Klobuchar and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The provision improves the care that veterans who were previously exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances receive during the coronavirus pandemic. It will require medical professionals to ask whether veterans who test positive for a virus designated by the federal government as a pandemic if they were previously exposed to burn pits, which will help ensure that they receive proper care and attention to their medical needs.In December 2019, Klobuchar’s bipartisan Burn Pits Accountability Act with Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Burn Pits Accountability Act requires members of the Armed Forces to be evaluated for exposure to toxic airborne chemicals during routine health exams and directs the Secretary of Defense to record and share whether servicemembers were based or stationed near an open burn pit, and they must include any information recorded as part of the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, the Periodic Health Assessment (PHAs), Separation History and Physical Examination (SHPEs), and Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHAs). Members will also be enrolled in the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry if they were exposed to toxic airborne chemicals, unless they choose to opt out. In September 2018, provisions based on the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act led by Klobuchar and Tillis were signed into law as part of the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. These provisions – the first legislative actions taken to address this issue – created the Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence within the VA, which is focused on researching the health effects associated with burn pits and treating veterans who become sick after exposure.# # #  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-statement-on-expansion-of-benefits-and-treatment-for-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits"

My deepest condolences are with the Duluth community as we mourn Sean, Riana, Shiway, and Sadie Barry – four lives taken much too soon. The Barrys left a special mark on Duluth. Raina was a social worker, known for her gentle, kind manner, and Sean was a wonderful neighbor who would extend a helping hand without being asked.

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Klobuchar shepherded Luger’s nomination through the committee and led the confirmation efforts on the Senate floor, where he was confirmed with bipartisan support last month. “In Minnesota, we need a U.S. Attorney who pursues justice without fear or favor to keep our families safe. Andy Luger has proven he can do just that, which is why I fought to get his nomination through the Senate with bipartisan support. As U.S. Attorney, Andy earned the respect of the law enforcement community and built partnerships across our state with federal, state, and tribal law enforcement and community organizations. I am confident that those relationships will serve him well as he steps into this role once again. He will bring key leadership to the U.S. Attorney’s office at a critical time to make our communities safer,” said Klobuchar.In February 2021, Klobuchar and Smith announced the formation of a selection committee of distinguished Minnesotans to assist in making recommendations to the President for candidates to serve in federal law enforcement positions in Minnesota. The Committee was chaired by John Choi, Ramsey County Attorney. Luger, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for Minnesota from 2014 to 2017, was one of the candidates sent to President Biden by Senators Klobuchar and Smith following the recommendations from the selection committee. The U.S. Attorney is the chief federal law enforcement official in the state, responsible for the prosecution of criminal cases brought by the federal government as well as the prosecution and defense of civil cases involving the federal government. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-delivers-remarks-at-ceremonial-swearing-in-of-u-s-attorney-andy-luger"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=ED821EF7-BF09-4E8A-9666-1FC2EEB32181," Expanding Naloxone availability will help increase access, lower costs of medication, and save livesWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) joined a bicameral, bipartisan group of colleagues in urging seven major drug manufacturers to expand the availability of Naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication. Making Naloxone available over the counter is expected to increase access to this life-saving medication, lower the cost of medication, and help save lives. A peer-reviewed study found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent. The number of opioid deaths in Minnesota from April 2020 to April 2021 rose by 39 percent compared to the previous year. Despite the effectiveness of naloxone in reversing active opioid overdoses and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) public support for making the product available over-the-counter, the medication is not currently available over-the-counter because drug manufacturers have resisted applying. “It has never been more important to adopt opioid overdose prevention and reversal strategies on a wide scale. This includes steps to increase access to affordable naloxone, which is a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses, and deaths,” the lawmakers wrote to the CEOs of Pfizer, Emergent Biosolutions, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Hikma, Akorn, Adamis Pharmaceuticals, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals. “With the support of naloxone manufacturers, we can significantly increase access to the medication and help mitigate the worsening crisis of drug overdose deaths.”“One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay,” the lawmakers continued. “Creating additional OTC naloxone options will help to reduce prices for those who need it, as well as for first responders and other good Samaritans, and increase the supply in at-risk communities.”Klobuchar has long led efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. In December 2020, she introduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to increase funding and expand access to treatment and prevention services. That same month, she also secured significant federal funding to help Minnesotans recovering from addiction access job training and support services.In 2018, three of Klobuchar’s bipartisan bills to combat the opioid epidemic were signed into law as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. Klobuchar’s bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery (CARA) Act was enacted in July 2016. This law encourages states and local communities to pursue a full array of proven strategies in the fight against addiction, including Klobuchar’s provision to combat drug abuse by enhancing prescription drug monitoring programs.The letters were also signed by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Angus King (I-ME),  Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV),  Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Mark Desaulnier (D-CA), Peter Meijer (R-MI), Katie Porter (D-CA), Mariannette J.

We ask that you act quickly given the scale of need at this moment. Lives are at stake.The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid and substance use disorder epidemic in this country, with reported overdoses and deaths spiking to historic levels. In fact, alarming data show that last year, the United States experienced a record 100,306 overdose deaths. These trends show no signs of abating as overdose deaths continue to rise.Given the scale of need at this moment, it has never been more important to adopt opioid overdose prevention and reversal strategies on a wide scale. This includes steps to increase access to affordable naloxone, which is a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses, and deaths. A study conducted in Massachusetts found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent. With the support of naloxone manufacturers, we can significantly increase access to the medication and help mitigate the worsening crisis of drug overdose deaths.One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay. While many states have standing orders and workarounds that allow individuals to acquire naloxone without a prescription, regulatory hurdles continue to create unnecessary barriers. Further, a formal switch to OTC status will help reduce stigma and encourage the widespread use of this critical medication during emergencies. Additionally, market prices for naloxone remain prohibitively high, putting additional financial strain on community organizations working to reduce overdoses. Creating additional OTC naloxone options will help to reduce prices for those who need it, as well as for first responders and other good Samaritans, and increase the supply in at-risk communities.The FDA strongly supports this change and has proactively created, tested, and validated the key labeling information and data needed to approve an OTC version of naloxone. As part of this effort to expedite the application process, the FDA has provided model OTC labels and usage instructions for the nasal spray and auto-injector versions of naloxone. Now the responsibility lies with manufacturers to submit the paperwork needed to make this switch. By doing so, [company name] will be taking an important step in the ongoing effort to prevent deadly opioid overdoses.We strongly urge you to support the widespread access to naloxone, and request that you quickly apply to the FDA for OTC status.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-bipartisan-bicameral-group-of-colleagues-urge-drug-manufacturers-to-expand-availability-of-opioid-overdose-reversal-medication"

Each year, 22,500 Americans are sent to the emergency room as a result of furniture tip-over injuries, and 44 percent of them are children.Klobuchar was joined by representatives from the Children’s Minnesota Hospital, Minneapolis, and furniture tip-over prevention advocate Janet McGee. McGee, of Eagan, Minnesota, lost her 22-month-old son, Teddy, in 2016 after a dresser toppled over while he was taking a nap.“No family should live in fear that their child could be severely injured or even killed by preventable accidents,” said Klobuchar. “I was glad to talk with advocates and medical professionals about the need to strengthen our furniture safety standards and protect more children from the risks of furniture tip-overs.”Klobuchar emphasized the need to pass legislation to strengthen furniture safety standards. She introduced the bipartisan, bicameral STURDY Act along with Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). This bill would direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to set mandatory rules for manufacturers to prevent furniture tip-overs, including requiring companies to test their products for safety and stability before being sold. The legislation has been endorsed by consumer groups, Parents Against Tip-overs, and manufacturers and retailers like IKEA, Room & Board, Crate & Barrel, and Williams-Sonoma.Tips for protecting children from furniture prevention injuries include:###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-health-care-professionals-from-minnesota-children-s-offer-guidance-on-protecting-children-from-furniture-tip-over-injuries"

The funding will also enable necessary renovations to the existing Aurora water plant. “Updating drinking water systems is essential to ensuring the health and safety of our communities. This funding will make a real difference for Aurora and surrounding cities, enabling critical improvements to water treatment plants and lowering costs for families,” said Klobuchar. “I’m proud to have worked with local leaders to secure these resources and improve water infrastructure in communities across the East Range.” “It may not be the flashiest project, but updating the wastewater treatment facility is critically important for those in and around Aurora and the East Mesabi region,” said Smith. “I am proud of our work to secure this funding, which will cut utility costs for Minnesotans and strengthen our water infrastructure.”“Our Project team was honored and elated to receive word that our joint East Range Water Project is slated to receive $2.5 million of federal funds to help finance our Project. Our Project will provide a new, more reliable and better-quality drinking water system to serve the needs of our East Range communities. Plans for this Project have been in process for over a decade and the Project is now fully designed and poised to begin construction once the last financing commitments have been secured. This Congressionally Designated Spending appropriation which Senator Klobuchar has spearheaded on our behalf is critically important for the success of the Project and is truly, and deeply appreciated. Our thanks go out to the Senator and her dedicated team for all of your efforts and support for this great water project,” said Doug Gregor, Mayor of Aurora.Klobuchar and Smith have been actively involved in securing this federal funding for projects benefiting communities across the state through a process called “Congressionally Directed Spending” (CDS). During the CDS process, Klobuchar and Smith have considered project proposals and advocated for funding in close coordination with leaders from across the state.Projects are expected to receive funding over the next several months.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-smith-secure-significant-federal-funding-to-strengthen-aurora-water-infrastructure"

Jaddou. “These delays and backlogs cause tremendous harm not only to prospective immigrants and their families who are left living in uncertainty, but also to companies that are waiting to hire them and the communities that are waiting to benefit from their talents.”“Given the workforce shortages faced by communities across the country, we are interested in making sure that USCIS has the resources it needs to cut down on these backlogs and to issue the immigrant visas that Congress has made available,” the senators continued. Klobuchar has led efforts to address workforce shortages. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last month, she highlighted ways to strengthen America’s workforce and maintain its global competitive edge, pointing to how challenges such as the green card backlog hurt American companies’ ability to recruit and retain workers. In March, Klobuchar joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging the Biden administration to quickly increase the number of available H-2B visas for seasonal workers. Minnesota businesses, including the tourism and forestry sectors, rely on temporary workers during their busiest seasons. Last May, Klobuchar introduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Joni Ernst (R-IA), to increase the number of doctors able to work in rural and medically underserved communities. The Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act would allow international doctors to remain in the U.S. upon completing their residency under the condition that they practice in rural or underserved areas.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Director Jaddou:We write to inquire about the steps that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is taking to address delays in green card, visa, and work permit application processing so the United States can continue to recruit top talent during a time of workforce shortages.Across the country, businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers to get the job done. Current estimates indicate that the United States has around 11.3 million job openings, and demand for labor far exceeds the supply of available U.S. workers at this time. With so many job openings, American businesses are looking to hire skilled workers through our employment-based immigrant and non-immigrant visa programs.In recent years, however, the path to legally immigrating to the United States has become a rocky one filled with waitlists and backlogs that too often keep the world’s talent waiting in limbo or away entirely. Currently, about nine million prospective immigrants are awaiting green cards, and for applicants from some countries, the wait will be years-long. In fiscal year 2021, processing delays were partly responsible for the evaporation of roughly 80,000 employment-based green cards. These delays and backlogs cause tremendous harm not only to prospective immigrants and their families who are left living in uncertainty, but also to companies that are waiting to hire them and the communities that are waiting to benefit from their talents.At a recent hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, former USCIS Chief Counsel Lynden Melmed testified that some delays in visa processing were attributable to the lack of options for electronic filing. Given the workforce shortages faced by communities across the country, we are interested in making sure that USCIS has the resources it needs to cut down on these backlogs and to issue the immigrant visas that Congress has made available.Accordingly, we ask that you answer the following questions by April 25, 2022:###  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-address-visa-backlogs-to-combat-workforce-shortages"

During the 2015 outbreak, Klobuchar led bipartisan efforts to ensure USDA had the resources necessary to fight the outbreak and compensate farmers for lost birds. In 2018, she and Smith successfully pushed to include a provision within the Farm Bill that created an animal disease and disaster response grant program to help fund projects to address risks to animal health, livestock export markets, and industry economic stability.Smith has also led efforts to protect Minnesota farmers from livestock illness, environmental, and financial troubles. After livestock producers were hit hard by drought, Smith worked with Klobuchar to press the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to expand relief and authorize emergency haying and grazing. The two Senators also successfully secured federal relief funds for farmers and livestock producers impacted by the pandemic. Smith has pushed for a host of legislation to protect farmers, including the bipartisan Securing All Livestock Equitably (SALE) Act, which she co-sponsored, to help ensure farmers and livestock dealers get fair, competitive prices.The full text of the letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack:We write with concern about the rapid spread of the H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus that has been confirmed in 19 commercial turkey flocks and 2 backyard flocks in 11 counties across Minnesota, already killing over a million birds.These are the first positive HPAI cases in Minnesota since the 2015 outbreak that killed 9 million birds and resulted in nearly $650 million in economic losses. As the number one turkey producing state in the country, we are extremely concerned about the potential impact to the poultry industry should this outbreak of HPAI continue to spread.In order to contain the virus and minimize economic disruptions to Minnesota farmers and rural communities, we respectfully urge the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to allow for flexibility when farmers receive the devastating news that they have an infected flock. Being able to quickly contain infected birds to stop the spread of the virus and responsibly restock barns that are within a control zone are critical steps in helping this important sector of Minnesota’s agricultural economy.The 2015 outbreak—the largest poultry health disaster in U.S. history—had a catastrophic impact on Minnesota poultry producers and processors, who make up about 6 percent of the state’s agricultural economy. Since that time, the 2018 Farm Bill authorized a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant program to fund forward-looking disease prevention activities, laboratory capacity for surveillance and diagnostics, and rapid response capabilities. Those resources, combined with the experience gained from that earlier outbreak, have better prepared and informed the initial on-the-ground efforts since testing confirmed the recent positive cases. The new Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory that opened in 2016 has played a critical role in enhancing the ability to quickly diagnose and confirm positive cases in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Yet Minnesota poultry farmers and rural communities are rightfully sensitive to the threat that this HPAI outbreak poses to their businesses and our country’s agricultural economy. That is why we respectfully ask that you take the following actions to assist them during this outbreak.First, we ask that APHIS provide flexibility when farmers with positive tests seek approval to quickly contain infected birds and restock barns with new animals. Second, we ask for continued vigilance and cooperation with state and local partners on testing, surveillance, and prevention activities to ensure that this outbreak does not continue to spread and cause additional economic damage. Lastly, APHIS should be proactive in negotiating with our trading partners to ensure open trade access is maintained for non-infected poultry flocks through regionalization agreements.We greatly appreciate USDA’s rapid response to this emergency and the cooperative working relationship that has been established between federal and state officials. We stand ready to work with you and your staff on these timely actions that will help contain this outbreak and minimize disruptions to Minnesota’s farmers and rural communities.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-smith-urge-u-s-department-of-agriculture-to-help-minnesota-farmers-respond-to-avian-flu-outbreak"

TPS recipients get life-saving protection from deportation and permission to work in the U.S.“Cameroon is currently experiencing multiple, worsening humanitarian crises, including an armed conflict in the Far North and widespread violence in the North-West and South-West,” the senators wrote. “Cameroon meets the standard for immediate designation of TPS due to ongoing armed conflict and the extraordinary and temporary conditions of the related humanitarian crises, which combine to impact most regions of the country and make safe return to Cameroon impossible.”“In light of the armed conflict and other extraordinary and temporary conditions engulfing the nation, American principles and international law compel the United States to protect the safety of Cameroonian nationals present in this county by ensuring that they are not forced to return to Cameroon. Only a limited number of individuals will be eligible for TPS: an estimated 40,000 Cameroonians, over 7,000 of whom are children, are currently in the United States,” the senators continued.In its most recent human rights report on Cameroon, the State Department catalogued a troubling series of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention, violence against women and children, and targeted attacks against members of the LGBTQ+ community. Human Rights Watch released a report on February 10, 2022, describing how many who have returned to Cameroon have been raped, tortured, beaten, arbitrarily arrested, extorted, threatened, and detained in unsanitary conditions.The letter was also signed by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).The letter is supported by the Cameroon Advocacy Network, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Amnesty International USA, Human Rights Watch, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights.Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear President Biden:We write to request that your Administration immediately designate Cameroon for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Cameroon is currently experiencing multiple, worsening humanitarian crises, including an armed conflict in the Far North and widespread violence in the North-West and South-West. The insecurity in nine of ten of the country’s regions and nationwide government repression of political dissent and use of torture and incommunicado detention make safe return for Cameroonian nationals in the United States impossible.Conditions in Cameroon warrant an initial 18-month TPS designation. As you know, TPS is a form of statutory relief made available to nationals of a designated country living in the U.S. when return to their home country would be unsafe due to ongoing armed conflict, the temporary effects of an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. TPS provides life-saving protection from deportation and permission to work in the U.S. for the duration of the designation.Cameroon meets the standard for immediate designation of TPS due to ongoing armed conflict and the extraordinary and temporary conditions of the related humanitarian crises, which combine to impact most regions of the country and make safe return to Cameroon impossible. Ongoing armed conflicts in the Far North as well as the Anglophone North-West and South-West regions are characterized by widespread violence and human rights abuses by government forces and armed groups, as well as massive internal displacement. Ongoing conflict in the neighboring Central African Republic has caused a further humanitarian crisis in Cameroon’s East, Adamawa, and North regions, where an influx of 346,000 refugees has increased pressure on limited natural resources and social services in host communities. The United Nations has stated that “nine out of ten regions of Cameroon continue to be impacted by [these] three complex humanitarian crises.” An astounding 4.4 million Cameroonians are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 2.6 million Cameroonians experiencing acute food insecurity. As of December 2021, over 1 million people were internally displaced in Cameroon, over 72,000 Cameroonian refugees were displaced in Nigeria, and over 35,000 refugees had fled to Chad from the Far North region. State-sponsored human rights violations, such as restriction of freedom of expression and association, crackdowns on political opposition and dissent, and frequent use of incommunicado detention and torture, also make return to Cameroon unsafe.The State Department has issued a “Do Not Travel” warning for six regions: The North, Far North, North-West, South-West, East, and parts of Adamawa. In its most recent human rights report on Cameroon, the State Department catalogued a troubling series of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention, violence against women and children, and targeted attacks against members of the LGBTQ+ community. Deportees from the U.S. are at the highest risk of being targeted by authorities for actual or imputed opposition to the government and have experienced arbitrary detention and other abuses upon return. The Cameroonian government’s continued crackdowns on political opposition and dissent and security forces’ documented use of incommunicado detention and torture create risks for anyone deported to Cameroon. Human Rights Watch released a report on February 10, 2022, describing the unspeakable horrors that await Cameroonian returnees. Returnees and their families have been raped, tortured, beaten, arbitrary arrested, extorted, and threatened by law enforcement, military personnel, other agents of the state, as well as by armed separatists. They have also been detained in inhumane, unsanitary, and degrading conditions. Many were targeted because of their deportation to Cameroon from the U.S. and presumed opposition to the Cameroonian government. These documented harms demonstrate the critical need for U.S. protection from deportation for Cameroonian nationals.In light of the armed conflict and other extraordinary and temporary conditions engulfing the nation, American principles and international law compel the United States to protect the safety of Cameroonian nationals present in this county by ensuring that they are not forced to return to Cameroon. Only a limited number of individuals will be eligible for TPS: an estimated 40,000 Cameroonians, over 7,000 of whom are children, are currently in the United States. As we applaud your Administration’s swift implementation of TPS protections for people from another war-ravaged nation, Ukraine, we cannot overlook the urgent need to designate TPS for Cameroon as the armed conflict there has worsened and violent death tolls continue to mount. A designation of TPS for Cameroon would serve as a key and strategic part of the U.S. government’s commitment to human rights and international stability, safeguarding Cameroonians in the U.S. from a return to these dangerous conditions.Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your timely reply.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-designate-cameroon-for-temporary-protected-status"

Klobuchar, elder care advocates, and law enforcement officers discussed the best tools and resources to educate seniors about fraud schemes and prevent seniors from falling victim to scams. “All Americans deserve safety and dignity in their senior years, but too often, older Americans are the targets of deceptive scams that can have serious consequences,” said Klobuchar. “I was glad to talk with local advocates and law enforcement about how we can educate consumers about scams and prevent more seniors from falling victim to these tactics.” Klobuchar was joined by Cathy McLeer, President of AARP Minnesota; Sylwia Bujous, Executive Director at 125 Live Center; Eric Stroup, Rochester Police Department Sergeant; and Walt Rothwell, AARP Fraud Watch Network volunteer.Klobuchar’s bipartisan Seniors Fraud Prevention Act, which cracks down on fraud schemes targeting seniors, was enacted by President Biden last month. The law will help fight scams designed to rob seniors of their assets by directing the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to create a new office dedicated to educating seniors about fraud schemes and improving the agency’s monitoring and response to fraud complaints.Tips for protecting seniors from fraud schemes include:Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office has a Fraud Report Form that seniors can fill out here to report a fraud or scam. Minnesotans can also report fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) through its online portal at reportfraud.ftc.gov or by calling 877-382-4357.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/in-rochester-klobuchar-aarp-and-rochester-police-department-offer-tips-on-protecting-seniors-from-fraud"

The Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of democracy, a place where people from across our country have their voices represented and heard. It is only fitting that we honor their remarkable lives and service to our country by establishing statues in the Capitol. Now that this bill has been signed into law, the accomplishments and legacies of these groundbreaking women will be commemorated forever in the heart of our democracy,” Klobuchar said. “I had the honor of informing Justice O’Connor’s son and Justice Ginsburg’s daughter that the bill had passed and look forward to welcoming them to the Capitol when they come to visit the statues.”“The contributions of Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have left an enduring impact on our nation, and their legacies of service have inspired generations of women,” said Murkowski. “I’m proud to see that this bipartisan bill has been signed into law. Having a place for their statues in the U.S. Capitol is a fitting way to honor these Justices and ensures their legacies live on.”“Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg will always be known as dedicated public servants, fierce champions for equality, and accomplished Americans who broke countless barriers in the field of law,” said Collins. “Statues in the nation’s capital honoring the first two women to serve on the highest court in the land will serve as fitting tributes to their invaluable contributions to our country.”“Justice O’Connor and Justice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women in law and life. By permanently placing their statues in the U.S. Capitol, we’re honoring their legacy and reminding visitors to our nation’s Capitol that women can achieve their dreams through grit and determination,” said Sinema.Members of the House of Representatives, led by Democratic Women’s Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Lois Frankel (D-FL), Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), and Jackie Speier (D-CA), and Vice Chairs Congresswomen Veronica Escobar (D-TX) and Sylvia Garcia (D-TX), and Bipartisan Women’s Caucus Co-Chairs Congresswomen Madeleine Dean (D-PA) and Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR), led the passage in the House alongside Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Chair of the Committee on House Administration and Vice Chair of the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library.""We are thrilled that President Biden signed our legislation to honor the legacies of Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg with statues in their honor on the U.S. Capitol Grounds—it’s an exciting day for children everywhere who dream of following in the footsteps of these legal giants,"" said the Democratic Women’s Caucus leadership. ""Justices O'Connor and Ginsburg broke the highest and hardest glass ceiling in our judiciary, becoming the first two women to sit on the Supreme Court after persisting through decades of gender-based discrimination in their academic and professional careers. These statues will serve as inspiration to future generations of children from across the country and around the world who pass through the halls of Congress.""""Both Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were trailblazers that inspired a generation of women to believe their place is everywhere – and it is perfectly fitting for them to be memorialized in the cathedral of our Democracy,"" said Congresswomen Dean and González-Colón. ""We want to thank all of our colleagues for their work in making this a reality and President Biden for signing the bill. We simply cannot wait to see their statues.""“I am glad to see this bipartisan bill pass both chambers, and now signed by President Joe Biden. Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg made revolutionary contributions to American history and jurisprudence. The presence of their statues in the United States Capitol will honor their legacy and help inspire the next generation of trailblazing women who pass through the halls of Congress,” said Congresswoman Lofgren. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Angus King (I-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Tina Smith (D-MN) joined their colleagues as cosponsors. In the House, the legislation passed with bipartisan support by a vote of 349-63.In honor of Justice Ginsburg’s and O’Connor’s trailblazing legacies, the legislation also requires the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library to consider selecting an artist from underrepresented demographic groups to create the statues. ###  Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-murkowski-collins-sinema-bipartisan-legislation-to-honor-supreme-court-justices-ginsburg-and-o-connor-signed-into-law"

The Travel Champion Award is an annual honor presented to Members of Congress that work to boost travel to and within the United States.“Thank you to the U.S. Travel Association for honoring me with the 2022 Travel Champion Award. Travel and tourism are crucial to powering economic growth and creating jobs in communities across Minnesota and our country,” said Klobuchar. “This year, we signed into law my bipartisan Restoring Brand USA Act, which will provide our tourism sector with much-needed economic support for travel promotion. As we say in Duluth, we can finally see the lighthouse on the horizon, and as more businesses open their doors to more visitors and customers, we need to remind international travelers of all we have to offer. As co-chair of the Congressional Tourism Caucus, I’m committed to championing travel and tourism across the nation to ensure America remains the best place in the world to visit.” The U.S. Travel Association praised Klobuchar as “a strong champion of the travel industry and has been one of Brand USA’s biggest advocates since the program’s inception,” highlighting her instrumental role in passing the Restoring Brand USA Act, which was signed into law in March. This bipartisan legislation, which Klobuchar introduced alongside Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO), provides support for Brand USA, a public-private partnership that promotes international travel to the United States. As co-chair of the Senate Travel and Tourism Caucus, Klobuchar recently announced significant federal funding to support the Duluth tourism industry. She also joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in urging the Biden administration to increase the number of available H-2B visas for temporary workers, as these workers are critical to seasonal tourism businesses. ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-named-u-s-travel-association-2022-travel-champion"

Last month, Klobuchar and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced bipartisan legislation to make E15 available year-round.“I have long pushed to make E15 available year-round and have introduced bipartisan legislation to do just that,” said Klobuchar. “Investing in affordable, readily-available biofuels produced in the U.S. will benefit our economy, decrease prices at the pump, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I am glad to see the administration take this initial step to diversify our fuel supply in an affordable way, and I will continue to push for more permanent solutions.”In addition to permitting the sale of year-round E15, the Biden administration announced progress on several actions Klobuchar has called for including:Klobuchar has been a strong advocate for permitting the year-round sale of E15 and increasing the use of biofuels.In addition to making E15 available year-round, Klobuchar’s Home Front Energy Independence Act would also establish an E15 tax credit and extend the tax credit for biodiesel, direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize their E15 labeling rule, and provide for biofuel infrastructure and compatibility with retailers.Last month Klobuchar also joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in the Senate in a letter calling on the administration to approve the year-round sale of E15. Last July, Klobuchar and Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) introduced another bipartisan bill to permit the year-round sale of E15. The introduction of this legislation immediately followed the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruling against year-round sales of E15.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/klobuchar-statement-on-waiver-to-allow-the-year-round-sale-of-higher-blends-of-ethanol"

That is not what they envisioned,” Klobuchar said before outlining several times in our nation’s history when Senate rules have been changed. “History plainly allows for just the type of action that our democracy now demands,” she concluded.The full transcript of Klobuchar’s speech as given below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.I first want to thank my colleague from the state of Washington, Senator Cantwell, for her passion for the people and the rights of people to vote, and her willingness to actually go through the details of the groups outside of this Congress that feel so strongly about this, including businesses, as pointed out, who understand that you can’t do business overseas – having just come back from Ukraine, that I just arrived an hour ago – and uphold democracies overseas, if we are allowing our democracy to go to shambles by allowing voter suppression laws to pass as they have in numerous states across the country.  Just this week we marked the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and today we are considering legislation that goes to the very heartbeat of the democracy, the freedom to vote, that so many have fought and died for. We’re here because a flood of state laws to roll back voting has surged up since the 2020 elections. And in the 2020 elections, in the middle of a pandemic, Americans cast a ballot, more of them cast a ballot, than ever before. They were willing to take those risks, and the laws were changed in red states and blue states and purple states to allow them to do that. But now what do we see? A rollback. A rollback in the Presiding Officer's great state of Wisconsin. We see rollbacks attempted across the nation, in places like Montana, same-day registration was in place for 15 years, 8,000 people took avail of it in the last election to either change their address or register that way. So then what happens? The Republican legislature in Montana, “why don't we get rid of something we've had in place for 15 years? Why don't we do that?” Guess what that creates, my friends? Maximum confusion and ultimate voter suppression. With that core freedom of voting now at stake, it is on us to stand up, to take up the torch that Dr. King and so many brave Americans carried decades ago and act to preserve the foundational right of our democracy. And while that may sound like an ambitious task, it is one within our reach. By passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act we can meet these challenges and turn back the tide.Today I want to address a topic that has loomed large over this historic debate, and that has to do with the very rules of this chamber. This week every member of the Senate will have a chance to cast a vote that will determine if this is a legislative body that will rise to meet a test. The test is participation and voting. The test is actually being able to take on the issues of our day.It won't be the first time. Indeed four times already this Congress, our Republican colleagues have blocked us from even considering legislation to protect the freedom to vote. But we’re here again this week. We’re here because to quote Ella Baker, a granddaughter of slaves from Virginia who worked alongside some of the great leaders of the civil rights movement, “We who believe in freedom cannot rest.” So while much has been made of our colleagues who have not committed to join us in this effort to change the Senate rules, we must remain steadfast in the truth that the right to vote is non-negotiable. We must forge ahead. I want to start by responding to some of the points that have been raised as reasons not to move forward with legislation at this watershed moment, as reasons not to do what it takes to come to protecting the most sacred of rights, the right to vote. Some have argued that allowing voting rights legislation to pass the Senate without clearing a 60 vote threshold would be a mistake that would open the door to somehow leading it to wild swings in federal policy. I’m trying to imagine this place ever involved in such a thing, given how slowly we go and how many people – understandably – want to make sure we’re careful in how we pass laws, but that’s one of the things that has been raised for why we need a 60 vote threshold, which of course is not in the Constitution. The word filibuster or cloture –  not in the Constitution. And in fact legislatures across this land, some of whom do very good things, do not use a 60-vote threshold, in fact democracies across the world do not use a 60-vote threshold. The truth is this: we have tried for months to persuade our Republican colleagues to join us in supporting legislation, to work with us, to debate it. But what they do is they throw a wrench into the process and then basically walk out that door and go home. We don’t have that debate that allows us to have amendments and allows us to ultimately have a vote on the bill. It is cut off from a vote. When you look at the past when it comes to voting rights, it has been bipartisan not even that long ago. But this time -- this time even reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, something that has been the law of the land, supported on a bipartisan basis, as the President of the United States pointed out when he was in Atlanta. This time, no. Only one Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, was willing even to allow the John Lewis bill to come up for a vote. But if our colleagues across the aisle will not work with us, it does not mean – it cannot mean – that we should simply give up. A simple look at history makes that clear. As Representative Clyburn has noted in recent weeks, there have been moments in our history when this most fundamental of rights has not been extended or defended on a bipartisan basis. That’s a right to have these bills come up. He pointed to the 15th Amendment, that as he said, “was a single-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote.” And that fact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.I would also say to my colleagues that the real threat facing our country isn’t too much legislation, it’s the gridlock and the stalemate in which this chamber is stuck. A number of us were just in Ukraine, standing up for democracy, standing up for the right of people across the world to be able to debate issues and make decisions on the most pressing issues of this time. And now we are back here in this chamber and we have to have that opportunity as well. This misses another key point in the arguments made against changing the rules. When politicians actually have to vote on stuff, voters can hold them accountable for these votes. We know that the policies in the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act enjoy strong support among the American people. They have been adopted in red and blue and purple states. Look at places like Utah. For years, mail-in balloting, yet in other states, sadly, it’s really hard to do. In other states, you have to get a notary just to get an application, or you have to get a witness just to get an application, even if you have COVID and you’re in a hospital. Yet, in many states – red, blue, purple – this is in place. We believe, those of us who support the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, that in keeping with the Constitution that says that Congress can make or alter the laws regarding federal elections, that this should be the law of the land. It is constitutionally supported, and Americans, no matter what their zip code, should have the right to vote in a safe way that’s best for them. Arguing that the Senate rules are more important than the right to vote ignores the very history of this nation. As Senator Angus King has reminded us, in 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge introduced a bill to ensure African Americans in the South were not disenfranchised. The bill passed the House but was blocked by the Senate with a filibuster. Lodge argued that the Senate should get rid of the filibuster, saying, “To vote without debating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is imbecile.” I think that kind of says it all quite directly. The Senate chose not to change its rules, and due to repeated filibusters in the years that followed, Congress couldn’t pass legislation to enforce the 15th Amendment until nearly 70 years later through the Civil Rights Act of 1957. We’ve also heard that allowing one party to insist on virtually unlimited debates – you can’t vote – is an essential part of the Senate. But experts from both parties have said this isn’t true. As Marty Gold, the respected expert on the Senate rules who worked for Republican leader Howard Baker and was Staff Director of the Senate Rules Committee has written, the possibility that a minority of Senators could hold unlimited debate on a topic against the majority's will was unknown in the first Senate. Those are his words. Others have argued that requiring a supermajority, as this filibuster does now, to pass legislation was an intentional effort to foster compromise. But again, the historical record simply doesn’t back that up. The Constitutional Convention heard but did not adopt a proposal to require a supermajority for legislation. The framers explicitly decided to reserve supermajority requirements for things like constitutional amendments, treaties, and impeachment. To quote one of them, Benjamin Franklin wrote that “a system where the minority overpowers the majority would be contrary to the common practice of assemblies in all countries and ages.” Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison, “It is my principle that the will of the majority should always prevail.” James Madison was a fierce defender of minority rights but in 1834 even he wrote, “The vital principle of Republican government is the will of the majority.” Listening to those words, does it really seem like the framers of our Constitution envisioned a system where a minority of senators could stand in the way of legislation and stop it altogether – stop the vote, stop the consideration, throw a wrench into a process, take it off the rails and then just walk out the door and go home? That is not what they envisioned.I also want to be clear: updating the Senate rules to meet the needs of this moment isn’t some radical break with past precedent. Throughout the Senate’s history, when faced with unrelenting obstruction from the minority, the majority has in fact changed the Senate rules to allow matters to conclude, to be voted on. Not to hang in a dance of perpetuity. In fact since it was first established in 1917, the cloture rule has been revised multiple times to make it easier to end debate and force a vote. For friends watching at home, this is what it means: a cloture motion is what allows senators to bring something to a vote, and under the current rules, it takes 60 senators to open debate to pass a bill. Here are some examples of how the cloture rule has changed over time. In 1949, cloture was extended to cover all issues pending before the Senate, not just bills. In 1975, the vote threshold for cloture was reduced to three-fifths of all senators. In 1979, total post cloture debate was limited to 100 hours, and then it was limited again to 30 hours in 1986. And in the past decade, the cloture rule has been further reduced for various kinds of nominees, most recently by our Republican colleagues across the aisle. This isn’t something from 100 years ago. This isn’t something from before we had cars and people were arriving here on horseback. This just happened.In addition to changes to the cloture rule itself, the Senate has put in place exceptions to the rule. In fact, over time the Senate has established over 160 processes and statutes that allow a final vote without requiring 60 votes for cloture to end debate. In other words, you get to a vote without the 60 votes. As a result, we expedited procedures, including – get this – reconciliation to pass spending and tax legislation, the Congressional Review Act to block regulations, disapproval of arms sales. I guess someone decided that was okay to do for less than 60 votes. Even approving compensation plans for commercial space accidents doesn't require 60 votes, my friends. But while the 60 vote threshold was carved up 160 times so senators could pass things like tax cuts under President Trump, block regulations and confirm some Supreme Court justices, when it comes to voting rights, we are told that traditions and comity means that we should hug it tight, this old rule, throw senators under the Senate desks and go home. It is no wonder that our Republican colleagues’ support for the 60 vote threshold rings hollow when their priorities, such as tax cuts, such as a Supreme Court nominee, can be passed with a simple majority. Time and time again, the majority in the U.S. Senate has had to change the rules to help pass major legislation. As Senator Merkley has noted time and time again, bills we have passed after the majority has modified the rules include the National Gas Policy Act in 1977, funding for the Selective Service System in 1980, deficit reduction legislation in 1985, a moratorium on listing new species under the Endangered Species Act in 1995, and the change made by the majority in 1996 to the reconciliation process which paved the way for the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the 2017 Trump tax cuts. When circumstances change, senators have changed the rules time and time again. All of this history clearly shows that the Senate rules are not chiseled in stone. That's probably a good thing. Because we get that the people out there need us to do our jobs and maybe that is more important than some archaic rule that someone is now abusing. They are not an outside force, these rules, over which we have no control. They are our rules, the senators’ rules, yes, but also the people’s rules, written and changed over the years by senators representing the people of this country, just like the ones sitting in this chamber today. As we move forward, I want to make clear that I agree with my colleagues who have said we must keep the history of this institution in mind. By the way, I just gave you the history of this institution, 160 carve-outs, time and time again, when the rules have changed. That is the true history of this institution. History plainly allows for just the type of action that our democracy now demands. If we acknowledge the stakes when it comes to protecting the freedom to vote, the cornerstone of our democracy, and we acknowledge the history of the rules of this body, I am left with the simple conclusion: we must update, change, and improve our rules to restore the Senate and meet the moment of our times. Our nation was founded on the ideals of democracy and we've seen for ourselves in this building how we can't afford to take that for granted. I certainly saw that this weekend in Ukraine. We cannot afford to take any democracy for granted. The world is watching us. Watching to see how America is taking on the challenges of the 21st Century, including the threats to our democracy. Around the globe there are those who see weakness as an opportunity. They see weakness in our democracy as an opportunity for them. They who are hoping that gridlock and paralysis are the defining features of America. They are out there, and you can imagine what world leaders I’m thinking of right now. To put it simply, if we’re going to effectively compete with the rest of the world, we need a Senate that can do more than just respond to crises. We are pretty good at that – tornados, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, financial crises, pandemics, okay, we respond to that. But what about the long-term challenges like slowly but surely eroding this democracy with voter suppression. There is so much at stake here. We must get this done. Thank you, Madam President.

I look forward to meeting with political and military leaders in Ukraine to better understand the situation on the ground and reaffirm our commitment to their security,” Klobuchar said.“I am proud to join my colleagues on this important trip to Ukraine,” Portman said. “Ukraine continues to defend its territorial integrity against an increasingly aggressive Russia, while also striving to enact critical domestic reforms to solidify its democracy – it is more important than ever that the U.S. support Ukraine in its efforts. I look forward to reaffirming this commitment during our upcoming discussions with senior Ukrainian officials.” “Our bipartisan congressional delegation sends a clear message to the global community: the United States stands in unwavering support of our Ukrainian partners to defend their sovereignty and in the face of persistent Russian aggression,” Shaheen said. “I’m proud to lead lawmakers on behalf of the United States to further our commitment to our Ukrainian partners in support of their NATO aspirations and look forward to strengthening our transatlantic bonds as they chart a prosperous, pro-democratic future.”“I am proud to join this bipartisan group of senators reaffirming the United States’ unwavering, unstinting commitment to Ukraine. I look forward to meeting directly with Ukraine’s President and senior leadership to learn firsthand the state of their military preparedness in the face of Russian aggression – and to understand what further support they may need to more decisively deter and defend against Russian invasion. Russia’s recent cyberattacks show the need for strong action now: greater military assistance, severe sanctions, and cooperation with NATO allies. In this urgent, historic moment we must show, through deed as well as word, that we stand strong with the people of Ukraine in defending against brazen, craven Russian aggression— a message that we will deliver together face to face,” Blumenthal said.“Russia continues to challenge Ukraine’s sovereignty, democratic values, and way of life. This is unacceptable and we must reaffirm our commitment to the Ukrainians in the face of this aggression,” Cramer said. “Our bipartisan delegation demonstrates to Vladimir Putin the United States’ resolve and sends the message we stand with Ukraine.”“Ukraine, Russia and Europe need to see that Republicans and Democrats are to stand together to defend Ukraine in the face of a threatened Russian invasion. This will be my seventh trip to Ukraine as a Senator, and I look forward to reconnecting with President Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials to complement the administration’s diplomatic work and protect U.S. national security interests,” Murphy said.“Ukraine is on the embattled frontier of the free world. This sovereign country deserves the steadfast support of its American friends during this dangerous and pivotal time,” Wicker said. “I am proud to join my Senate colleagues on this bipartisan delegation in the face of Vladimir Putin’s shameful aggression. I look forward to meeting with President Zelenskyy and other senior Ukrainian officials.”During their visit, the senators will also meet with Ukrainian leaders to encourage continued democratic reforms so that Ukraine may further position itself for membership in NATO. Additional details about the visit will be available in the coming days.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/klobuchar-bipartisan-group-of-colleagues-travel-to-ukraine-will-meet-with-ukraine-president-in-face-of-russian-aggression"

Full audio of the press conference can be found here.“I’m Senator Amy Klobuchar from the state of Minnesota. I’m proud to be part of this delegation. At a moment of a lot of political divides in Washington, D.C., which we could do an entire press conference about, we instead choose to be here in unity. From conservative Republicans to liberal Democrats. And that is because we stand with Ukraine, we stand with the brave, brave people of Ukraine who have now lost – and I think it’s important for our country, for our citizens to know this – 14,000 people at the hands of Russia. “We were briefed by the embassy this morning. We know the administration from every level, the U.S. administration from the Secretary of State to the President himself, have pledged to help this country. And that means everything from the aid that has been given, the congressional work led by Senators Shaheen and Portman, and also the sanctions bill that Senator Menendez put forward. I’m one of the cosponsors but a number of us are focused on as we move forward. So our message is there will be consequences if he chooses to violate the sanctity of this democracy.”[...]“In the U.S., there’s two things going on. One is that the Biden administration is looking at what sanctions are within their power to implement, looking at section by section of the economy. And they’ve already committed to be looking at that. And those sanctions are only most effective, and can be effective, if we work with our allies. And so that’s the other piece of the negotiations and what’s happening.""The other thing that’s happening that’s more in our control – the people up here – is that Congress is looking at additional sanctions that are not yet authorized by law. That is the bill that I referred to that Senator Menendez, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, is leading. And those include personal limitations on travel and personal sanctions against individuals, including Vladimir Putin. So both things are at play in a serious way right now as the threats continue.”# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/video-we-stand-with-ukraine-following-meeting-with-ukraine-president-klobuchar-reiterates-support-for-ukraine-in-the-face-of-russian-aggression"

And we stand with Ukraine.”KLOBUCHAR: “This is something closely followed in America…because we support democracy, but it also hits home.”WATCH FULL PRESS CONFERENCE HEREWASHINGTON – At a press conference today in Ukraine, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) emphasized the United States’ strong bipartisan commitment to Ukraine as it continues to face Russian aggression, noting, “This is a democracy, we’re proud it’s a democracy. And we stand with Ukraine.”Klobuchar also highlighted strong engagement on this conflict in the United States, including in Minnesota’s Ukrainian-American community. “I have a huge Ukrainian-American population in my state, and I remember after my last trip I ended up doing a town hall meeting in the Ukrainian Hall, and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up…this is something closely followed in America…because we support democracy, but it also hits home.”Klobuchar announced this morning that she and a bipartisan group of colleagues, including Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), traveled to Ukraine to meet with President Zelenskyy.Klobuchar’s full remarks from the press conference can be found below. A recording of the press conference can be viewed here.“I wanted to add that one of the last times I was here was with Senator McCain and we went to the Donbas region, something I’ll never forget, with Senator Graham. And met widows who had just lost their husbands to Russian snipers. And as we came today, I thought of all those lost, brave Ukranians, 14,000 overall, since this began. And we just felt it was really important as a bipartisan delegation to be here, to say we’re standing with Ukraine. Whether that means the assistance our country has given in large sums and continues to give, and equipment and the like. Whether that means coordinating with our allies as you saw Wendy Sherman and others and Secretary Blinken do over the last months. Or whether it means simply giving our strong moral support for the country of Ukraine. This is a democracy, we’re proud it’s a democracy. And we stand with Ukraine.”Reporter question: Some Americans I’ve read on Twitter, they ask one question. United States is so far away from Ukraine. Ukraine is basically near Russia and Europe. Why do you care so much about Ukraine that you’re willing to risk a full breakup of diplomatic relations, Putin threatened, in case those sanctions – some of you stand for and co-authored this bill on sanctions – why are you ready for such a risky move for Ukraine? The second question is again about sanctions and weapons. Our government is advocating for their partners, not only United States but other countries like Canada, some EU countries, to provide weapons and to impose sanctions before the Russian invasion, not after. While I heard that Biden administration stands for the [inaudible] of sanctions only if Russia invades, as well as the offense of weapons.“I know Senator Cramer’s going to say something, but I wanted to reiterate that in answer to your question, it isn’t ‘well we may be that distant.’ We’re not that distant. I have a huge Ukrainian-American population in my state, and I remember after my last trip I ended up doing a town hall meeting in the Ukrainian Hall, and hundreds and hundreds of people showed up. And then-Ambassador Yovanovitch, our U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine at the time, appeared on the screen and answered their questions. So this is something closely followed in America, for the reasons my colleagues outlined, because we support democracy, but it also hits home. And then the second piece is we’re not alone. I think Roger [Senator Wicker] was getting at that at the end. So many allies in the region, Great Britain, so many other countries that have been standing up for their own freedoms, are also helping Ukraine in every way they can.”“I just want to conclude, one of the reasons we’re all here together, because I think you all know we don’t always agree on everything, is to make that point. This isn’t just, ‘oh hold hands, and we’re happy to be here, and we’re wearing our Ukraine buttons.’ It is send our flags. It is also to say that we stand united on moving ahead on legislation and responding if this is to come to bear.”# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/in-ukraine-klobuchar-emphasizes-bipartisan-commitment-to-defending-ukraine-in-the-face-of-russian-aggression-highlights-minnesota-ukrainian-american-community"

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:“Today as we remember Dr. King, we celebrate his passion and perseverance. Dr. King understood better than anyone that the path to progress is neither short nor without obstacles. Still, he pursued justice every day of his life, recognizing that ‘Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle.’“Last week, I had the privilege of meeting with Martin Luther King III and Arndrea Waters King. As we discussed efforts to protect our most fundamental right – the right to vote – I was again reminded of this powerful message. Dr. King devoted his life to ensuring that all Americans, no matter their race, were able to make their voices heard at the ballot box. He stared down violence time and time again and instead fought for our democracy with words and wisdom. In times of strife, he did not give up hope, and he did not back down.“As we observe this holiday, let us honor Dr. King’s legacy by ensuring our actions live up to our words. We will keep moving forward as one nation, channeling Dr. King’s spirit of love and light as we fight to protect the ideals of democracy on which our country was built. And when challenges arise, as they most certainly will, we will think of his teachings and carry on, just as he would have.”# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/klobuchar-statement-on-martin-luther-king-jr-day"

Approximately 1 in 6 women in the U.S. have experienced stalking at some point in their lives.“As a former prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the serious emotional and physical toll stalking can take on victims,” Klobuchar said. “This resolution will raise awareness about the dangers of stalking, the need to ensure that victims are protected, and the resources available to help survivors get their lives back on track.”“Millions of our fellow Americans have been victims of stalking. Oftentimes their stories involve years-long episodes, drastic changes to their lives to secure their safety and sadly other criminal activity by stalkers. This month is a time for us all to reflect on the pervasiveness of stalking and the serious hardships and dangers faced by victims. The work of advocates raising awareness, of law enforcement and courts taking preventive and punitive action and of service workers in providing help to victims are all worthy of our thanks,” Grassley said.“As we all spend more time online, we must do more to crack down on online stalking and other predatory behaviors,” said Murphy. “I’m honored to partner with Senators Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley, as well as my colleague Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick in the House, to introduce this bipartisan resolution designating January as National Stalking Awareness Month and sharing information with partners across Florida and the country about how to keep our communities, and especially our kids, safe.""“During National Stalking Awareness Month, we must redouble our efforts to improve the prevention and response to all forms of stalking, and send a clear message to predators that they will be held accountable for their abhorrent crimes,” said Fitzpatrick. “I am proud to support this bipartisan resolution, which will work to raise awareness regarding the serious dangers of stalking, emphasize the protection of victims, and help survivors recover and heal.”This resolution is cosponsored by every woman senator on the Judiciary Committee—Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)—as well as Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mike Crapo (R-ID). It complements efforts by the Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center (SPARC) to bring attention to Stalking Awareness Month.Klobuchar is a national leader in the fight to prevent domestic violence. She is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and prior to her time in the Senate, she served as Hennepin County Attorney. In March 2021, Klobuchar and Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI) introduced the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act. This legislation prevents convicted stalkers from buying or owning a gun—a commonsense update to federal law that many states have already adopted.In January 2021 Klobuchar introduced the Abby Honold Act with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN). This bill was inspired by Abby Honold, a former student of the University of Minnesota and rape survivor, who has worked to promote the use of trauma-informed techniques by law enforcement when responding to sexual assault crimes. Klobuchar introduced legislation to protect immigrant victims of domestic violence the following month.Klobuchar has worked to secure support for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault during the pandemic. When the pandemic began, Klobuchar, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) led their colleagues in a bipartisan letter expressing concern for the wellbeing of families who face an increased risk of domestic violence during the pandemic and urging the Administration to ensure service providers have the flexibility and resources to help victims of domestic violence. In April 2020, Klobuchar, Murkowski, and Casey led a bipartisan group of 38 colleagues requesting that any future legislation to address the pandemic includes support for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The senators expressed concern that service providers have reported that abusers are using the pandemic to isolate their victims, withhold financial resources, and refuse medical aid; rape crisis centers have seen an increased need for services; and many local law enforcement agencies have received an increased number of domestic violence-related calls. The full text of the resolution can be found HERE and below:Whereas approximately 1 in 6 women in the United States, at some point during her lifetime, has experienced stalking victimization, causing her to feel very fearful or believe that she or someone close to her would be harmed or killed;Whereas it is estimated that, each year, between 6,000,000 and 7,500,000 individuals in the United States report that they have been victims of stalking;Whereas more than 85 percent of victims of stalking report that they have been stalked by someone they know;Whereas nearly 70 percent of intimate partner stalking victims are threatened with physical harm by stalkers;Whereas stalking is a risk factor for intimate partner homicide;Whereas 3 in 4 female victims of intimate partner homicides were stalked during the year preceding the homicide by their killers;Whereas 11 percent of victims of stalking report having been stalked for more than 5 years;Whereas two-thirds of stalkers pursue their victims at least once a week;Whereas many victims of stalking are forced to take drastic measures to protect themselves, including relocating, changing jobs, or obtaining protection orders;Whereas the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression is much higher among victims of stalking than the general population;Whereas many victims of stalking do not report stalking to the police or contact a victim service provider, shelter, or hotline;Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law, the laws of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice;Whereas stalking affects victims of every race, age, culture, gender, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, and economic status;Whereas national organizations, local victim service organizations, campuses, prosecutor’s offices, and police departments stand ready to assist victims of stalking and are working diligently to develop effective and innovative responses to stalking, including online stalking;Whereas there is a need to improve the response of the criminal justice system to stalking through more aggressive investigation and prosecution;Whereas there is a need for an increase in the availability of victim services across the United States, and those services must include programs tailored to meet the needs of victims of stalking;Whereas individuals between 18 and 24 years old experience the highest rates of stalking victimization, and a majority of stalking victims report their victimization first occurred before the age of 25;Whereas up to 75 percent of women in college who experience behavior relating to stalking also experience other forms of victimization, including sexual or physical victimization;Whereas college students with disabilities are twice as likely as college students without disabilities to experience stalking;Whereas there is a need for an effective response to stalking on each campus;Whereas more than twice as many victims of stalking are stalked using technology, such as phone calls, text messages, social media platforms, internet posts, emails, electronic tracking, as victims of stalking who are stalked without the use of technology;Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has heightened the risk of online stalking and harassment, particularly among school-aged individuals;Whereas victim service organizations and law enforcement entities have swiftly adapted to the COVID–19 pandemic in order to continue to serve victims of stalking;Whereas victim service providers report an increase in online stalking and harassment, particularly among school-aged individuals; andWhereas the Senate finds that “National Stalking Awareness Month” provides an opportunity to educate the people of the United States about stalking: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Senate— # # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/klobuchar-grassley-bipartisan-bicameral-resolution-designating-january-as-national-stalking-awareness-month-passes-senate"

This win will help increase exports from Minnesota’s dairy industry to Canada and ensure the USMCA is properly enforced to benefit and protect Minnesota farmers and workers.Klobuchar and Smith also highlighted that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has opened signup for the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program for calendar year 2022 and expanded the program to allow dairy producers to better protect their operations. The deadline to sign up is February 18, 2022.“Minnesota’s dairy farmers are key to producing and protecting our nation’s food supply,” said Klobuchar. “By ensuring fair access to international markets and providing a strong safety net for producers, we are supporting the industry and our rural communities. I’ll keep fighting for policies to position our state’s dairy farmers for success.”“For nearly two years, I have worked to crack down on Canada’s illegal trade practices that are hurting U.S. dairy farmers,” said Smith. “This is a historic win for dairies in Minnesota and across the country, who will finally be able to sell U.S. products to Canadian buyers without unjustified restrictions.”In August 2020, Klobuchar, Smith, and a bipartisan group of 24 Senators sent a letter to then-USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer calling for the enforcement of USMCA dairy provisions.Klobuchar and Smith worked to provide vital support for dairy producers continuing to face challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, including authorizing supplemental DMC payments to small and medium-sized dairy farms in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. In August 2021, Klobuchar and Smith led a letter with Representative Angie Craig (D-MN) to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack urging him to prioritize finalizing the Supplemental DMC payments. Additional information on the DMC program can be found here.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/klobuchar-smith-announce-resolution-of-dairy-trade-dispute-aid-for-minnesota-dairy-farmers"

What is radical is people who are undermining our democracy.”KLOBUCHAR: “And I want to make clear to your viewers today, this is not a liberal/moderate divide.”WATCH KLOBUCHAR INTERVIEW HEREWASHINGTON – In an interview with Rachel Maddow tonight, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee with oversight of federal elections and campaign finance law, once again called for changes to Senate rules in order to pass federal voting rights legislation following her trip to Georgia with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.Klobuchar noted that changes to the filibuster have previously been made over 160 times to pass major legislation, create government agencies, and address pressing issues like the national deficit and defense.“The federal government responded when there were civil rights violations, the federal government responded throughout history when things have happened. And it's on us right now,” Klobuchar told Maddow. “This is not a radical change. What is radical is people who are undermining our democracy. That’s what’s radical, and it is on us to right it.”The full transcript of the interview is available below and high-resolution video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Rachel Maddow: Joining us now is Senator Amy Klobuchar. She’s Chair of the Rules Committee. She’s one of the lead sponsors of the Freedom to Vote Act. She traveled to Georgia with Vice President Harris today, she just returned to D.C. tonight aboard Air Force One with President Biden. Senator it’s great to see you, I know it’s been a long day, thanks for being here.Klobuchar: Thanks, Rachel. I was just –Maddow: Go ahead. Klobuchar: Just before we get into what’s going on in the Senate, which is the key question, I did want to say President Biden's speech was wonderful tonight, as was Vice President Harris's. But there was this moment where he talked about how there’s a moment in time, and this has happened through history, where time basically stops. He brought up the bomb blowing up in that church in Birmingham. He brought up when John Lewis crossed that bridge, and when he got hit, and people got killed, and people got injured. And he brought up January 6th. There are those moments, and this is one of those moments. It didn't begin on January 6th, it didn’t end there. It's been a concerted effort. You know, and you just talked about it on your show. Over 400 bills introduced across the country, many of them passed, to take people's rights away to vote. As Reverend Warnock has said repeatedly, “Some people don't want some people to vote.” That is what’s going on, our very democracy depends on it. This is a moment when time stands still, and that is the argument we're making to these two senators. Maddow: I was also struck, Senator Klobuchar, with the argument the President made about the way that partisan shift on this issue has changed over time. The way he went out of his way, you know, speaking in Atlanta, speaking in blue dot Atlanta, in now what is blue state Georgia, talking before a very supportive audience. But making the case in part by talking about how Republicans until quite recently unanimously, all but unanimously, supported voting rights and the Voting Rights Act. People like George W. Bush. People like Strom Thurmond. He had an extensive reflection on Strom Thurmond, the anti civil rights icon, who in the end supported the Voting Rights Act. And this is something that even Republicans found necessary to do by massive margins in the past. That is both an indictment of Republicans but also of Democrats who won't do what needs to be done in order to get it passed. I wondered about what your reflections were on him talking so much about how the partisanship around this issue has calcified in a way that we’ve never seen before? Klobuchar: I think it makes the case, right? Because there’s many of us – as you know, I cherish the work I've done across the aisle. I've passed a bunch of bills, I think I’ve mentioned that quite a few times on the presidential debate stage. But the point is that right now, they're not playing on this right now. Even though, and that's why I think he felt it was important to make the case, in the past, democracy triumphed. It's more important than any divides between us. But right now, because of the shadow, the large shadow of Donald Trump over the Republican Party, there are very few people that are willing to stand up like you're seeing with Liz Cheney, with the January 6th Commission, that she's willing to stand up, over in the House. And there’s just not that happening in the Senate right now when it comes to voting rights. And the case that I've made to my colleagues in those rooms, where we want it to happen, to quote ""Hamilton,"" is that the filibuster has -- it is unbelievable, changes to the filibuster are not radical. They've happened 160 times, Rachel. Changes have happened where bills have been passed without the 60 vote: 1977 national gas policy; 1980, Selective Service System; 1987, national defense bill; 1995, endangered species bill. The Bush tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts through reconciliation. What just happened with Mitch McConnell and the debt ceiling. History is riddled with exceptions and changes that were made. And it was Robert Byrd himself, and I've said this to Senator Manchin several times, who once said, “you change the rules when there are changed circumstances.” Well Rachel, an all-out assault on our democracy is a changed circumstance. Maddow: We're going to see if we believe Senator Schumer about the timing here. As soon as tomorrow, as late as Monday, Martin Luther King Day, we are going to see a vote in the Senate. Is there anything else we should look for ahead of that vote in terms of conversations, events, pronouncements? Or we just wait to see how it’s going to go when the roll call happens? Klobuchar: There's a lot of drama right now, I’ll give you that, but I think that’s good – that’s democracy. We are negotiating, we're talking to both senators, groups of people. Our whole voting group that has been involved from the beginning, including of course Senator Schumer and Senator Merkley and Kaine and King and Tester and Padilla, and Warnock, it is a group that is not giving up. And as are other senators that have been involved and meeting with Senator Sinema. Because people feel so strongly about this. And I want to make clear to your viewers today, this is not a liberal/moderate divide. There are two senators who are working through this with us, but there are a whole bunch of moderates and people from states, like Senator Tester of Montana, who have seen good democracy rules. Then suddenly, after 15 years, you have same-day registration taken away in that state. Yet thousands of people have relied on that. Just one example that you don't always hear about. That is this all-out assault on democracy across the country. When you look through history, and we were there in Georgia, where history happened – federal government response. They may not do it right away, but we can't wait anymore. The federal government responded when there were civil rights violations, the federal government responded throughout history when things have happened. And it's on us right now. We’re just making the case to these two senators, as vociferously – and I’m giving you a lot of the arguments I use all of the time – as we can. This is not a radical change. What is radical is people who are undermining our democracy. That’s what’s radical, and it is on us to right it. We can always have differences of opinion, Democrats and Republicans. But our job is to make sure, as you pointed out earlier in the show, that votes are counted fairly, that people aren't doing sham audits and fake certifications, and they're not throwing people off of election boards, and they're not taking and dismantling those election boards. Those things would be solved through the Freedom to Vote Act, that simply sets minimum federal standards for the country grounded in the U.S. Constitution, which clearly says, never questions, that Congress can make or alter the laws regarding federal elections.Maddow: Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Chair of the Rules Committee in the Senate and one of the lead sponsors of Freedom to Vote. Senator, thank you for joining us tonight. As you say, a lot of drama here right now. We look to you to understand it. Thanks for being here. Klobuchar: Okay.

The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act, named for two young brothers from Kimball, Minnesota, who died from CO poisoning, would direct the CPSC to ensure carbon monoxide detectors are safe and reliable. In addition to encouraging states to require residential CO detection devices, the bill would authorize the CPSC to establish a federal grant program to help states, local governments, and tribes carry out CO education programs and install alarms.“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that at least 430 people in the U.S. die each year from CO poisoning and approximately 50,000 people are forced to seek medical attention for accidental CO poisoning.

At the federal level, the CPSC is charged with protecting the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products. While the CPSC has taken steps to educate consumers—such as posting safety tips to the Commission’s website and social media page—we believe additional informative measures could be taken to protect Americans from CO poisoning. We also respectfully request that you respond to the following questions:Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We look forward to your response. # # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/following-tragic-death-of-moorhead-family-klobuchar-hoeven-press-for-information-on-efforts-to-protect-americans-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning"

If you're in South Carolina right now and you want to cast a mail-in ballot, and you have COVID or you're in the hospital, you have to get a witness to sign off on your ballot. Or if you're in Georgia and you don't register, you're a new resident there, you moved there from another state, and you're in a big election and you think “I'm going to vote in the final place,” you're no longer allowed to register in the last month as you were in the past during the runoff election. Or, as we saw in the last election in 2020, in Houston, in that county, five million people, there was only one dropoff box in the entire county. Here's a county with five million people, only one dropoff box. There are places in states where you wait in line eight, ten hours in the hot sun just to exercise your right to vote. And that is why, through the year we worked together, Senators – of course Leader Schumer who brought us together – and Senators Manchin, Merkley, Padilla, King, Kaine, Tester, and Warnock, different senators coming from different parts of the country with different political views on certain issues, but we came together and cosponsored this bill which is supported by every member of the Democratic Caucus.I want to thank all of them for their ongoing hard work to get the bill passed and also to thank Senators Schumer, Durbin, Kaine, and Merkley for joining me on the floor today in support of this bill. The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms, which is why we called it the Freedom to Vote Act. It ensures people are part of a franchise and that government is accountable to the people. But today this fundamental right that is the very foundation of our system of government is under attack. Since the 2020 election, we have seen a persistent and coordinated assault on the freedom to vote in states across the country. I just viewed a few examples of the laws that have changed, the attempts that have been made in nearly every state with over 400 bills to change those laws. But then there have been direct threats. Local election officials, many Secretary of State have told me that they're having trouble now recruiting people to run their election day and election month facilities. Why? Because there's threats. There have been polls and studies that have shown that election officials in inordinate numbers are the victims of these threats. One Republican commissioner in Philadelphia, election commissioner who recently left his job, they actually put his family's names –  young kids' names, a picture of his house, his address – on the internet so that people could target his very family. The e-mails, the voice messages left, the one left for Katie Hobbs, the Secretary of State of Arizona: “We will hunt you down, Katie. We'll hunt you down.” These attacks on our local election officials and also members of Congress of both parties are record number, 9,600 in the last year, which is double or triple what it has ever been. You cannot look at the incidents of January 6th, on that insurrection, on its own. These threats of violence have continued into the year, and why is that? Well, we know there is this enormous lack of trust right now in the election system. We know that people have wrongly been told, have been given misinformation, have been motivated, as we saw as those people marched on the mall on January 6th, to believe that somehow our democracy and our voting system is a fraud. Now we know that's not right because we hear it from Republican and Democratic local officials all the time. President Trump's own Homeland Security election head, after the last election said it was the most secure in the history of America. That was President Trump's appointee. Former Attorney General Barr made it very clear that there was not widespread fraud in the last election of any kind, but yet this lie continues, and people sadly continue to believe it.And what is the most sad is that elected leaders in states, a number of states -- not just one or two -- multiple states are passing laws with the false tenet of fraud and literally taking away people's right to vote, kicking them off of voting rolls. People who for years have gone to one polling location who now can't figure out where they're supposed to vote. People in Georgia who suddenly have been told after the last election did it differently, that they have to write their birthday on the outside of an envelope. Anyone that's asked to write a date on an envelope for a ballot, one would assume it's the date that you are putting your ballot in the mail. But, no, it's your birthday. That's the kind of thing we're seeing across the country. As one court in North Carolina once said about previous efforts to suppress the law, it is discrimination with “surgical precision,” state by state by state. These attacks on our democracy demand a federal response. Just as we saw in the 1960s with civil rights legislation, at some point the federal government had to step in. And in fact, our own Founding Fathers actually anticipated that this might be necessary, because right in the Constitution it says that Congress can “make or alter the laws regarding federal elections,” as clear as can be. “Make or alter the laws regarding federal elections.” So what we're talking about here, with some minimum standards in place for how you do early voting, for the fact that you can register, for the fact that you can have drop off boxes: “make or alter the rules for federal elections.” When you have states, certain states, messing around to the extent that they are with the clear intent that they have, this is the moment that we look to the Constitution for guidance, and it is right there.And this is why the need for action could not be more serious. And this is why, as Leader Schumer has announced, we will be moving to advance the Freedom to Vote Act next week. With state legislatures beginning to convene for their 2022 legislative sessions this week, with plans to pass more bills that will restrict voting, and with primaries for the 2022 election just around the corner, we cannot wait another moment. Yesterday we gathered in this chamber to mark one year since the violent mob of insurrectionists stormed into this Capitol. I can see everything like it was in technicolor. When we came back into this chamber. The desks, everyone looking in their desks to see if anything had been taken. The videos we saw which only a few hours before people had invaded this chamber, and the walk that Senator Blunt and the Vice President and I took through the broken glass, spray painted statue with the young staff members with the mahogany boxes containing the last of the electoral ballots. And as I said two weeks later at the inauguration, “This is the moment when our democracy brushes itself off, stands straight, moves forward, one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty, and justice for all.”You just said that pledge, Mr. President, in this very chamber. The pages said that pledge in this very chamber. To me, those are not just empty words. They are a pledge that we must keep. Election officials, as I note, across the country have been targeted by an overwhelming increase in the number of threats. We cannot keep that pledge for liberty and justice for all in a democracy if we can't have fair elections and literally people who are just doing their jobs, whether in this building or out in Mississippi, or out in Pennsylvania, or in Arizona, get threatened just for counting votes. We actually even heard from the Republican Kentucky Secretary of State recently in a hearing that Senator Blunt and I had about how difficult it is to fill those jobs. So in light of all of this, let's talk some basics about what the Freedom to Vote Act does. It strengthens protections for federal workers by making it a federal crime to intimidate election workers. It protects election officials from improper removal by partisan actors. It puts a standard in place so you can't just throw them out because you don't like what the results were, what the votes were that they counted. It establishes a statutory right to vote to have their votes counted. And it protects against sham audits like the one we saw in Arizona and the ones being advanced in Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and Pennsylvania. It's worth noting that even though these so-called audits aren't using reliable methods, in Arizona the sham audit actually found President Biden had a larger margin of victory and the first round in Texas found nothing that could have changed the outcome in the election.A few weeks ago we gathered for the funeral for a great man who served many years in this chamber, Senator Dole. And President Biden reminded us of something he had once said when the debates in this chamber – when there were actual debates – were raging about civil rights legislation. And Bob Dole said this: “No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens.”No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens. We are a first class democracy. And yet, as I note, 19 states have passed 34 bills that include provisions to restrict voting and state legislatures are looking at even more. The need for federal action is urgent. But as we have seen in states like Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Montana, and Texas, we're up against a coordinated attack aimed at limiting the freedom to vote. Example – I've used a few already, I'm going to keep using them throughout the weeks ahead. The new law in Georgia shortens runoffs by five weeks and prevents new voters from registering to vote during runoff elections. In Iowa, a new law cut the days of early voting by nine days and closes the polls an hour early. That was after the state, in the words of its own Republican Secretary of State, shattered its voter turnout record last year. If that shattered the voter turnout record, to have an hour extra, why then take the hour away? A new law in Montana says you can no longer register to vote on Election Day. Yet, that same-day registration – I know because my state is proud of our same-day registration, we have the highest voter turnout nearly every election – 15 years that was in place in Montana. Fifteen years. Don't tell me it was some new thing they weren't used to. Fifteen years. And as part of this coordinated, national attack on voting they took it away.In 2020, the Texas Governor limited counties, including Harris County, which has as many people as nearly my entire state, to that one ballot dropoff box. We cannot hold free and fair elections with laws and procedures like these. And yes, there is the issue, the horrendous issue, of messing around with how the votes are counted, getting rid of the nonpartisan boards, and allowing partisan legislatures to count, and sham audits. All of that is covered by our bill, and it is a big problem. But if you rig the elections before the votes are even counted by making  it impossible for certain people to vote, in the words of our great colleague, Reverend Warnock, “some people don't want some people to vote,” does it even matter if you count them if they're not allowed to vote in the first place? That's why Americans need the Freedom to Vote Act, which builds on the framework put forward by my colleague and former West Virginia Secretary of State, Senator Manchin, last summer. As I note, it reflected the work, hard work, of many, many senators, including ones in this room today, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley; Senator from Virginia, Senator Kaine. We can't just sit back and allow for five weeks to be cut from the Georgia runoff period, during which over 1.3 million people voted in 2021. Or allow for beam to be prevented from registering to vote for runoff elections when nearly 70,000 Georgians registered to vote during that time. Protecting elections against subversion also won't bring back same-day registration on election day in Montana, unless we do the work from the beginning, on which nearly 8,200 Montanans use in 2020 to register or update their registration. That's a lot of people in Montana. It won't ensure that over 60 million registered voters in Texas have access to drop boxes. It's simply not enough to just focus on counting the votes if you want to protect things that matter to people.The best of the best is what the American people want. They want to be able to vote in the safest way possible that works for them. One poll found that 78 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of Republicans, this is from April, 2021 Pew, support making early in-person voting available for at least two weeks before election day. That's exactly what this bill does. Sixty-eight percent of Americans, including 59 percent of Republicans, support making election day a national holiday. Pew poll, April 2021. That's what this bill does. Sixty-one percent of Americans support automatic voter registration, Pew, April 2021. That's what this bill does. Where if you go in to get your driver license, huh? Why would you have to then give the state, when the state has all of your information, would you have to go in and register again? While Senate Republicans claim that this bill is unpopular, there are people in their own party, time and time again, who have supported these provisions. How about, for instance, Utah, where nearly the entire state is mail-in balloting? But yet in other states, like I mentioned in South Carolina, you can't cast your mail-in ballot without getting a witness signature? That's why the Constitution says that for federal elections, that Congress can make or alter the rules regarding federal elections. For decades we know voting rights has been a bipartisan issue. In 2006, the Voting Rights Act – I know Senator Durbin, the author of this bill, who has worked so hard on this – was reauthorized, the Voting Rights Act, was reauthorized by a vote of 98-0. But right now, when we look at changes to the Voting Rights Act in response to a court case out of the Supreme Court – it's so necessary to update that bill right now – only one Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, voted to even advance that bill to allow for debate. Only one was willing to debate it. Let's be clear -- when Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution empowers Congress to make our alter rules for federal elections at any time, at any time, I believe it's in there for a reason. I don't think they just put that in there for, oh, let's throw this in, you know, very few words of a Constitution for the greatest democracy the world has ever known. No. It was in there for a reason. This is the reason. We get to one more thing, then I'll turn it over to my colleagues, and that is the need to look at the Senate rules for voting. So, I would argue that maybe the people in this country, the hundreds of millions of the people of this country, that their voting rules might be just a little, tiny bit more important than our voting rules in this chamber. But nevertheless, acknowledging that, our voting rules have changed many, many times. Since the beginning of the Senate, the rules governing debate have changed multiple times. Throughout history there have been over 160 exceptions to the 60-vote cloture, including nominees, reconciliation, disapproval of arms sales, even the number of votes needed to end debate has changed. I am very interested in making this place work. I don't think people would spend all this time getting elected just to come here and stop bills from happening, and then go home. But that's pretty much what's going on right now in this chamber. I look at those pages. I think about how they came here to watch these grand debates and we’re supposed to be the greatest deliberative body of all time. Instead, we basically have an empty room. This is the moment to protect voting rights, and yes, we acknowledge to do it, because sadly we don't have the bipartisan support we've had in the past for voting rights and for protecting people's rights. We have to do it this way. And there is nothing magical about the rules as they are now. If there were, there wouldn't be 160 exceptions, and they wouldn't have been changed multiple times. I'll end with this: protecting the freedom to vote has never been easy. Throughout our country's 245-year history we've had to course correct to ensure that our democracy, for the people, by the people, always lived up to our ideals. Last year, when speaking in Philadelphia, President Biden called the fight to protect voting rights “the test of our time.” We owe it to ourselves and future generations of Americans to ensure that our democracy is protected. With that, I thank you, Mr. President, and I turn it over to my colleagues. Thank you. I yield the floor.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/video-on-senate-floor-klobuchar-calls-for-immediate-action-to-protect-our-democracy"

It is a precious, precious thing.”WATCH KLOBUCHAR FLOOR SPEECHWASHINGTON – Today on the Senate Floor, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, honored the law enforcement officers and support staff who responded to the January 6th insurrection one year ago and called for urgent action to strengthen our democracy.“It is on us, when we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, no matter what party we're in, to hold our democracy dear. It is a precious, precious thing, and it is very fragile, and it is in our hands to protect, just as our police officers protected it on January 6th.”Klobuchar and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Mark Warner (D-VA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a series of floor speeches today.As the lead Democrat on the Rules Committee, which has oversight of federal elections, Klobuchar was one of two Senators receiving each state’s electoral votes during the Joint Session of Congress on the day of the attack. Over the last year, she has introduced legislation, which has become law, and held oversight hearings on improvements to Capitol Police policies and procedures to protect the Capitol. She and Rules Committee Ranking Member Roy Blunt (R-MO) partnered with leaders of the Homeland Security Committee to investigate and issue a bipartisan report with findings and recommendations on the security, preparedness, and response failures exposed during the insurrection. Klobuchar also led bipartisan legislation in the Senate to honor the law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol with the Congressional Gold Medal. This legislation unanimously passed Congress and was signed by the President in August.The full transcript of Senator Klobuchar’s opening remarks as given are available below and high-resolution video is available for TV download HERE and for online viewing HERE.Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator Schumer, for your leadership and your work and your words today. As I stand here, I look at the faces of the staff, I remember the moment when we were pushed out of this chamber for security reasons. I remember the words of one staff member who yelled out, “Take the boxes. Take the boxes.” She was talking about the mahogany boxes that were filled with the electoral ballots, because we knew they would be destroyed if they were left behind.I remember my own staff, one of them is here today, hearing their stories of being in a closet, hiding in a closet with only forks that happened to be next door, to protect themselves, right next to the doors where the insurrectionists had invaded. I remember the staff throughout this building that were marooned in places, and the faces of the police officers, the cuts on their faces, the anguish and the words of Officer Dunn, who said at the end of the day that he had been called the ""N-word” multiple times, and that he looked at his friend as they collapsed in the rotunda and said, “Is this America? Is this America?” The haunting words of the police officer on the police radio that was heard broadcast in the middle of the whole thing – “Is there a plan? Is there a plan?”There were many breakdowns that day, but the biggest breakdown was the breakdown of our democracy, that some people actually felt that they could take the law into their own hands, that they could invade, not just a building but our very republic. I look back at the words and the speeches that people gave that day, not only after the insurrection, but what was telling was what they said before it started. And I think I would urge people to look at those speeches, that discussion that we were having about this had been raging for weeks and for months. I remember standing at this very place, right before we closed down the Senate, because of the insurrection, and going through the facts, going through the facts about how President-elect Biden, at the time, had won more votes than any president in history. The facts that ten living Defense Secretaries had actually stood up at the time, including both of Donald Trump's Defense Secretaries, including people like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and William Cohen, and came together and said that the scurrilous attacks on our democracy must stop, and we must allow for the peaceful transition of power.And then I looked at the very end of my remarks, and I ended with this, right before we were invaded – I said this: my friend Roy Blunt – who I still have immense respect for, for what he did that evening – my friend Roy Blunt, my fellow Rules Committee leader, many years ago found a statue, a bust of a man at the top of a bookcase. He did research. He went to the historians. And all he could find out was that no one knew who this guy was, except that he was a cleric, hence the statue is called “The Unknown Cleric.” Now, at the time the leaders in this great place thought this man important enough that they would warrant a statue for him. But today, no one knows who he is. Senator Blunt's message to school kids and senators alike that visit his office when he shows them this statue: what we do here is more important than who we are. And I ended with this: “Senators, what matters is not our futures, not our short-term destinies. What matters is our democracy's destiny, because I think many of us know that people will not know who we are 100 years from now, or 200 years from now, but what they will know is this: they will know what we did today, how we voted today, and that is more important than who we are. As someone once said, ‘It's a republic if we can keep it.’”It's a republic if we can keep it. Those words ring more true now than they did a year ago. Because, as we know, the haunting shrieks of the police that day, the officer pinned between the doors at the hand of rioters, there were people that stood up for our republic and there were people that attacked our republic. I remember Captain Carneysha Mendoza, 19-year veteran of the Capitol Police, who testified before the Rules Committee, she suffered chemical burns to her face while commanding the officers in the rotunda while they struggled to hold the doors open. Or who can forget Officer Eugene Goodman, who after saving Senator Romney from walking directly into the mob, ran by himself to take on a group of rioters with his baton and then diverted that mob away from the Senate chamber, allowing us to safely depart.Mr. President, who can forget the image right there, where you sit on that dais, of the insurrectionists rifling through papers on people's desks, opening up their offices and desks? Tragically, five officers who reported for duty have since passed away. Five officers. You wonder why you see sad faces today on many people in this building who were their friends. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died the day after the attack. Four other officers died in the days and months that followed. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood, D.C. Metropolitan Police Officers Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida, and Kyle DeFreytag. Many more suffered physical injuries, and even more sustained emotional trauma from the events of that day. And we also remember, of course, Officer Billy Evans, who tragically died doing his job at his post in April. Recognizing the sacrifice of those heroes to defend our democracy is the least we can do. Senator Blunt and I led legislation in support of our leaders honoring those who protected the Capitol on January 6th with the Congressional Gold Medal. It was an honor to stand with officers and their families in August as President Biden signed this bill into law. We have made many, many improvements to the security of the Capitol. I think it's very important for staff and officers alike and those who work there to know that. I want to thank Senator Schumer for his work in installing a new Sergeant at Arms, Karen Gibson, for the Senate. We have General Walker over in the House. And we have a new Police Chief, Chief Manger, who did an excellent job yesterday in describing the changes. We know there are many challenges ahead. Last but not least is that we do not have enough police officers right now to fill vacancies. So people are working double-shifts or working vacations. They're canceling vacations. We have over 400 openings, an experience that many police departments throughout the country have right now, but one that is very important and the Chief has committed to fill those vacancies.What have we done, the progress? Well, we have, one, gotten new personnel in. Two, we have passed a law in this chamber and signed into law by President Biden that makes it easier for the Chief to call in the National Guard in case of emergency. We have made sure that there's operational plans in place, as there were this summer, when major events occur. One of the saddest memories of that day was the fact that 75% of the police officers asked to defend this Capitol were in plain clothes. 75%. In many cases, they had less protective gear on than the invaders of the Capitol. That has changed. No more equipment that's going to be locked on a bus that they can't access. Senator Leahy's leadership with Appropriations, Senator Shelby's leadership, we've been able to obtain more funding to get them the equipment that they need. All of those things are important. But as Senator Schumer noted, the other piece of this is our democracy itself. And that means getting to the bottom of what happened, something that's happening right now with the House Select Committee that is working to get the facts. We would have loved to have an independent commission like the 9/11 Commission to do that, but they are doing that work over in the House. Yesterday, we heard from Attorney General Garland, who pledged to look at this at every level and to go where the facts will lead. Those were his words. Accountability at every level for what happened here is key, and it is the largest investigation we've seen in the history of America, over 700 people that have been charged. That is a big piece of this work as well, accountability.And as Senator Schumer noted, this is also about carrying on the torch of our democracy. The voting rights legislation that we are working on right now couldn't be more important, because what was not accomplished with bear spray and bayonets has now been passed on to others to pass bills, as we've seen in Wisconsin, where a bill actually passed that would have allowed for only one ballot dropoff box in the entire city of Milwaukee. That one was vetoed by Governor Evers. Others passed in states like Georgia, in states like Texas, and across this country a concerted effort to undermine our democracy.So, it is on us, when we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, no matter what party we're in, to hold our democracy dear. It is a precious, precious thing, and it is very fragile, and it is in our hands to protect, just as our police officers protected it on January 6th. When you've got 9,600 threats against members of Congress, double what it has ever been in the past, that's not a small thing. That is January 6th continued. When you have election officials that have to leave their posts because, in the words of the election official from the city of Philadelphia, that his own family was threatened, their names, their addresses, their house put out on the internet. Katie Hobbs, Secretary of State in Arizona, receiving a voicemail saying, “I'm a hunter, and I think you should be hunted.” People in rural areas, elected officials that cannot have the security that people may have in this building. That's January 6th continued. And we cannot forget our duty going forward. I will end with that image that I will always cherish and the hope that democracy will prevail at 3:30 in the morning, when Senator Blunt and I and Vice President Pence took that long walk over to the House with the two young women with the mahogany box filled with the last of the electoral ballots, up through Wyoming. There was broken glass on all sides. There was spray paint on statues. It was the same walk we had taken in the morning, which had been so joyful, the celebration of our democracy. So ceremonial. And there we were, the last ones left, taking that walk into the House Chambers where we finished our job. So when I look back at that day, that is the lasting image, that in the end democracy prevailed, that two weeks later there we were, under that beautiful blue sky with leaders of both parties on that inaugural stage, saying that, yes, our democracy stood tall. It brushed itself off and we moved forward as one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all, as we always do. And that is the spirit with which we must go forward in the coming weeks, as we debate the importance and the importance of keeping that democracy strong with election laws, that we continue to improve the security in this Capitol, and that we hold the people that did this not just to us, not just to this building, but to our very republic accountable for what they did. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/video-from-the-senate-floor-klobuchar-honors-law-enforcement-who-defended-the-capitol-on-january-6th-calls-for-continued-action-to-strengthen-our-democracy"

I call to order this hearing, which is the Rules Committee’s third oversight hearing of the United States Capitol Police – and the fifth Rules Committee hearing addressing the issues following the January 6th attack on the Capitol. I would like to thank my friend Ranking Member Blunt and our colleagues for being here today. Thank you, Senator Leahy, for being here today, he played a major leadership role with your Appropriations Committee in getting the emergency supplemental funding that we needed after January 6th.I especially want to thank our witness – Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger – who joined the Department nearly six months ago after a lifetime in law enforcement and is appearing before our Committee today for the first time. And we all of course are grateful to the men and women of the Capitol Police for the work that they do every single day. Tomorrow marks one year since a violent mob staged an insurrection in an attempt to disrupt the peaceful transition of power while Congress was gathered to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. That mob desecrated our Capitol – the temple of our democracy – and delayed the counting of the electoral votes. But thanks to the heroism of the people that work with you, Chief, thanks to our brave law enforcement officers, we were able to return and finish our work.I will never forget walking down to the House Chamber from the Senate floor with my friend Senator Blunt and Vice President Pence. It was 3:30 a.m. – 3:30 a.m. – and we walked through that hallway, broken glass on the sides, spray paint on the statues. Remembering that just that day, earlier, we had done this joyful walk for what is every four years the peaceful transition to power, no matter who wins, Democrat or Republican. And there we were, alone in that hallway, with two young women holding the mahogany box that had the last remaining electoral ballots up to the state of Wyoming. And while it was a sorrowful day, and you lost officers, and we had so many people injured, I had this moment of thinking while we walked down that hallway, “in the end, because of the bravery of your officers, democracy prevailed.”Many of us remember the insurrection for what it was, as an attack on our democracy. But it was also, as we’ll talk about today, a brutal and prolonged physical attack for the law enforcement officers who risked their lives to defend the Capitol that day.Tragically five officers who reported for duty have since passed away, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died the day after the attack. Four other officers died in the days and months that followed: Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood, D.C. Metropolitan Police Officers Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida, and Kyle DeFreytag. And of course, we all remember Billy Evans who died in an incident unrelated to this attack.Many more suffered physical injuries, and even more sustained emotional trauma from the events of that day.We owe it to the Capitol Police officers who defend the Capitol every day to make sure that they have the resources and support they need to do their jobs. That is why – in the immediate aftermath of the attack – this Committee convened a series of hearings, Senator Blunt and I, on a bipartisan basis, with every single member of this Committee involved, Democrat and Republican, joined forces with the Homeland Security Committee, and held these hearings. Out of that, came a bipartisan report that Senator Blunt and Senator Peters and Portman and I authored, with findings and 20 recommendations for agencies across the federal government to be implemented without delay.As we approach this solemn anniversary, today we will hear – I know because I’ve read your testimony – that significant progress has been made to implement the recommendations that pertain to the Capitol Police. And I thank you and all your officers for that. The changes made since January 6th, of course, started at the top. We said the Capitol Police Board must appoint a new Police Chief, and they selected you in July. We also have two new Sergeants at Arms. In the Senate, Leader Schumer appointed General Karen Gibson, who just finished a term as Board Chair – and who has worked to put recommendations in place. In the House, Speaker Pelosi appointed General William Walker, who led the D.C. National Guard on January 6th and, in fact, has testified before this Committee in that role. As I note, on January 6th, we saw 75 percent of officers on duty forced to defend the Capitol in their regular uniforms, in plain clothes – in some cases they had less protective gear than the insurrectionists themselves. That’s why we recommended that the Capitol Police have enough officers with appropriate training and equipment–and in July, as I note, President Biden signed emergency funding legislation led in the Senate by Chairman Leahy to deliver resources to do exactly that. We also saw the former Police Chief, that day, delayed for over an hour trying to get approval to call in the National Guard – in an absurd situation, he was trying to reach the Sergeant at Arms in order to follow the law, who in fact were trying to defend their own chambers at a time when shots had been fired and people had been killed. Senator Blunt and I introduced a bill, along with a number of other members of this Committee, including Senators King, Wicker, Feinstein, Capito, Merkley, Padilla, and Warner, and it was signed into law this month to make it easier for you, Chief, to call in the National Guard if ever such an emergency situation would arise again. We will never forget, also, the haunting words of an officer desperately calling out over the radio that day in the middle of the insurrection: “Does anyone have a plan?” “Does anyone have a plan?” The answer, sadly, that day was “no.” So we recommended the Capitol Police produce a Department- wide operational plan for all large-scale events at the Capitol – and that is now standard procedure. “No” will never be the answer again. We also heard how officers on the frontlines were left without critical information. We said the Department needed to take significant action to improve its handling of intelligence, and it has worked to ensure information is shared with rank-and-file officers. So while there is so much to do – including, as we know, hiring multiple additional officers, and I’m sure you’ll be asked about that today, as well as making sure the Department is equipped to respond to the dramatic increase in threats against Members of Congress, which have now exceeded by your reports over 9000 in the last year. More than we have ever seen double, triple what we have seen, completely related to what we saw on January 6th. And that, of course, is a challenge for your department to respond to.  To close I will note that while today we will discuss the steps that have been taken and the work that lies ahead to ensure the security of our nation’s Capitol, there must also be more done to safeguard the future of our very democracy. I continue to support the work of the House Select Committee to bring the underlying causes of the insurrection to light to hold people accountable for what happened. And it is crucial as ever, in addition to that, that we pass legislation to protect the freedom to vote in the Senate.Because at this moment, we are dealing with a slew of laws that have either been introduced or passed around the country, major overhauls to legislation, that make it harder for people to vote. It is as if what wasn’t accomplished with bear spray and bayonets is now attempting to be accomplished through laws that limit voting on weekends. Laws that limit ballot  dropboxes to one in a major city. Laws that literally disband nonpartisan voting boards to be replaced by partisan counting of the votes. That is what we’re seeing across the country right now. It is not the subject of this hearing, but it is clearly related to what happened on January 6th.With that, we look forward to hearing from you, Chief Manger, about the progress you have made and the work still to be done. Now I’ll turn it over to my good friend Senator Roy Blunt. And I thank him again, on a bipartisan basis, for working through, and this entire Committee, what we needed to do to make the security recommendations for changes, the funding for changes, the legal provisions for changes, as well as the respect and dignity that your officers deserved and deserve every day. Thank you Senator Blunt.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/video-at-hearing-with-capitol-police-chief-thomas-manger-chairwoman-klobuchar-highlights-capitol-security-improvements-since-1-6-insurrection"

Klobuchar was joined by representatives from the American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region and Memorial Blood Centers in the Twin Cities, Rochester, Duluth, and Fargo.“Hospitals rely on community donations for their blood supply, but right now Minnesota’s blood bank donations are at a 10-year low,” said Klobuchar. “The good news is that we can help solve this problem by donating blood and encouraging our loved ones to do the same. By coming together to tackle this blood shortage, we can make sure that our state’s medical professionals are able to continue their lifesaving work.”January is National Blood Donor Month, marking a time of year when blood donations tend to drop off despite need remaining high. Minnesota’s blood banks report that donations have dropped 10% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and the cold weather, busy schedules, and rise in coronavirus cases are making it difficult to regain the supply that’s been lost over the past two years. In some cases, hospital blood inventories have been reduced by 20%. One blood donation can save up to three lives.Roundtable participants included Tonia Teasley, CEO, American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region; Dr. Jed Gorlin, Medical Director and Vice President, Medical and Quality Affairs, Memorial Blood Centers; and Dr. Nancy Van Buren, Medical Director, Memorial Blood Centers; Dr. David Hamlar, Board Chair, American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region – Twin Cities Chapter; Melanie Tschida, Executive Director, American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region – Southeast Chapter in Rochester; Dan Williams, Executive Director, American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region – Northern Minnesota Chapter in Duluth; Kevin Mehrer, Executive Director, American Red Cross of Minnesota and Dakotas Region – Eastern North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota Chapter in Fargo; Angela Engblom, Northland Component Services Manager for Memorial Blood Centers in Duluth; and Wendy Capetz, Director of Marketing and Development for Memorial Blood Centers.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/1/klobuchar-holds-virtual-roundtable-on-urgent-need-to-alleviate-blood-supply-shortage-across-minnesota"

As you know, additional funding was added to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act. However, the previous administration argued that congressional intent was not clear with regard to support for biofuels and did not use its discretionary authority to assist biofuels producers through available CCC funding,” the senators wrote.“As the Department prepares a proposal for providing assistance to the agriculture industry using CCC and other resources, we ask that you use this explicit authority to aid the nation’s biofuels industry… We have been encouraged by your recent statements at your confirmation hearing that you will fully utilize USDA resources to get biofuel producers back on track and will aid the Biden Administration in restoring the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” the senators concluded.This letter is also signed by Sens. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), John Thune (R-SD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Mike Braun (R-IN).Full text of the letter can be found HERE and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack,Congratulations on your recent confirmation to serve as United States Secretary of Agriculture. We wish you success in your mission, which is so important to America’s farmers, and we lookforward to working with you to find solutions to the many challenges facing American agriculture.We have been advocating for targeted relief for the biofuels industry since last spring when we were first made aware of the demand collapse for ethanol and other renewable fuels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As you know, additional funding was added to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stabilization (CARES) Act. However, the previous administration argued that congressional intent was not clear with regard to support for biofuels and did not use its discretionary authority to assist biofuels producers through available CCC funding.As a result, we worked to ensure specific language was included in December’s COVID relief bill that explicitly clarifies that USDA may provide direct payments to biofuels producers hard hit by the pandemic. Providing aid to the ethanol industry would provide much-needed financial assistance for these key agriculture processors and help keep these critical markets open to farmers. It is for these reasons that we are supportive of the proposals the biofuels industry and key agricultural organizations have put forward to stabilize the market from last year’s macroeconomic shock.As the Department prepares a proposal for providing assistance to the agriculture industry using CCC and other resources, we ask that you use this explicit authority to aid the nation’s biofuels industry. Keeping biofuels plants open is vital to the states we represent. We have been encouraged by your recent statements at your confirmation hearing that you will fully utilize USDA resources to get biofuel producers back on track and will aid the Biden Administration in restoring the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard.Thank you for considering our request and for your dedication to rural America.

K. Butterfield (D-NC), leaders of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to enact policy reforms at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accelerate the development of therapies for rare diseases and disorders.The Speeding Therapy Access Today (STAT) Act will improve access to therapies for the rare disease community, including patients living with an ultra-rare disease, by promoting coordination within the government to advance science-based policies and ensure the intended patient populations ultimately receive access to approved therapies. “30 million Americans are impacted by one of 7,000 known rare diseases, but nearly 93 percent of these known rare diseases have no FDA-approved treatment,” Klobuchar said. “It is critical that we pass this legislation to increase the number of safe, effective, and affordable treatments available for people suffering from diseases. As the co-chair of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, I’ll keep working to prioritize the needs of rare disease patients and their loved ones.”“Millions of Americans are living with one or more rare disease, the majority of which do not have FDA approved treatments,” Wicker said. “Creating a Rare Disease Center of Excellence would accelerate the development of therapies for rare diseases and disorders at the FDA while putting patient input first. This would be an important step forward as we work to find cures for all diseases.”“For me, this work is very personal because I have close family members and friends who suffer with rare diseases. The lack of available treatments and therapies for rare disease patients is a common problem,” Bilirakis said. “The targeted FDA reforms contained in this legislation will have a meaningful impact on the acceleration of treatment development and will provide hope to the millions of patients and families who are coping with a rare disease.”“There are over 7,000 known rare diseases and no more than 5% have FDA-approved therapy. Millions of Americans are suffering avoidable delays and barriers to new therapies due to overly complex regulatory processes that can take over a decade to develop. Patients in the rare disease community are in desperate need of options and cannot wait,” Butterfield said. “I’m proud to join my co-chairs of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus in introducing the Speeding Therapy Access Today (or STAT) Act to accelerate development and access to potentially life-saving rare disease therapies.”“On behalf of the more than 30 million Americans living with a rare disease, the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases enthusiastically endorses the STAT Act and stands ready to help advance this impactful legislation,” said Julia Jenkins, EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases Executive Director. “As co-chairs of the Rare Disease Caucus, and now as co-leads of the STAT Act, Senators Klobuchar and Wicker and Representatives Bilirakis and Butterfield have been unwavering champions for the rare disease community.

The Report and Educate About Campus Hazing (REACH) Act would require hazing incidents to be reported as part of a college’s annual crime report and establish a definition of hazing to clarify what constitutes a reportable offense. The legislation would also require institutions to establish a campus-wide, research-based program to educate students about the dangers of hazing. Since 2000, there have been more than 50 hazing-related deaths on America’s college campuses.Companion legislation is led in the House of Representatives by Representatives Lucy McBath (D-GA) and Alan Lowenthal (D-CA). “Hazing is a dangerous—and at times deadly—problem on college campuses, and we must work to end it,” said Klobuchar. “This legislation will require colleges and universities to include hazing as part of their annual crime reports, giving us a comprehensive and accurate understanding of hazing so we can create effective measures to address it.”“Education and accountability are required to end hazing. The REACH act does,"" said Cassidy. ""This keeps students safer which increases parents peace of mind.”“We have a collective responsibility to protect and support Ohio students – that means addressing the hazing that pervades college campuses,” said Brown. “Hazing should never be taken lightly and cannot be tolerated. By helping to lay the groundwork for students and educators to identify and report hazing, we can provide important tools to prevent this abuse in the first place.”“Every year, hundreds of students are hurt or killed by hazing on college campuses, yet information and data of these acts often goes unreported,” said Casey. “The Report and Educate About Campus Hazing (REACH) Act would ensure hazing is appropriately reported as crimes and that students are educated on the dangers of hazing. I also want to express my sincere condolences to the Piazza and Braham families—who lost their college-age children to hazing—and thank them for their tireless advocacy to stop hazing and prevent other families from losing their loved ones to these horrific acts.”“The impacts of hazing on young people across our country are heartbreaking and unacceptable, and we have a duty to ensure that schools are a safe environment for our students,” said McBath. “By setting national standards for anti-hazing programs, we can protect the health and safety of our students and ensure they learn and live in a positive, secure environment.”“As a father, grandfather, and former professor, the wellbeing of students has always one of my top priorities. I am proud to work with Congresswoman McBath and Senator Klobuchar on this important legislation. The REACH Act would most importantly add hazing to the list of campus offenses that are disclosed in a higher education institution’s Annual Security Report. Hazing is a serious crime, and full transparency of these incidences should be made available to parents and students. The Clery Act currently does not list hazing as a reportable offense, but the REACH Act would close this loophole. My heart goes out to the families that have suffered from incidences of hazing. It is time that we take this important step to protect our students,” said Lowenthal.“Federal legislation to address hazing is long overdue, and while we wait, lives continue to be lost. The REACH Act will help institutionalize hazing prevention and will standardize how hazing is defined, tracked, and responded to across colleges and universities,” said Jessica Mertz, Executive Director of the Clery Center.“Passage of the REACH Act will help campus leaders send a strong and clear message that student health, safety, and well-being are vital to achieving the goals of postsecondary education,” said Dr. Elizabeth Allan, Professor of Higher Education at the University of Maine, Principal of StopHazing, and Director of the Hazing Prevention Consortium.“On March 30, 2007 (almost exactly 14 years ago) our oldest son Gary DeVercelly, Jr. died from a fraternity hazing ritual during Big/Little night at the age of 18. Since his death, the number of identified hazing deaths has escalated at an alarming rate. This year alone we have seen three hazing deaths in the span of one week. We see the reintroduction of the REACH Act as a giant step forward in our battle to eradicate hazing. By requiring accountability, transparency, and education this bill will transform the hazing culture. We know the REACH Act will save lives and make campuses safer.

The introduction comes as lawmakers in 43 states  push to restrict Americans’ access to the ballot box—with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. According to a recent report from the Brennan Center, at least 253 bills to restrict voting have been introduced around the country.The landmark legislation—companion legislation to H.R. 1, which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 3—aims to restore the promise of American democracy by guaranteeing every American citizen full access to the ballot by addressing voter intimidation and suppression, which are among the biggest examples of systemic racism in America; ending the corrupting power of dark money in our campaigns; and putting an end to gerrymandering. In addition, it strengthens ethics laws to ensure that public servants work for the public interest.“At a time when the right to vote is under attack and special interests and dark money are drowning out the voices of the American people, we need to take bold action,” said Klobuchar. “The For the People Act is essential to protecting every American’s right to vote, getting dark money out of our elections, and making sweeping anti-corruption reforms. Many of the provisions in this bill have already been adopted across the country in red, blue, and purple states and they have the support of Republican and Democratic governors and election officials. Next week I will hold a hearing on this bill in the Rules Committee, followed soon after with a mark-up so we can send it to the Senate floor for a vote, because making our Democracy work for every American is a top priority.”“Every American—regardless of the color of their skin, where they live, or how much money they have—deserves a seat at the table and an equal voice in their government,” said Merkley. “That’s the only way we can realize our founders’ ‘We the People’ vision. We must tackle every obstacle, from partisan gerrymandering, to massive sums of dark money, to voter suppression, that are keeping us from fully realizing the promise of an equal and just America. If you really believe in the vision of our republic, you believe in voter empowerment and not voter suppression.”“As Senate Majority Leader, one of the first things that I did was designate the For The People Act as S.1, the first legislative bill from the Senate Democrats,” said Schumer. “In doing so, Senate Democrats made clear we are committed to standing up to the voter suppression efforts that are threatening the core tenets of our democracy, to ending dark money in politics, and to ensuring public officials work for those they represent and not the special interests. As this legislation moves through the Senate, every member of this body will have an opportunity to stand up and say if they support a government by the people and for the people.”Full text of the legislation is available here.

In 2016, Minnesota was one of the first states to apply for a Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver to establish a reinsurance program to ensure more Minnesotans have access to affordable, quality health care. However, the waiver request was only partially approved.The letter notes that CMS’s decision to partially approve the waiver application in 2017 has caused the state to receive significantly less annual federal funding than expected for the state’s BHP, leading the state to lose over $49 million in federal funding between 2018 and 2020 according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services.The letter also stresses Minnesota’s standing as a national leader in health care and medical innovation as one of only two states with an established BHP. MinnesotaCare served approximately 75,000 Minnesotans in 2019 and “is a vital source of health coverage for people who may not otherwise have access to health insurance,” the legislators wrote in the letter.The legislators continued: “We know that access to quality health care is more important than ever in light of the coronavirus pandemic—which has infected hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans and disrupted access to employer-based health coverage. On behalf of our constituents, we urge you to consider the state of Minnesota’s request to reassess the decision made in 2017 regarding partial denial of its waiver application as soon as possible.”Full text of the letter can be found HERE and below:Dear Acting Administrator Richter,We write to respectfully request your consideration of Minnesota’s recent request to review the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) September 2017 decision to partially deny the state’s Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver regarding MinnesotaCare, the state’s Basic Health Program (BHP).Minnesota has long been a national leader in healthcare and medical innovation and is one of only two states that has established a BHP. MinnesotaCare served 75,000 Minnesotans on average during 2019 and is a vital source of health coverage for people who may not otherwise have access to health insurance.However, as the February 5 letter from Minnesota Department of Human Services Commissioner Jodi Harpstead and Minnesota Department of Commerce Commissioner Grace Arnold indicates, CMS’ decision to only partially approve the state’s 1332 waiver in 2017 has resulted in Minnesota receiving significantly less annual federal pass-through funding than was previously expected. Between 2018 through 2020, the partial denial of the waiver has cost the state of Minnesota over $49 million in federal funding.We know that access to quality health care is more important than ever in light of the coronavirus pandemic—which has infected hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans and disrupted access to employer-based health coverage.

The Work Opportunities and Resources to Keep Nonprofit Organizations Well (WORK NOW) Act will create a major new grant program to help nonprofit organizations retain their employees, scale their service delivery, and provide unemployed Americans with new jobs serving their communities. Companion legislation is being led in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Linda Sánchez (D-CA).In addition to reintroducing this legislation, the Senators also sent a bicameral letter to congressional leaders calling for nonprofit relief in future aid packages. The letter emphasized the importance of passing the WORK NOW Act and ensuring nonprofits have the resources they need to help people through the pandemic. This letter, led by Klobuchar, was signed by Senators Schatz, Wyden, Brown, Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).""From food banks, to shelters, to counseling centers, charitable organizations are doing incredible work to help people get through this pandemic,” Klobuchar said. “As demand for their services continues to soar, many of these organizations are struggling financially. We need to help charitable nonprofits keep their doors open, scale their invaluable services, and provide opportunities for unemployed Americans to return to work serving their communities.”""Local nonprofits are leading the way as we rebuild our communities and our economy. In Hawai?i, these essential organizations are providing families with hot meals and child care, shelter for those who need it, and help for victims of domestic and sexual violence,"" Schatz said. ""Our bill invests federal dollars into nonprofits so that they have the resources to hire more workers, expand their services, and help more people.""“Nonprofits have been hit with a one-two punch: giving is down, while demand for services is at an all-time high with millions Americans out of work, or working reduced hours, and struggling to put food on the table,” Wyden said. “Our bill would provide critical resources to overwhelmed nonprofits and help connect them with workers who are unemployed. It's critical that organizations like food banks have both the funding and manpower needed to serve their communities.”“During this crisis, non-profits have stepped in to fulfill the needs of our communities,” Brown said. “But like many, they are feeling the financial strain of this pandemic, while the need for their services continues to grow. One of the best things we can do to provide relief for our communities is to help these organizations maintain the workforce needed to continue their services.”“Nonprofit organizations provided some of the most essential services throughout this pandemic. This is especially true for our most vulnerable communities who relied on charitable nonprofit organizations for support in homeless shelters, food banks, and domestic violence shelters,” Sánchez said. “As they handle the increased demand and adhere to social health guidelines, these organization need help expanding services and hiring, training, and retaining employees. The WORK NOW Act will ensure our nonprofit organizations continue to meet the needs of our community and will help get Americans back to work.”In addition to Klobuchar, Schatz, Wyden, and Brown, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Tina Smith (D-MN).The legislation is endorsed by over 100 organizations across the country, including the following groups: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; Boys and Girls Clubs of America; Child Welfare League of America; Girls Inc.; Goodwill Industries; Habitat for Humanity; Independent Sector; Jewish Federations of North America; Lutheran Services in America; March of Dimes; MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership; Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC); National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National Community Action Foundation; National Council of Nonprofits; Legal Services Corporation; Spina Bifida Association; Union of Orthodox Jewish; United Way; YMCA; YWCA USA; After-School All-Stars Hawai'i; Big Brothers Big Sisters Hawai'i; Ceeds of Peace; Hawai'i Alliance of Nonprofit Organizations; Hawai'i Children's Action Network; Maui Economic Opportunity; Parents and Children Together; Aspire Minnesota; Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota; The North Carolina Center for Nonprofits; Momentum Nonprofit Partners; St. David’s Center for Child & Family Development; Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis; and Minnesota Council of Nonprofits.“America’s 1.3 million charitable nonprofits embody the best of America. They feed, heal, shelter, educate, inspire, enlighten, and nurture people across the country. But with even more people relying on them now, nonprofits need help in meeting the enormous demand created by the coronavirus pandemic,” said Tim Delaney, President and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. “The WORK NOW Act is a crucial piece of legislation that will help nonprofits retain and rehire their employees, expand services to meet the skyrocketing human needs, and put unemployed men and women back to work for the common good. This is a well-designed bill to accelerate the economic recovery.”“Since day one of the COVID-19 pandemic, community-serving organizations like Boys & Girls Clubs have played a crucial role in recovery and response,” said Jim Clark, president and CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs of America. “We're thankful for the leadership of Senator Klobuchar through her sponsorship of the WORK NOW Act which would enable Clubs to continue providing critical community support while helping us meet the increased demand and cost for these vital services. Nonprofits support communities in their time of need – it’s time to support them in theirs.”“Senator Klobuchar’s WORK NOW proposal would propel nonprofits forward as they work to support their communities, including through housing, nutrition assistance, mental health and counseling services, child care, and disability assistance,” said Jon Pratt, executive director of Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. “As the far-reaching impact of the pandemic moves into its second year, we continue to see increased demands on nonprofits, as well as epic uncertainty about their future funding.”Full text of the letter can be found HERE and below:Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McConnell, and Minority Leader McCarthy:We write to express our concern about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the charitable nonprofit community and to respectfully request that you include provisions to provide broad relief for nonprofits in subsequent coronavirus relief legislation.Almost a year ago, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis and passed the CARES Act in response to the rapidly worsening coronavirus pandemic. It quickly became clear that the depths of this pandemic would be felt across our entire economy, including the nonprofit sector. In fact, a recent report by the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies estimates nearly 960,000 nonprofit jobs were lost due to the coronavirus pandemic over the past ten months.While nonprofits are on the front lines of this crisis, demand for their services has never been higher. Nonprofit caseloads have exploded during the coronavirus pandemic, with reports highlighting long lines at food banks, overloaded calls for housing assistance, and overwhelmed mental health providers. Unfortunately, charitable giving to smaller nonprofits (which account for 92 percent of nonprofit organizations) declined by over 7 percent last year. With decreased charitable giving and extraordinarily high community needs, nonprofits are being squeezed from all sides.We introduced the WORK NOW Act in May of last year to help nonprofits expand, rather than shrink, the ways in which they are serving their communities. This bill – which was reintroduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives this week – creates a grant program at the Treasury Department to help nonprofit organizations retain employees, scale up operations to meet increased demand, and employ newly unemployed workers. Allocations will be made to states and localities – with all funding channeled directly to eligible nonprofits – and the majority of funds must be used for paying the wages, salaries and benefits of either existing employees or new employees.Since we initially introduced this bill last year, over 500,000 Americans have lost their lives due to the coronavirus and we are still down nearly 10 million jobs. More than ever, nonprofits and the communities they serve need our support and we encourage you to include provisions  – such as the WORK NOW Act – in subsequent coronavirus relief legislation. Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-schatz-wyden-brown-introduce-legislation-call-on-congressional-leaders-to-support-nonprofits"

Clyburn (D-SC), to invest over $94 billion to build high-speed broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved communities to close the digital divide and ensure Americans have internet connectivity to learn and work from home, access telehealth services, and stay connected to loved ones. Klobuchar also highlighted her bipartisan legislation with Senator Cramer, the Keeping Critical Connections Act, to establish a $2 billion fund at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure that students and low-income families have continued access to critical internet connectivity during the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Klobuchar raised the critical need for accurate broadband data as we plan for broadband deployment. Her bipartisan legislation with Ranking Member Wicker and Senators Peters and Thune, the Broadband DATA Act, would help the accuracy of the FCC’s broadband data maps, which was signed into law in March 2020.While questioning expert witnesses, Klobuchar pressed on the need for this funding to bridge the digital divide and support students, low-income families, small businesses, as well as minority and  rural communities nationwide. In response, Dr. Christopher Ali, Associate Professor in the Department of Media Studies at the University of Virginia, noted, “I think all too often we think about the digital divide as being one divide, as a divide between rural America and urban America, but as we’ve learned in the last few years, the real divide is...about race, it’s about income, it is about geography, it’s about affordability, it’s about students, so there are multiple digital divides.”The full transcript of remarks below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Senator Cantwell: Senator Klobuchar, your state has been mentioned, you’ve been mentioned...Senator Klobuchar: Very exciting day for me and it’s St. Patrick’s day so we’re feeling good.Senator Cantwell: Good. Well.Senator Klobuchar: Alright, well thank you very much, Chairwoman, and thank you Senator Wicker as well for both of your leadership on this. I think we all know the pandemic has put one big magnifying glass on this problem that we all know existed and having been to Iceland, I just don’t understand why they have better internet than we have in America -- that you can reach corners of Iceland over volcanoes and you still can’t reach with high-speed internet parts of Southern Minnesota or Northern Minnesota. That’s how I go into this. I think it’s so important when we’ve got kids that are having to learn the mute button to learn to read and parents with their toddlers on their knees and their laptops on their desk and we know that this pandemic as we see this lighthouse in front of us that we’re going to get through this we still know that it’s forever changed the way people are going to communicate and we can’t have haves and have nots. So I’ll start with the bill that I’m leading with Representative Clyburn. I’m so proud we have six members of this committee on the bill. I’ll start with you, Dr. Ali. Could you talk about the need for forward-looking with broadband? You mentioned precision agriculture and they need to help small businesses, and why we need this kind of funding for once and for all to get through this?Dr. Ali: Absolutely, thank you very much for the question. I like to think about when we think about high performance broadband particularly in rural America, we have five pillars. We’ve got pillars for telehealth, education, we know that there is a great point -- one great point between separating those students who have broadband and who don’t. We know that those folks are struggling with vaccines, to sign up for vaccines without a broadband connection. We also know that high-performance broadband attracts businesses. I was doing some work in Rock County, Minnesota, and for a brief point they had attracted a shrimp company--Senator Klobuchar: Yes, I am well aware of this issue.Dr. Ali: And they were attracted there because they had fiber. They had fiber in the ground, in fact, Rock County’s the most connected county in Minnesota, so I think that, you know, for all of these reasons, small businesses, working from home, studying from home, the 1001 definition that then also the $80 billion for deployment is absolutely crucial.Senator Klobuchar: Right and you mentioned how getting to underserved areas is so important, and Chair Cantwell I have a letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human rights which represents over 200 national organizations, expressing support for my broadband infrastructure with Majority Whip Clyburn, the Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act, which I’d like to submit to the record.Chairwoman Cantwell: Without objection.Senator Klobuchar: Thank you very much. Briefly on that, because I have questions for other witnesses. Dr. Ali, what this divide is when it comes to race, when it comes to smaller towns, and the like.Dr. Ali: Well we know, I think all too often we think about the digital divide as being one divide, as a divide between rural America and urban America, but as we’ve learned in the last few years, the real divide is intersectional. It’s about race, it’s about income, it is about geography, it’s about affordability, it’s about students, so there are multiple digital divides. One of the ones plaguing rural communities the most is of course the divide in infrastructure. But that does not mean that there are not problems with affordability, that does not mean there is not a problem with availability and computer use and digital literacy. So this needs to be -- this is an opportunity for us to really attack all of these issues. The digital divide is not a zero-sum game...Senator Klobuchar: Exactly.Dr. Ali: ...where we fund one and not fund the other. It has to happen at the same time.Senator Klobuchar: Okay, thank you. Mr. Wilkins, one of the bills we have out there that is bipartisan -- 15 democrats, 13 republicans -- Senator Cramer and I have introduced which focuses on internet services to students, rural, and low-income families and that is a $2 billion fund. Could you just very -- like in thirty seconds here -- mention the importance of that bill?Mr. Wilkins: Absolutely, and in my mind, that’s especially important because it actually gets at the deployment challenge as well. If you’re building a broadband network in a rural area, you actually are very, very interested in the ability of families in that area to afford service on your network. And I think funding to support that kind of distanced learning is a very important part of the -- frankly, the revenue side of the business case for deploying in rural areas.Senator Klobuchar: Okay, exactly because some areas -- some providers are doing this, some aren’t. As you have pointed out, Mr. Forde, which I appreciate and I appreciate your work in Minnesota. Last question is along the lines of what my friend Senator Wicker was talking about, this is our bill and we’re proud to have several others on it as well, the Broadband Data Act, as he’s mentioned, it has been passed. Just talk about this would help us despite everything good you’ve done in Minnesota, we still have areas that aren’t covered and we’ve got to make the case for where we need the money and where we don’t. Mr. Forde?Mr. Forde: Yes, thank you very much, Senator. Pleasure to do a lot of great work across the state of Minnesota. You know we’re -- I have an excellent GIS department. We stand ready to provide that data and we love working closely with the State of Minnesota and the Broadband Office. If there is ever a data discrepancy, right down to the address level, they call us, we certainly get that worked out and make sure we know the exact areas that lack access to broadband and really like the way that their office is very surgical in attacking areas. They pulled out all of the RDOF areas from their latest grant round to ensure that federal funding would not be duplicative with their state funding and you have an excellent challenge process with their grants as well. There was a grant that we applied for and the provider agreed to upgrade their service and we did not get. There was another instance where we applied -- or another provider provided for a grant for an area the Midco was going to build with private capital in 2022 and they pulled that grant so that would just be using private capital so really like the way that they’re really focused right down to the address level and work very, very closely with companies who have this data from excellent GIS departments to ensure that the funding is targeted and--Senator Klobuchar: Exactly.Mr. Forde: I think we’re able to implement these things at a federal level that will help.Senator Klobuchar: And I think Senator Wicker sees this. We’ve got to do both things at once because once we get the money, we want to target it, and good to see you, Former Commissioner. Chairwoman Cantwell: Thank you for your leadership again, Senator Klobuchar, very much appreciate it.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/at-commerce-committee-hearing-klobuchar-emphasizes-need-to-close-the-digital-divide-by-expanding-high-speed-broadband-access-across-u-s"

Klobuchar stressed that Minnesota has long protected LGBTQ people from discrimination and that the state has “one of the most thriving economies” in part because of the Minnesota Human Rights Act. She also emphasized the Business Coalition for the Equality Act’s strong support for the legislation, with 388 leading U.S. employers collaborating to push for its passage.

They understand that for their employees to thrive, they need to be protected.” The full transcript of remarks below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Senator Klobuchar: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you to our witnesses. It wasn’t long ago that a person could be prosecuted for being gay. It wasn’t long ago that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was the law of the land and it wasn’t long ago that states were permitted to deny LGBTQ couples the right to marry. We have made great progress, miles of progress, but we still have miles to go as this hearing has pointed out. My first question is of you, Mr. David. I first want to thank you for mentioning Minnesota’s Civil Rights Act. We’ve been ahead of the curve when it came to these issues for a long, long time and I think it’s been a good thing because we’ve been able to – have been able to have one of the most thriving economies in terms of recruiting people to work at companies. We have one of the highest per-capita numbers for fortune 500 companies and I think it’s been incredibly – a good thing that we have so many citizens in our state and I was listening to some of the other questions, specifically Senator Cotton’s question, so many people of faith that support equality under the law. So I just want to ask you a series of questions, Mr. David. Are there still places in the United States where LGBTQ person can be denied a home simply because of who they are?Mr. David: Yes. Senator Klobuchar: Are there still places where an LGBTQ person can be denied a loan simply of who they are?Mr. David: Yes, there are. There are areas where there are no state laws that would protect LGBTQ people.Senator Klobuchar: And are there still places in the U.S. where an LGBTQ person can be denied access to health care because of who they are?Mr. David: Yes. There are areas where there is no state law that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in health care.Senator Klobuchar: And how have gaps in federal protections contributed to systemic inequalities experienced by members of the community?Mr. David: So we have areas that are not protected by federal law. For example, jury service. If I, as a gay man, tried to serve on the jury, I could be dismissed from the jury because of my sexual orientation and I would have no protections under federal law. The same if I were to get into a transportation hub, an Uber or a Lyft, and travel in a state that does not have protections. I would have no recourse if I was thrown out of that taxi. If I was thrown out of that car, I would have no recourse. If I went into a store to purchase a new pair of jeans or a new shirt, and I faced discrimination as an LGBTQ person, I would have no recourse under federal law. These instances unfortunately are real for LGBTQ people. Two-thirds of LGBTQ people face discrimination in this country.Senator Klobuchar: Yeah. You know the business coalition for the Equality Act is a group of 388 leading U.S. employers which includes companies like 3M and General Mills – I thought I’d lead with hometown companies – as well as Delta, Nike, and Target, another Minnesota company. The coalition has a combined $6.4 trillion in reverence and employs over 13.5 million people in the United States. What is driving this level of support among our largest businesses?Mr. David: Our largest businesses understand that diversity, inclusion, and fairness actually affect the bottom line. They understand that for their employees to thrive, they need to be protected. How can your employees actually thrive when they worry about walking home at night because they don’t have protections under state law? How can your employees thrive when they may not have the protections to get the resources and the services they need? Those employers understand that diversity, inclusion, and fairness, and equality actually affects the bottom line and if they have those protections if those employees are able to live freely and be who they are, they can thrive and that benefits the bottom line for all of those companies.Senator Klobuchar: Last question. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted the LGT-- LBG-- LGBTQ community especially LGBTQ people of color. While LGBTQ people overall are thirty percent more likely to have lost their jobs since the pandemic started, Black and Latino people who identify as LGBTQ are seventy percent more likely to have lost their jobs. Why is this and could you just-- end by speaking to the impact on the community and how the Equality Act could help mitigate these problems?Mr. David: Absolutely. So we have all been affected by COVID-19, all of us. Some of us have lost loved ones, others have gotten ill, or we know family members who have gotten ill. But there is also a second reality. That is an economic reality that some of us have lost our jobs, some of us have taken two jobs in order to protect our families because of reduced wages, and if you are LGBTQ and you’re a person of color, COVID-19 hits you disproportionately high and if you happen to be a transgender person, your unemployment rate is almost three times that of the general population so as we think about the Equality Act and why it’s important, we need to make sure that all of us have an equal opportunity to contribute and thrive and without these protections, what we’re seeing now is, unfortunately, going to get worse because LGTBQ people and people of color, as we all know, face the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic.Senator Klobuchar: Very good. Thank you very much and thanks to all the witnesses. I will ask a few questions on the record. Thank you.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/at-judiciary-committee-hearing-klobuchar-highlights-need-to-expand-protections-for-lgbtq-americans"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=EF4F681D-BCA5-4A34-ABB3-4A161D8D3BE0,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and six of her Senate colleagues urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure seniors are able to access coronavirus vaccine scheduling systems.In a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, the Senators noted that many seniors—who account for more than 80 percent of coronavirus-related deaths—lack broadband access or do not regularly use the internet, leaving them at a disadvantage when signing up for a vaccine appointment. In response, the Senators encouraged the CDC to consider all available options to ensure all people, and in particular our nation’s seniors, know how to navigate and can access vaccine scheduling systems.  The Senators wrote: “The CDC plays a critical role in overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and is uniquely positioned to work with states to implement effective and equitable systems to schedule and administer vaccines...We look forward to working with the Administration to ensure the success of a federally-supported vaccination website and call center to address some of the barriers to accessing vaccines.”The letter was signed by Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Mark Kelly (D-AZ).Full text of the letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Director Walensky:We write to encourage the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take additional action to ensure that older Americans—including seniors who may not have access to broadband or other necessary technology—can access appointment and scheduling systems for coronavirus vaccines.As you know, this pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. They are at a higher risk of serious illness if infected and account for 80 percent of all coronavirus-related deaths.  The impact is not just physical—in July 2020, nearly 50 percent of older adults reported that coronavirus-related stress had a negative impact on their mental health, up from 31 percent in May 2020, closer to the beginning of the pandemic.  In recognition of this, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the prioritization of older adults in its proposed Phase 1b and 1c of vaccine distribution.  However, the majority of all coronavirus vaccination appointments are currently scheduled online—exposing a critical generational digital divide that threatens to limit access to vaccines for some of the most vulnerable populations. Nearly 1 in 3 seniors in the United States do not use the internet, and many that do struggle to use it effectively.   For seniors who have access to an online appointment portal, other issues persist, including registration websites frequently crashing due to overloads of traffic, challenges creating registration accounts, and glitches where available appointments vanish before applicants can enter all of their information to register.  These issues are compounded by the fact that nearly 22 million—or 42 percent—of American seniors lack broadband access at home, while many others do not own a working computer. The CDC plays a critical role in overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and is uniquely positioned to work with states to implement effective and equitable systems to schedule and administer vaccines. We appreciate the Administration’s work to examine various options for a centralized vaccine scheduling and appointment system for Americans, including the elderly, to access vaccines.  We urge the CDC to consider all available options and resources to ensure that people can navigate and access vaccine scheduling systems, and we look forward to working with the Administration to ensure the success of a federally-supported vaccination website and call center to address some of the barriers to accessing vaccines.  The progress made in developing multiple safe and highly effective vaccines to fight the coronavirus in less than a year is nothing short of a medical marvel. We must now take steps to ensure these vaccines are accessible—and that begins by making sure all Americans, including older adults, have access to vaccination appointment systems.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-colleagues-urge-cdc-to-increase-accessibility-of-coronavirus-vaccine-for-seniors"

Guzman as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). In her remarks, Klobuchar emphasized Guzman’s strong qualifications to support small businesses as our economy recovers from the pandemic, citing her background as a former entrepreneur and the SBA deputy chief of staff and senior adviser during the Obama administration. Highlighting recent visits to restaurants in St. Louis Park and Duluth, MN, Klobuchar also stressed the need for a leader who will prioritize resources and aid for local restaurants, noting that one in six restaurants has closed during the pandemic.The full transcript of remarks below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Senator Klobuchar: Mr. President, today I rise in support of Isabel Guzman, currently the Director of the Presiding Officer in California, Office of the Small Business Advocate, to be the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. We all know the importance of small businesses and how they have been hit so hard during this pandemic. Small businesses employ nearly half of all private sector workers and make outsized contributions to the innovation that make America's economy strong. Yet the Coronavirus has put millions of people out of business, hundreds of thousands of these mom and pop, brick and mortar retail shops out of business, restaurants out of business, and we are so pleased that there is, as we say in Minnesota, a lighthouse that we're looking to now. I was up in Duluth on Sunday and instead of the light at the end of the tunnel which so many of us talk about with the end of this pandemic, the Mayor there referred to it as a lighthouse. They have a lot of lighthouses on Lake Superior, Mr. President, and the end of this pandemic is our lighthouse. And we see the blinking lights from a distance but we know we are not there yet. And to get there, we not only need to get this vaccine to every person and the President has said we will have available vaccines by the end of May for every adult in America, we have to get it distributed and our pandemic bill certainly is going to be a major step toward getting that done. But we also need to get our business economy back in order. We need to be able to not be so far down in the ground that we can't climb out of where we are. And that's why having Ms. Guzman, who served as Deputy Chief of Staff and the Senior Adviser at the Small Business Administration during the Obama administration, having someone with her record and her ability to lead in place is so important. She will oversee the Paycheck Protection Program, which we established on a bipartisan basis in March of 2020 as part of the CARES Act. She understands the need for greater equity in loan distribution and has shown commitment to transparency and accurate loan data. She has made clear she will make the Paycheck Protection Program more accessible to businesses that have traditionally not had the access to making relationships needed to secure loans and grants. And very significantly to me and to those of us that worked on the Save Our Stages bill, including Senator Cornyn of Texas, who led the bill with me, she has made clear that she will move on the grant program immediately. We have been working with the staff there and we have made some -- given these venues who have been shuttered, the first to close, the last to open, the ability to access PPP loans, which is really important right now but we also want to get the grant program out immediately, get that money out, distributing over $16 billion in grants. Our venues can't wait. They need that relief and Ms. Guzman will be key to leading our way out of this and helping Senator Schumer with his theaters in New York to the Fargo Theater in North Dakota. We need to get this done. Our restaurant relief: we just passed as part of the American Rescue Plan, a major, major bill, the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund which is going to be so key. When I was at the Block Food and Drink restaurant in St. Louis Park on Sunday and then headed up to Duluth to the Boat Club with the mayor and the owners of the Boat Club, the stories I heard of servers who have been laid off and then came back, laid off and came back, the stories I’ve heard about the owners of some of these restaurants taking out repeated loans, they are hanging in there and we need to have their backs. One out of six restaurants in this country has permanently closed down during the pandemic. We don't want to just go, as the leader of the Antitrust Committee in the Senate -- we don't want to give all of our food service and action in the restaurant area to the big guys. We're pleased we have successful restaurant chains in this country, but that can't be the only thing we have. And that's why helping these smaller venues is so important and Ms. Guzman gets that. She is a lifelong proponent of small businesses, the daughter of a small business owner, and as a former entrepreneur, this makes her the right person for this job at the pivotal time in the life of our country. She has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and numerous trade organizations. I know her leadership at the S.B.A will put our struggling businesses in the best hands. With that, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the nomination of Isabella Guzman to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration. You must be proud, Mr. President, as having someone who has done such good work in California in this job. We're excited about her and what she can do and I also will put remarks on the record as I'm running out of time. I see my colleague from Wisconsin is here and we're going to have the vote ahead of us. Put my statement on the record for Xavier Becerra. We're very excited about him as well to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/on-senate-floor-klobuchar-highlights-sba-administrator-nominee-isabel-guzman-s-leadership-role-in-supporting-restaurant-industry"

Klobuchar’s floor speech was delivered on the eve of the first hearing on the legislation in the Senate, scheduled by Klobuchar in the Rules Committee for tomorrow.The full transcript of remarks below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Madam President, I come to the floor today to join my colleagues, Senator Merkley and so many others, in speaking in support of the critical democracy reforms in the For the People Act, legislation that I am honored to lead with Senator Merkley and Majority Leader Schumer, Representative Sarbanes over in the House, which passed this bill very recently through their entire chamber.This bill will in short make it easier to vote, not harder to vote as sadly some of our colleagues have proposed over the years, but it will make it easier to vote, end the dominance of big money in politics, and ensure that public officials work for the public interest. And it includes provisions, as Senator Merkley noted, from 15 bills that I lead to strengthen our democracy.I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have contributed to the ideas in this bill. It represents the combined work of so many people in this chamber who are dedicated to improving our democracy.Nine bipartisan bills are part of the For the People Act. Bills like the Honest Ads Act, which I originally introduced with Senator McCain of the great state of Arizona, the Presiding Officer’s home state, and now lead with Senator Graham and Senator Warner. What does this bill do? Well, it improves disclosure requirements for online ads. Disclosure requirements that aren’t in law. It’s not right and that’s why this is just one of the many provisions with bipartisan support. These election security reforms that so many of us worked at, including Senator Lankford and Senator Burr, those are in this bill. These are reforms that have broad support among the American people. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 65 percent of respondents said the option to vote early in this bill or absentee in this bill, should be available to any voter. And a poll from the Campaign Legal Center found that 83 percent of likely voters support public disclosure of contributions to organizations involved in elections. Of course they do! People want to know who is paying for these ads they see on TV. They want to know where the money is from, and then they can follow the money.Many of the provisions in the bill have already been adopted across the country in red, blue, and purple states. And Republican and Democratic election officials and governors have supported them.As the Chair of the Senate Rules Committee – the committee with jurisdiction over federal elections and campaign finance law, and the committee to which this bill has been referred – I believe we must get this done. Tomorrow, as noted by Senator Merkley, we will be holding a hearing on the bill. I am pleased that every single Democratic member of that committee is a cosponsor of the bill, and I intend to move quickly to a mark-up to send the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.The For the People Act is critically important. It’s important because it would improve our democracy by protecting voting rights, getting dark money out of our elections, and putting in place anti-corruption reforms.It’s important because every one of the things that we want to get done, from rebuilding the economy, to fixing our immigration system, to investing in infrastructure, to tackling the climate crisis, to reforming our criminal justice system, they all depend on a democracy that works for the people.Last November, in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic, nearly 160 million Americans voted – more people than ever before in the history of America. Think about that. In the middle of a pandemic. And we know we saw the pictures on TV. We saw the people at the very beginning before we knew what safety protocols should be in place, when things were getting messed around, those people in Wisconsin in garbage bags – in garbage bags in the rain, standing in line to vote. Why did so many people vote in the middle of a pandemic? Both sides of the aisle – Democrats, Republicans, Independents – why did they vote? Well, they were interested in the election, we know that. But it was more than that. In part, they voted because they had more access to voting because of the changes that were made in the states. Vote by mail that was available and easier for so many more people to do than ever before. We think about those people that suddenly had new means to vote, in states where they suddenly didn’t have to get a notary public or two signatures or this or that just to exercise their right to vote. And they voted. And they voted in droves. And even though the overwhelming majority of Americans have made it clear they want to see policies that continue to make it easier to vote, sadly there are those on the other side of the aisle who have been doubling down to find ways to make it harder to vote. As Senator Merkley noted, over 250 bills introduced in states across the country, including my home state of Minnesota that had the highest voter turnout once again in the country, people trying to make it harder to vote, including in Arizona where they had such a record turn out, including in Georgia. Why? Well as Senator Warnock said so beautifully and succinctly in his maiden Senate floor speech just last week: “Some people don’t want some people to vote.” Well, that’s not how this country was founded. That’s not what our Constitution says. We cannot just sit back and let our democracy be undermined.As I said from the inaugural stage on that beautiful blue sky day at the very place where you could still see the spray paint at the bottom of the columns and the makeshift windows that we had in place after the January 6th attack, this is the day our democracy picks itself up, brushes off the dust, and does what America always does: goes forward as a nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.For decades there are those that have been trying to chip away at the fundamental right to vote. We can’t just keep taking it. We have to ensure that right to vote.What is this about? One, making it easier to vote.That’s exactly what For the People does. It includes provisions that I’ve championed and so many others have like automatic voter registration, ending purges of voting rolls, independent redistricting commissions, and requiring all states to allow same-day voter registration and voting by mail.These are common sense policies that are already in place in many states. In the 2020 general election, 45 states didn’t require an excuse to vote by mail. This will ensure that in every state you don’t need to make an excuse. 21 states have same-day registration, including states like Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. 43 states have early voting. Just last month, Kentucky’s Republican Secretary of State praised a state bill that would make early in-person voting permanent.And certainly, we need to ban purges of voting rolls. As my friend Stacey Abrams said – if you don’t go to a meeting every year, you don’t lose your right to assemble under the Constitution. If you don’t go to church or synagogue, or mosque or temple, you don’t lose your right to worship. So if you haven’t voted for a few elections, and you decide you want to vote because you care about a candidate or an issue, you should not lose your right to vote. But in too many places that is not the case. 20 states have automatic voter registration laws, including West Virginia, Alaska, and Georgia. This bill simply says they all should. The second major reform we need is to get the big money out of politics.The For the People Act helps bring transparency to campaign spending so that voters are informed about who is funding candidates and who is paying for the ads. It also tightens regulations on Super PACs, and restructures the Federal Election Commission to make it more effective and less prone to partisan gridlock.And the third major reform in the For the People Act is restoring trust in our government.Democracy isn’t just about what happens on Election Day, it’s also about making sure that our elected officials are accountable once they take office.The For the People Act ensures that members of Congress and other federal officials are truly working for the people. It expands conflict of interest laws, prohibits members of Congress from serving on the boards of for-profit entities, and codifies ethics rules for the executive branch.Most importantly, why does the highest court of the land not have any ethics rules, for the Supreme Court, when every other federal court in the nation does? This bill answers that question.Three simple ideas: making voting easier, getting big money out of politics, and strengthening ethics rules.2020 marked the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment which granted women the right to vote. And a century after that ratification, we elected our first African American, first Asian American, and first woman Vice President in Vice President Kamala Harris. As we celebrate these firsts, we are reminded that throughout our country’s history, the right to vote has been hard-fought and hard-won.As Congressman John Lewis, who we sadly lost, once said, “Your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect union.”When we reflect on the sacrifices and strides that have been made for the right to vote, one thing is very clear: the fight isn’t over.The best way we can honor the countless Americans who have risked – and in some cases given their lives – given their lives to protect our freedoms overseas, given their lives to protect our democracy here at home – the best way is to make sure that that democracy continues unfettered and that everyone has the right to vote because we know as Senator Warnock reminded us, there are some people that are trying to make it hard for some people to vote. That’s not how America works. And the For the People Act is all about making sure America works for everyone. Thank you Madam President, I yield the floor.# # # Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/on-senate-floor-klobuchar-calls-for-passage-of-legislation-that-makes-voting-easier-gets-dark-money-out-of-politics-and-strengthens-ethics-rules"

The eight victims of this attack, six of whom were women of Asian descent, must never be forgotten. As Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, said: ‘this is a crime against all of us.’ While there is still a lot we don’t know, it’s clear that this attack followed a year of increasing harassment and violence against the Asian American community. And when people inflict fear on one community in Minnesota, they inflict fear on all of us. “There have been 42 documented incidents of anti-Asian bias in our state over the past year. And that number just represents what has actually been reported. It is really important, as we have done so many times in Minnesota, that we stand together to denounce hate and take action. “This means we have to make progress in our efforts to combat hate crimes, including advancing legislation I am cosponsoring with my friend, Senator Mazie Hirono, to require the Department of Justice to invest the resources needed to fully investigate pandemic-related hate crimes against Asian Americans. “To live up to our values, we must do everything in our power to combat hatred and violence fueled by bigotry. We also know that easy access to guns can make hate deadly. That’s why we need to pass laws that ensure firearms don’t fall into the hands of people who should not have them. Congress can protect the Asian American community and all women by passing the Violence Against Women Act, which includes my bill to close to the boyfriend loophole once and for all. “While your organizations are working to elevate these issues and offer support to Asian American communities, I will be your partner in Washington—combating this alarming rise in attacks on people of Asian descent.”# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/following-surge-of-hate-crimes-klobuchar-meets-with-asian-american-community-leaders"
https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=42E481DB-F178-4677-9891-87C329580AD5,"The Housing Supply and Affordability Act will create a competitive grant program to increase housing supply and affordability WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Tim Kaine (D-VA) introduced the Housing Supply and Affordability Act to create a new grant program that would provide funding to help localities develop and implement comprehensive housing policy plans. This program will provide technical assistance to help states, localities, and regional coalitions increase housing supply, improve housing affordability, and reduce barriers to new housing development while avoiding the displacement of current residents. Companion legislation in the House of Representatives is led by Representatives Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), and Joyce Beatty (D-OH).“All Americans deserve access to an affordable home, but unfortunately the nationwide housing shortage has created an affordability crisis for far too many,” said Klobuchar. “These grants will help communities identify their housing challenges, improve affordability, and implement unique solutions to expand their housing supply.”“The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the housing affordability crisis in Ohio and cities across the nation. To truly address the issue of housing affordability, we need to look closely at what’s happening at the local level, and that is exactly what this bill does,” said Portman. “This bipartisan piece of legislation will provide localities and municipalities with resources to expand the supply of housing and increase affordability. As we turn the corner on the coronavirus pandemic, let’s make sure that housing affordability and availability is at the center of our economic recovery efforts.”“It’s critical that we eliminate barriers that keep Americans from accessing safe and affordable housing,” said Kaine. “I’m proud to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation that would help address our nation’s housing crisis and provide state and local governments the resources they need to ensure more Virginians can find affordable housing.” “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen the critical need for housing supply and affordability. While Delaware has taken some truly innovative approaches to expanding housing, the reality is that our states and localities need more resources to be able to meet housing needs across the country,” said Blunt Rochester. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan Housing Supply and Affordability Act, which will create incentives which ultimately result in more Americans having the dignity and security of reliable housing.”“Our nation’s housing crisis, coupled with the effects of the COVID pandemic, has hit Southwest Washington communities and families particularly hard. Finding solutions to meet our region’s housing demands is a top priority of mine, and it’s why I’m working in Congress to address this issue. I’m pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation aimed at helping local communities increase housing supply and affordability throughout our region. Our goal is to give families, seniors, and individuals increased access to quality housing in Southwest Washington,” said Herrera Beutler.“Right now in America, millions of people lack access to safe, secure, and stable housing because of draconian land-use and exclusionary policies. The Housing Supply and Affordability Act will help close our nation’s severe housing shortage by incentivizing local governments to enact policies that increase supply and help more families find their ‘home sweet home,’” said Beatty.An estimated 2.5 million additional housing units are needed to match long-term housing demand, while the total inventory of homes for sale in December 2020 was the lowest on record. Minnesota is estimated to have the third-highest housing supply deficit of any state. This shortage of housing supply—and the inability of many housing markets to respond to local demand—decreases housing affordability for working families, restricts access to high-opportunity job markets, and raises the costs for housing assistance programs offered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).In response, the Housing Supply and Affordability Act will establish a $300 million per year grant program to award planning and implementation grants to states, localities, and regional coalitions of localities to support the development and implementation of comprehensive plans to expand the supply and affordability of housing, reduce barriers to new housing development, and avoid the displacement of current residents. The bill also directs HUD to provide recommendations on strategies that states and localities should consider in developing and implementing these plans, including how to best inclusively engage with community members on housing reforms. Finally, the bill requires routine reporting from applicants regarding the use of these grant funds, convenes a learning group of applicants and grantees to facilitate problem-solving regarding housing reforms, and requires a study from HUD describing the impact of the Program and outlining the most successful strategies in expanding the supply of housing. This legislation has been endorsed by 100 national and local organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, Up For Growth Action, NeighborWorks Association, Minnesota Housing Partnership, and American Planning Association.“The Housing Supply and Affordability Act will provide cities, states, regional associations, and tribes the resources they need to connect housing with jobs, transit, and opportunity,” said Mike Kingsella, Executive Director of Up for Growth Action. “The Local Housing Policy Grant program established by the legislation incentivizes recipients to develop housing policies that eliminate artificial barriers to housing production, including exclusionary zoning. The bipartisan Housing Supply and Affordability Act should be a key component of the country’s continued economic recovery. We applaud Senator Klobuchar, Senator Portman, Senator Kaine, Representative Blunt Rochester, Representative Herrera Beutler, and Representative Beatty for developing and introducing this critical pro-housing legislation.”“Many planners are pushing communities to take a fresh look at development codes and zoning,” said Leo Asuncion, AICP, President of the American Planning Association. “The federal incentives and support provided in the Housing Supply and Affordability Act will make it easier for more planners and local governments to overhaul local rules that continue to stymie housing supply, availability, and safety.”""The Housing Supply and Affordability Act, led by Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, will help remove local barriers to housing production, and ensure that communities have the tools they desperately need to address our housing shortage,” said Anne Mavity, Executive Director of the Minnesota Housing Partnership. ""Zoning has been used by too many communities to keep people out. This legislation will provide incentives for local communities to remove discriminatory zoning policies, and ensure that communities have the housing they need to support a thriving economy, ensure healthy seniors, and ensure that every child has a home to do their homework,” Mavity added. # # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-portman-kaine-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage"

Noting that many states, including Minnesota, have taken action to prevent abusive dating partners from purchasing a gun, Klobuchar highlighted that her bill to close the “boyfriend loophole” at the federal level recently passed the House with bipartisan support as a part of the legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. She also discussed the tragic shooting that occurred at the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, MN, last month, and asked about how Extreme Risk Protection Order laws can help prevent mass shootings.The full transcript of remarks below and video available for TV download HERE and online viewing HERE.Senator Klobuchar: Thank you very much, and thank you Mr. Chairman for this hearing, this moving testimony. I was here for your initial comments in the room, and I want to thank all of you for the work that you’re doing, especially those that have been personally affected by gun violence. So for years I’ve been working to pass the Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, which would close a dangerous loophole. And actually when Senator Grassley chaired this committee we had a hearing, and the Republican witnesses agreed with the piece about closing the boyfriend loophole, which, of course, abusive dating partners now can buy a gun, whereas people who are married cannot. And we’re just simply trying to close that loophole which has been closed in many states but not all states. What’s really interesting is that this provision actually has passed the House now with 29 Republican votes because it’s part of the Violence Against Women Act. And I am--we are working so hard on background checks and some of the other things we need to do, but this provision is actually in that along with an important provision that’s contained in the bill on stalking. And I remember when we had that hearing and the Republican witnesses agreed with this idea. The very conservative sheriff from Wisconsin actually said this, he said: “Dangerous boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous husbands. They hit just as hard, and they fire their guns with the same deadly force.” I ask you, Ms. Thomas, about this. I know you know this bill well. Many states have taken actions to close this loophole in state law, including mine. How have the rates of gun violence changed in those states, and how would changing federal law to include dating partners help?Ms. Thomas: So I first just want to acknowledge that more than half of intimate partner homicides occur by a dating--former or current--dating partner, so this is a really important group that we include within the definition of those prohibited from having firearms. We have seen a marked reduction in gun violence in states that have this law and certainly we would expect the same if we expanded the characterization within the current law to include not just the domestic violence misdemeanors that are currently in there, but also to include dating partners and those that are convicted of stalking. In addition to dating partners, more than 70 percent of homicide victims in intimate partner homicides are previously the victims of stalking, so these are two ways that we could very easily expand those definitions, cover more individuals, protect individuals in domestic violence situations, and reduce harm. And both of those are in the reauthorized Violence Against Women Act.Senator Klobuchar: Thank you, and one other question, and I know this has been discussed a little bit: The Extreme Risk Protection Orders. I remember being at a meeting with the former President Trump after the Parkland shooting, and actually Vice President Pence supported this, doing something with these Extreme Risk Protection Orders in federal law. And sadly we've had now a horrible crime in Minnesota, in February, a terrible shooting at the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, where a young medical assistant was killed and four others were injured. It had been reported that the police were aware that the shooter had actually previously made threats against this clinic, it was a general health clinic, and so doing something now in our state is supported by the governor, the chiefs of police, the Minnesota County Attorneys Association. Can you talk, Ms. Thomas, about how an Extreme Risk Protection Order can help to prevent shootings like the one that we just had tragically in Minnesota?Ms. Thomas: Absolutely. I want to address some comments made earlier about Extreme Risk Protection Orders. There is a lot of discussion around due process when we talk about Extreme Risk Protection Orders and that's because it is a situation where you can have ex parte, temporary removal. These laws are modeled on domestic violence hearings, domestic violence ex parte hearings, which have withstood decades of challenge and ensure they comply with due process and that's how these laws are modeled. So they ensure that we cover due process, that we protect those individuals' rights, and have a system in place where there is a full and fair hearing very quickly after the initial removal. Extreme Risk Protective Orders are now in place in 19 states and the District of Columbia. They are working in a really impactful way to reduce the incidence of mass shootings. As I mentioned earlier, 21 incidents that we've just recently has been reviewed by peer reviewed research where mass shootings where been prevented by Risk Protective Orders and we know for sure that it’s reduced suicide in states like Connecticut from research that’s come out. So, as has been mentioned by other witnesses, this is a really smart, effective way to remove guns when people are in a time of crisis and to ensure that due process rights are protected, and to ensure the safety of communities. There was a question earlier about who gets to decide about these rights and it is always a judicial officer, testimony is always under oath. There was comments made about who gets to testify. These are comments under oath utilizing our fair justice system. We believe systems are put in place in a way that protects all the parties involved and enhances public safety. Senator Klobuchar: Thank you so much. We should note, as I brought up those previous meetings, these provisions are in place in a number of what would be considered red states as well, and have been supported by many Republicans in the past. So thank you very much, and I appreciate, again, all the witnesses. Thank you.  # # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/at-judiciary-committee-hearing-klobuchar-emphasizes-need-to-pass-common-sense-legislation-to-address-gun-violence"

Fuels like biodiesel offer a sustainable, readily available source of emissions reductions, but full acknowledgement of such contributions require accurate data and modeling.We were encouraged by your response to a question for the record in your confirmation hearing, in which you committed to “request a review of the current literature and an evaluation of the benefit of a new study focused on biomass-based diesel.” We write in support of such a review and request that you instruct USDA complete a full lifecycle assessment of soybean oil-based biodiesel, including direct and significant indirect emissions, before the end of the year.As you know, USDA updated its assessment for corn ethanol in 2019, providing a federally supported figure for the first time since the 2010 implementation of the RFS. The analysis projected that corn ethanol could reach emissions reductions as high as 47-70 percent compared to conventional gasoline. More recent studies find that average ethanol emissions are approaching this range, with an average of 46 percent greenhouse gas reductions.However, similar analysis has not yet been conducted for biodiesel, denying a timely opportunity for a federally directed study to further inform the ongoing discussion about biofuels and lifecycle emission reductions. As part of this review, USDA should consider the most recent analysis conducted by the Department of Energy's Argonne National Lab's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) Model, USDA’s indirect land use change assessment, and the indirect land use change assessment conducted by Purdue University.We believe an updated assessment will show significant reductions in the overall lifecycle emissions of biodiesel, reinforcing the fact that America's soybean farmers and biodiesel producers are among the most sustainable in the world. For example, in 2018, Argonne National Lab conducted a life cycle assessment of soybean oil-based biodiesel’s direct and significant indirect greenhouse gas emissions. They calculated a carbon intensity 33 percent lower than EPA’s outdated 2010 analysis. Without an update to EPA’s soybean oil analysis, which would be influenced by new USDA data, the agency will continue to leave over 3 million metric tons of CO2 emission reductions uncredited every year due to continued reliance on outdated science. These additional reductions will add to the over 25 million metric tons of emissions already avoided annually by domestic biodiesel producers.Our request comes at a critically important time as states, regions, and municipalities are designing new or expanding existing greenhouse gas reduction targets. We believe that biofuels have already demonstrated their value as a readily available fuel that is compatible with existing vehicle fleets and fueling infrastructure. However, providing an updated, federally supported lifecycle assessment of soybean oil-based biodiesel will help ensure that this product is given accurate credit when considering carbon reduction strategies. Additionally, since EPA generally benchmarks new RFS pathways petitions against soybean oil, USDA providing EPA with an updated assessment could help facilitate new pathway approvals for burgeoning areas of agriculture like winter oilseed cover crops.We thank you for your timely consideration of this matter and look forward to working with you on this important issue.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-thune-lead-colleagues-in-urging-usda-to-update-biodiesel-emissions-study"

Current law only allows for bargaining by pharmaceutical companies, not Medicare. By harnessing the bargaining power of the nearly 46 million seniors enrolled in the program, Medicare could negotiate bigger discounts from pharmaceutical companies. This bill is co-sponsored by 32 other senators.Klobuchar, Welch, and their colleagues in the Senate and House are committed to developing and considering a range of solutions to make prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans.“The skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs in our country is an urgent problem impacting our seniors, and there are solutions on the table to help them access the medications they need at prices they can afford,” said Klobuchar. “My legislation will lift restrictions on Medicare negotiating the best price of prescription drugs for seniors enrolled in Part D. We must put an end to rising health care costs, and this legislation will increase the affordability of critical medications.”“Leveraging the federal government's enormous purchasing power to cut drug prices for seniors is common sense and long overdue,” said Welch. “Paying retail prices for wholesale drug purchases is wasteful and irresponsible. We need to pass this bill to end big pharma’s sweetheart deal and lower drug prices for 46 million American seniors.”“Taxpayers and America’s seniors deserve relief from the extortionate monopoly prices charged by prescription drug corporations. The so-called noninterference clause was a bad bargain from the beginning; its author Billy Tauzin went straight out the revolving door to run Big Pharma’s top lobbying group. It’s past time to repeal the clause and let the government negotiate a better deal for America’s seniors. This is a basic, commonsense reform that everyone serious about making medicine affordable can support,” said Peter Maybarduk, Access to Medicines Program Director, Public Citizen.“Neurology patients and their families are directly affected by the rising cost of medications, and in some cases, patients are less likely to take their medications as often as prescribed. Costs have risen to the point where systematic changes are needed. Even with market competition, prices continue to climb dramatically both for new revolutionary treatments as well as treatments that have been prescribed for decades. The Empowering Medicare Seniors to Negotiate Drug Prices Act will bring savings to patients and the health care system by allowing the government to use its significant purchasing power to secure prescription drugs at a more appropriate price,” said James C. Stevens, MD, FAAN, President of the American Academy of Neurology.The Empowering Medicare Seniors to Negotiate Drug Prices Act would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to directly negotiate with drug companies for price discounts for the Medicare Prescription Drug Program, eliminating the “non-interference” clause that expressly bans Medicare from negotiating for better prices. By bargaining on behalf of nearly 46 million seniors, Medicare would be in a position to secure significant discounts and ensure enrollees are receiving the best prices.This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Angus King (I-ME), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).In the House, the legislation is known as the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act and is cosponsored by Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Cathy Castor (D-FL), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Reuben Gallego (D-AZ), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), David Cicilline (D-RI), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), Raul Ruiz (D-CA), Betty McCollum (D-MN), and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY). ###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-welch-introduce-legislation-to-cut-prescription-drug-costs-for-seniors"

This grant program was created by the bipartisan Save Our Stages Act, led by U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Cornyn (R-TX), and will provide $15 billion in relief for independent venues — including live music stages, movie theaters, and museums shuttered by the pandemic. “Independent venues were some of the first establishments to close down and will likely be some of the last to reopen. So many are just hanging on by a thread, but relief is now on the way. In just a few weeks, independent venues will be able to apply for grant funding from the Small Business Administration secured through my bipartisan legislation with Senator Cornyn, the Save Our Stages Act. This funding is critical to getting these venues the help they need to make ends meet and serve our communities for generations to come,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Some live entertainment venues in Texas have been shuttered for more than a year now, and the Save Our Stages Act will help ensure these cultural landmarks remain in business,” said Senator Cornyn. “It is imperative the Small Business Administration gets these grants to venues as soon as possible, and I’m looking forward to seeing the difference it makes for Texas’ live music industry.” As the SBA builds and prepares to open the program, the dedicated SBA website, www.sba.gov/svogrant, which includes frequently asked questions, video tutorials and other SVOG details, is the best source for information for those looking to apply for a grant. To prepare in advance of the SVOG application portal opening on April 8, potential applicants should get registered in the federal government’s System for Award Management (SAM.gov), as this is required for an entity to receive an SVOG, and reference the preliminary application checklist and eligibility requirements.In June, Klobuchar and Cornyn introduced the Save Our Stages Act to provide Small Business Administration grants for independent venue operators affected by the coronavirus pandemic. These grants will provide six months of financial support to keep venues afloat, pay employees, and preserve a critical economic sector for communities across America.The bipartisan legislation gained more than 50 cosponsors in the Senate, and the House version of Save our Stages, led by Representatives Peter Welch (D-VT) and Roger Williams (R-TX), gained over 170 cosponsors.The Save Our Stages Act is endorsed by the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), National Independent Talent Organization (NITO), National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), Association of Performing Arts Professionals, Music Biz, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Recording Academy, American Association of Independent Music (A2IM), and Broadway League.###Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-cornyn-statements-on-small-business-administration-announcement-of-save-our-stages-grant-applications"

Companion legislation in the House of Representatives is led by Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT).“Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with relevant academic instruction, making for a win-win situation for workers and employers,” Klobuchar said. “Our bipartisan bill would create and strengthen tuition programs for those who participate in apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs to help workers bridge the skills gap into 21st century careers and find fulfilling work during and following the pandemic.”“In addition to the difficulties small business owners have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, many have also told me that they often experience difficulty finding qualified and trained workers to fill vacant positions,” Collins said. “Apprenticeships help address this issue by aligning employees’ skills with employers’ needs and preparing individuals for a successful future in their chosen field. With many people looking for work during the ongoing public health and economic crisis, this bipartisan bill would help expand access and lower the cost of apprenticeships, allowing more Americans to take advantage of these programs to gain in-demand skills and obtain good-paying jobs.”For workers, apprenticeships provide an opportunity to stay in the labor market, earn a living wage, and pursue a nationally-recognized credential, making apprenticeships one of the most cost-effective workforce development tools.

As we continue to learn about the effects of toxic exposure, I’ll keep working to ensure we provide our veterans with the support they have earned.” “Our brave veterans risked their lives to protect our country and it’s our job to make sure they are supported back home, even years after they served,” said Senator Tillis. “As a Senator from North Carolina, I know firsthand the obstacles thousands of veterans who have been exposed to toxicants while serving have had to overcome, including many stationed at Camp Lejeune who spent decades pushing for documentation of their exposure and fair treatment for the damages caused by the military. This cannot continue to be the norm. After working alongside veterans who were stationed at Camp Lejeune and fighting for servicemembers exposed to toxicants from burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, it’s clear the men and women who served our country deserve better. The TEAM Act ensures that all veterans are given a fair and uniform process to receive the health care and benefits to which they are entitled following exposure to toxicants during their service.”“We have an obligation to ensure that veterans who return home from war receive the care that they need and have earned,” said Senator Hassan. “Unfortunately, for millions of veterans across the country who may have been exposed to toxic substances during their service, that obligation is not being met. Our bipartisan bill would take long overdue steps to ensure that veterans can receive health care for diseases that they develop as a result of toxic substance exposure during their service.”“Veterans took a sacred oath to serve this country and our obligation to them following their service must match that level of commitment,” said Senator Moran. “Veterans who are experiencing negative health effects of toxic exposures need to be able to rely on VA for answers and a Congress that is attentive to their needs. That is why I am co-sponsoring the TEAM Act, landmark legislation that will reform the way veterans exposed to toxic substances access health care and establishes an independent scientific commission tasked with researching the health effects of such toxic exposure. I am committed to working with my colleagues to make certain veterans who experience negative health consequences following exposure to dangerous chemicals where they were living and working while serving have access to an enduring framework, supported by science, to identify, research and address cases of toxic exposure in a timely manner.”“Our veterans spent years putting their lives on the line in some of the world’s most dangerous places,” said Senator Blackburn. “They should not have to wage war against the federal bureaucracy to receive proper medical care. This legislation will open up access to critical treatment for veterans exposed to toxic substances.”""After nearly two years of tireless work by our Coalition, we are pleased to see The TEAM Act re-introduced in the 117th Congress. We would like to thank Senator Tillis and Senator Hassan for their leadership on this critical issue, and urge the Senate to pass this legislation without delay.” – The Toxic Exposures in The American Military (TEAM) CoalitionSpecifically, the TEAM Act:In January 2021, a provision based on the bipartisan Pandemic Care for Burn Pits Exposure Act led by Klobuchar and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The provision improves the care that servicemembers and veterans who were previously exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances receive during the coronavirus pandemic. By requiring medical professionals to ask whether servicemembers and veterans who test positive for a virus designated by the federal government as a pandemic if they were previously exposed to burn pits, this provision will help ensure that they receive proper care and attention to their medical needs.In December 2019, Klobuchar’s bipartisan Burn Pits Accountability Act with Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Burn Pits Accountability Act requires members of the Armed Forces to be evaluated for exposure to toxic airborne chemicals during routine health exams and directs the Secretary of Defense to record and share whether servicemembers were based or stationed near an open burn pit, including any information recorded as part of the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, the Periodic Health Assessment (PHAs), Separation History and Physical Examination (SHPEs), and Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHAs). Members will also be enrolled in the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, unless they choose to opt out, if they were exposed to toxic airborne chemicals or stationed near an open burn pit. In September 2018, provisions based on the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act led by Klobuchar and Senator Tillis were signed into law as part of the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, and created the Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Center of Excellence within the VA focused on researching the health effects associated with burn pits and treating veterans who become sick after exposure. Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-tillis-hassan-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-team-act-to-reform-how-veterans-exposed-to-toxic-substances-receive-health-care-and-benefits"

The Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act will help make sure small and medium sized manufacturers have a strong voice within the federal government and help agencies coordinate policies that encourage domestic manufacturing,” said Miles Free, Director of Industry Affairs at the Precision Machined Products Association.“The bipartisan Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act is a critical step toward establishing an effective national industrial strategy that would benefit working people and union members in every state and congressional district. IFPTE applauds Senators Klobuchar, Wicker, Coons, and Portman and Representative Kaptur and Fitzpatrick for proposing legislation that aligns federally-funded research, development, and technological innovation with the goal of rebuilding the nation’s industrial base and supports high-quality high-wage domestic manufacturing jobs,” said Paul Shearon, President of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.“Manufacturing has been the foundation of the US economy from the beginning. Bipartisan support of this effort highlights the importance of working together to ensure future economic opportunity for all Americans,” said Professor Mark Johnson, Director of Clemson Center for Advanced Manufacturing, former Director of the Advanced Manufacturing Office at the US Department of Energy.“The federal government needs an industrial policy for manufacturing in America that encourages innovation and investment, in both technologies and people. The Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act will make sure that the White House has a coordinated strategy to promote domestic manufacturing growth,” said Roger Atkins, President of the National Tooling and Machining Association.“I can think of few more important initiatives for our long term competitiveness than the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act. In the years to come, this legislation will ensure robust coordination across every facet of public and private enterprise, and advance both our national and economic security. Public policy in these key areas are often undertaken on an ad hoc, disaggregated basis. The provisions of this bill will set the foundation for America to ‘Build Back Better’ — with a robust strategy grounded in real science, productivity, and smart job growth,” said Neal Orringer, Former Director of Manufacturing for the U.S. Department of Defense and Former Manufacturing Senior Advisor to U.S. Commerce Secretary and Co-Chair of White House Office of Manufacturing Policy.“The Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act gives manufacturers a long overdue seat at the policy-making table at a time when the sector is taking a leading role responding to the pandemic and driving the economy,” said David Klotz, President of Precision Metalforming Association.“Rapid and effective implementation of President Biden's BuildBackBetter agenda is critical to restore the nation's global competitiveness in manufacturing and rebuild our domestic supply chains. The Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Office, modeled on the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will develop a national manufacturing strategy, strengthen partnerships between the federal and state governments, and coordinate the siloed 58 federal manufacturing programs. Working closely with the private sector and educational institutions, the Office will ensure that all workers, communities, and companies will participate in economic growth,"" said Phillip Singerman, former NIST Associate Director for Innovation and Industry Services (2011 – 2020).“The White House should take a whole of government approach to manufacturing and the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act will put the sector at the center of policymaking within the Executive Office of the President,” said Kym Conis, Managing Director of the American Mold Builders Association.“Based on my experience as the Assistant Director for Advanced Manufacturing at OSTP (2009-12), creating the OMII is a critical step to regain America’s leadership in advanced manufacturing, rebuild the national manufacturing innovation ecosystem, and rekindle American ingenuity. OMII is designed to provide a much needed national strategy and requisite policy implementation to ensure that what is invented here is manufactured here to deliver a return on investment of taxpayer dollars in science and technology,” said Sridhar Kota, Executive Director of MForesight: Alliance for Manufacturing Foresight; Herrick Professor of Engineering at the University of Michigan. “The fastener industry makes the nuts, bolts and screws that hold the world together. We are pleased to support this legislation to elevate manufacturing within the Executive Office of the President, and to better coordinate the various manufacturing initiatives across the federal government as the U.S. focuses on a needed national manufacturing strategy,” said Dan Walker, Managing Director of the Industrial Fasteners Institute.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-wicker-coons-portman-kaptur-fitzpatrick-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-strengthen-america-s-manufacturing-industry-and-workforce-improve-economic-competitiveness"

As a result, the distribution of vaccines through VA medical facilities is a critical component to our nation’s strategy to move past this pandemic. We appreciate the efforts the VA has taken thus far to ensure veterans have access to the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccines. As of March 17, your Department has administered more than 1.8 million doses of the vaccines, and over 1.16 million veterans have been fully vaccinated.However, we are concerned that the misinformation and disinformation surrounding the vaccines will prevent some veterans from having a plan to receive a coronavirus vaccination. A recent poll by the Blue Star Families found that almost half of veteran families surveyed do not expect to receive a vaccine, with 75 percent of those families citing concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.Since the beginning of the pandemic, false information related to the coronavirus has spread rapidly. In order to save lives, we urge you to continue to address vaccine hesitancy by increasing educational efforts amongst VA recipients about vaccine misinformation. These efforts would build upon the actions the VA has already taken to warn veterans against scams soliciting money in exchange for vaccine availability. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included over $19 billion for the VA, and we encourage you to use a portion of the remaining unspent funds to counter vaccine misinformation among our veterans. It is crucial that veterans receive clear and accurate information about the vaccine and your agency can play a major role in helping them identify false information and recognize the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/klobuchar-portman-lead-colleagues-in-urging-va-to-combat-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-among-veterans"

Furthermore, the Appraisal Institute recently acknowledged the need to address unconscious racial bias in home valuations. In the letter, the legislators highlight data on racial disparities in home appraisals, the connection between home values and intergenerational wealth, and the significant gap in black and white homeownership rates, concluding: “Given the critical connection between homeownership and wealth, as well as the longstanding structural barriers to homeownership for families of color, it is crucial that appraisers accurately and impartially assess the values of Americans’ homes. Therefore, we encourage FFIEC to work with appraisers to reduce the racial appraisal gap and to address the long-term undervaluation of neighborhoods of color.”Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Merkley (D-MA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tina Smith (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Dwight Evans (D-PA), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Donald Beyer (D-VA), Sanford Bishop, Jr. (D-GA), Deborah Ross (D-NC), Cindy Axne (D-IA), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Grace Meng (D-NY), Bill Foster (D-IL), Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Bobby L.

Even following the substantial decline in wealth after the 2008 housing downturn, the net worth of homeowners has significantly outpaced that of renters over time. In fact, it is estimated that the typical homeowner today has a net worth that is about 40 times higher than that of the typical renter.  The Appraisal Institute, the global association representing nearly 17,000 real estate appraisers, recently expressed the need to confront “unconscious valuation bias,” which results in home appraisers assessing lower home values to communities of color due to an area’s racial makeup. A 2018 Brookings Institution study found that homes in neighborhoods where the share of the population is 50 percent black are valued at roughly half the price as homes in neighborhoods with no black residents.  The same study found that differences in home and neighborhood quality do not completely explain the disparities in property values. The report also stated that “homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities are worth 23 percent less in majority black neighborhoods, compared to those with very few or no black residents” and “across all majority black neighborhoods, owner-occupied homes are undervalued by $48,000 per home on average, amounting to $156 billion in cumulative losses.” There remain significant disparities in homeownership rates between white families and families of color. Years of discriminatory policies—such as segregation, limited access to federally-backed mortgages, and restrictive neighborhood covenants—have created significant barriers to homeownership for families of color. These structural factors continue to exist today, where there is now an estimated 50-year high in the gap between black and white homeownership rates, as well as persistent gaps for Asian, Hispanic, and Native households. Given the critical connection between homeownership and wealth, as well as the longstanding structural barriers to homeownership for families of color, it is crucial that appraisers accurately and impartially assess the values of Americans’ homes. Therefore, we encourage FFIEC to work with appraisers to reduce the racial appraisal gap and to address the long-term undervaluation of neighborhoods of color. The Appraisal Institute has recently acknowledged the need to address the issue of racial bias in the appraisal industry and committed to diversifying the appraisal profession, and we urge  FFIEC and its respective member agencies – the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) – to consider near- and long-term structural reforms to address and meaningfully reduce racial bias and improve impartiality in home valuations for communities of color.    We look forward to working with you to address the issue of racial disparities in home valuations and to create more equitable outcomes for communities of color.

In February, Klobuchar led a bipartisan letter to the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urging the Agency to restore integrity to the Renewable Fuel Standard.Earlier this month, Klobuchar and Grassley led a letter urging Tom Vilsack, Secretary of the USDA, to use the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and other resources to aid the nation’s biofuel industry. # # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/following-call-from-senator-klobuchar-usda-to-assist-biofuel-producers-hurt-by-the-pandemic"

I would also like to acknowledge, in addition to Senator Merkley, two of our other members who are new to this committee and are new to the Senate: Senator Ossoff, who along with Senator Warnock was elected in Georgia, where we all know election issues were front and center, as well as Senator Padilla, who has his own extensive experience with these issues from his time as California’s Secretary of State.Last month when we held this Committee’s organizing meeting, I announced that the For the People Act would be the subject of our first legislative hearing. I am also pleased that we took part in very constructive hearings along with the Homeland Security Committee on the January 6 attack on the Capitol and our productive work Senator Blunt and I are doing together on oversight and investigations of that day is continuing. In the end that insurrection was about an angry mob working to undermine our democracy and it reminds all of us how very fragile our democracy truly is, and how it is on all of us to not just protect that democracy, but to ensure that it thrives. And that democracy is due for some rejuvenation.This bill is essential to protecting every American’s right to vote, getting dark money out of our elections, as well as some very important anti-corruption reforms. It is about strengthening our democracy by returning it to the hands of its rightful owners: the American people. As I said from the stage on the Inauguration Day, on that beautiful day which Senator Blunt did so much to make a success, under that bright blue sky at the very place where you could still see the spray paint on the bottom of the columns and the makeshift windows that were put in place, I said: This is the day our democracy picks itself up, brushes off the dust, and does what America always does: goes forward as one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Well we can’t do that if anyone's vote is suppressed.At a time when the right to vote is under attack and special interests and dark money are drowning out the voices of the American people, we need to take action.Last November, in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of a public health crisis, nearly 160 million Americans voted – more people than ever before. In part because the methods of voting – specifically ways that we made it easier to vote – were extended in states across the country. That was an extraordinary thing.That was progress. But what was the result? Well just since the beginning of this year, now over 300 bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the country in nearly every state, including my own home state of Minnesota, efforts have been made to suppress the vote. Efforts have been made to introduce bills that would suppress the vote. So, as Senator Warnock said in his maiden speech on the Senate floor last week, what’s happening? “Some people don’t want some people to vote.” That’s what’s happening.To take two examples: A dozen states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, have introduced legislation to limit access to vote by mail, which is how 45 percent of voters cast their ballots in the last election. And 14 states have introduced legislation to make it easier to purge voters from the rolls.At the same time, the huge sums of money spent on elections are drowning out the voices of voters. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending for the 2020 election cycle was approximately $14 billion dollars – more than double the 2016 cycle. And dark money also continues to flood our elections, denying voters their ability to know who is trying to influence their vote.  These are real threats to our democracy and the For the People Act takes them head-on in a common sense way to return power to the people.That is why the American people overwhelmingly support the provisions of this bill.According to a Pew poll from last year, 65 percent of respondents said the option to vote early or absentee should be available to any voter. A poll from the Campaign Legal Center found that 83 percent of likely voters support public disclosure of contributions to organizations involved in elections. A recent Morning Consult poll found that 57 percent of voters support requiring states to establish non-partisan redistricting commissions.These are not new ideas. Many of the provisions in this bill have already been adopted across the country in red, blue, and purple states and have the support of Republican and Democratic governors and election officials. They should be extended to all people in America.21 states have same-day voter registration, including red states like Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. Kentucky’s Republican Secretary of State just recently praised a bill that would make early in-person voting permanent. He called it the “most significant election-reform legislation in the past quarter-century.” 20 states have automatic voter registration laws, including Alaska and Georgia. Even Ohio’s Republican Secretary of State has called for automatic voter registration in his state.45 states allowed all voters to vote by mail in the November election and 43 states have early voting. They should all have early voting.What this bill does is to take the best of the best and simply puts in place minimum standards.And I note, it’s not just bipartisan support in the states: there are nine bipartisan bills that are part of the For the People Act, including the Honest Ads Act, a bill that Senator Graham and I have long tried to get passed along with Senator Warner, a member of this committee.I am focused on having a productive discussion of what is in the bill before us and how we will address the real challenges our democracy is facing. Based on what some of my colleagues say, I think I want to briefly respond ahead of time to that.We may hear about voter fraud – despite the fact that experts have found that voter impersonation fraud is so rare that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter impersonation fraud.We may hear about alleged problems with the 2020 election – despite the fact that in November the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, along with state and local officials across the country, called the 2020 elections “the most secure in American history.”We may hear about federal overreach – despite the fact that Article I, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution empowers Congress to “make or alter,” those are the words of the Constitution, rules for federal elections “at any time.”We may hear about alleged violations of the First Amendment – despite the fact that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that disclaimer and disclosure requirements are constitutional, and that the Court has never held that there is a constitutional right to spend anonymously on elections.And we may hear about taxpayer funding of campaigns – despite the fact that this bill includes a provision stating explicitly that no taxpayer money should be used to fund campaigns.The subject of this hearing – the very health of our democracy – is simply too important to allow these types of misrepresentations go unaddressed. At its core, the For the People Act is about three simple ideas: making voting easier, getting big money out of politics, and strengthening ethics rules. These are not radical proposals. These are ideas that nearly everyone in this country agrees with. And this bill, we can make them a reality and ensure that Americans have a democracy that works for them.With that, I am honored to turn it over to Ranking Member Blunt. Thank you.# # #Permalink: https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/3/chairwoman-klobuchar-kicks-off-first-senate-hearing-on-for-the-people-act-to-strengthen-democracy-make-it-easier-to-vote-and-end-influence-of-dark-money-in-politics"
