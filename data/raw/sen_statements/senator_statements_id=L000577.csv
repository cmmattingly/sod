https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/9/lee-leads-letter-addressing-conflicts-of-interest-at-the-ftc,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Sens. Grassley, Blackburn, Tillis, Cotton, Lummis, Cruz, and Scott, sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan expressing concerns over the agency’s use of unpaid consultants. Earlier that month an FTC Inspector General report found that the FTC, despite making wide use of unpaid consultants, lacked any organized policy or procedures to prevent “unpaid consultants and experts involvement in inherently governmental functions.” The letter asked the FTC to respond to a series of questions to assist Congress in its oversight of the agency. Chairwoman Khan responded on September 9th.The FTC’s responses and supporting materials revealed that five of its unpaid consultants are current or former employees of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit funded by progressive philanthropy organizations like the Omidyar Network, Ford Foundation, and MacArthur foundation. In addition, three of FTC’s unpaid consultants are concurrently working for tech companies that compete with companies subject to FTC jurisdiction.Of the response, Sen. Lee said, “These are inexcusable conflicts of interest, and call for vigorous congressional oversight,” Sen. Lee continued, “We cannot surrender our antitrust enforcement policy to far-left activists. I look forward to addressing these concerns with Chairwoman Khan next week.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/9/senator-lee-introduces-the-no-cbdc-act,"Senator Lee introduced legislation to prevent the Federal Reserve from reshaping the U.S. financial sector and spying on every consumer transaction. The Fed, with encouragement from the Biden Administration, has begun to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a cryptocurrency, minted, issued, and controlled by them, that would alter the ability of financial institutions to function as lenders, while giving the federal government knowledge of every purchase that uses a CBDC. Financial institutions could no longer offer loans since they would bear no risk for a deposit – they would function merely as wallets, holders of a CBDC – and as such, could not extend deposits to prospective borrowers in the form of loans. Moreover, since the Federal Reserve would be the sole operator and overseer of a U.S. CBDC, the bank would have knowledge of every purchase using the cryptocurrency; if it maintains the technology needed to create the CBDC, it will know how it is used. CLICK HERE for a One-Pager on the bill."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/9/lee-introduces-bill-to-protect-communities-from-drone-threats,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Stopping Harmful Incidents to Enforce Lawful Drone Use (SHIELD-U) Act to equip state and local law enforcement with the authority needed to protect their citizens and communities from drone threats.The need to respond to drone threats is increasing as commercial and personal use becomes more widespread. Sen. Lee’s legislation gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with state and local law enforcement, the authority to detect, identify, and mitigate drone threats on commercial service airport property, including the airspace involved in the takeoff and landing of aircraft. It further grants state and local law enforcement similar counter drone authority within their respective jurisdiction.Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “State and local law enforcement agencies cannot ensure the safety of their communities when the federal government restricts their ability to respond to active drone threats. Rather than waiting on the federal government, which often lacks the resources and capital to respond to threats effectively, this bill grants local authorities the latitude to quickly identify and mitigate threats.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/8/lee-opposes-plan-to-cancel-student-debt,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) opposes President Biden’s plan to cancel a portion of federal student debt. Lee offered the statement below following the plan’s announcement.""President Biden’s plan to cancel student debt is yet another reckless spending policy during a period of dangerous inflation. This plan will hurt everyone, including those the policy purports to help. Canceling debt will do little to ease America’s economic burden and will instead fuel inflation, increase the cost of education, and further the divide between the rich and poor. This sets a dangerous precedent and misleads future borrowers who presume additional forgiveness is inevitable."""
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/8/lee-denounces-so-called-inflation-reduction-act,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee denounced Senate Democrat's passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The bill spends hundreds of billions of dollars and raises taxes at a time when inflation has grown to 9.1% nationally and nearly 15% in Utah.Democrats passed President Biden's legislation through what's known as the budget reconciliation process, meaning the bill could pass with a simple majority rather than the sixty votes customarily needed to advance legislation. The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Inflation Reduction Act will raise taxes by $313 billion over the next ten years. The Penn Wharton budget model broke this down and concluded that this bill has no deficit reduction until at least 2027.Sen. Lee was joined by all of his Republican colleagues in rejecting the legislation.Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, ""You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and you certainly shouldn't judge this bill by its title. Despite its name, this bill will not reduce inflation."" Sen. Lee continued, ""American families cannot afford the Biden administration's latest tax and spend scheme. If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results, then spending more money and increasing taxes to reduce inflation meets that definition.""Ahead of the late-night kickoff of the amendment process known as vote-a-rama, various GOP Senators took to the Senate floor to voice their opposition to the bill.Sen. Crapo (R-ID) said, “It's too many taxes, too much spending, too big of a burden on American people across all income categories. if anything, the taxes will drive prices up. Madam president, I encourage all of my colleagues to reject this reckless bill.”Sen. Lankford (R-OK) said, “It doesn't reduce the deficit. They joined in the chorus talking about the beauty of the emperor's new clothes. I'm willing to say what a lot of people in this room know in their gut but they're afraid to say, it doesn't reduce inflation, it doesn't reduce the deficit, the emperor has no clothes. Let's reject this bill.”Sen. Blackburn (R-TN) said, “These hundreds of billions of dollars will serve a purpose, but not to reduce inflation or bring relief. Blue states, unions, radical activists will once again come out on top. Meanwhile, families, working hard to make ends meet, workers, business owners, local leaders are still on the verge of losing everything.”Sen. Portman (R-OH) said, “The nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, not a partisan group, nonpartisan, says this will hurt Americans in every tax bracket. They say more than half of the burden of the over $300 billion in new taxes will fall on folks making less than $400,000 a year. Well, that directly contradicts promises made not to increase taxes on Americans at that level.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/8/lee-laments-democrat-s-rejection-of-pilt-amendment,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) lamented the rejection of his amendment to the so-called Inflation Reduction Act that would have instituted a supplemental PILT payment over the next ten years.In Utah, the federal government owns 66.48% of the total land. Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) are federal payments to local governments designed to offset losses in property taxes due to nontaxable federal lands within their boundaries. However, these payments are far lower than what local governments could expect to collect in property taxes. To regard PILT payments as tax equivalents in Utah cities, they would need to be 262 times larger.Sen. Lee's amendment would have increased PILT payments by nearly 10%. Due to the unprecedented inflation caused by the Biden administration, local governments need this forgone revenue more than ever.  Sen. Lee said, ""For far too long, the federal government has short-changed local governments who have had to forgo property taxes due to massive swaths of federal land within their boundaries. Locals have experienced profound losses in revenue under a system that is not equitable or fair. My amendment would have helped alleviate this imbalance. While not a full tax equivalent, President Biden's policies have created record-breaking inflation, and local governments need the help now. It’s a shame that Democrats, particularly those with constituencies who stand to benefit from this amendment, have voted to continue short-changing Americans.”"

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/lee-resolution-recognizes-pregnancy-centers,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a Resolution designating the week of November 7th as “National Pregnancy Center Week.” Pregnancy Resource Centers are a vital resource to women across the country, providing a wide range of healthcare services to those in need. Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) introduced a companion resolution in the House. Of the Resolution, Sen. Lee said, “In light of recent attacks on pregnancy centers across the country, this timely resolution recognizes the unsung heroes dedicated to providing critical services to women across the country. These centers go above and beyond the call of duty, providing services such as free pregnancy testing, ultrasounds, counseling, and education. I’m humbled by their efforts and honored to support their life-affirming work.”The full list of Senate cosponsors includes: Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC),  Mike Braun (R-IN), James Risch (R- ID), Deb Fischer (R- NE), Ted Cruz (R- TX), Marco Rubio (R- FL), Josh Hawley (R- MO), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R- MS), Tommy Tuberville (R- AL), Roger Wicker (R- MS), Ben Sasse (R- NE), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), James Inhofe (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Tod Young (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Tim Scott (R-SC).Support from outside groups includes: the Susan B. Anthony List, March for Life, CatholicVote, Heritage Action, Family Research Council, U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, Catholic Charities USA, Pregnancy Medical Clinic/Journey Clinic, Pregnancy Resource Center of Salt Lake City.Hon. Marilyn Musgrave of SBA Pro-Life America said, “Over 2,700 pregnancy centers across the country lovingly provide hope, encouragement, and vital medical and material support for women and families. We commend Senator Lee and Congressman Good for highlighting the important work these nonprofits do by recognizing ‘National Pregnancy Center Week.’ We hope all of Congress will join them, and we thank them for their continued courage and commitment to protecting unborn children and mothers.”Jeanne F. Mancini, President of March for Life said, “Pregnancy Resource Centers perform lifesaving and life-changing work across our nation every day, providing free resources and compassionate support to women and families in need. In this post-Roe era, such work should be applauded. Instead, these centers are being targeted by the far left with an increasing number of attacks involving violence and vandalism, and they are the subject of a harmful misinformation campaign. We are grateful to Senator Mike Lee and Representative Bob Good for introducing this timely resolution heralding the heroic and transformative contributions of Pregnancy Resource Centers.”Tom McClusky, Director of Government Affairs of CatholicVote said, “For decades pregnancy resource centers have disproven the lie that those who are pro-life only care for the unborn. In every state these centers greatly outnumber the abortion mills - all while offering guidance, shelter and much needed support to parents and children. PRCs are the very powerful heart of the pro-life movement, which is why Democrats and their allies target them with violence and threats.” Mary Szoch, Director of the Center for Human Dignity of Family Research Council said, “Each year, thousands of women find themselves unexpectedly pregnant with no one to turn to. Pregnancy resource centers (PRC) provide vital support for these women offering free ultrasounds, STD testing, parenting classes, post-abortion support, diapers, baby clothes, and most importantly a loving, listening friend. From the moment a woman enters a PRC, she is surrounded with compassion, support, and care. The work of these centers changes the lives of many women and saves the lives of countless children. Now that state laws protecting life in the womb are going into effect, the work of PRCs supporting moms and their babies is more important than ever. Many more moms will experience the gift of life—and PRCs will be right there to help them every step of the way. Family Research Council is proud to support PRCs across the country and is grateful to Sen. Lee and Rep. Good for their resolution calling for national recognition of this heroic work.”Heartbeat International issued a statement saying, “We thank Representative Good and Senator Lee for celebrating the vital work that pregnancy help centers do every day. As we have entered into a post-Roe world, the work of these centers is all the more important as they walk alongside families throughout the pregnancy and beyond, blessing them with pregnancy tests, emotional support, ultrasounds, parenting classes, and so much more at no cost. We at Heartbeat International are proud to partner with pregnancy help centers as they offer true compassion and support so that a woman never feels alone, coerced, or so hopeless that she ends her child’s life through abortion.”Anthony Granado of Catholic Charities USA said, “We appreciate the attention of Sen. Lee and the U.S. Senate to the plight of women and families facing unexpected pregnancies that may leave them in straitened circumstances. As one of the nation’s largest social services providers, Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) supports those policies, agencies and initiatives that shine a light on the needs of pregnant women and their children, especially those who are living on the margins and facing an increasingly tentative daily existence. We also continue to call for strong social supports — including food, health and housing policies — that uplift and promote the welfare of all. This call is consistent with our Catholic faith and values, with our mission to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and with the teachings of the Gospels.” For full text of the Resolution, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/lee-amendments-bolster-child-online-safety,"Washington, D.C. – During a markup focused on protecting children’s online privacy, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) offered thirteen amendments, nine of which the Senate Commerce Committee adopted. Lee’s amendments were adopted as part of Sen. Blumenthal’s (D- CT) and Sen. Blackburn’s (R-TN) Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and provide additional regulatory safeguards and protections for children online. Sen. Lee voted in favor of pushing KOSA out of committee while noting the work still needed to improve the bill. Sen. Lee’s amendments bolster KOSA by strengthening transparency surrounding risks posed to children. It adds flexibility and clarifies algorithmic child safeguards. The amendments contain regulatory aspects that protect from overly burdensome regulations while defending intellectual property. Additionally, they restrict unelected FTC bureaucrats from mission creep. Of his amendments, Sen. Lee said, “I have long been concerned with protecting children online, and it remains one of my most important priorities. I believe that we are at our best when we carefully consider our legislative response, don’t rush a complicated product, and openly debate the complex issues before us.” Sen. Lee continued, “So, I look forward to working with my colleagues post-markup with the anticipation that we can resolve these issues, advance this bill on the floor, and most importantly – protect the safety of children online.”"

Ridge Alkonis was forced to leave his wife and three children to report to Japanese prison. An American serviceman had to explain to his kids that although he did nothing wrong, he had to leave them for three years. While serving his country in Japan, Lt. Alkonis was involved in a car accident resulting from a medical emergency. The accident left two people dead. I speak sincerely when I say my deepest sympathies are with their families, friends, and loved ones. I can’t begin to imagine their sense of loss, confusion, hurt, and anger associated with this horrific accident.   It’s important to note, however, that this was an accident. In no way, shape or form do the facts of the case suggest otherwise. Yet, the Japanese court continues to insist that Lt. Alkonis had some culpability. They continue to float the false narrative that he fell asleep while driving. This is simply not true. The accident occurred at 1:00 p.m. in broad daylight. Lt. Alkonis was well rested and had no reason to be tired or drowsy. In fact, he was having a conversation with his daughter when he passed out mid-sentence. He remained unconscious despite his daughter’s attempts to yell, scream, and kick his seat. Alkonis did not wake to his daughter’s cries, nor did he wake upon impact. No matter how deep a sleeper, anyone would be awoken by either. But he did not. He remained unconscious even after the collision. Eyewitnesses reported that Lt. Alkonis’s color had drained from his face, consistent with someone who has suffered from a syncopal episode. He was too weak to open his car door after finally regaining consciousness. It’s disingenuous that Judge Kumiko Maesawa would offer such a simplistic view by stating that he should have pulled over if he felt drowsy. It flies in the face of the evidence and the experiences of everyone at the scene, including his family, who were present. The comments are even more egregious considering the Japanese government didn’t so much as bother to conduct an adequate investigation following the crash. He was even denied a medical evaluation before the Japanese police subjected him to 26 days of detention and interrogation before he was charged.  The United States Navy did conduct an investigation and concluded that Lt. Alkonis lost consciousness from Acute Mountain Sickness. There were no drugs or alcohol involved in the crash. Yet, even after the Navy concluded that he was not at fault, Lt. Alkonis did everything within his power to remedy the situation. He has paid over one and a half million dollars to the victims’ families, consistent with the Japanese gomenasai tradition. He has expressed sincere and deep remorse. Despite all of the mitigating circumstances, despite the deep remorse, despite using every resource at his disposal to make it right, he is still in prison. I find it inexcusable that an American who experienced a medical emergency be treated so poorly by an allied Nation that he protected. Japanese nationals convicted of the same crime are routinely granted leniency. In fact, 95% of similarly charged defendants get a suspended sentence. Meaning they do not serve prison time. Clearly, the Japanese judicial system is trying to make an example of Lt. Alkonis stemming from a history of disputes over our Status of Forces agreement. An agreement  that has nothing to do with him. How can we ensure justice for the thousands of American men and women who serve our country abroad when they face prejudice because of their status as American servicemen and women? Lt. Alkonis represents our best. If our servicemembers can’t get fair treatment from the country they have been tasked to defend, maybe it’s time to revisit features of our Status of Forces agreement with Japan. Ambassador Emanuel, Secretary Blinken, and the Department of Defense should immediately take every step possible to negotiate with their Japanese counterparts and bring Ridge home.  "
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-lee-calls-for-the-release-of-lt-alkonis,"Washington, D.C. - Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) called upon U.S. officials to negotiate with their Japanese counterparts and secure the release of Lt. Ridge Alkonis. While serving in Japan, Lt. Alkonis was involved in a deadly car accident that the U.S. Navy determined was caused by the sudden onset of Acute Mountain Sickness. Subsequently, the Japanese court sentenced him to three years imprisonment. Sen. Lee expressed his deepest sympathies for the victims’ families while noting that an American servicemember should not be disproportionately punished for an accident resulting from a medical emergency. Of Lt. Alkonis’s imprisonment, Sen. Lee said, “I find it nothing short of inexcusable that an American who experienced a medical emergency should be treated so poorly by an allied nation that he’s protecting.” Sen.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/university-of-utah-research-park-act-passes-committee," Washington, D.C. - Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) University of Utah Research Park Act passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today with a bipartisan vote. This bill would preserve the University of Utah’s nearly 600-acre research park and avoid possible action by the Bureau of Land Management to repurpose the land. Research Park is a center for research and development serving both the University and the local workforce. Research Park is situated on a parcel of land which was transferred to the University by the Bureau of Land Management in 1968. Sen. Lee’s bill would remove an encumbrance from that land patent to ensure Research Park remains productive and thriving. The bill is now eligible for consideration by the full Senate. Sen. Lee said, “This simple fix will protect the good work and learning that takes place at Research Park. The Park is home to cutting-edge companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, and manufacturing spaces. The work they do provides for innovation in their fields and offers first-class opportunities for students to work and learn alongside experts. For the good of Utah and the world, this work must continue.” After sponsoring companion legislation in the House, Rep. Chris Stewart said, “The important work being done at the University of Utah provides our state with invaluable innovations. I’m proud to stand beside Senator Lee in support of this legislation. And I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in protecting research that will continue to benefit communities across the country.” University of Utah President Taylor Randall said, “Since its establishment in 1968, Research Park has become a key component in the university’s mission to foster innovation, advance science and contribute to Utah’s strong economy. The forethought of state and federal leaders in making this investment of land to the university has reaped extraordinary success and resulted in a myriad of scientific discoveries and companies that have improved the health and well-being of all Americans. This public-private partnership remains a case study in how major research universities can contribute to the success of their communities. I support this legislation and the resulting positive impact it will have on the university and our state.” In a letter to Sen. Lee, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said, “I appreciate your sponsorship of The University of Utah Research Park Act to help Utah and the University of Utah to clean up an encumbrance to the University’s ownership and use of land for Research Park.” Gov. Cox continued, “I appreciate your hard work and attention to the needs of our state.” In a letter to Sen. Lee, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said, “On behalf of Salt Lake City, I support this legislation and look forward to continued partnerships that enhance the quality of life and opportunities for the citizens of Salt Lake.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-lee-s-formula-act-heads-to-president-s-desk,"Washington, D.C. – The United States Senate unanimously passed Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) FORMULA Act.  The bill, which removes import tariffs on baby formula and baby formula input products until the end of this year now heads to the President’s desk.  The House of Representatives had previously modified and passed the bill resulting in Senate reconsideration.  The national baby formula crisis has only worsened in recent weeks with millions of American families struggling to feed their infants.  The out-of-stock rate in Utah stores has reached as high as 90% during the crisis.  Senator Lee’s complete plan to combat the crisis includes the tariff suspension among other solutions. Of the bill’s passage, Sen. Lee said, “Passing the FORMULA Act will be an incredible win for families and hungry babies nationwide. It will make meaningful headway that is desperately needed today. By suspending the tariff on formula imports, we are providing cheaper access to formulas to individual consumers and retailers alike.” Lee continued, “This relief has been long overdue, particularly for Utahns, who have the largest families, the most children per capita, and the highest birth rate in the nation.”  Lead House sponsor, Chairman Earl Blumenaur (D-OR) said, “Suspending tariffs on the importation of infant formula and relieving parents of steep price increases is a critical step to ending the infant formula shortage. This crisis requires a whole government response. The Biden Administration has taken important steps to increase supply and I applaud the FDA’s actions to import more formula. Now Congress must act to temporarily remove tariff barriers so families can access affordable formula.” Ranking Member Adrian Smith (R-NE) said, “The Formula Act makes infant formula more accessible and affordable by allowing it to be imported duty-free through the end of the year. Families should never have to experience the despair of worrying whether shelves will be stocked with the formula they need to feed their infants. As a father of two, including a one-year-old, nothing is more important than the health and well-being of children. I will continue to work with my colleagues to use trade tools to strengthen critical supply chains, like infant formula.” Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) said, “America’s mothers and fathers need help. This should never be a concern in our great nation, but young families are hunting from store to store to feed their infants. Red tape led to the culmination of the baby formula crisis, and removing it is our best way out. I’m so proud to say that Congress has drafted bipartisan legislation that temporarily waives trade tariffs, allows for the importation of safe baby formula, and increases formula options here at home. I look forward to President Biden signing this critical, bipartisan bill into law.” House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee member, Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) said, “The baby formula crisis underscores the fragility of our supply chains when there is intense industry consolidation. Washington state in particular has felt the brunt of the formula shortage with parents facing empty shelves earlier and more acutely than other states. Parents should never struggle to feed their kids. This legislation will help alleviate this crisis by lowering the price of imported baby formula from safe and trusted partners abroad while our domestic production catches up.” For video of Lee’s remarks, click HERE.For text of Lee’s remarks as prepared, click HERE.For full text of the legislation, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-lee-s-formula-act-heads-to,"Mr. President, For months, American babies have endured an unprecedented and prolonged formula shortage. Some doctors have called this the worst crisis of their careers. It has become so widespread that nearly everyone knows someone that has been personally affected. Desperate parents have scoured online marketplaces, reached out to family and friends for help, and paid exorbitant markups to feed their babies. In worst-case scenarios, some resorted to dangerous homemade formulas. Mr. President, in the United States of America, no parent should be left to wonder how they will feed their newborn baby. After months of work and bipartisan collaboration with my colleagues in the House and Senate, I rise to pass needed reforms that will provide relief to hungry babies. Today, we can take action to alleviate a crisis largely of the federal government’s creation. Poor governance has crippled our domestic formula market. Tariffs and regulations have prevented safe foreign formulas from entering the United States. Currently, the government imposes a 17.5% minimum tariff on formula imports. This tariff has stifled competition. But it doesn’t have to be that way. We can lift these substantial tariffs on the importation of baby formulas and reduce the costs borne by retailers to provide access to safe, affordable formula. Doing so will expand the severely limited formula options for American consumers. This modified version of the FORMULA Act, does just that by waiving these tariffs through the end of the year. While passing my bill will provide immediate relief, our work is far from complete. I’m committed to doing everything I can, not only to provide this temporary relief but to make the necessary additional reforms to our system to ensure a crisis like this never arises again. We still have work to do. We must further our efforts by allowing WIC recipients to buy whatever brand of formula is available. We must make meaningful reforms to how the FDA regulates the formula industry. Passing my bill is the first step. In the meantime, I’m actively working on expanding the list of products to receive temporary relief from tariffs. While this is an important first step, it is certainly not the last. This crisis is such that American babies cannot wait any longer than they already have. We have a moral obligation to these infants to say that we did everything we could to fight for them. Mr. President, passing the FORMULA Act will be an incredible win for families and hungry babies nationwide. It will make meaningful headway that is desperately needed today. By suspending the tariff on formula imports, we are providing cheaper access to individual consumers and retailers alike. This relief has been long overdue, particularly for Utahns, who have the largest families, the most children per capita, and the highest birth rate. I’m grateful for the countless hours of behind-the-scenes work and successful negotiations with my colleagues in the House and Senate, which have resulted in a win for the most vulnerable Americans. I look forward to continuing this important work with them. Passing my FORMULA Act is a victory for families and babies everywhere."

Mike Lee (R-UT) stood against high energy prices today in asking the Senate to pass his bill reaffirming the law to limit the President’s authority to delay or forgo legally required sales of energy leases on federal land.  Sen. Lee was joined in this effort by Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK).  Utah is currently facing some of the highest gas prices in the nation with an average price over five dollars a gallon. President Biden and his administration have used court challenges, so-called reviews, and other tactics to delay or prevent legally required sales of oil and gas leases on federal land and in federally controlled waters.  This delay, along with other Biden Administration policies, has constrained the available domestic supply of energy and placed energy suppliers in Utah and elsewhere in difficult economic circumstances. Sen. Lee said of the bill, “The American people cannot endure President Biden’s clear-as-mud policies any longer.  I’ve introduced legislation to reaffirm that under the Mineral Leasing Act, the President absolutely does not have the authority to hold the country’s domestic energy production hostage.”  Sen. Lee continued, “We can end this crusade today and get to work securing American energy independence for generations to come.” For video of Lee’s remarks, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-lee-fights-biden-s-war-on-energy,"Mr. President,President Biden has wasted no time embarking on his crusade to hamstring American energy production. On day one of his presidency, he halted all new oil and gas lease sales on federal land. Now, Americans are paying the price. Across the nation, people struggle to fill their gas tanks as prices climb to over $5 a gallon. But, Mr. President, there’s apparently no need to worry. According to the President, Americans’ pain at the pump is merely part of an energy “transition.” It’s important to note that this is a transition away from affordable, reliable, fossil fuels. It’s not that high gas prices are a problem to be fixed, rather, high gas prices are the solution. The President is getting the results he wants.Despite this being part of the plan, it didn't take long for the President to realize how unpopular high gas prices are. Now, he’s trying to take credit for a slight reduction in gas prices. First, by no means is this reduction sufficient. Second, we can't attribute that reduction to the President's policies.To be clear, placing a moratorium on the sale of oil and gas leases is outside the President’s authority. If the President actually possessed that authority, he wouldn’t have attempted to portray this as a temporary pause. It’s clear this is a thinly veiled attempt to enact the most radical climate policies our country has ever seen.Our suspicions were confirmed when Gina McCarthy, the President’s climate advisor, said during an interview, “President Biden remains absolutely committed to not moving forward with additional drilling on public lands.” So much for a temporary moratorium. Confused as to whether Ms. McCarthy’s statement represented the administration’s policy, I asked Interior Secretary Deb Haaland whether it was indeed their intention to indefinitely pause the sale of all federal oil and gas leases. She responded, “I don’t know.” “I don’t know,” Mr. President, is not an acceptable answer to the Utah communities who rely on those oil and gas leases. “I don’t know” is not an acceptable answer to Americans paying over $5 for a gallon of gas.The American people cannot endure President Biden’s clear-as-mud policies any longer. I’ve introduced legislation to re-affirm that under the Mineral Leasing Act, the President absolutely does not have the authority to hold the country’s domestic energy production hostage. Their continued efforts are coming at the expense of struggling families. The Biden administration is fighting in court for Presidential authority to enact sweeping changes to American energy policy on a whim. While I believe the courts will arrive at the same conclusion, we can act now to ensure citizens and companies receive the certainty they deserve.

Mike Lee (R-UT) sought passage of his Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act as a part of his continued effort to counter rising inflation.  Utah families are feeling the pains of inflation more acutely than those from almost all other states.  This week’s Consumer Price Index grew beyond expectations placing inflation at a staggering 9.1% nationally.  Sen. Lee’s PRICE Act would require a three-fifths supermajority vote in the Senate to pass new spending measures when inflation is deemed to be above 3% nationally.  This bill constitutes a pillar of Lee’s detailed plan to fight inflation.  Government spending, especially deficit spending, is considered a major contributor to inflation. Sen. Lee delivered floor remarks and asked that the Senate unanimously pass the PRICE Act.  While the proposal was objected to and accordingly did not pass, Sen. Lee committed to continue his efforts to pass the PRICE Act and to enact the other provisions of his plan to fight inflation. Sen. Lee said of the bill, “The PRICE Act is desperately needed. This insatiable spending machine is now costing Utahns 881 dollars a month more than they paid last year, and that’s on top of what they already pay in taxes.” Lee continued, “Congress has become the trust fund baby that doesn’t understand the value of a dollar. The PRICE act is the recognition that sometimes you need to take away the credit card.” For video of Lee’s remarks, click HERE.For text of Lee’s remarks as prepared, click HERE.For a one-pager of the PRICE Act, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/the-price-act,"Madame. President,We’ve broken another record. Unfortunately, not the kind to boast about. Last week, the latest Consumer Price Index exceeded inflation expectations at a staggering 9.1%. In Utah, that rate is much higher.The Biden administration’s evolving blame game has shifted its focus from the pandemic to the supply chain, from the supply chain to Putin. But there is a more coherent answer: government continues to spend more than it has. Last year, Congress spent 6.8 trillion dollars, while collecting just over 4 trillion in revenue. With the return of legislative ear marks, pork-barrel spending has increased over 1700%.Rather than recognizing the problems associated with spending more than it brings in, the government simply prints itself more money. Like a child stricken with affluenza, rather than being cut off, the government simply helps itself to more money. It doesn’t take long to lose the value of a dollar when you’re not spending your own money. Government is no different. While hardworking Americans pinch pennies, lawmakers spend carelessly. To pay for their next project, they threaten to raise taxes. When they don’t have the support to raise taxes, they nevertheless continue to spend and drive-up inflation. Inflation is nothing but an invisible tax on the people.With no action, the reckless spending will drive us off a financial cliff. I have consistently called for a balanced budget amendment. But, our spending trajectory is such that we cannot afford to wait for the consensus needed to pass a constitutional amendment. While hardworking Americans wait, I’ve introduced the Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act to stop the bleeding. The PRICE Act requires a three-fifths majority of Senators to approve new spending measures when the nation’s inflation rate is at or above 3%.The PRICE Act is desperately needed. This insatiable spending machine is now costing Utahns 881 dollars a month more than they paid last year, and that’s on top of what they already pay in taxes. Those are 881 dollars for which Utahns receive nothing in return. It represents money that could be spent toward their mortgage, toward their child’s college education, towards filling their empty gas tank. Instead, millions of Americans will look at the skyrocketing cost of living and determine they must sacrifice their wants just to meet their needs.My PRICE Act flips the script. It doesn’t altogether prevent lawmakers from spending when inflation is above 3%, but it requires lawmakers to offset that spending with cuts from somewhere else. In essence, it puts the impetus on Congress to weigh its legislative wants against the legislative needs of the American people.That’s because for everyone living in reality, a budget means something. Failure to live within that budget has profound consequences. When Jack has to pay an extra $93 a month on food, he begins to doubt his ability to feed his family. When Jill has to pay an extra $145 a month for housing, she doubts her ability to keep a roof over her child’s head. When Joe has to pay an extra $404 dollars on transportation, he doubts his ability to get his child to and from practice. So why is it that when inflation is at 9.1%, lawmakers are still spending? As Americans are filled with financial fear and doubt, why is it that Democrats want to spend an additional trillion dollars for their Build Back Better Plan?Congress is failing to exercise self-restraint during unprecedented inflation. As Americans tighten their belts, Congress has opened the spigot. If a household ran this disaster of a budget, the family would quickly be met with foreclosures, repossessions, and bankruptcy. Ronald Reagan couldn’t have been more prescient when he described inflation as “the price we pay for those government benefits everybody thought were free.” While members tout their shiny new pet projects, Americans are footing the bill.It is unconscionable that Congress continues to pat itself on the back for passing massive spending bills while the country has a financial millstone around its neck. It’s high time that Congress subject itself to the same cutbacks working class families are facing now. Although I wish members of Congress would self-impose these restraints, the Democrats push for a new trillion-dollar spending plan shows that is unlikely to happen. Given our demonstrated lack of self-restraint, it’s time to pass the PRICE Act."

Mike Lee (R-UT) applauded the Forest Service for issuing the Record of Decision regarding the Uinta Basin Railway Project. Sen.

Local efforts were led by the 7-County Infrastructure Coalition, the Ute Indian Tribe, the UBRY company, Rio Grande Pacific Corp., and DHIP Group. The decision represents the final hurdle toward bringing the project to fruition. Sen. Lee said of the decision, “Congratulations to all who have championed the Uinta Basin Railway Project. It's high time we unleash Utah's capabilities for domestic energy production.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/7/bipartisan-formula-act-passes-house,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) applauds the passage of the bipartisan Formula Act in the US House of Representatives. The Formula Act was introduced in the House by the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, Representative Earl Blumenaur (D-OR) along with the subcommittee’s Ranking Member, Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE) and a growing list of additional cosponsors.   Recently, the US Senate unanimously passed a modified version of the FORMULA Act introduced by Sen. Lee. The FORMULA Act was created to combat domestic baby formula shortages and bolster the supply chain to help American families feed their babies. Recent shortages come in the immediate aftermath of a recall and temporary closure of a major American formula factory, but highlight systemic weaknesses in this vital supply chain. Due to the disruption, families in Utah and across the nation are struggling to feed their babies. The FORMULA Act will lift substantial tariffs on the importation of baby formula and reduce the costs borne by retailers trying to keep their shelves stocked.   Following House passage of the Formula Act, Sen. Mike Lee said, “With the highest birthrate in the nation, Utahns have particularly felt the weight of this prolonged baby formula crisis. I am thrilled to see the Formula Act pass the House with bipartisan support. We are one step closer to providing desperately needed relief to American newborns. For my part, I am committed to ensuring the bill once again passes the Senate and is signed into law.”Lead House sponsor, Chairman Blumenaur (D-OR) said, “Suspending tariffs on the importation of infant formula and relieving parents of steep price increases is a critical step to ending the infant formula shortage. This crisis requires a whole government response. The Biden Administration has taken important steps to increase supply and I applaud the FDA’s actions to import more formula. Now Congress must act to temporarily remove tariff barriers so families can access affordable formula.”Ranking Member Adrian Smith (R-NE) said, “The Formula Act makes infant formula more accessible and affordable by allowing it to be imported duty-free through the end of the year. Families should never have to experience the despair of worrying whether shelves will be stocked with the formula they need to feed their infants. As a father of two, including a one-year-old, nothing is more important than the health and well-being of children. I will continue to work with my colleagues to use trade tools to strengthen critical supply chains, like infant formula.” Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) said, “America’s mothers and fathers need help. This should never be a concern in our great nation, but young families are hunting from store to store to feed their infants. Red tape led to the culmination of the baby formula crisis, and removing it is our best way out. I’m so proud to say that Congress has drafted bipartisan legislation that temporarily waives trade tariffs, allows for the importation of safe baby formula, and increases formula options here at home. I look forward to President Biden signing this critical, bipartisan bill into law.”House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee member, Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) said, “The baby formula crisis underscores the fragility of our supply chains when there is intense industry consolidation. Washington state in particular has felt the brunt of the formula shortage with parents facing empty shelves earlier and more acutely than other states. Parents should never struggle to feed their kids. This legislation will help alleviate this crisis by lowering the price of imported baby formula from safe and trusted partners abroad while our domestic production catches up.” NOTE: Negotiations resulting in the lengthening of the tariff waiver timeline as well as certain economic implications require the Formula Act be presented anew to the US Senate. "

In Carson v. Makin, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision striking down Maine’s discriminatory tuition assistance program. Authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court ruled in favor of religious liberty and parents’ right to choose the best education for their children.Senator Lee said of the brief, “Congress and the Supreme Court have long understood the value of both religious and secular education institutions. Students should not be punished for attending a school where faith is taught, and states should not be able to discriminate against citizens who choose to live and learn their faith in school.”The brief reads in part, “Since its infancy under the Articles of Confederation, the United States of America has valued education and seen it as an integral part of a free society. To that end, Congress—entrusted with the will of the People—has worked for over two hundred years to increase educational opportunities for Americans.” and continues, “History shows that Congress repeatedly allocated funds to advance education without fear of triggering Establishment Clause concerns.”Senator Lee was joined in the brief by Senators:For full text of the brief, click HERE.For full text of the SCOTUS decision, click HERE. ###"

Lee said, “The surge of online goods has exposed some problems, systemic problems, with our supply chain.  Americans in all states are experiencing consumer product shortages, and the end doesn’t appear to be anywhere in sight.  This has contributed to inflation that is costing American families.  I am encouraged that a number of my amendments that will help get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves have become law.”Sen.

Lee said, “I am thrilled to see the bipartisan State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act unanimously pass the senate.  Putting state enforcers on equal footing with federal enforcers is an important step toward improving antitrust enforcement to better protect American consumers.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make further reforms to stop abusive monopolists.”The bill’s sponsor in the house, Rep.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/support-mounts-for-lee-s-digital-advertising-act,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), introduced the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act.  The bill would restore and protect competition in digital advertising by eliminating conflicts of interest that have allowed the leading platforms in the market to manipulate ad auctions and impose monopoly rents on a broad swath of the American economy.  The bill has also been endorsed by: Heritage Action for AmericaAmerican Principles ProjectCitizens for Renewing AmericaInternet Accountability ProjectTexas Attorney General Ken PaxtonBull Moose ProjectClare Morrell, Ethics & Public Policy Center Big Tech ProjectDigital Progress InstitutePublic KnowledgeAmerican Economic Liberties Project Quotes from the bill’s original sponsors and endorsers are below. Senator Lee said, “Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the internet economy. It supports most of the free content and services Americans have come to rely upon, including essential local journalism, and it allows businesses of every size to reach their customers quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, online advertising is also suffering under the thumb of trillion-dollar tech companies. “Companies like Google and Facebook have been able to exploit their unprecedented troves of detailed user data to obtain vice grip-like control over digital advertising, amassing power on every side of the market and using it to block competition and take advantage of their customers. The conflicts of interest are so glaring that one Google employee described Google’s ad business as being like ‘if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.’ “This lack of competition in digital advertising means that monopoly rents are being imposed upon every website that is ad-supported and every company—small, medium, or large—that relies on internet advertising to grow its business. It is essentially a tax on thousands of American businesses, and thus a tax on millions of American consumers. “While online advertising is essential to nearly every business, this broken system has been the primary driver of growth for the tech companies that have failed us in so many other ways: by undermining our privacy, censoring our speech, and exploiting our children. “That is why I have introduced this bill, and why I believe it is the first step towards liberating the internet—and therefore much of the 21st century economy—from the grip of Big Tech monopolists.” Senator Cruz said, “Free markets require competition, and America has a long history of fighting monopolies in order to guarantee that healthy competition delivers the best results, products, and services for the American people. The internet should be no different. I’m proud to work in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues, Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, and Richard Blumenthal, to guarantee customer protections in digital advertising.” Senator Klobuchar said, “For too long, Google and Facebook have dominated the digital advertising marketplace at the expense of advertisers, publishers, and consumers. It is past time for a transparent ad technology industry where the best interests of customers are prioritized and companies of all sizes are able to compete. This legislation will put rules in place to do just that, restoring and protecting competition in digital advertising to create a more even playing field that will promote fairness and innovation moving forward.” Senator Blumenthal said, “Our bipartisan bill would guard against immense conflicts of interest in today’s digital advertising market. Big Tech claims that it simply presides over an open and free market, but in a truly free market the same party can’t represent the seller, the buyer, make the rules, and conduct the auction. And that is unacceptable in a free enterprise system – it hurts consumers and it hurts competition.” Jon Schweppe, Policy Director at the American Principles Project said, “Republicans are increasingly recognizing the threat posed by Big Tech's concentrated corporate power. Senator Mike Lee in particular has been an important leader on the issue of antitrust enforcement. His Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act is well thought-out and addresses rampant anti-competitive behavior in the online ads market. American Principles Project is proud to endorse this bill, and we encourage Republicans to continue to embrace an all-of-the-above approach to reining in Big Tech.” “The basic idea of this bill is simple: no one can serve two masters,” said Matt Stoller, Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project. “As the buyer, seller, broker, and exchange, Google maintains pervasive conflicts of interest in online advertising that it uses to manipulate markets. By breaking up Google’s third party ad tech business and requiring advertising intermediaries to disclose the prices and quality of the advertising they are buying and selling, this bill will finally allow honest price discovery in markets for online advertising.” “No one would accept Goldman Sachs running the New York Stock Exchange, representing buyers of stock, and sellers of stock at the same time, just as no one would accept a lawyer representing both sides in a trial. Neither should Congress let corporations run all sides of a transaction in online ad markets,”Stoller continued. Wade Miller, Executive Director at Citizens for Renewing America said, “The days of Big Tech getting away with gaming the digital advertising system are over. Senator Mike Lee's ‘Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act’ will end the market manipulation and anticompetitive practices of some of the biggest companies in tech. Sen. Lee has shown Congress how to break-up big tech the right way. We commend his efforts and urge Congress to stop talking and start legislating.” Charlotte Slaiman, Competition Policy Director at Public Knowledge, said, “The lack of competition in online advertising technology hurts not just advertisers and publishers but also consumers who pay more for products and see lower quality news and other content online. Right now, advertising is the primary business model for much of the internet. It’s essential that online advertising be an open ecosystem with dynamic and fair competition. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act takes a remarkable step towards that ideal by breaking up the largest ad tech giants and creating common-sense rules of the road. The Competition and Transparency in Online Advertising Act from Senators Lee and Klobuchar can address gatekeeper power in ad tech and make this market function better for consumers.” Mike Davis of the Internet Accountability Project said, “For many years now, monopolist control from Facebook and Google over the ad tech market has hurt small businesses, slowed innovation and stifled competition. Passing this bill into law would help put an end to the anticompetitive practices these Big Tech monopolists rely on for their undue trillions in market control. The Internet Accountability Project thanks Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz for their leadership and dedication to the free market and antitrust principles that are critical to restoring a fair and well functioning tech economy that encourages innovation and success.”  Joel Thayer, President of the Digital Progress Institute, said, “Large tech platforms have operated under complete opacity, which has allowed them to engage in anticompetitive behavior within the digital ad market. Senator Lee’s Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act takes this issue head on by applying a meaningful and targeted framework that will not only help shed light on these practices that detrimentally harm competition in the digital ad space, but will also help open doors for smaller players by evening the odds. The Digital Progress Institute is proud to endorse this important piece of legislation.” Aiden Buzzetti, President of the Bull Moose Project, said, “The Bull Moose Project enthusiastically supports the CDTA. This is a huge step in leveling the playing field of digital advertising. For too long we have seen companies dominate this field. Senator Lee should be commended for this legislation. We hope all Republicans will support this bill.”  "

Lee said, “The United States and the United Kingdom are the closest of allies and the most natural of economic partners.  Since the British people have reclaimed the right to negotiate their own trade agreements, I have advocated for a robust trade agreement between our nations.  I am overjoyed and encouraged to see the Senate pass this resolution calling for such a mutually beneficial agreement.  Free trade between our nations would be good for Britons, for Americans, and particularly for Utahns who have such close economic ties to our friends across the pond.”"

Lee’s efforts to overturn Chair Cantwell’s rulings against the amendment were defeated on party-line, 14-14 votes. In the hearing, Sen. Lee said, “The reality remains that Democrats’ crusade against reliable, domestic energy sources has largely resulted in our current state of high energy prices. …  But instead of looking to address these negative “signals” and misguided regulatory policies that are sending our energy markets into a tailspin, the Administration as well as Senate and House Democrats are suggesting that the solution is to have more government micromanagement of our markets and that gas prices will come down if we just empower more federal bureaucrats to look over your shoulder.  In fact, House Democrats just passed legislation that unbelievably would give the federal government the power to enact what I can only call “price controls” on gasoline.”  For one-pagers of the amendments, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/lee-leads-letter-questioning-w-h-o-abortion-guidelines,"Washington, D.C. – Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Representative Doug Lamborn (R-CO) led 53 other House and Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), urging a reversal on the Organization’s recent guidelines on abortion.  These guidelines advocate for abortion on demand and critique conscious objections of healthcare providers.  The updated guidelines follow years of controversy regarding the role, allegiance, and effectiveness of the W.H.O. The letter reads in part, “We, members of the U.S. Congress, write to you today with concerns about the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) dangerous new abortion guidelines. These extreme new guidelines aim to remove all legal and policy safeguards on abortion, impose restrictions on the conscience rights of health workers, and ignore the right to life and the safety of the mother and child.…“Moreover, we are astonished that the W.H.O. is attempting to de-humanize preborn children and assert that the rights of the preborn do not exist by categorizing self-induced—and, in some cases, illegal—abortions as ‘self-care’ and demanding ‘the full decimalization of abortion’ without any gestational age limits. To categorize abortions as ‘self-care’ not only strips away the humanity and dignity of a preborn child but also contradicts international standards recognizing the preborn child as a rights-holding person.…“Furthermore, this guidance not only threatens the conscience rights of health care providers at all levels but treats individuals and institutions that object to abortion as obstacles.…“Given the W.H.O.’s influence, this guidance will likely cause severe, irreversible harm, not only to U.S. citizens but to women and children worldwide. Such overreach and trampling of national sovereignty also further delegitimizes the W.H.O. and U.N. in the eyes of many people around the world. For these reasons, we ask that the W.H.O. reverse course and retract the anti-life recommendations that it has promoted through the release of its 2022 abortion care guidelines.”Of the letter, Sen. Lee said, “The World Health Organization’s new guidelines are radical anti-life propaganda that advocate for abortion until the moment of birth while deriding conscious objections that are a hallmark of free society.  Abortion is not healthcare, and the W.H.O. should cease being a mouthpiece for the left’s radical social engineering agenda.  The W.H.O. has done enough damage to its reputation in recent years.  Our letter encourages the W.H.O. to change course and to stop using American taxpayer dollars to advocate against American interests and values globally.”Representative Lamborn said, “These new guidelines are alarming and completely disregard the sanctity of human life. Every instance of abortion is a tragedy and I hope that the World Health Organization seriously considers reversing these horrific guidelines. I will never waiver in my fight to protect the lives of the preborn, whether it be domestically or on the international stage. I thank Senator Lee for co-leading this extremely important letter and remaining strong in the fight to protect human life.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/lee-introduces-digital-advertising-act,"Washington, D.C. – Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), joined by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), has introduced the Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act. The bill would restore and protect competition in digital advertising by eliminating conflicts of interest that have allowed the leading platforms in the market to manipulate ad auctions and impose monopoly rents on a broad swath of the American economy. Senator Lee said, “Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the internet economy. It supports most of the free content and services Americans have come to rely upon, including essential local journalism, and it allows businesses of every size to reach their customers quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, online advertising is also suffering under the thumb of trillion-dollar tech companies. “Companies like Google and Facebook have been able to exploit their unprecedented troves of detailed user data to obtain vice grip-like control over digital advertising, amassing power on every side of the market and using it to block competition and take advantage of their customers. The conflicts of interest are so glaring that one Google employee described Google’s ad business as being like ‘if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE.’ “This lack of competition in digital advertising means that monopoly rents are being imposed upon every website that is ad-supported and every company—small, medium, or large—that relies on internet advertising to grow its business. It is essentially a tax on thousands of American businesses, and thus a tax on millions of American consumers. “While online advertising is essential to nearly every business, this broken system has been the primary driver of growth for the tech companies that have failed us in so many other ways: by undermining our privacy, censoring our speech, and exploiting our children. “That is why I have introduced this bill, and why I believe it is the first step towards liberating the internet—and therefore much of the 21st century economy—from the grip of Big Tech monopolists.” Senator Cruz said, “Free markets require competition, and America has a long history of fighting monopolies in order to guarantee that healthy competition delivers the best results, products, and services for the American people. The internet should be no different. I’m proud to work in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues, Mike Lee, Amy Klobuchar, and Richard Blumenthal, to guarantee customer protections in digital advertising.” Senator Klobuchar said, “For too long, Google and Facebook have dominated the digital advertising marketplace at the expense of advertisers, publishers, and consumers. It is past time for a transparent ad technology industry where the best interests of customers are prioritized and companies of all sizes are able to compete. This legislation will put rules in place to do just that, restoring and protecting competition in digital advertising to create a more even playing field that will promote fairness and innovation moving forward.” Senator Blumenthal said, “Our bipartisan bill would guard against immense conflicts of interest in today’s digital advertising market. Big Tech claims that it simply presides over an open and free market, but in a truly free market the same party can’t represent the seller, the buyer, make the rules, and conduct the auction. And that is unacceptable in a free enterprise system – it hurts consumers and it hurts competition.”For full text of the legislation, click HERE.For more detailed information, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/support-for-lee-s-formula-act," Washington, D.C. – Since introducing the Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) has received wide support from congressional colleagues and outside groups. The FORMULA Act is aimed at combating domestic baby formula shortages and bolstering the supply chain to help American families feed their babies.Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) “Over 40% of Montana’s baby formula supply is out of stock, and Montana moms and dads are struggling to feed their babies because of it. This is a crisis for families in Montana, and we must prioritize the needs of these parents and children. It is critical that we combat this formula shortage and bolster the supply chain in order to get formula back on the shelves immediately.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA): “Iowa is one of several states where half of all baby formula was sold out at the end of April, and I’ve heard from parents and health care providers rightfully concerned about the health and welfare of babies and patients with special medical needs. It’s critically important that a reliable supply of formula is reestablished immediately. The FORMULA Act will accomplish this by removing trade and regulatory barriers to ensure infants and patients receive the nutrition they need to survive.”Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS): “Parents are struggling to feed their newborns because baby formula has disappeared from the shelves,” Wicker said. “Congress needs to act quickly to address this problem. I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that would provide relief and allow more product to reach the market.”Sen. Bill Cassidy M.D. (R-LA): “No mom should have to fear whether or not she will have enough formula for her child,” said Dr. Cassidy. “The Biden administration knew the shortage was coming, but they did nothing. Once more, they have mismanaged an impending crisis.”Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “American babies are going hungry and the federal government is standing in the way. Current policies, tariffs, quotas, bans, and regulations are preventing mothers and fathers from being able to make the best choices to feed their babies. My FORMULA Act will give these families relief during this unprecedented shortage. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately to protect American babies from going hungry.”Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT), the bill’s sponsor in the House of Representatives: “New mothers are hunting from store to store to feed their infants,” said Rep. Stewart. “This is heartbreaking to see, and it should never happen in America. Red tape led to the culmination of this crisis, and removing it is our best way out. My legislation will temporarily waive trade tariffs, allow for the importation of safe baby formula, and increase formula options here at home. To my congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle: America’s mothers and fathers need help, and there is no time to waste. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately.”Hadley Heath Manning, Director of Policy at Independent Women’s Voice, said in a letter, “Independent Women’s Voice, which fights to enhance people’s freedom, opportunities and well-being, supports the Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act, introduced by Senator Mike Lee. … [W]e cannot sit idly by while parents grow even more helpless to feed their babies. We thank Senator Lee for his leadership on this important issue and urge all Senators and Members of Congress to support this proposed legislation if it comes to the floor for a vote.”Jessica Anderson, Executive Director of Heritage Action, said, “Big government is once again creating a crisis in President Biden’s America. Thanks to a heavy handed FDA, the United States faces a baby-formula shortage, forcing American moms and dads to scramble in order to feed their children. Fortunately, Senator Lee has recognized that the best way to help parents is to get the government out of the way. The FORMULA Act, which the Senator introduced this week, will do just that by suspending burdensome regulations that are currently preventing parents from getting their children the nourishment they need.”The FORMULA Act targets supply chain disruption by temporarily waiving current protectionist trade barriers like tariffs and quotas on importation that reduce the supply and increase the price of available foreign-made formula. The bill would also waive regulations that prevent the importation of safe baby formula from abroad. This would allow American families to access safe and plentiful formula manufactured in Europe and elsewhere during the current shortage. The bill will also allow Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program recipients to use vouchers to purchase formula from any producer rather than be limited to the brand or product listed on specific vouchers—which may be unavailable.For a one-pager of the bill, click HERE.For bill text, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/lee-offers-amendment-to-target-and-pay-for-ukraine-aid,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) has introduced an amendment to the House-passed, $40 billion Ukraine Aid package to streamline and target aid to meet the needs on the ground in the conflict.  Sen. Lee’s amendment also would pay for the expenditure ensuring the aid does not add to the national deficit. Of the amendment, Sen. Lee said, “The House proposal would spend nearly ten times the annual defense budget of Ukraine while delegating broad discretion to the President and bureaucrats regarding where and how most of the money is spent.  Much of the money will likely go to nations across the world not involved in the conflict.”  Lee continued, “Putin’s aggression is indefensible, and we should look for appropriate ways to support Ukrainians in the noble defense of their homeland. We must also make sure Congress maintains its constitutional role of directing engagement in conflict and ensure that we are not spending unnecessary funds while in a time of historic inflation and ballooning national debt.  My amendment will ensure we can help our friends without compromising our constitutional or financial integrity.”"
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-lee-to-introduce-formula-act," Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) is finalizing his Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act to combat domestic baby formula shortages and bolster the supply chain to help American families feed their babies. In recent days, challenges in the baby formula supply chains have seen the out-of-stock rate for formula to triple from numbers seen six months ago. Recent shortages come in the immediate aftermath of a recall and temporary closure of a major American formula factory, but highlight systemic weaknesses in this vital supply chain. Due to the disruption, families in Utah and across the nation are struggling to feed their babies.The FORMULA Act targets supply chain disruption by temporarily waiving current protectionist trade barriers like tariffs and quotas on importation that reduce the supply and increase the price of available foreign-made formula.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-lee-introduces-regulatory-reform-bills-to-spur-economy,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the PIONEER Act today to create a federal regulatory sandbox reducing the heavy burden of federal regulations and allowing businesses to grow, develop, and innovate with an expanded degree of flexibility.  The PIONEER Act joins Sen. Lee’s LIBERATE Act as proposals to reduce burdensome regulations on businesses to spur growth and bolster the struggling economy.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute has estimated that federal regulations and intervention cost American consumers and businesses $1.9 trillion each year. Just within federal infrastructure projects alone it is estimated that federal regulations increase a project’s cost by as much as 20%. The LIBERATE Act, introduced in April, would create a “Regulatory Oversight and Review Task Force” that would submit reports to Congress that would include a list of regulations recommended for repeal.  All or part of the recommended repeals would be eligible for expedited procedures in both the House and the Senate.  The PIONEER Act follows Utah’s state regulatory sandbox law which has allowed businesses to expand, hire, and develop while cooperating with government to develop more efficient and effective regulatory regimes in the state. Of the bills, Sen. Lee said, “The federal government is notorious for instituting burdensome regulations that increase costs, inhibit innovation, and rarely expire. Sadly, many of these regulations have resulted from Congress’s long history of ceding legislative authority to bureaucrats. My LIBERATE Act would require a task force to examine existing burdensome federal regulations, compile them into a list, and transmit them to Congress where lawmakers would be able to vote on their immediate repeal. Second, my PIONEER Act would create the first federal regulatory sandbox program which would waive regulations that are currently impeding the start or expansion of their business for periods of two years while adhering to certain consumer health and safety protections. These bills, combined with my REINS Act, will provide the needed regulatory reform toolbox that can tackle the massive federal regulatory burden allowing our business environment to thrive.” Sen. Lee’s regulatory reform efforts are supported by Americans for Prosperity, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, FreedomWorks, the Libertas Institute, and the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce.  Quotes are below. “A mountain of needless regulations is crushing Americans by stifling the supply of energy, food, and other household goods. In contrast, smart regulatory reform will create an economy that works for everyone.  Senator Lee’s LIBERATE Act would deliver relief to Americans through a systematic, across-the-board reduction of existing rules that are not achieving their intended goals. The U.S. badly needs to put an end to overregulation that suppresses opportunity and limits innovation. Senator Lee’s plan is a visionary and bold step in the right direction.” Americans for Prosperity “In Washington, D.C., rules and regulations are even less disciplined than federal spending is; and as we all know, that ""budgeted"" federal spending has plunged the nation into a $30 trillion abyss. The often ignored ""hidden tax"" of regulatory intervention must be brought to heel alongside spending, especially since President Biden has launched a series of self-proclaimed ""Whole-of-Government"" regulatory campaigns. Restoration is urgent, and must be rooted in disclosure, but most importantly in a full-throated re-establishment of Article I Congressional accountability that ends regulation without representation once and for all. Necessary steps include implementing a regulatory reduction commission like that presented in Senator Mike Lee's LIBERATE Act, as well as requiring a shirking Congress to reassume its authority over lawmaking by affirming significant new agency rules and guidance documents before they bind anyone.” Competitive Enterprise Institute National Taxpayers Union is pleased to support Senator Lee's LIBERATE Act, which would help roll back excessive regulations and foster more economic growth. American businesses should not be burdened by outdated, unnecessary regulations as they strive to innovate, create jobs, and succeed in a difficult economy. NTU appreciates Senator Lee's efforts and looks forward to working with him to pass the LIBERATE Act. – Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union ""Today's economy is burdened by outdated bureaucratic regulations that limit or outlaw innovative new approaches to solving our problems and needs. Following the lead of his home state's legislature, Senator Lee's PIONEER Act provides a hopeful and bipartisan solution: a flexible approach to regulations that welcomes new ideas and approaches to make our world better."" Connor Boyack, President of Libertas Institute “One of the most important and intentional ways Utah has developed the strongest economy in the nation has been our relentless efforts to weed out unreasonable and overbearing government regulation that limits commerce, increases prices, hurts small business, and serves no public purpose.  The federal government would do well to follow Utah’s lead in regulatory reform, and that is exactly what Senator Mike Lee has proposed with his recent introduction of the LIBERATE Act and the PIONEER Act. These bills will combat regulatory red tape, foster innovation, and create jobs. Such principles will allow Utah to continue to thrive as the most business friendly state in the nation.” Salt Lake Chamber of CommerceFor a one-pager of the PIONEER Act, click HERE.For full text of the PIONEER Act, click HERE.For a one-pager of the LIBERATE Act, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-lee-celebrates-house-passage-of-reca,"The House of Representatives has passed Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) two-year extension of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) ensuring that those Americans harmed by the nation’s early nuclear program can be compensated. Rep. Burgess Owens (UT-04) championed the RECA in the House. The United States Senate unanimously passed the Lee measure in April. Following House passage, Sen. Lee said, “When the government harms people, victims should be able to receive compensation. Downwinders and others harmed by the nation’s early atomic program often suffer the consequences of exposure decades after the fact. The passage of my RECA extension is a statement saying the United States government is not abandoning these victims and communities.” In 1990, RECA became law, providing a one-time cash benefit to certain persons who participated in atomic weapons testing or lived near nuclear test sites during periods of above-ground atomic weapons testing between 1951 and 1992.  To date, RECA has awarded over $2.4 billion in benefits to more than 38,000 claimants in Nevada, Utah, and elsewhere. It was previously scheduled to sunset in July of this year.  This bill pushes the expiration to 2024. Sen. Lee has long advocated that Americans within geographic areas that have been found to be affected by atomic weapons testing should be eligible for compensation.  This extension comes as a part of legislative negotiation on his more comprehensive Downwinders Act which would expand eligibility for compensation to new geographic areas and extend application eligibility by another ten years."

Lee said,  “Partial-birth abortion is a tragedy and a crime of the most gruesome nature.  While local authorities bend to political pressure to protect abortion facilities from investigation, this bicameral group of sixty-nine members of Congress is committed to make sure the evidence is fully investigated and that any crimes are prosecuted.  I am proud to lead this group in demanding justice be done.” The full text of the letter can be read here. Senator Lee is joined by the following members of Congress as co-signers: Senators:Sen.

Coupled with historic inflation, the rising prices of housing is making life less affordable for western families.  The HOUSES Act helps solve Utah’s land and housing scarcity by allowing parcels of federal land to be purchased by a state or unit of local government at a reduced price giving them flexibility to address housing constraints.  The act requires that land be used for housing, subject to a density requirement, and protects against development of expensive second homes on the purchased parcels. Of the bill Sen. Lee said,  “Supply is not meeting housing demand in Utah, and the federal government’s land ownership is a significant cause of our restricted housing stock.  The HOUSES Act will free federal land in a responsible manner to keep the dream and promise of Utah alive.  This bill will help ensure Utah remains a place where families and communities can thrive, grow, and prosper.” Sen. John Barasso (R-WY) said of the bill, “Wyoming and the West are blessed with tremendous resources, including vast expanses of land. As more and more people move to places like Wyoming, the growing communities need options to expand housing for residents. The HOUSES Act will give many new options to state and local governments by allowing them to buy certain lands from the federal government for residential purposes. This has already been happening in Nevada.  It makes sense for other public lands states to have the same opportunities.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said, “As our state has experienced rapid growth over the last decade, housing prices have skyrocketed and housing affordability has become a growing challenge for communities across our state—a challenge which has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. We must make finding and affording houses more accessible for everyone. However, with two-thirds of our state owned by the federal government, the ability of many communities to expand is prohibited by federal ownership. By increasing the amount of federal land that can be used for housing development—ranging from single family homes to low-income housing and apartments—our legislation will start to address our state’s housing shortages.” Utah County Commissioner, Amelia Powers Gardner said, “Utah County is facing a critical affordable housing shortage that is going to require creative and innovative solutions to solve. Senator Mike Lee’s HOUSES Act is one solution that could actually move the needle in helping to ensure more affordable housing in Utah County. Senator Lee’s HOUSES Act is one example of creative and innovative solutions for tackling our affordable housing shortage in Utah County. The HOUSES Act would give local government one more tool that could help combat the lack of affordable housing in Utah County.” President and CEO of the Cedar City Chamber of Commerce, Christopher M. McCormick said, “The HOUSES Act would have a significant impact on the affordable housing crisis[.] … The Cedar City Chamber of Commerce stands in support of the HOUSES Act and urges our legislators to implement this as expeditiously as possible.  This is not only a good plan for Utah, but the nation as a whole, as this is becoming a nationwide problem.” Washington City Councilman, Kurt Ivie said of the bill, “The median home price in Washington County hit $553,000 in February of 2022. Housing is quickly becoming unaffordable and unattainable for many of our residents. We need to find solutions that will allow the middle class to thrive in Washington City. I appreciate Senator Lee including me in this critical discussion and for bringing forward the HOUSES Act, a bill that will give municipalities another avenue through which they can increase the supply of more affordable housing. I support this concept as one way to alleviate pressure on the housing market. I look forward to working with Senator Lee and the communities across Utah to build support for this bill. This is a great issue backed by an absolute need and Senator Lee’s bill is good policy.” Vernal Area Chamber of Commerce Legislative Committee Chairman, Steve Evans said, “Like the rest of the State of Utah, Uintah County has a severe shortage of affordable housing.  Much of the area in Uintah County is under BLM jurisdiction and many of these large tracts of land are not usable for recreation or other public uses.  If this act is passed, it would allow counties like Uintah County to provide opportunities for affordable housing to be built.  We very much support Senator Lee’s efforts to pass the HOUSES Act.” The National Association of Counties also supports the bill. Sen. Lee is joined by Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) as cosponsors. A one-pager of the bill is available here.The full text of the bill can be read here."

The letter asks the Department of State to aid the Ukrainian government to establish a consular office in Poland to process paperwork required for adoption.  The letter further asks about current State Department efforts to aid Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees.The letter reads in part, “We write to thank you for the work of the United States Department of State to assist the people of Ukraine during this crisis and to make you aware of a particular group of orphans amongst the many fleeing the country.  There are families already towards the very end of the process to adopt Ukrainian orphans, and they are waiting for approval from the Ukrainian government to be united with their adopted children on U.S. soil.”The members continue, “We believe the State Department can do more to urge or aid the Ukrainian application process to continue, especially for cases close to finalization. … Helping these orphans to join their American families expeditiously will allow them to get to a safe, nurturing environment while freeing up resources for other refugees.  In a warzone and a refugee crisis, it is often the most vulnerable who bear the greatest consequences.” Including Sen. Lee, the letter is signed by thirty-nine members of Congress. For full text of the letter, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/day-2-senator-lee-questions-scotus-nominee-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States today on the second day of questioning.  His questions focused on her past cases dealing with federal lands, her record on criminal sentencing, and the troubling history of Supreme Court precedent regarding partial-birth abortion.  A full transcript of the exchange is below.  MSL indicates Sen. Lee is speaking.  JKBJ and italics indicate Judge Jackson is speaking.  Timestamps are in reference to the above-linked video.  [00:00:00] MSL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge. I want to talk next a little bit about a case that you were involved in. A case called Coal River Mountain Watch versus the United States Department of the Interior. It was a ruling that you issued in 2015 while on the Federal District Court.  I know you've had a lot of cases. JKBJ: I have.I can't imagine that by merely triggering the case name that would necessarily bring it back. But this case involved [00:00:30] a challenge to an administrative action within the Department of Interior on some issues bearing on coal mining within the state of West Virginia.There were two parallel challenges brought against that administrative action; one in a federal district court in West Virginia, where the land in question was located and another in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, where you sat. The government defending itself against that action brought by [00:01:00] some environmental groups, asked that you dismiss the DC case so that the matter could be litigated in West Virginia. You denied that.Can you, based on my description of the facts, does that ring any bells? And can you tell me why you might've denied it?[00:01:17] JKBJ: Thank you, Senator. It actually doesn't. It sounds like dozens of cases that I handled with similar issues and requests. Something like a motion to [00:01:30] dismiss is early in the action. And so denying a motion to dismiss is pretty routine for the District of Columbia.[00:01:36] MSL: I understand it. And I'm sure you handled a lot of those all the time as a district judge. The reason I raise it is just because it relates indirectly to some concerns that I've got that are somewhat unique to the Western United States.We have a lot of cases that involve the U S Department of the Interior and agency actions taken relative to the public land [00:02:00] that we have. In every state east of Colorado the federal government owns less than 15% of the land. And in most of those it's much less than 15%, in the single digits or low single digits. In every state, Colorado and west of Colorado, the federal government owns more than 15% of the land, and most of the time it's a lot more.In my state it happens to be about two thirds of the land that's owned by the federal government. As a result it complicates our ability to do just about everything we do, whether it's recreation, construction, oil, and gas development, whether it's [00:02:30] just accessing people's farms and ranches, or even something as simple as trying to fund local fire, police, search and rescue operations. All these things are affected by the excessive ownership of federal land by the federal government and the way it's often managed.Sometimes decisions made at the federal level are challenged in parallel actions like these: one in the forum state, in the host state to where the action is happening and other in DC. And I'm always [00:03:00] concerned about forum shopping, and I'm sure that's something you've watched out for as a judge and saw forum shopping from time to time. It's also something that touches on an issue that involves statutory interpretation. There’s something called the Antiquities Act passed 110 years ago or so, designed to give presidents of the United States the authority to designate parcels of federal land as national monuments.[00:03:30]This text of the statute states that the limits of the parcels in question should be quote, “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care, and management of the objects to be protected”. Now given that these presidential proclamations tend to be broad, it's sometimes the objects to be protected are also broad.And as a result of that it's difficult to tell what the [00:04:00] limits are. Do you have any reactions to how we could discern that? How we could define any meaning out of that? It's got to mean something, the text of the statute. You try not to leave language simply unaddressed or meaningless in a statute.Do you have any thoughts on how a statute like that, saying that it should be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected? Any thoughts briefly on that?[00:04:24] JKBJ:  Well Senator, if I were presented with a case with that [00:04:30] statute in that circumstance, I would proceed as I always have.You would have to understand the party’s arguments about the particulars in the case. What does the presidential proclamation say? To what does it relate? Whether there are any precedents in this area that define, further define, or further address what Congress intended with respect to the statute at issue.[00:04:59] MSL: And I would assume that it would also matter if the government's lawyer defending the president's action made an argument that would leave the interpretation open-ended and meaningless.[00:05:11] JKBJ: Well, as part of your interpretive exercise, as you're considering the party’s various arguments, one that did not account for all the words in a statute would be one that you might not agree with.[00:05:28] MSL: No, I [00:05:30] get it. And this is one of the things that I've appreciated about what you've told us in these hearings. I really like the way you've described the effect. It's important to construe the text that you're asked to interpret. And in interpreting that you look at the language and you're endeavoring to figure out the original public meaning.And I think that is a very helpful thing. Let’s move to a different issue a moment ago. Now, you clerked on the U S [00:06:00] Supreme Court for Justice Breyer in October term 1999, is that right?JKBJ: That is right.MSL: You clerked for Justice Breyer. And that was the same year that the Supreme court issued its decision in a case called Stenberg vs. Carhart. This is the case where the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a Nebraska law prohibiting partial birth abortion. In the absence of circumstances where the baby posed a threat to the life of a mother.[00:06:30] Now to be clear that the law prohibited a procedure where the abortionist causes an unborn baby to be partially delivered by the mother.And then the abortionist intentionally kills the baby outside the womb by puncturing its skull with scissors and then collapsing the skull. This is gruesome and I don't like having to quote this, but it is relevant to the topic we're covering here. Justice Kennedy described it this way and chilling terms in [00:07:00] his dissent when he describes the fact that, “When scissors are inserted into the back of the head, the fetus’ body wholly outside the woman's body and alive reacts as though startled and then goes limp.”Justice Scalia in his great eloquence expressed, lamented the ruling, but also expressed optimism for the fact that future courts would get it right. Saying quote, “I'm optimistic enough to believe that one day Stenberg versus Carhart will be assigned to its rightful place in the history of this [00:07:30] court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. This method of killing a human child, one cannot even accurately say an entirely unborn human child, prescribed by the statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shutter of revulsion.”We then saw a few years later, the Supreme Court of the United States issue a different ruling. The Supreme Court issued a different ruling in a case called [00:08:00] Gonzales v. Carhart. Gonzales v. Carhart upheld a different statute. This one was federal rather than state, but it was a different federal statute that also prohibited partial birth abortion.Judge Jackson, can you distinguish these cases for me? What was the difference between Gonzales v. Carhartt, where the partial birth abortion ban in question was upheld whereas in Stenberg v. Carhartt, it was invalidated? [00:08:30][00:08:31] JKBJ: Thank you Senator. I don't have the opinions in front of me. I think it had to do with the method of extraction, the fact-finding related to the procedure.In one case the district court had made some findings in, and the court felt bound by them. And in another there was considerations beyond those that [00:09:00] previously relied upon. So there were distinctions that the court looked at and considered in the cases. [00:09:09] MSL: Let's talk about court packing for a minute.JKBJ: Yes.MSL: One of the reasons court packing concerns me. One of the many reasons is because it's not prohibited in the first instance, it's not prohibited by the constitution. There's nothing in the constitution that says that Congress may not change the size of the Supreme Court, there's no limitation on that. [00:09:30] We have for one hundred and fifty years stuck with the number nine.It has worked, and the absence of an argument saying that that number is too low, the court is too small, from a workforce standpoint we need to expand it. It's difficult to imagine why it would be a good idea to change it, particularly, because if you increase the size of the court in one fell swoop, and you do that for partisan political purposes, [00:10:00] allowing one president, the current president, to have a disproportionate impact on the court.And to change its rulings, that portion of the court's docket that tends to be more politically contentious. It can turn the court into a political football of sorts. Given the fact that our Supreme Court Justices serve for life, once you do that, it becomes something of a one-way ratchet, always expanding, never contracting.Before long, you could [00:10:30] see an increasingly larger court with the court expanding each time a different party secures the coveted circumstance of a majority of the House, majority in the Senate, and controlled by the same party of the White House. And so this is why it concerns me. I understand why it is that the canons of judicial ethics don't allow you to comment on matters that might come before you.This is one that could not come before you as a justice. This is not a justiciable political question. It's [00:11:00] committed to the two political branches of government. There's not even a constitutional challenge that could lie to it, even though it would undermine the separation of powers in the constitution.As I see it, it's not unconstitutional. So it couldn't, and it would never come before you. Last night when you were asked a question by my colleague Senator Kennedy  on this, you acknowledged that you have an opinion? Did I understand that right? Do you have an opinion on court packing?[00:11:25] JKBJ: Senator, I have a lot of opinions. I'm a [00:11:30] human being, and I have an opinion on a lot of things. The reason why, in my view, it is not appropriate for me to comment is because of my fidelity to the judicial role. I understand that it's a political question, and that is precisely why I think that I am uncomfortable speaking to it.[00:11:54] MSL: I understand that and out of respect, I respect the impulse. I respect[00:12:00] the overall issue. And I think it's better for Article III judges and justices ordinarily to not wade into the political thicket. This one I do think is different because number one, as I said, can never come before you. Number two: It does have an impact on what you would be doing. And you also as an Article III judge, someone who's served for nearly nine years as a Federal Judge, you've developed experience and intuition, and a thorough understanding of our federal court system. And that's why I think your [00:12:30] perspective on it would be valuable.The reason it concerns me so much is that even when court packing doesn't succeed legislatively, it can leave an impact. The last time this was attempted was in 1937. President Franklin D Roosevelt was upset at the Supreme Court on a number of basis. He didn't like the 32 year old precedent of Lochner versus New York. Where five conservatives on the Supreme Court engaged in an act of judicial activism, reading [00:13:00] something into the constitution that wasn't really there.Some people disagree with me on this, but it wasn’t there, and they impose that. But the bigger reason was, he didn't like the court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. It was that interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The one we discussed yesterday, you know, prior to 1937, you had the Supreme Court agreeing as far as the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce that we talked about yesterday. You had the court more or less in agreement over [00:13:30] time as to the impact of the Dormant Commerce Clause.But as to the substantial effects test that didn't exist yet. It required something much closer to an interstate commercial transaction. In order for Congress's Commerce Clause authority to kick in, they were the so-called four horsemen of the apocalypse. FDR actually called them, four conservatives who were consistently pushing for limits on congress’s authority.And then you had other [00:14:00] justices who would sometimes join with them. Usually that included Justice Owen Roberts, who stood with them in maintaining narrower authority for Congress under the Commerce Clause. All that changed went on April 12th, 1937. Two weeks to the day when the case often associated with the so-called switching time that changed nine, West Coast Hotel versus Parish, or where they undid the Lochner precedent.April 12th, 1937, the Supreme court decided a case LRP vs [00:14:30] Jones and Laughlin Steel that forever changed and magnified, expanded the Commerce Clause in a way that had it been through a constitutional amendment, it would be among the most significant, impactful constitutional amendments ever adopted.And yet it's rarely discussed. This case resulted from one vote, one person on the Supreme Court who changed his vote; associate Justice Owen Roberts. It's widely believed, and I believe it, based on what I've researched on it, he was influenced heavily by FTR’s court [00:15:00] packing plan. He didn't want to be on a court that was packed.He convinced himself that he made that switch in order to save the court as it was. And that has changed everything. It's led to a much bigger, more expensive, more intrusive federal government. We can disagree as to the policy merits of that, but it did change the constitution. That's why I worry about that. So I hope. I understand you don't want to answer it. I hope that between now and [00:15:30] the end of the day, you'll see fit to tell us what your opinion is. I do think it's worth discussing.Let's talk for a minute, just got a moment left. I want to get back to your sentencing approach.Now, when you approach these child pornography cases, what you're describing, in many circumstances is an overall concern that you've got what the [00:16:00] sentencing guidelines and particularly that portion of the sentencing guidelines that deals with child pornography cases. This showed up in the transcripts of some of your sentencing hearings, including the transcript of your sentencing hearing in the Hawkins case. I turned to that page 38, line 17 to 24 of that transcript.Here's something you say in that Hawkins case, and I believe this was the eighteen year old defendant that you sentenced to three months in prison, when the lower end [00:16:30] of the guidelines range would have been ninety-seven. I think the higher end would have been in the one-twenties or something like that. You said, and in your case, this is you speaking to Mr. Hawkins. In your case in particular, “I don't feel that it is appropriate necessarily to increase the penalty on the basis of your use of a computer, or the number of images, or prepubescent victims. As the guidelines require because these circumstances exist in many cases, if not most, [00:17:00] and don't signal, an especially heinous or egregious child pornography offense.”I've got a couple of questions about that. Were those, you start off that paragraph sounding like you're making a determination as to him, but then the observations you make in that paragraph seem to apply broadly. Is that right?[00:17:22] JKBJ: Senator, I do not have the transcript of Mr. Hawkins case. I recall that I[00:17:30] found that case, like all child pornography cases, to be difficult, really difficult. His case, I recall, was in many ways an outlier, in terms of the various considerations that Congress required me to take into account.[00:17:51] MSL: But there were prepubescent victims that were at stake?[00:17:54] JKBJ: I don't remember how many, I don't remember the circumstances of his actual crime. What I will say is that, consistent with Supreme Court case law and Congress's statute in this area, judges have to take into account a number of factors, and the guidelines, which are no longer, I won't say not mandatory you have to calculate the guidelines, there are no longer binding and the Supreme Court has said that under the statutory scheme to judges have discretion.[00:18:32] MSL: Okay, I am also almost out of time and I want to make a point. Hawkins, as I recall, as Senator Hawley discussed yesterday, he specifically asked for images of 11 to 17 year olds. So I don't understand how that can be an instance where that shouldn't matter, and where the fact that he did it with the computer, hardly atones for what he was doing, hardly offsets the fact that he was seeking and obtained pre-pubescent child pornography images. Nor does the fact that the images become easier over time to transmit and receive and store because of computers. I actually think it cuts in precisely the opposite direction that you described. It makes it more severe, not less. I see this as an aggravating factor and that is of great concern to me. I see I have exceeded my time. Thank you.[00:19:33] JKBJ: Senator as in every child pornography case that I sentenced. I considered all of the evidence, all of the relevant factors. It is not the same exercise to look at a transcript, to think about guidelines, to not have in front of you, the individuals, the victims, the pictures, the circumstances that trial judges have to review in these cases or any cases. I understand Senator, that there are some questions about records, ect. Courts have all of the evidence and courts have all of the recommendations of various parties and courts have, under Congress's authority, the responsibility of using our judgment to make determinations that are sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes or promote the purposes of punishment taking into account  things like unwarranted sentencing disparities. It may seem like an easy exercise, it may seem in retrospect, when you look back at a few pieces of data, that courts have not done what it is that they are supposed to do, but what I can assure you is that I took every one of these cases seriously, in my duty, and responsibility as a judge, and I made my determinations in light of the seriousness of the offense, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to promote various purposes of punishment, and all of the other factors that Congress prescribed.[00:21:37] MSL: Okay, but you keep resetting that standard, and you specifically excluded from consideration the fact that he had requested and obtained images, prepubescent child pornography images. [00:21:52] JKBJ: Senator, I didn't exclude it. I didn't exclude it. What I did was I looked at the guidelines, which is what the Supreme Court requires, and I was making policy determinations as the Supreme Court says that judges are to do in these situations.[00:22:08] MSL: Look at page 38 of your transcript. It looks to me like you excluded it and your actions sentencing him to three months, for one of the most heinous offenses imaginable, keep in mind because these are transmitted electronically, they are there for years. They re-victimize these victims the rest of their lives."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-questions-scotus-nominee-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) questioned Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States today.  His questions focused on her judicial philosophy, her record on criminal sentencing, and her views on unenumerated constitutional rights.  A full transcript of the exchange is below.  MSL indicates Sen. Lee is speaking.  JKBJ and italics indicate Judge Jackson is speaking.  Timestamps are in reference to the above-linked video. [00:00:00] MSL: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Judge Jackson for being here. I want to talk today about some things you heard about yesterday. There was a lot of talk from members of this committee about judicial philosophy. I want to talk a little bit about what that means and why it's important. We'll start with what it means, at least to me. One of the things that you heard from a lot of members of the committee, whether they couched it in terms of judicial philosophy or not, [00:00:30] relates to the idea that justice should be blind. That justice properly administered within our system is blind, and that therefore individual justices and judges serving in Article III courts should be blind in the sense that they are able to see and understand and interpret the law. Understand what the law is, while understanding that the idea of what the law should be is left to [00:01:00] other branches of government, not to the judiciary.In this respect, we recognize that blind justice and blind justices, those who are blind to the things they are supposed to be blind to, are those willing to recognize that if there is a policy flaw in the law, and if there's a policy change that needs to be made, it's not the role of a court to change it.That belongs to two different branches of government, primarily to Congress. This of course requires judicial restraint, it [00:01:30] requires judicial humility, and it gets back to what I was describing yesterday when I referred to Justice Barrett drawing on the analogy from the Odyssey, of Odysseus binding himself to the mast of the ship.Most of us refer to this judicial philosophy as textualism. Textualism is neither liberal nor conservative, it's neither Republican nor Democratic. It's just the approach that says what the law says [00:02:00] matters, and the job of the jurist is to look at the text and figure out what the text means to ascertain the original public meaning of the text in question.While I doubt there are any members of this committee who would disagree with the idea that justice should be blind in this respect, and that policy changes need to be made by the political branches of government, primarily by the legislative branch, and not by the courts. You did hear some statements that I think are at least a little bit at odds [00:02:30] with that concept of justice.One of my colleagues mentioned that you should interpret the Constitution in a way that works for the people of today. Fair enough. I certainly don't want to interpret the Constitution in a way that doesn't work, but again, that's not the objective. The objective is not to ascertain good policy. The objective is to ascertain what the law requires. You were urged to consider the effects of the Court's actions on people's lives. There again, [00:03:00] and so far as this relates to policy, it's not really the job of the courts. You were admonished that you must “be able to see the real people at the other end of the Court's rulings, like Americans who are one Supreme Court decision away from losing their health insurance or one court decision away from the ability to make their own healthcare choices.”And the list goes on and on. Now, that type of judicial philosophy would have you step into the role of [00:03:30] policymaker, and decide what the law should be rather than what the law is. You also heard quoted, a couple of times yesterday, quoted or paraphrased or otherwise referenced, Federalist 78. In which Alexander Hamilton refers to the difference between law between will and judgment. Will, as expressed by Hamilton, refers to what the law should be. Judgment pertains to what the law is.[00:04:00]The judicial branch has the latter power, but not the former. The legislative branch has the former, but not the latter. Judge Jackson, I'd love to get your thoughts on this discussion about what it means, what blind justice is, why that's important. Let's start with this formulation of it though.Does the law determine the outcome of a case or does the outcome of the case determine the law?[00:04:30] JKBJ: Thank you, Senator. The law determines the outcome of a case. And so anytime you're looking at a case and you're looking at the outcomes for ordinary Americans, for day-to-day Americans, if you're looking beyond the scope of deciding that case, and if you're looking, even within that case, beyond what the law says, you would be stepping into a province of a different branch. Is that right?[00:04:53] JKBJ: I believe so. The law and the facts of the case determine the outcome of cases.[00:05:00][00:05:02] MSL: I think that's an accurate statement. It's important to emphasize this. This is also something that Hamilton describes in Federalist 78, where he goes on to say, anytime you start to see the courts start to exercise will instead of judgment, the result is supplanting the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives, through the courts.And that tends to undermine the whole system. You see, there's a reason, of course, why we give life tenure to Article III judges [00:05:30] and justices, and that is because we want to make sure that they have the power, the authority, the discretion, and the confidence to issue a decision that they might not be comfortable with.In fact, a judge who always agrees with and is always comfortable with his or her own opinions, is, as Justice Scalia used to say, not a very good judge. So we wanted them, you, all, to have confidence in being able to make the right decision. Even knowing that you [00:06:00] and the public at large might be uncomfortable with the result it produces. Congress makes laws that you won't always agree with. Congress is accountable to the people at regular intervals. You can fire every member of the House of Representatives every two years. You can fire one-third of us in the Senate every two years. We insulate judges and Supreme Court Justices from that same accountability precisely for this reason.It's [00:06:30] because political accountability is so important. This is born out in the judicial oath, one of the oaths that you'll take if confirmed to this position as an associate justice. In which you'll swear or affirm that you'll administer justice without respect to persons, and that you'll do it faithfully and impartially.I read this to mean that you do it without consideration of external circumstances, external considerations, policy considerations, or otherwise. [00:07:00] Now, this relates to some interaction that you and I had when you came before this committee for your confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where you now sit. In connection with that hearing, I submitted some questions to the record, in which I asked you whether, to what extent, the Constitution protects rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution itself, and if so, to specify what those rights were. You responded by setting a number of cases, [00:07:30] including Griswold v. Connecticut, Roe v. Wade, Loving v. Virginia and a handful of others. You also suggested that the Ninth Amendment was something, was a source, for such rights on enumerated rights.The Ninth Amendment of course states, “that the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Judge Jackson, what specific rights has the Supreme Court identified as [00:08:00] flowing from the Ninth Amendment? And by that, I mean, specifically from the Ninth Amendment, rather than, in sort of an also ran list, of other features of the Constitution that might backup a particular ruling. What rights has the Constitution identified as flowing specifically from the Ninth Amendment?[00:08:19] JKBJ: Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court, as I understand it, has not identified any particular rights flowing directly from the Ninth Amendment, although, as you said, the text of the amendment [00:08:30] suggests that there are some rights that are not enumerated.[00:08:35] MSL: Right. Right. Its very existence and its very language suggests that, which opens up other questions as to how those are to be resolved. It’s led to considerable debate among scholars and jurists alike as to whether, to what extent, in what way, this is enforceable, those rights are enforceable by the courts.But, how would we go about deciding that? How would [00:09:00] jurists go about deciding this question appropriately? In other words, would it be more appropriate to say, we will ascertain the existence of rights protected by the Ninth Amendment based on contemporaneous understanding, at the time of the ratification of the Ninth Amendment? Or would it be more open ended to protect rights that we think are important today?[00:09:30][00:09:32] JKBJ: Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court now, very clearly, has determined that in order to interpret provisions of the Constitution, we look to the time of the founding, and we ascertain, based on what the original public meaning of the words the Constitution were at the time. Sometimes that yields a [00:10:00] particular answer. Other times you may have to look to practices historically from that time. But that would be the way in which you would go about interpreting the Ninth Amendment.[00:10:11] MSL: Could it also be that it leaves this to be decided at the discretion of the Supreme Court itself? In other words, not based on any historical precedent, but based on what the Supreme Court justices themselves deem appropriate at the moment? [00:10:30][00:10:30] JKBJ: I don't think so. MSL: And why is that?JKBJ: Because the way in which the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution is with reference to the meaning of the text at the time That it is one of the constraints, as I mentioned, in terms of my own way of handling, interpreting the law. One of the constraints is that you're bound by the text and [00:11:00] what it meant to those who drafted it.[00:11:04] MSL:At the time, gotcha. Yeah. Now, on February 1st of this year, President Biden said that he was looking for a Supreme Court nominee, this was, I recall, right after Justice Breyer announced that he would be stepping down, and before he had announced whom he might nominate, that he was looking for a nominee “with a judicial philosophy that is more one that suggests that there are unenumerated rights to the Constitution, and all new members mean something, including the Ninth Amendment.” So do you share the judicial philosophy that President Biden described in that statement?[00:11:45] JKBJ: Senator, I have not reviewed that statement, but I have not discussed anything about enumerated rights, unenumerated rights with the President.MSL: So did President Biden ask you either about your judicial philosophy more broadly, separate and apart from the Ninth Amendment, or ask you about your approach to the Ninth Amendment?JKBJ: He did not.[00:12:12] MSL: In a primary election debate that he had as a presidential candidate in Nevada in 2007, Joe Biden stated “I would not appoint anyone who did not understand that Section V of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provided a right to privacy. That's the question I'd ask them. If that is answered correctly, that that is the case, that it answers the question which means they would support Roe v. Wade.” I assume his reference to the Liberty Clause is referring to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In context, that appears to be what he is saying. Did President Biden ask you whether you agreed with his analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment as it relates to the right to privacy?[00:13:05] JKBJ: He did not.[00:13:12] MSL: Tell me this. When we look at any provision of the Constitution,  one of the many reasons it is helpful to look at the original understanding, in addition to the fundamental reason that you described, it can help us understand what motivated it, and it can help us understand the actions of those who voted within Congress to propose text to be amended to the Constitution, and those who voted to ratify it. We have got a number of amendments, including the amendment that he referred to in that last quote I read, that had an understanding that included certain thou shalt nots for government. The Equal Protection Clause, I think, is a provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that, people understood, among anything else it might do, restricts the government's ability to treat people differently on the basis of race. Consistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, when is it permissible for the government to treat a person differently on the basis of race?[00:14:29] JKBJ: Thank you, Senator. The Supreme Court has interpreted the equal protection clause, as you say, to generally prohibit classifications on the basis of race, and it says that those classifications are to be rigorously scrutinized, strict scrutiny, which is a standard that applies, that looks at the purposes of the government, and the means by which the government seeks to achieve any end related to such classification. The government would have to have a compelling interest in making that classification, and the means that it selects would have to be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.[00:15:21] MSL: And so those compelling interests cannot be for light or transient reasons. They can't just be something like, we feel like it, in other words.[00:15:30] JKBJ: Correct. [00:15:31] MSL: And the reason for this is because, number one, it is bad for anyone to treat another person differently on the basis of race. It is especially bad when the government does it, because there is not exactly equal bargaining power, when you're dealing with the relationship an individual has with government. By definition, it's a particularly unfair form of discrimination when it is the government doing it. Governments have enforcement officers, they have armies, they have the means of enforcing their will and their laws, and that is one of the reasons why it's so important. What about under statute, consistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when is it permissible for an employer to treat an employee, or a prospective employee, differently on the basis of his or her race?JKBJ: By statute, under Title VII, it is generally impermissible. [00:16:30] MSL: And permissible only in very narrow circumstances.[00:16:34] JKBJ: I believe so, and the statute itself has some restrictions in terms of to whom it applies, the employers.[00:16:42] MSL: Some exclusions in terms of religious employers for example, not being able to discriminate on the basis of race, but it exempts religious employers within certain spheres in order to be able to protect that religious employer’s discretion to operate within its faith, and the rules of its faith. And by doing that, it makes that much clearer, by making that distinction, it makes that much clearer, that discrimination on the basis of race and employment is not something that the law smiles upon, nor should it. Let us talk about the Commerce Clause for a minute, if that is all right. Now at the time of the founding, the founding fathers didn't foresee and almost certainly could not have foreseen the invention of radios, televisions, airplanes, the internet, telephone networks, and yet all of those things are governed by federal law, and not by state law. Why is this constitutional?[00:17:58] JKBJ: Well Senator, the Commerce Clause was initially interpreted by the Supreme Court to be very broad, to allow for federal regulation of interstate commerce and the growth of the economy in this country. Over time, the Supreme Court has made clear that the Commerce Clause limits the federal government, there is limited authority under the Commerce Clause. The state of the law now is such that the federal government, through the Commerce Clause, is only permitted to regulate channels of interstate commerce, instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, and with respect to the third category, the Supreme Court has made clear, in the Lopez case and in Morrison, that non-economic activities are not covered by Commerce Clause authority. In the NFIB case and the ACA case, the Supreme Court made clear that inactivity is also not covered and not authorized under the Commerce Clause.[00:19:17] MSL:And most of the items that I identified in my question, in fact, all of them, I believe would fall into the category of channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce we are dealing [00:19:30] with interstate airways, airwaves, waterways, networks, things like that. Things that depend for their existence, for their effectiveness on their operation interstate such that they could not, no one could effectively regulate them and preserve their core function, unless that was federal. Those fit into the category of the channels and instrumentalities with the third item that you described the substantial [00:20:00] effects, interstate commerce. Is there much of a limiting principle there? You referred to Lopez and Morrison, and NFIB versus Sebelius. To my knowledge, those are the only three cases the Supreme Court has decided since its ruling in 1937 on NLRB versus Jones and Loughlin Steel, which essentially created the modern substantial effects case.The modern substantial effects standard was the only three instances in which the Supreme court identified [00:20:30] as outside the Commerce Clause authority, something that Congress had enacted. Are these meaningful constraints in your view, or are they examples of Congress just getting reckless and sloppy in the way it drafted things?Some have argued for instance that as long as Congress does not get reckless and sloppy, it can do whatever it wants under those. Do you have any view on that? [00:21:08] JKBJ: Well these cases come through the courts, so I'll be general. [00:21:00]The fact that Congress is limited in its authority under the commerce clause is established law. It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional order and those limits that the Supreme Court has recognized do carve out categories of activity that Congress is not permitted, the federal government is not permitted to regulate. [00:21:30] Non-economic activity is a category. Inactivity is a category.MSL:The Supreme Court has also, through the Commerce Clause, established rules for things that the states may not do, this is referred to as the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause. The Dormant Commerce Clause acknowledges the power of Congress, the exclusive [00:22:00] domain of Congress is regulating interstate commerce. But there's no federal cause of action to allow for the invalidation of a state law under the commerce clause.It's been something that's been adopted by the courts. Is that an appropriate exercise of the court's judicial power or does it amount to de facto legislation on the part of the courts?[00:22:21] JKBJ: Well Senator, I would not characterize it. I know that's what the Supreme Court has permitted the Dormant Commerce Clause. [00:22:30] It is a principle that supports the interstate nature and regulation and authority of the federal government.And so states are not permitted under that doctrine to discriminate against other states, to preference their own commerce in a way that interferes with interstate commerce.[00:22:57] MSL: I wanna turn back for a moment to a line [00:23:00] of inquiry you had with Senator Durbin earlier today, when you were talking about your sentencing in these child pornography cases. I wanna make sure that I understand your answer there.If I understand it, you were making the argument that your concern was that the laws in this area did not adequately take into account the transfer of these materials [00:23:30] by electronic means to be transmitted, received and stored through computers. Is that my understanding of that correctly?[00:23:39] JKBJ: Well Senator, the point that I was making was that the sentencing commission back when I was part of it and even since, tasked with the responsibility to evaluate and make recommendations and look at the data and information about cases, has [00:24:00] looked at the operation of the child pornography guideline.Not so much the statute, but the guidelines, which the Congress has tasked the Sentencing Commission with developing. And there are aspects of the child pornography guideline that Congress in legislation has required. It required certain enhancements to be included in the guideline. And some of those enhancements, the [00:24:30] data is now revealing. Don’t take into account the change in the way that this horrible offense is now committed.[00:24:46] MSL: But the fact that it's easier to commit the offense shouldn't diminish the severity of the punishment, should it? I mean, any more than the more widespread availability of certain drugs, the more widespread availability of certain weapons might. I mean you surely wouldn't [00:25:00] argue for a lower sentence when certain things become easier in other criminal contexts. So why is this one different?[00:25:07] JKBJ: The sentencing enhancements that are in the guidelines are designed to help courts differentiate between different levels of culpability. Congress will say, this is an offense, whatever it is, and the maximum penalty [00:25:30] is X. In most cases, the range is between zero and something like 20 years that Congress gives when it establishes a penalty.The point of the guidelines is to help judges figure out where in that range between zero and 20 years, a particular defendant should be sentenced. And the guidelines have gradations in them, [00:26:00] that relates to various aspects of the commission of the crime. So, the commission does data gathering and research to figure out how crimes are committed and what gradations should it matter in terms of the range of culpability. Because the problem of not doing that or of getting it wrong is that you were not able [00:26:30] to adequately assess and determine the differences among offenders on the scale.[00:26:39] MSL: Right, I understand that. And so, but in, in these cases, as I understand it all ten of the cases that we've reviewed on record, where you've sent someone for a child pornography conviction in all 10 of those cases, you departed from the guidelines,and departed downward.It's hard for me to [00:27:00] understand departing from those in every case you've got, because isn't a departure supposed to be grounded in a finding that it's outside the heartland of cases in that range cases of that sort?[00:27:15] JKBJ: Yes, Senator. And as I said before, these are horrible cases that involve terrible crimes, and the court is looking at all of the evidence consistent with Congress' factors [00:27:30]for sentencing. The guidelines are one factor, but the court is told that you look at the guidelines, but you also look at the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and, and characteristics of the offender.There are a series of factors in the cases you are also getting recommendations. And in most of the cases, I haven't pinned it all down, but in most of the cases, if not all of the cases, the government [00:28:00] is asking for a sentence below the guidelines, because this guideline system is not doing the work in this particular case.[00:28:08] MSL: Understood. Section 230 of the Telecommunication Decency Act provides a degree of immunity for tech companies operating in the space of being online interactive service providers. It immunizes them from certain causes of action that would otherwise apply [00:28:30] against them.Would it be within Congress's authority to condition the receipt and availability of Section 230 immunity? On those online interactive service providers operating as a public forum that is not discriminating on the basis of viewpoint or, the viewpoint of those posting on them. Would that be within our [00:29:00] authority?[00:29:01] JKBJ: Senator, I can't comment on a particular issue about whether or not it is constitutional or not. But the criteria that you identify, it would be relevant. I think as to whether or not the government is seeking to regulate along viewpoint lines under the First Amendment. That is something that is,[00:29:30] generally impermissible.[00:29:32] MSL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-introduces-resolution-to-maintain-undivided-jerusalem-embassy,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced a concurrent resolution today reaffirming Congress’s position that the United States should be represented by a single diplomatic mission in Jerusalem.  The Biden Administration has previously stated its intent to create a consulate general in Jerusalem dedicated to Palestinian affairs.  The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, passed into law by Congressional supermajority recognizes that Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel and the U.S. embassy to Israel should be in Jerusalem. Senator Lee’s resolution states Congress’s opposition to any establishment of a separate U.S. diplomatic office for Palestinian affairs within Jerusalem and expresses that such a plan violates the intent of current U.S. law and is an affront to a U.S. ally and therefore should not move forward in the absence of congressional authorization. Regarding the resolution, Sen. Lee said, “Congress has made clear for decades that the U.S. embassy in Israel should be in Jerusalem.  Now, after we have made the historic and legally required move, President Biden risks upsetting allies, a delicate diplomatic balance, and the authority of the law.  This resolution will reassert Congress’s clear position that the U.S. embassy should be in Jerusalem and it should not be divided.” Sen. Lee is joined in this effort by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Steve Daines (R-WY), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Roger Marshall (R-KS), John Hoeven (R-ND), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and John Boozman (R-AR) as cosponsors. To read a one-pager on the resolution, click HERE.For full text of the resolution, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-s-statement-in-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-hearing,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke in the Judiciary Committee Supreme Court nomination hearing of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson this morning highlighting what he will be looking for in the hearing and in Judge Jackson’s testimony.  Senator Lee reiterated his commitment to avoid personal attacks, highlighted the importance of humility in the judicial role, and advocated for protecting the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.  Sen. Lee’s remarks are found in transcript form below. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Judge Jackson for joining us today. I appreciated the conversation you and I had in my office a few days ago and your willingness to engage in a lively, interesting conversation during that and look forward to more of that this week. I've enjoyed also meeting your husband and your two lovely daughters. They are wonderful people.  I am grateful to you for your service, your service to the federal judiciary and as a member of the bar. You bring to the court, as I mentioned to you last week, a unique set of experiences. If you are confirmed, you will be someone who has served at all three levels of the federal judiciary, and as a result of that, you will have a perspective that is different than that of most who have served on that Court during the modern era. And I appreciate your willingness to be considered and to be here to talk to us about our questions.  I echo what many of my colleagues have said today in that I am dedicated, as I always have been, to making sure that these hearings are respectful. Engaging in the politics of personal destruction is not something we should ever aspire to. It is something that has occurred on this committee, in the context of Supreme Court nominations. I am pleased to say that it has never been under Republican leadership that such attacks have occurred, and I intend to make sure that this hearing is no exception to that. There are a few reasons for that.  First and foremost, the most obvious, is that respect to human beings requires it. Secondly, it is important because if we focus on personal attacks, that means we will be betraying our duty under the Constitution and to our constituents to make sure that we do our jobs fairly and properly. When we are focused on things that we have no business doing, like bringing forward spurious, last-minute, uncorroborated accusations of a personal nature, we neglect the importance of talking about the jurisprudential role, the philosophy that guides individual jurists, and the document that we have all sworn to uphold and protect, the Constitution of the United States.  It is also important for an additional reason, a third reason. It has to do with the fact that, having been nominated to this position, we know that you stand a very decent likelihood of ultimately being confirmed to this position. In which case, you will serve as a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I think it's important that even when, especially when, we disagree with decisions issued by that tribunal, we as a committee, as the Senate Judiciary Committee, not engage in speech or behavior that would undermine the legitimacy of the Supreme Court of the United States. You see it is the legitimacy of the courts that gives them their potence, their power, their significance in our system of government. We all have a duty to make sure that we do not undermine that very thing that we purport to be protecting.  Let me tell you some of the things that I look for when reviewing a nominee, and a few things that I intend to focus on in these hearings with you. One of them will involve any nominee’s commitment to judicial self-restraint, to understanding the judicial role, what it is and what it is not. Any judicial nominee these days will acknowledge that he or she understands that the role of the judge is to interpret the law based on what it says, rather than on the basis of the judge's personal opinion. This is all very true. It raises questions as to how exactly that goes about and what steps, what tools, what rhetorical linguistic devices the jurist in question might follow in order to do that. I am looking for someone who is, ideally, going to echo something that Justice Amy Coney Barrett said in her confirmation proceedings, in which she likened the Constitution, this document, written by wise men, nearly two and a half centuries ago, wise men who I believed were raised up by Almighty God to that very purpose. To the extent we have followed that document, it has helped foster the development of the greatest civilization the world has ever known, but she likened this, and our commitment to it, as a little like what Odysseus told his crew. She said the Constitution is like how Odysseus ties himself to the mast to resist the song of the sirens. She then goes on to explain that he told the crew, do not untie me, no matter how much I beg or plead, don't untie me from the mast. He wanted to avoid the tempting call of the sirens. The tempting call of the sirens is inherent, it is in government itself, it's understandable. And that is why we tie ourselves to it. Critical to that is the federal judiciary: the ultimate backstop, the backstop that’s there to resolve disputes.  Now, the Constitution is not just something for the courts. It is not something that is owned exclusively and independently by the federal judiciary or the Supreme Court itself. But it does play an important role, because the Court is there to resolve disputes that arise within the Court's jurisdiction, as to the meaning of a particular provision of federal law, whether in the Constitution itself, or as enacted into law by Congress. So we need a jurist who is willing to respect that role and demonstrate judicial humility. What I mean by that is an ability to acknowledge that there are a lot of things, not within the province of the courts, that entail policy, that the job of the Court, of the judiciary is never to exert will or force. It is only judgment. It is discerning what the law says. A nominee also, I believe, needs to show a steadfast commitment to the principle of separation of powers. There are a couple of forms of separation of powers required by the Constitution, along two axes. One operates along the vertical axis that we call federalism, that says most of the power of government within the United States, most powers that government might exercise are to be exercised at the state and local level. Power that is federal is the exception, not the norm, in our constitutional system of government.  The other form of separation of powers operates along the horizontal axis. It is one that recognizes within the federal government, which is limited, we are going to have one branch, our branch, of Congress that makes the laws, another branch headed by the President, the executive branch, that enforces them, and the third branch, which interprets them, resolving disputes between parties coming before the courts’ jurisdiction.  Third, I think it is important that a jurist within our system of government acknowledge the importance of interpreting the law as it was written, as it was understood by the public at the time of its enactment, if a statute, or if a provision of the Constitution at the time of its ratification. This is part of how we tie ourselves to the mast, making sure that we undertake efforts to make sure that we are interpreting it based on how the public understood those words, regardless of the subjective intent of any particular lawmaker or group thereof. The public meaning at the time it became law. This is how we maintain the rule of law. This is part of how we have given force to this greatest civilization that human history has ever recorded. It is through the rule of law and tying ourselves to that mast.  There are increasing threats to this. We have seen those threats arise with efforts to delegitimize the Court, and I am sickened every time I see or hear or experience one of those efforts to delegitimize it. We have heard some today, in fact. Comments that I think, by their very nature, delegitimize the Court. Another thing that can delegitimize the Court are arguments made in favor of packing the Supreme Court. This was attempted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937. It did lasting damage to the Court. It didn't succeed as a legislative matter, but it is arguable that it left a mark, and not a pretty one. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires us to have nine and only nine justices. That is, under the Constitution, left to Congress's determination. But nine is a number that works. It has worked now for 152 years. It is not one that we ought to revisit, and it is one that Supreme Court justices of various ideologies, including your former boss, Justice Breyer, whom I really enjoyed getting to know, when serving as a law clerk on the Supreme Court, enjoyed our conversations with him. He, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Thomas, and so many others have been against that. We must protect the Court. We may not protect the Court. We lose ability to protect the Court if we allow arguments to take root that are focused on expanding that and turning the Court into a political body.  For full video of the statement, click HERE."

I invite you to take the time to review and reflect on this material along with the role of faith in our society. If there is anything you may like to see in future newsletters, please do not hesitate to let me know.Michael S. LeeUnited States Senator for Utah  Sponsored Legislation1.

Child Welfare Provision Inclusion Act2. Lee-Rubio Child Tax Credit Plan From CommitteeThe Joint Economic Committee is Congress’s bicameral economic research center led by Ranking Member Mike Lee.Ranking Member Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) shared an illustrative story from the Return Utah program in today’s Joint Economic Committee hearing on older workers. The new workforce training initiative, created by Utah’s Lieutenant Governor Deidre Henderson, is designed to help Utahns who are looking for work after an extended absence. Click to watch Ranking Member Lee’s remarks below:   “Ultimately, a thriving, unencumbered economy is the best way to allow older Americans to make the choices best suited for themselves and their families—whether that’s spending more time with the kids and grandkids, volunteering in a local congregation, maintaining a long healthy working life, or all of the above.”Read Ranking Member Lee’s full remarks HERE, and testimony from Dr. Andrew Biggs, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, HERE. Senator Lee has been fighting to protect Americans’ freedoms to exercise their beliefs. Check out this clip against Biden’s vaccine mandate from a recent JEC hearing.“The federal vaccine mandate is an obstacle to connecting people to work, and there is no legal or constitutional authority for it. Under the mandate, some Americans would be forced to make a personal health decision against their will or face losing their job. This ultimatum to workers is unacceptable and immoral.”   Click here to see the full clip.  Here are reports from the second volume of our Social Capital Project:  Expanding Child Care Choices  The tax code shouldn’t discriminate against single-income families who choose to have a parent stay at home. Senator Lee recommended reforming tax benefits to make it easier for families to raise children in the way they deem best.  Higher Education and Family Formation  The popular narrative that student debt delays marriage and kids paints a misleading picture. Policymakers should focus on making higher education work better for Americans by allowing competition, improving income-based repayment, and supporting community colleges, trade schools, and non-traditional pathways to the workforce.  Balancing the Costs of School Closures  School closures throughout the COVID-19 pandemic harmed children’s learning and the mental health of parents, students, and teachers. Senator Lee supports improving America’s educational system with innovative alternatives to traditional one-size-fits-all education.  Finally, these shorter pieces with social capital information are about how the pandemic has created unique obstacles to religious participation, how car seat laws indirectly raise the costs of having a third child, and whether families will want to continue homeschooling after schools fully reopen.   Please contact Chris Coombs (Chris_Coombs@Lee.Senate.Gov) to receive complimentary copies of the Joint Economic Committee’s Social Capital Project publications: An Overview of Social Capital Vol. 1 & A Policy Agenda for Social Capital Vol. 2. Judicial CasesCarson v. Makin: Public education funding and religious educationTo ensure school-age children receive a free public education, the Maine State Legislature created a tuition assistance program. However, private schools labeled as “sectarian” by the state were not approved for funding. In 2018, three sets of parents filed against the state, alleging an infringement on their First Amendment rights. The Court will decide whether a state violates the Constitution by prohibiting students from choosing to use their aid to attend schools that provide religious instruction. The case will involve the Supreme Court's decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue (2020). Ramirez v. Collier: Religious accommodations during an executionIn 2008, Ramirez was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. One month before his execution, Ramirez filed a spiritual advisory claim requesting to have his pastor be permitted to pray aloud and physically touch him in the execution chamber while the sentence was carried out. After Texas denied this request, Ramirez appealed arguing a violation of his constitutional rights by declining to accommodate all of his religious needs. The Court will decide if allowing a pastor to enter the execution chamber but not physically touch Ramirez or pray aloud violates his constitutional rights of free exercise. Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany v. Lacewell: Mandating insurance cover abortionsIn 2017, New York passed a regulation mandating that employer health insurance plans cover abortions. The mandate applies to a subset of religious organizations who do not support abortions. The Court will answer three questions: (1) if the regulation is “neutral” and “generally applicable” under Smith and City of Hialeah (2) if New York’s regulation violates the First Amendment by interfering with the autonomy of religious entities and (3) if the Court’s decision in Smith should be overruled?  The case will involve the Supreme Court's decision Employment Division v. Smith (1990). Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo: Limiting occupancy for religious servicesThe Court granted injunctive relief to stop New York Governor Cuomo from enforcing Executive Order 202.68’s 10- and 25-person occupancy limits on religious services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Court found that the plaintiff's rights to free exercise were most likely violated because Cuomo’s orders “single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment” that were not imposed on stores, factories, and schools.  Dignity Health v. Minton: Requiring religious hospital to permit medical proceduresThe case concerns whether a California Catholic hospital can be required to perform a hysterectomy on a transgender patient. The Court will answer if (1) free exercise and (2) freedom of expression and association are violated where the State compels a religiously affiliated hospital to allow medical procedures that violate its longstanding, deeply held religious beliefs. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization: Ban on abortions after 15 weeksIn 2018, Mississippi enacted the ""Gestational Age Act,"" which effectively prohibits abortions after 15-weeks. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion facility in Mississippi, challenged the law as unconstitutional arguing the earliest point where a State can justify a ban on abortions is after 24-weeks where there is fetal viability. The Court will consider the constitutionality of Mississippi’s law prohibiting abortions after the fifteenth week of pregnancy except in cases of medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities. The case will involve the Supreme Court's decision Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).  Recent Press Releases Sen.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-introduces-bill-to-help-victims-of-vaccine-adverse-reactions,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced his Countermeasure Injury Compensation Amendment Act to help those who have suffered adverse reactions from the COVID-19 vaccines.  Current law provides redress measures for patients who have suffered adverse reactions to vaccines and other countermeasures used to promote public health.  Unfortunately, the thousands of patients who have sought relief for adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines have not received compensation under the existing framework. Senator Lee’s bill would amend the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Act (CICP) to improve responsiveness, create a commission to examine the injuries directly caused as a result of COVID-19 countermeasures, and allow those whose claims have been previously rejects to resubmit claims for new consideration. Regarding the bill, Sen. Lee said, “The federal government has encouraged all Americans to receive the COVID-19 vaccines.  While these vaccines have been miraculous and have helped save innumerable lives, there are always some who experience adverse reactions.  My Countermeasure Injury Compensation Amendment Act will help build trust in future medical treatments and to make sure those who were harmed are properly compensated.” Brianne Dressen, a Utah mother who experienced a serious adverse reaction as a participant in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, said of the bill,  “What would this bill mean?  It would mean those who are suffering adverse reactions will no longer have to decide between putting the bread on the table or picking up that critical prescription from the pharmacyor paying rent vs going to the doctor.  For those of us waiting for critical compensation, this bill very well could be the difference between healing, and suffering and declining.” Sen. Lee is joined by Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) as cosponsors. To read a one-pager of the bill, click HERE.For full text of the bill, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-leads-letter-to-defend-second-amendment,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today led a group of twenty Senators in a letter to the Attorney General and the Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) expressing concern over the ATF’s use of secret internal guidance to enforce regulations that are not openly published.  This secret guidance has been used to justify the seizure of property and could troublingly be used to prosecute Americans and businesses. The letter reads in part, “We write to express our grave concern over the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives’ (ATF) continued pattern of enforcing secret guidance.  This secret guidance was brought to our attention by those who have received recent threatening letters where the ATF makes blanket threats based on the recipient allegedly purchasing and possessing various firearms accessories, none of which are illegal based on any statute or regulation.” “We find the ATF’s attempt to conceal its interpretations of the law disturbing.  In a free society, ‘Every citizen is presumed to know the law.’  Thus, as the Supreme Court has said, ‘it needs no argument to show that all should have free access’ to [the law’s] contents.” The letter continues, “With this attempted secret regulation, the ATF shows an abject disregard for the fundamental principles of due process and accountable governance. Federal agencies cannot enforce the law in this manner.  The signatories as of this release are:Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)Sen. James E. Risch (R-ID)Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC)Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL)Sen.

Ted Cruz (R-TX)  Travis R. White, President and CEO of the Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition said of the letter, “The Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition (“FRAC”) sincerely appreciates Senator Lee for his initiative and steadfast leadership in this matter, and his unwavering resolve to stand with industry and the American People in demanding accountability, transparency, and fairness (A-T-F) from the ATF. The ATF’s recent abuses—to include the use of secretive rules and documents—is a gross dereliction of fundamental regulatory ethics and we are proud to stand with Senator Lee and his colleagues in the Senate in demanding answers from ATF.”Aidan Jonhnston, Director of Federal Affairs of Gun Owners of America said of the effort, “The ATF will stop at nothing to criminalize gun owners and attack the Second Amendment. This time, their scheme is to criminalize solvent traps -- tools that gun owners use while cleaning their firearms. By mislabeling solvent traps as silencers, the ATF makes it clear that they not only do not understand how firearms really work, but also that they are willing to turn law-abiding Americans into criminals overnight to push their anti-gun agenda.”For full text of the letter, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-introduces-supply-chain-bill-to-counter-inflation,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the SHIP IT Act today to help ease the nations supply chain crisis and counter rising inflation by simplifying or suspending certain federal regulations on ports, ships, and trucks.  Empty shelves and backlogged ports have wreaked havoc on American businesses and families.  This bill focuses on streamlining the process to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves.   The SHIP IT Act builds on and expands Sen. Lee’s STOP the GRINCH Act which was introduced in 2021. For details of the bill, a one-pager of the bill can be read here.  Of the bill, Sen. Lee said, “The SHIP IT Act will help us ease our port congestion at the source and combat rising inflation.  Our supply chains and distribution networks are struggling under the combined weight of increased demand, global disruption, and heavy federal regulation.  This bill will provide the relief our nation’s supply chains need to get products off of ships, into trucks, and onto shelves, and help Utah families get everyday necessities at prices they can afford.” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is a cosponsor of the bill.  Sen. Lummis said, “Congress must find ways to relieve the pressures of the supply chain crisis on people in Wyoming. The SHIP IT Act would cut red tape and ease factors that are increasing prices and slowing down shipping times for goods that we need. I am happy to work with Senator Mike Lee on this bill.” A one-pager of the bill is available HERE.For full text of the bill, HERE."

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/senator-lee-leads-letter-to-defund-federal-vaccine-mandates,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) today led a group of Senators in defense of Americans targeted by President Biden’s vaccine mandates, making clear in a letter to colleagues they will not consent to expedited passage of a funding bill that allows the vaccine mandates to continue. At minimum, the Senators demanded a roll call vote on an amendment to defund the enforcement of remaining federal vaccine mandates on government contractors, members of the military, all other federal employees, and medical care providers. The letter reads in part “We have consistently opposed President Biden’s federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which would force millions of Americans to choose between an unwanted medical procedure and being able to provide for their families. For legal, constitutional, and policy reasons, we remain strongly opposed to the mandates and will continue to work to end their imposition on Americans. The letter continues, “These COVID-19 vaccine mandates amount to a serious abuse of both federal power and executive authority.  … President Biden has no business forcing people to make a tragic choice between unemployment and an unwanted vaccination. Additionally, it is particularly troubling for the President to ask thousands of troops to amass in eastern Europe while simultaneously demanding they get a politicized vaccine. “History will bear record of whether we chose to endure tyranny, or oppose it, in this pivotal moment. We invite you to stand with us and oppose the continued funding of these mandates.”  The signatories are:Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT)Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL)Sen.

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/sen-lee-introduces-bill-countering-inflation,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Preventing Runaway Inflation in Consumer Expenditures (PRICE) Act today. This bill builds upon Senator Lee’s budget amendment that received 49 votes during the August 2021 budget reconciliation process. The PRICE Act requires a 3/5 majority of Senators to approve new spending measures when the nation’s inflation rate is at or above 3%. Runaway federal spending has been a major contributor to current inflation, which is now charted as the highest rate in four decades. This bill follows a report on inflation from Senator Lee’s Social Capital Project. The report shows that while nationally inflation is at 7.5%, in Utah and other Mountain West states, inflation is much higher at 9%. Nationally families pay an extra $385 a month due to inflation; in Utah, the average family pays an extra $511 a month due to increased inflation. Of the bill and rising inflation Sen. Lee said, “Inflation is a hidden tax making life more expensive for and harder on Utah families. The federal government is largely to blame for this prolonged spike in the cost of living, and we must do more to restrain spending and give security to Utah families. I am committed to protecting the Utah way of life and keeping our communities affordable for hardworking Utah families. The PRICE Act will help do just that.”  Senator Rick Scott (FL) joins Senator Lee as a cosponsor. For a one-pager on the bill, click HERE.For full text of the bill, click HERE."
https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/3/sen-lee-introduces-bill-granting-immediate-ssdi-benefits-for-terminally-ill,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced his Immediate Access for the Terminally Ill Act today.  The bill would allow terminally ill patients with certain diagnoses with limited life expectancies to choose to forego the current five-month waiting period and receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits immediately. Of the bill Sen. Lee said, “Social Security Disability Insurance provides a financial safety net for disabled workers but requires a five-month waiting period prior to receipt of benefits. Unfortunately, for some Americans who suffer from illnesses that are clearly disabling long-term, have short life expectancies, and have no known cure, five months is simply too long. If passed, my bill could put SSDI benefits into patients’ hands sooner, relieving some of the stress associated with end-of-life care."" Stan Lockhart, a Utah advocate for those with rare diseases who lost his wife, former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives, Becky Lockhart, to Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease, said of the bill, “In the blink of an eye, a rare disease can flip a family’s life upside down. I have seen firsthand the pain and difficulty rare diseases can inflict. Waiting periods and bureaucratic red tape can make the most stressful moments of a family's life even worse. Senator Lee's Immediate Access for the Terminally Ill Act, gives families the option to receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits when they need them, and unlike far too much lawmaking in this space, it puts families in control. The bill doesn't prioritize one disease over others; it provides fair relief to patients with rare diseases while protecting taxpayer resources. I endorse this bill wholeheartedly.""  For a one-pager on the bill, click HERE.For full text of the bill, click HERE."

https://www.lee.senate.gov/2022/2/sen-mike-lee-remarks-on-the-passing-of-walter-estes-dellinger-iii,"Walter Dellinger was a scholar, a friend, and a lawyer’s lawyer.I first met him when I invited him to speak at a religious freedom conference I helped organize while I was in law school. His presentation was exceptional, and he showed genuine interest in teaching and uplifting every person with whom he interacted.One of those people was my father, who (unbeknownst to me prior to the conference) had known Walter for years and considered him a friend. My dad was battling late-stage cancer at the time, and didn’t have long to live. Sensing that he’d likely never see my dad again, Walter went out of his way to thank him for attending, praise him for his contributions to both the study and practice of law, and seek his advice regarding the role of the Solicitor General (Walter was about to be named to that post, which my dad had held more than a decade earlier).My dad died just a few weeks after the conference. A few months after my dad’s death, Walter hosted a wonderful memorial service for my father at the Department of Justice, where he offered kind words of condolence to my family.A few years later, Walter served as opposing counsel in a case my brother and I litigated—a case that culminated in arguments before the Supreme Court. After Walter’s client won the case in a complicated, split ruling, Walter called us to offer his perspective on the case, pointing out interesting nuances in the Court’s ruling, and praising us for the manner in which we had handled the case.In the decades since then, Walter and I have continued to visit from time to time, and I have always left our conversations feeling uplifted and educated by his wisdom—just as I have felt on each of the many occasions when he has testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I have served for the last 11 years.In every conversation I have ever had with him, Walter has offered encouragement, kind words, and sound advice. And although he and I had very different political views, that didn’t matter to him; friendship easily overcame politics for Walter.I’m grateful to have known Walter Dellinger, and mourn his loss. My thoughts and prayers are with his family."
