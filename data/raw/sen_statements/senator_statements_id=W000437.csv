https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/9/wicker-hyde-smith-move-to-make-distribution-of-deadly-fentanyl-chargeable-as-felony-murder,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., on Thursday joined U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in introducing legislation to make the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death chargeable as a felony murder.In instances of deaths resulting from illegal fentanyl-related opiates, the Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act (S.4876) would amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to make it a felony to distribute fentanyl and fentanyl-analogs if the dealer has knowledge or reason to know that the substance they are dealing contains fentanyl or a fentanyl-analog.“The lethal drug fentanyl is destroying lives across the country, and dealers who put it on our streets should be held responsible,” Wicker said. “This bill would send a strong signal that the federal government will not tolerate this deadly drug which is tearing apart communities, or those who distribute it.”“The Biden administration has failed to enforce multiple policies to stop fentanyl from coming across the border, even though it is now the leading cause of death for adults aged 18 to 45,” Hyde-Smith said.  “This legislation is desperately needed to protect our communities by ensuring harsher consequences to those who knowingly distribute this deadly drug in Mississippi and across the country.”According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, authorities seized enough fentanyl in July — 2,071 pounds — to kill 469 million Americans.  That is up from 680 pounds seized in June as the issue continues to hit close to home for far too many Americans, whether or not they live in a border-state. Under current law, the CSA treats all Schedule I and Schedule II drugs the same for purposes of distribution resulting in death by mandating a 20-year minimum and no more than life, despite varying degrees of lethality, availability, and medicinal purposes.A March 2022 Mississippi State Department of Health report shows a sharp escalation of overall deaths in Mississippi involving fentanyl, including a 125 percent increase in overdose fatalities due to synthetic opioids from 2019 to 2020.Additional S.4876 cosponsors include Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).Click here to read the text of S.4876, which has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/9/wicker-hyde-smith-colleagues-say-unprecedented-drug-price-control-scheme-threatens-innovation-future-drug-costs,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., this week raised concerns about the risks of serious unintended consequences as the Biden administration attempts to establish a permanent government price control program for prescription drugs.Wicker, Hyde-Smith and 23 other Republican Senators signed a letter that asks Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to weigh impacts on health care access, research and development, and domestic manufacturing under the unprecedented price-setting scheme enacted with the Democrats’ misnamed “Inflation Reduction” bill. Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) led the letter to highlight the outsized risks the government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole.“As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years,” the Senators wrote.“Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.   The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight,” the Senators continued.“Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts,” the Senators said.The letter requests responses to a series of questions regarding the implementation of the program, which is being funded with billions of taxpayer dollars.The letter is available here and below: Dear Secretary Becerra and Administrator Brooks-LaSure:Congress recently acted, on a party-line basis, to establish a permanent government price-setting program for prescription drugs, financed with billions of taxpayer dollars and enforced through an unprecedented excise tax of up to 95 percent.  We write to express concerns with the disruptive and distortive administrative undertaking that the implementation of this far-reaching federal expansion will inevitably represent, as well as to raise a number of questions regarding your department’s plans for putting this new program into practice.  Given the outsize risks that the impending government pricing initiative poses for patients, frontline health care providers, small businesses, and the American economy as a whole, we urge you to weigh both direct and indirect impacts on health care access, research and development (R&D), and domestic manufacturing as you take the first steps toward implementing this program.As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed, the government price controls codified under the recently enacted reconciliation legislation have the potential to increase launch prices for new medications, as well as to trigger fewer new drug approvals in the coming years.  Scores of life-threatening conditions, from cancer to Alzheimer’s and sickle cell disease, could see a substantial decline in possible treatment options on the horizon.  Moreover, based on CBO’s analysis, some manufacturers may choose to terminate participation in Medicare and Medicaid altogether as a result of the compulsory new price-setting program, jeopardizing access to a range of therapies and cures for the most vulnerable Americans.  Other independent analyses have projected even more catastrophic consequences, from hundreds of thousands of domestic job losses to hundreds of billions in forgone R&D dollars.  The innovation ecosystem that has made the United States the world’s unquestioned life sciences leader, bolstered by thousands of startups and small businesses, may wither under this partisan legislation, particularly in the absence of careful, deliberative implementation and assertive, consumer-oriented oversight.Given the profound health care, economic, and national security implications of this anomalous new federal program, we ask that you carefully consider these and other threats, from depressed drug discovery and development to diminished medical access and cascades of health care provider cuts.  In light of the urgent importance of clarity and caution regarding the forthcoming implementation of this colossal government initiative, please provide the following information by the close of business on October 28, 2022: "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/9/wicker-hyde-smith-move-to-nullify-biden-restrictions-on-charter-schools,"The Mississippi lawmakers are original cosponsors of Congressional Review Act (CRA) legislation (S.J.Res.60), which would stop a U.S. Department of Education final rule that violates congressional intent for supporting charter schools.“Educational freedom has helped millions of Americans build better and more prosperous lives,” Wicker said.  “President Biden’s proposed rule targeting charter schools would restrict that freedom, and I am glad to join Senator Hyde-Smith in opposing its implementation.”“The Biden administration’s wholehearted embrace of teacher unions shouldn’t result in rules that hogtie charter schools and the choices they offer parents and students.  Unfortunately, that’s just what the Education Department’s new rule does,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I hope a majority of Senators agree that the administration exceeded its authority and overturn this harmful rule.”S.J.Res.60 is based on the fact that the Secretary of Education exceeded his authority and violated congressional intent by making substantial changes to the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP).  The new rule includes a broad range of federal mandates intended to restrict the growth of charter schools around the country.Among other things, the new rule would force charter schools to co-develop curriculum with traditional public school bureaucracies. In addition, charter schools applying for federal grants would be required to conduct a federally-micromanaged “needs analysis” that requires schools to provide a description of projected demographics to ensure student body and staff diversity.Congress can consider S.J.Res.60 using expedited procedures under the CRA and pass it by a simple majority vote.U.S. Senator Tim Scott, R-S.C., introduced S.J.Res.60, which is also cosponsored by Senators Richard Burr, R-N.C., Bill Cassidy, M.D., R-La., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., James Lankford, R-Okla., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Steve Daines, R-Mont., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., John Cornyn, R-Texas, James Risch, R-Idaho, Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Todd Young, R-Ind., Rand Paul, R-Ky., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas."

Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight.Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe saw to it that the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act remained bipartisan and the result safeguards the United States. Additionally, the bill invests in technology advancements and procurement through a $45 billion budget topline increase, provides service members with a 4.6 percent pay raise, and strengthens our forces in cybersecurity, space, the Indo-Pacific, personnel management, and many other areas.Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 - 101. For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process. As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period."

School children and the average citizens across America raised money to support grieving families.And we remember the courage of our troops, who within weeks had al-Qaeda terrorists on the run – and whose persistent efforts over the years would bring countless terrorists to justice -- evil men like Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.And we’ve bolstered our national defense with thousands of national security professionals who now have the tools they need to make sure nothing like that day ever happens again.We will never forget 9/11."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/9/wicker-introduces-mississippian-bill-renick-at-tennessee-valley-authority-nomination-hearing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a member of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, today introduced Mississippi native Bill Renick of Ashland during his confirmation hearing to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Board of Directors.In his remarks, Wicker praised Renick as the right pick for the agency, touting his credentials as “job creator” who delivers for Mississippi in a bipartisan fashion, dating back to his days as Wicker’s colleague in the Mississippi state Senate. Wicker made clear his support for Renick’s nomination in June when the White House announced it, saying Renick has a “proven record of serving our state.”Read a transcript of Sen. Wicker’s introductory remarks below or watch them here.Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.I am delighted to be here today to say a word or two about the importance that TVA continues to have for our region and for my state of Mississippi, and to congratulate all three nominees.I'm sure Mr. White and Mr. Ritch are absolutely outstanding, but, to give as ringing of an endorsement as I possibly can for Bill Renick of Ashland, Mississippi.A word or two about the history of TVA. In 1930, Mississippi had electric power in 85% of its larger municipalities, but only 1.5% of rural farms and homes. And coming along in 1933, TVA was a game changer.The goal was simple: to improve living and economic conditions in seven southeastern states. And TVA has done that, and continues to do that in new and different ways.I grew up in the small town of Pontotoc, Mississippi, and I'll help your transcribers spell that later on, Mr. Chairman. I now make my home in my wife's native town of Tupelo, and we've lived there for some decades.Tupelo is proudly known as the first TVA city. It was the first to purchase electric power from the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the TVA lights came on in Tupelo in 1934.Today, TVA utilities are located in 36 of our 82 counties and serve more than 359,000 households. TVA has made significant contributions to our economic development. Between 2017 and 2021, TVA created or retained over 26,000 jobs in Mississippi and invested $3.6 billion in our economy. So they are far, far more than a provider of electric power.They are a job creator for places like Cooper Tire and Steel Dynamics and Milwaukee Tools in north Mississippi.Which leads me to my enthusiastic endorsement of Bill Renick to serve on the TVA board. I served with Bill Renick in the State Senate, back in ‘88 and forward. He's a great job creator.He has worked for Three Rivers Planning and Development District, from which he is now retired.And we have a wonderful group of planning and development districts, but I can tell you, none finer than Three Rivers Planning and Development District. He was Workforce Division director there, Mr. Chairman. He currently chairs the Commission on the Future of North Mississippi.And let me say a word about bipartisanship. And I think the Ranking Member, Mr. Inhofe, will agree with this. Senator Markey is a dear personal friend of mine. Our wives are cordial. We try to agree on things when we can.Let me tell you about bipartisanship. Bill Renick was elected as alderman, mayor, county supervisor, and state senator as a north Mississippi Democrat back in the day. He went right straight from that, Mr. Chairman, to being the campaign manager for a statewide candidate for governor on the Republican ticket. He went right from there to being the chief staff person in the Mississippi State Senate for a Republican lieutenant governor of the state of Mississippi.And it wasn't very many years after that that a certain Democratic governor of Mississippi was looking around for talent and a new chief of staff for his Democratic administration, and he chose Bill Renick.So having managed to campaign statewide as a Republican, having been a chief of staff as a Republican, and a chief of staff as a Democrat; we need more bipartisanship like Bill Renick can deliver.And also, we need the job creation and work training expertise that Bill Renick will bring to this office. Mr. Chairman, have I made it clear the enthusiasm I have, and the great fortune we have in this nation and in the TVA region for the fact that the President has nominated Mr. Bill Renick?And I yield."

In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years - while others are not taking orders at all,” the letter continued.To address this urgent matter, the lawmakers asked Biden to “direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required,” and to “engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.”In addition to Wicker and Hyde-Smith, others signing the letter include Senators Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., and U.S. Representatives David Kustoff, R-Tenn., Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., John Rose, R-Tenn., Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn., Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., Morgan Griffith, R-Va., and Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn.Read the letter here or below.Dear Mr. President:We are writing to encourage you to take further action to address the urgent supply chain shortages threatening our region’s electric infrastructure.  Beyond the current invocation of the Defense Production Act for certain energy infrastructure components, more must be done to ensure electric reliability heading into storm season.We have heard from Local Power Companies serving our region that the availability of transformers is particularly dire.  Transformers are a crucial component of electricity delivery at substations and utility poles.  This equipment is important not only for keeping up with economic growth, but for restoring power after storms and other extreme weather events.  In the past months, costs are skyrocketing, and lead times for some manufacturers are up to two years - while others are not taking orders at all.At issue is the availability of raw materials like steel.  Your Capstone report on America’s Supply Chains notes that there is only one domestic manufacturer of the steel used to produce transformers, and this company is unable to meet demand.  The Department of Energy’s (DOE) February 2022 report which informed that conclusion recommends, among other things, lowering manufacturing costs of large power transformers.At a minimum, we request that you direct DOE to temporarily suspend its most recent conservation standards for transformers, which require manufacturers to use more steel than previously required.  According to a letter sent to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm by the American Public Power Association and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, this would allow manufacturers to increase transformer availability by allowing less steel to be used for each device.Further, we request you engage the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to engage with suppliers and utilities to determine whether stockpiles of transformers, particularly those that may have been purchased with federal funds, may exist that can be called upon in emergency situations.Thank you for your attention to this matter."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/9/wicker-travels-state-to-meet-with-mississippians,"Each year during August, I get the chance to travel extensively in Mississippi to meet with constituents while Congress is out of session. This past month, I met with a wide range of small business owners, employees, parents, civic groups, and local leaders, some of whom are managing new infrastructure projects. I am encouraged by the great deal of progress happening across our state. However, the Jackson water crisis and our slowing economy have posed significant challenges.  Jackson Loses Water Supply   Last week’s flooding along the Pearl River and the subsequent loss of water supply has affected more than 180,000 residents in the Jackson area. Early in the crisis, I met with Mayor Lumumba to tour the rising floodwaters and discuss emerging needs. Governor Reeves soon announced the imminent failure of Jackson’s water system, and President Biden granted a federal emergency declaration. It is critical that we receive all available resources as officials work to restore water access in the capital.  As Mississippi’s senior U.S. Senator, I am hopeful that we can soon enact a long-term solution to these problems. As a direct result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I helped negotiate, Mississippi will be able to draw upon at least $429 million over the next five years to address water and wastewater problems. These funds will supplement other money that has already been set aside for Mississippi but is not yet spent. It is also clear that we need to address flooding that coincided with the water crisis. As the historic rain was falling, I hosted a group of federal officials in Jackson to discuss a long-delayed plan for flood control along the Pearl River developed by state and local leaders. I will continue calling on the Biden Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to approve this proposal and let us get to work.  New Projects Move Forward   Throughout my August travels, I met with builders and manufacturers who are unleashing new growth across our state. I had the chance to meet with transportation officials coordinating the construction of new highways and bridges, as well as Mississippi shipbuilders and parts manufacturers who are supplying our Navy with world-class equipment. I also visited chemical and asphalt plants, met with furniture makers, and helped mark the beginning of construction on a federal courthouse in Greenville. Additionally, I celebrated the opening of a new Adranos rocket facility in McHenry, which will build high-end rockets to help us beat China in the next space race. These and other examples of development bring the promise of jobs and prosperity to Mississippi, and I will continue to support them through legislation in Congress.  Tax Hikes Loom Over Job Creators   Despite these positive trends, Mississippians are struggling under our slowing economy. Inflation, which is near a 40-year high, continues to drive up prices. Job creators still cannot find enough workers – a problem that became entrenched with President Biden’s extended welfare benefits. Many are also rightly disturbed by the President’s decision to pay off hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt with our taxes – a move that is unfair and will make inflation worse. On top of all this, the President’s new tax hikes are forcing many job creators to rethink their plans for expansion, dimming the prospects for a recovery. With Congress now returning to session, I will continue to bring these concerns to the table as we seek solutions to our nation’s challenges."

And the American people are seeing this, they’re being very responsive, and we’re going to need additional federal help to salvage the lives, homes, and futures of our major city,” Wicker said. “I have six grandchildren that live inside the city limits in Jackson. This is personal to me, and it’s my capital city.”As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Wicker also highlighted the millions of dollars in new investments in Mississippi water and wastewater infrastructure that will come from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which he supported.“We have money in the pipeline. The bipartisan infrastructure bill provided Mississippi $429 million for water and sewer treatment…there’s help on the way.”Wicker saw the challenges Jackson faces firsthand last week when he visited with residents and community leaders affected by flooding in the region. Read his column on that visit here."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-statement-on-jackson-water-crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today released the following statement regarding the ongoing water crisis in Jackson:“I have long supported federal efforts to improve Mississippi’s water and wastewater infrastructure. I am ready to support the city and state as they seek additional resources to address this crisis.”"
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-pushes-flood-relief-for-mississippians,"This week marks 17 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. Since that horrific storm, we have taken significant steps to prevent future disasters by improving our drainage systems, flood walls, and levees. The same cannot be said for residents of metro Jackson and the South Delta, who continue to face persistent flooding. Just last week, heavy rains caused flash flood damage across Mississippi, and in February 2020, Jackson floodwaters rose to their third-highest level on record. Meanwhile, South Delta residents have suffered repeated property damage, crop failure, and even death because of backwater floods, which were especially severe in 2019. These flood threats are not going away and require investments in new infrastructure.Pearl River Project Nears Final DecisionI have consistently pushed for flood control projects across Mississippi, and last week was an important milestone in moving the ball forward. Last Tuesday, I met with local mayors, county supervisors, and Army Corps of Engineers officials to discuss the need for the Pearl River Flood Control Project in Jackson. This proposal, which is being reviewed by the Army Corps, would widen the Pearl River, enlarge levees, and remove chokepoints that have caused upstream flooding. This plan would protect Hinds and Rankin counties from more than $1 billion in potential damages, shielding our homes, roads, hospitals, rail, and other infrastructure. Studies show that 92 percent of the structures affected by the 2020 flood would in fact be protected under this plan.Last year, I helped secure $300,000 for the Army Corps to complete a study of this proposal, and a final decision should be released soon. If the project is approved, Jackson area residents will benefit from safer living conditions and improved quality of life.Biden Officials Hear From Delta ResidentsSouth Delta residents have also suffered greatly from a lack of flood protection. In 1941, Congress promised to provide flood control to areas up and down the Mississippi River, and for the South Delta, this included a system of levees, flood gates, and backwater pumps. However, for more than 80 years, federal bureaucracy and misinformation have delayed the final component of this project – the backwater pumps. As a result, rainwaters have continually been trapped in the Yazoo Backwater Area, resulting in flooded homes, ruined crops, and billions of dollars in damage. To our great frustration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has blocked the pumps project twice in the last 15 years, leaving Delta residents vulnerable to continued flooding.Last week, I joined Congressman Bennie Thompson and Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith to host Biden officials in the South Delta, where we held meetings with local leaders and discussed the need for the Yazoo Pump Project. We had representatives from multiple federal agencies, including the EPA, FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior, and the President’s Council on Environmental Quality. Our most important event was a listening session that was attended by hundreds of South Delta residents who shared their unfiltered stories of loss and hardship. It was clear that virtually every Delta resident in attendance had suffered immensely from the continued flooding.These federal officials learned a lot, and I can only hope they were moved by hearing from citizens who have to live with the fear that their homes or businesses will flood every time we have a heavy rain. I was encouraged that the group seemed willing to work with us toward a solution, and I will continue to hold them accountable to that commitment until they finally deliver on the promise of flood control for South Delta residents. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/letter-to-the-editor-if-you-want-peace-prepare-industry-for-war,"Elbridge Colby and Alexander Gray are exactly right that our defense supply chain needs strengthening (“America’s Industrial Base Isn’t Ready for War With China,” op-ed, Aug. 19). Emerging threats require a major increase in defense spending if we are going to retain deterrence.These new defense dollars must be well-dispersed and targeted. Contrary to popular caricature, our defense industrial base is made up of producers both large and small. My state of Mississippi, for example, is home to an array of defense enterprises employing anywhere from a few dozen to thousands of workers. Many smaller producers provide niche components for vital systems.Seemann Composites in Gulfport, Miss., is a good example. This family-owned business is the only U.S. firm that can produce resin-infused bow domes (nose cones) for Navy submarines. Taylor Machine offers industrial and logistical support to our military. U.S. Marine, Inc., another Mississippi company, is one of the few suppliers for highly-maneuverable craft for special operators—critical for contested environments.There are thousands of companies across the country like these. We will need all of them and more to prevent a costly war in the Pacific. Congress should signal demand now so that these suppliers can invest in their workforce and boost capacity for the long haul.This letter to the editor originally appeared in the Wall Street Journal. Read it here."

Many Americans have taken a different path to avoid student debt – for example, serving in the military or pursuing a different career option. The President’s action takes their hard-earned tax money and gives it to those who made financial decisions that the President favors. This is deeply unfair.”“The President’s action is also potentially illegal and will almost certainly invite legal challenges. President Biden is testing the outer limits of his authority and could soon face a reality check in court.”"

This portal could help cut through red tape and make it easier to get the permits and licenses needed to comply with federal and state requirements as businesses launch and begin to operate.“We have heard from many small business owners in our communities that accessing information on the vast array of business permitting and licensing rules is difficult, especially for those launching businesses for the first time,” said the senators. “SBA has made important strides in providing online resources through its Learning Center, but we believe more can be done to help entrepreneurs, particularly those running startups, get the information they need to start, build, and expand their businesses and cut through bureaucratic red tape.”“To assist with that effort, we would like to explore Congressional authorization for the creation of a centralized SBA portal to serve as a one-stop shop where small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs can find all applicable information on federal, state, and local permitting and licensing for starting and operating a small business,” the senators continued.The full letter can be found here."

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-assesses-damage-from-biden-tax-hike,"As our economy enters a recession, Democrats in Washington have chosen to use the last remaining months of the congressional term to impose new taxes on the American people. Their $739 billion tax-and-spend bill, dishonestly titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” has now passed both the House and Senate without a single Republican vote. As a result, job creators are now bracing for higher taxes and an economic slump with no end in sight. It is stunning that Democrats approved this tax increase days after poor economic news had come to light. Last week, the Labor Department reported jobless claims had reached their highest level all year. The department also reported July inflation at 8.5 percent – only a meager drop from June’s dangerously high rate of 9.1 percent. Grocery prices rose by 13.1 percent in July and electricity costs soared by 15.2 percent, the largest increase since 2006. Meanwhile, workers took home three percent less in real weekly earnings as the dollar continued to lose value. This new round of taxes and spending will likely make inflation even worse and is the opposite of what working Americans need. Small Businesses Brace for Impact Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, employing nearly half of the American workforce. Many of these small businesses did not survive the pandemic, and those that did are now treading water amid high inflation and a chronic worker shortage. The Democrats’ bill completely ignores these challenges. Under their legislation, small businesses that file as individuals will now have to shoulder an additional $50 billion in tax burden. They will also be much more likely to face audits from the IRS, which will now be hiring an army of 87,000 new agents. Because of this bill, Main Street businesses can expect more IRS harassment and higher compliance costs, making it that much harder to keep the doors open. Another Step Toward Socialized Medicine In addition to hurting our economy, this bill will likely undermine medical innovation, resulting in fewer life-saving drugs for American patients. The bill puts in place government price controls for prescription drugs, making it more risky and costly for drug developers to come up with new treatments and cures. Democrats who voted for this change want to make our system more like Europe, where socialized medicine has made many drugs “cheaper” but far less available. Between 2011 and 2018, for example, patients in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands had access to just 66 percent of new cancer drugs while Americans had access to 96 percent. With this step toward socialized medicine, we can expect fewer drugs to be developed and made available to seniors through Medicare. Democrats Neglect Urgent Priorities While Democrats were advancing this legislation, Republicans offered dozens of amendments to address the actual concerns of the American people. These included measures to lower energy prices by promoting U.S. energy production, including through the sale of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. We also sought to address the crisis on our southern border by hiring more border agents and extending the President’s deportation authority. In addition, we proposed measures to stop abortion providers from receiving special tax breaks and to prohibit the IRS from targeting religious nonprofits. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats blocked each of these amendments, revealing how out of step they are with the American people. With each passing month, Americans are losing patience with single-party rule in Washington that ignores their priorities."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/a-national-defense-renaissance,"American defense needs a renaissance. After a decade of budget cutbacks — and now amid rapid inflation — our military is stagnating. Meanwhile, our adversaries are leaping ahead in weapons technology like never before. Having entered the 21st century unrivaled, our armed forces now find themselves without the resources needed to fight and win a two-front war.Many would balk at the mere mention of such a conflict, but the reality is that such a scenario is increasingly plausible. Thirty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, we have entered a new kind of Cold War. China and a resurgent Russia both seek to erode American power. The former, led by Xi Jinping, boasts a rapidly growing military that includes the world’s largest navy by ship count. The latter, under Vladimir Putin, has launched the largest land war in Europe since World War II. It is against this grim backdrop that we must chart the future of American military power. Fortunately, history offers numerous examples that can inform our thinking. The United States has already waged and won several extended geopolitical contests in the past, and events now require that we rise to the occasion again. We should start by recommitting to President Reagan’s proposition, “We win, they lose,” and by ensuring that our competitive strategies in defense, diplomacy, and elsewhere are geared toward protecting the next American century.*  *  *Historical comparisons have their limits, but there are undeniable parallels between the Cold War and our security environment today. In 1981, President Reagan entered office on the heels of a massive Soviet defense buildup that put Moscow — in the words of Ford secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld — on a path toward “true superpower status.” Caspar Weinberger, Reagan’s defense secretary, later observed that this expansion put the Soviets “practically ahead of us in every category.” Soviet military growth culminated in Moscow’s 1979 invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted for nearly a decade.There is no doubt China is on a similar expansionist path today — the main difference being that China has exceeded the old Soviet war machine in industrial capacity. The result has been China’s remarkable military rise over the last decade.U.S. defense planners have noted this dramatic rise. Admiral Charles Richard, who leads U.S. Strategic Command, described China’s nuclear-arms buildup as “breathtaking,” with new missile fields, radars, and satellites popping up regularly. A key milestone in Chinese advancement came last summer with the successful testing of hypersonic missiles — a massive technological leap that some called a “Sputnik moment.” In addition, China has invested heavily in shipbuilding in recent decades, expanding its Navy to 355 ships, surpassing the U.S. Navy’s 297. Beyond its borders, China has built militarized islands and is setting up bases from Cambodia to Djibouti. Admiral Phil Davidson, former chief of Indo-Pacific Command, last year predicted China would invade Taiwan by 2027. As China now responds to Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit with intensified military exercises, some analysts expect China to move even sooner.Unfortunately, much as in 1980, as America’s adversaries appear to be on the rise, American credibility is waning. President Biden’s bungled exit from Afghanistan, his failure to deter war in Ukraine, and his hat-in-hand petitions to OPEC for oil have projected weakness. President Biden’s advisers have pushed for climate-change cooperation with China even as Beijing turns increasingly imperialistic. Biden and his advisers continue to send mixed messages about Taiwan while the administration’s stated policy of “integrated deterrence” leads to naval decline. Iran is racing toward a nuclear weapon, and President Biden’s response has been months of fruitless talks to return to a failed deal. As the failures of the president’s foreign-policy agenda become obvious, the need for serious readjustment becomes all the more urgent.President Biden’s response to world events increasingly shows that he seems to have forgotten that deterrence requires a formidable fighting force and the will to use it. During the Cold War, stability was built on effective deterrence. This remains true today. Any renewal of America’s standing will begin with a revival of American hard power. The organizing principle of this endeavor must be President Reagan’s old wisdom: “peace through strength.”This path to recovery by the means of a defense buildup starts with aligning our priorities to the challenge of a two-front war. Beijing has not only built up its military but also declared its intent to use it in the pursuit of hegemony in the Pacific. Our first priority in competing with China must be to regain our military edge. We need a military that can fight and win a Pacific war while still offering credible deterrence on the other side of the world. Such a capability is the surest guarantee of preventing an armed conflict with China and of denying Beijing its strategic aims. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. must focus on strengthening NATO’s eastern front and supporting the infrastructure necessary to ward off an imperialist Russian advance.There is a blueprint for this realignment. Technological breakthroughs in ballistic missiles, made lethal by the long reach of Strategic Air Command, proved decisive in the Cold War’s early military balance. Reagan historian Will Inboden notes that by the 1980s, U.S. investments in intercontinental ballistic missiles and space-based missile programs left Soviet defense initiatives in the dust.Reagan’s shipbuilding surge was a game-changer as well. In the 1980s, the U.S. Navy swelled to nearly 600 ships, which allowed the U.S. to apply pressure to the Soviet fleet and contain it around the Eurasian landmass. Frequent naval exercises also forced the Soviet Navy’s hand into revealing new tactics and previously unknown weaknesses. As President Reagan’s Navy secretary John Lehman would later write, it “sent a message to the Soviets that there was a new game in town, and delivered it with something like a two-by-four.”It is important to remember that this growth in capability required a significant increase in defense spending. Between 1982 and 1986, defense programs received around 6 percent of GDP. The Senate Armed Services Committee has heard repeatedly from defense experts that the U.S. should spend 5 to 8 percent of GDP on defense for the foreseeable future to keep pace with China and other threats. President Biden does not seem to understand this. He has consistently proposed less than 3.5 percent of GDP for defense. Congress jettisoned the President’s meager top-line last year in favor of a substantially higher number, and we are preparing to do so again in FY2023. Smart defense planning would dictate a spending increase to 5 percent of GDP at minimum to thwart our military’s atrophy.How this money should be spent is another matter. In the broadest sense, we should strive to close gaps in technology — such as in artificial intelligence and anti-satellite weapons — and convert our existing advantages into overwhelming superiority. We also need to ramp up shipbuilding to meet our statutory policy of 355 ships, a policy that I have championed.These additional investments should be sustained across administrations. Regrettably, years of shifting goalposts from the Department of Defense, in shipbuilding and other key industries, has gutted American industrial capacity. Providing long-term certainty to manufacturers across the board, enabling them to invest in their facilities and hire and train highly skilled workers, will be essential.A U.S. defense buildup today would likely be welcomed by allies around the world. As historian Hal Brands has noted, allies tend to follow America’s lead in the realm of defense spending, so larger budgets from Washington could encourage our allies to follow suit. In light of increased Russian and Chinese aggression, our allies are increasingly prioritizing defense. Numerous NATO member states are boosting their defense budgets across the board. In this context, it is encouraging to see so many leaders of free nations — such as Britain’s Ben Wallace and Liz Truss, Poland’s Andrzej Duda, and Japan’s Fumio Kishida — pairing a message of military rearmament with the need to protect democracy and freedom. Increased investments from international partners would strengthen NATO as well as new and promising partnerships like the Quad and AUKUS.Such international cooperation should also take on a moral and rhetorical dimension. Freedom remains our most potent advantage in this great-power competition. The triumph of the West over the Soviet Union was fundamentally a win for freedom over despotism. Like Reagan, we should take every opportunity to assert the moral high ground against unjust systems of government. China is uniquely ripe for such criticism. Despite its impressive material gains, China is struggling to maintain many of its partnerships as one regional power after another gets burned by Beijing. Openly confronting the Chinese Communist Party for its rank illiberalism should be integral to American strategy. The more allies we can bring into the chorus, the better.But this will require a fundamental restoration of American self-confidence. Part of the genius of Reagan’s defense buildup was that it helped restore a rightful sense of American pride. In the years after the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, our nation had been plagued by “Vietnam syndrome,” a deep dread of overseas military involvements and a sense of doubt about America’s role in the world. Reagan turned the page on that sort of defeatism. He rejected talk of an American “malaise” and reminded us that America is an unparalleled force for good in the world, even the “last best hope of mankind.”Our service members desperately need such a morale boost from their commander in chief. “Afghanistan syndrome,” as we might call it today, has been devastating for troop morale. Chronic underfunding and growing demands have left service members stretched thin and overworked, resulting in a series of naval and air accidents and a growing burnout rate. Additionally, the spread of toxic gender and race ideologies has damaged unit cohesion among the enlisted and within our military academies, potentially jeopardizing the future leadership of our armed forces. Any viable defense strategy for the years ahead will need to reverse these trends. Congress and the president need to work together to improve quality of life for our troops and to root out corrosive ideologies that are creeping into the services.Despite many of our divisions in Washington, this ambitious project to revitalize American national defense has bipartisan potential. The Senate Armed Services Committee remains one of the strongest places in Congress for bipartisanship. The Senate recently boosted the president’s FY2023 Pentagon top-line by $45 billion, again with bipartisan support. Similar measures are being debated in the House and enjoy bipartisan support. Carrying that momentum forward for years to come will not just be good strategically but will solidify an emerging consensus on defense issues in Congress.*  *  *In December 1982, President Reagan stood on the shining deck of the newly recommissioned USS New Jersey, a battleship that had seen action in every major American conflict since World War II.“The call has been sounded,” Reagan said with the star-spangled banner streaming behind him. “America needs the battleship once again to provide firepower for the defense of freedom and, above all, to maintain the peace. She will truly fulfill her mission if her firepower never has to be used.” The New Jersey quickly became a leading vessel in the Pacific fleet, standing watch as the Soviet Union collapsed.Just as occurred on the New Jersey some 40 years ago, the call to defend freedom has been sounded once again.What the world needs is good, old-fashioned, American hard power. We should start rebuilding it.This op-ed originally appeared in National Review. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-hyde-smith-welcome-15-4m-in-infrastructure-funding-for-mississippi,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., today praised the award of $15.4 million for infrastructure projects in Yazoo City, Tupelo, and Ripley. The three grants, which are specifically designed for local projects, were awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) grant program.“These grants will help several important projects move forward across our state,” Wicker said. “Yazoo City will soon see a major investment in revitalizing their downtown, and both Tupelo and Ripley have secured support to begin planning to reduce congestion and improve quality of life in their communities. I look forward to working with the rest of our delegation to help more Mississippi communities secure support for infrastructure improvements like these.”“Each of the proposals put forth by these cities offer great potential for improving the quality of life for their residents, through improved public safety, better infrastructure, and more economic opportunities,” Hyde-Smith said. “I am especially hopeful the large award to Yazoo City will result in a new vibrancy for the city, and look forward to progress on the Tupelo rail and Tanglefoot Trail extension projects.”The three RAISE grants for Mississippi include:The RAISE Grant program is highly competitive, and is one of the few DOT discretionary programs for which regional and local governments can directly compete for multimodal transportation funding.  The program replaced the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) Transportation grants program and the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-opposes-biden-tax-hikes,"President Biden’s new tax-and-spend legislation is totally disconnected from the needs of our country. After causing massive inflation with last year’s $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, President Biden and his party are now pushing a massive tax hike on job creators and working Americans, all but guaranteeing that we will sink further into a recession.For months, Democrat Senator Joe Manchin had blocked his party’s attempts to raise taxes, citing concerns over inflation. Last fall, he said the President’s tax-and-spend proposal was full of “shell games” and “accounting gimmicks,” and that he could not support a tax hike in the current economic climate. Stunningly, he has done a 180. The West Virginian is now locking arms with President Biden and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to support a $739 billion tax bill, which they are dishonestly calling the “Inflation Reduction Act.”New Taxes Would Impact EveryonePresident Biden has repeatedly vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. This tax-and-spend bill would shatter that promise. The biggest item listed in the bill is a $313 billion tax on job creators and manufacturers, which are already struggling to survive inflation. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation predicts that this tax alone would reduce our gross domestic product and cost roughly 30,000 jobs. It would also depress worker wages while causing further price increases across the economy. The tax would fall hardest on coal workers, whose industry would face a net tax increase of 7.2 percent. It would also hit wireless telecom providers, potentially hurting efforts to build 5G networks across the country.American energy would take a huge hit from this legislation. Natural gas, which is already under assault by the President’s regulations, would be taxed at an estimated $8 billion, costing some 90,000 jobs. This tax would drive up the average family’s natural gas bill by 17 percent, according to the American Gas Association. In addition, the bill’s tax on oil imports would put needless upward pressure on gas prices, which are still far too high.Despite this bill’s name, it would do virtually nothing to quell our inflation crisis, which Democrats unleashed with last year’s stimulus bill. According to Moody’s Analytics – one of President Biden’s preferred sources – this bill would cut inflation over the next decade by a mere 0.33 percent, equal to about two weeks of inflation at today’s rate. Experts at the University of Pennsylvania are even less optimistic, saying the bill would have little to no impact on inflation. Calling this bill the “Inflation Reduction Act” is false advertising.Green Subsidies for the Wealthy After taxing manufacturers and workers, Democrats plan to spend $250 billion in tax revenue on wasteful subsidies that would largely benefit the wealthy. Their bill would provide $7,500 in tax credits for those who buy electric vehicles costing up to $80,000. These credits would be available for families making as much as $300,000. This is an obscene form of socialism for the rich – taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to high-end car buyers. If this legislation becomes law, Democrats will bear even more responsibility for government waste, continued inflation, and the recession we will all have to endure."

Designating August as National Catfish Month gives us the opportunity to recognize the many producers who are a part of this important industry.”“It’s a point of pride that Mississippi is the No. 1 catfish producing state in the nation, and I applaud the domestic industry for its role in providing safe, affordable, farm-raised catfish to consumers across the country,” Hyde-Smith said.“Catfish is the largest farm-raised aquaculture product in the nation, and the success of its production in the U.S. is because of southern states like Alabama. Our catfish farmers and workers play a major role in providing jobs and enhancing the local economy,” Shelby said. “National Catfish Month is a great opportunity to recognize the significance of this industry.”“Arkansas, our nation’s birthplace of warm water aquaculture, remains a proud leader in the catfish industry,” Boozman said. “The research conducted in Arkansas continues to advance new and innovative strategies to support our producers nationwide. Our family-owned operations do a tremendous job raising catfish that consumers crave. I’m proud to join my colleagues to mark National Catfish Month and celebrate the entire industry,”“A fried catfish po’ boy, dressed, with ketchup, my mouth waters to think of it. Thanks to everyone who makes it possible for the rest of us to enjoy great catfish dinners. We recognize National Catfish Month,” Cassidy said.“The catfish industry contributes billions of dollars to our economy and employs thousands of people across the country,” Tillis said. “North Carolina is one of a few states home to farm raised catfish which is why I am proud to work with my colleagues to recognize August as National Catfish Month to honor all the workers that provide catfish for people across our country and the world.”“The aquaculture industry greatly benefits Texas and the nation, with domestic catfish growers alone contributing well over $350 million to the U.S. economy. Texas is one of four states whose industry accounts for over 97 percent of total U.S. sales. I am proud to join my colleagues in resolving to designate August as National Catfish Month to acknowledge the contributions of these producers,” Cruz said.The full text of the resolution can be found here or below:Whereas the Catfish Institute recognizes August to be National Catfish Month;Whereas the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas recognize August to be National Catfish Month;Whereas the States of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Tennessee embody the Channel Catfish as their State Fish;Whereas the farm-raised catfish industry in the United States employs nearly 10,000 people and contributes more than $4,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States;Whereas the United States has 67,640 surface water acres used for catfish production in 2022, and catfish growers in the United States had $421,161,000 in sales during 2021;Whereas the average catfish farmer produces 5,000 pounds of catfish per acre;Whereas 99 percent of all United States farm-raised catfish are grown in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas;Whereas catfish is the largest farm-raised seafood product, by weight, in the United States, representing more than 50 percent of the United States aquaculture industry;Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are consistently high quality and, unlike ocean-caught fish, are available all year long;Whereas United States farm-raised catfish are a sustainable and environmentally friendly seafood product;Whereas catfish is a lean fish and an excellent source of protein; andWhereas catfish is a versatile fish in cuisine of the United States, with a myriad of regional and national recipes to be enjoyed by all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Senate—(1) designates August 2022 as ‘‘National Catfish Month’’;(2) recognizes the contributions of all workers, past and present, that produce, process, and provide catfish for the people of the United States; and(3) recognizes that purchasing United States farm-raised catfish supports farmers, jobs, and the economy of the United States. "

Jeanee Shaheen, D-N.H., to Secretary of State Antony Blinken advocating for the preservation of the role of U.S. Special Envoy to Belarus and asking the State Department to work with the Biden administration to expeditiously fill the position. In the letter, the Senators thanked Ambassador Fisher for spotlighting Lukashenka’s horrendous human rights abuses and building a strong foundation for a democratic future for Belarus during her tenure. They noted that given Fisher's recent departure, a new Special Envoy is needed to continue advancing the United States’ diplomatic engagement with Belarus.  The letter was also signed by Senators Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “We write to express our continued support for the position of U.S. Special Envoy to Belarus, which is vital to promoting democracy and freedom in Belarus,” wrote the Senators. “As Mr. Lukashenka tightens his authoritarian grip, the United States must remain a committed partner for all those pursuing a democratic future for Belarus. Ambassador Fisher provided critical support to the pro-democracy movement in Belarus and was a strong advocate for its democratic aspirations. She kept the spotlight on Lukashenka’s horrendous human rights abuses and worked with Senators to establish the Free Belarus Caucus, which continues to marshal bipartisan support for the Belarussian people.”  They continued: “On June 9, 2022, Ambassador Fisher announced her departure from the role of U.S. Special Envoy to Belarus. We wish to thank the Government of Lithuania and the U.S. Embassy in Vilnius for their partnership in America’s efforts to support the Belarusian people, and we congratulate Ambassador Fisher on her tour of duty. Her role of Special Envoy cannot be left vacant. As Ambassador Fisher demonstrated, this role played a critical role in keeping much- needed focus on Belarus, and the Administration needs to ensure this continues.” Full text of the letter is available here. "

Finland already spends the NATO-mandated 2 percent of its GDP on defense, while Sweden has upped its defense spending in recent years and is on pace to reach 2 percent of GDP in the next decade.The Mississippi senator also recently authored an op-ed in National Review arguing that military and technological capabilities provided by Finland and Sweden would fortify the alliance’s defenses against Russia, while improving resources available to compete with China.Read more about Wicker’s work on foreign policy and defense here."

Wicker had joined 40 other Senate Republicans in asking for the change to the legislation, which would have ensured national Democrats could not fill a $400 billion budget hole with unrelated spending.“The PACT Act is an important step forward for veterans who have been denied their benefits for too long, and I look forward to seeing it passed without further delay,” Wicker said. “I appreciated Senator Pat Toomey for leading the effort to help make this legislation better for veterans and their families who do not want to see the federal government use their cause to spend billions on unrelated priorities. Senate Republicans will continue our efforts to ensure these funds are spent only on veterans.”Majority Leader Chuck Schumer allowed the Senate to proceed to a vote on Senator Toomey’s amendment after previously blocking efforts to vote on the change. The amendment, which would not have affected veterans benefits by a single dollar, failed to reach the 60-vote threshold. Senate Republicans will have additional opportunities to address the funding loophole through the appropriations process, which will proceed later this year."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/8/wicker-successfully-negotiates-china-competition-bill,"One of the biggest changes to our economy in recent decades has been our dependence on microchips. These tiny electronic devices – sometimes called semiconductors – are essential to our phones, computers, cars, laundry machines, and a whole range of everyday appliances. Chips are also used in military assets, such as missiles, fighter jets, and Navy ships. In recent years, China and other countries have worked overtime to gain dominance over the chip industry. Unfortunately, they have succeeded. Today, 90 percent of all semiconductors are made outside the United States. This means we are now dependent on foreign chipmakers to sustain our modern way of life and supply our military. Members of both parties agree this is a threat to our economic and national security that must be addressed.China is our greatest adversary when it comes to technology. In recent decades, China has become notorious for stealing U.S. intellectual property. This allows Chinese companies to catch up to us and in some cases leap ahead. China has also invested billions of dollars to become the center of gravity for technological innovation – an advantage that could prove decisive in future wars. For all of these reasons, it is urgent that we shore up our technology sector so that we can outcompete China. Congress Advances Landmark BillAs the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, I helped negotiate legislation to energize our chip industry and boost technological research across America. Both the House and Senate passed this bill last week, sending it to the President’s desk for his signature. Known as the CHIPS Act, this legislation will encourage American chip producers to establish factories and good-paying jobs here in the United States. It will also further U.S. innovation in quantum computing, advanced robotics, biotechnology, advanced materials, and artificial intelligence, all of which are needed to outcompete China. In addition, the bill will create important new safeguards to protect American intellectual property from being stolen by China. This legislation was the culmination of a year and a half of work, and I was encouraged by the strong bipartisan support it received. Rural States Will Help Drive InnovationThe CHIPS Act also corrects a longstanding disparity in research funding, which had put Mississippi at a disadvantage. Each year, the federal government awards grants for cutting-edge research in science and technology. Unfortunately, this money has gone overwhelmingly to a select few universities located in five states and Washington, D.C. This disparity has kept us from maximizing innovation. If we are going to outcompete China, we need the talents and expertise of researchers across the nation, including in rural states.In recent days, I successfully fought to include a major boost in research funding to predominately rural states through the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Based on these provisions, EPSCoR jurisdictions – which include Mississippi – will now receive 20 percent of all research and development dollars awarded by the National Science Foundation, up from 13 percent. These investments could be pivotal in facilitating new discoveries and inventions in the science labs at Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi. Combined with the bill’s semiconductor and security provisions, these investments will put us on the right footing to compete with China for the long haul. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/what-they-are-saying-chips-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON – Today, the CHIPS Act of 2022, also known as the “CHIPS and Science Act,” passed the U.S. House of Representatives, and will soon be sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law.U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., was a key negotiator of the new package, which includes support not only to boost American semiconductor manufacturing, but also to reduce historic disparities in research funding that put rural states like Mississippi at a disadvantage. For example, in 2021 over half of National Science Foundation (NSF) funds went to just seven states plus D.C. Half the states in the country received less than 13% of NSF funds.Wicker negotiated a provision that would increase this share of funding for rural states. Under the new legislation, 20 percent of research and development funding through the National Science Foundation (NSF) would be set aside for the 25 states and three territories that are included in NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdictions, which includes Mississippi.Wicker also negotiated a provision that would establish a new $10 billion Regional Technology Hub program to drive technology development in parts of America outside of established high-tech locations.Leaders from universities in Mississippi are expressing their support for the strong research and development provisions of the CHIPS and Science Act. Here is what they are saying:Mississippi State University“Passage of this bill is vitally important to our Nation’s future in science and technology. It provides the opportunity for young people in every state to participate in cutting edge research and technology development, ensuring our Nation’s future is bright for all Americans,” said Dr. David Shaw, Provost and Executive Vice President at Mississippi State University. The University of Mississippi“It is exciting to see this historic bipartisan legislation aimed at returning leadership in technology innovation to the US through the creation of Regional Tech Hubs,” said Dr. Josh Gladden, Vice Chancellor for Research at University of Mississippi. “By supporting research and the development of regional innovation strategies, this program will create a renewed focus on technology commercialization, growing the nation’s technology economy and fostering competitiveness.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-stands-in-solidarity-with-russian-dissident,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a ranking member on the U.S. Helsinki Commission, today delivered a speech on the Senate floor expressing support for Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian democracy activist who has been imprisoned in Moscow since April for criticizing Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Wicker, who is a friend of Kara-Murza, highlighted Putin’s long campaign of repression against Russians who speak out against the regime, and commended Kara-Murza and other “modern-day heroes” for their courage in fighting for a better future in Russia.“Instead of democracy and freedom, the Russian people got Vladimir Putin, a man who has used his office to murder, imprison, and force into exile anyone who threatens his grip on power – all the while, enriching himself beyond anyone’s wildest imagination while ordinary Russians, especially out in the countryside of Russia, live in squalid conditions,” Wicker said. “One of his latest victims is Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian patriot and a friend I had the privilege of hosting in my office just four months ago.”“As leader of the free world, America must continue to condemn Putin’s lawless acts and stand in solidarity with our Russian friends, who are courageously fighting against all odds for a better future in Russia – and are suffering as a result. … I invite my colleagues from both parties to stand with Mr. Kara-Murza and to work for his release.”The Mississippi senator last met with Kara-Murza in March, a month before his arrest in Moscow. Wicker has since repeatedly called for his release and continues to work on legislation putting pressure on the Kremlin and supporting Ukraine.Read more about Wicker’s recent activity on national security matters here. Watch the full speech here or read it as delivered below.Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to make sure that the plight of Russian leader Vladimir Kara-Murza is not forgotten.That the outrageous imprisonment of Vladimir Kara-Murza by the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is not forgotten.We remember three decades ago what hope we had for a new Russia.Russia entered a new age of possibility some three decades ago, after more than 70 years of communist repression, the Soviet order had collapsed, and with it the Iron Curtain that kept freedom away from millions was torn down.As the red flags came down in Moscow, the free world watched with anticipation, hoping that democracy and the rule of law might finally take root in a free Russia.Regrettably, that has not happened.Instead of democracy and freedom, the Russian people got Vladimir Putin, a man who has used his office to murder, imprison, and force into exile anyone who threatens his grip on power -- all the while, enriching himself beyond anyone's wildest imagination while ordinary Russians, especially out in the countryside of Russia, live in squalid conditions.One of his latest victims is Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian patriot and a friend I had the privilege of hosting in my office just four months ago.As a matter of fact, I have hosted him several times.Today, Vladimir Kara-Murza spends his days in a prison cell, where the only thing you can see through the window is a barbed wire fence.What was his crime?He simply spoke the truth about Putin's war on Ukraine.His trial, if it can even be called a trial, was held in secret.No journalists, no diplomats or spectators of any kind were allowed to be there.And for his offense of talking about the Russian war against Ukraine, he now faces up to 15 years in prison.This is not the first time the Russian dictator has tried to silence him. Mr. Kara-Murza has been poisoned twice, in 2015 and 2017, and almost died in both cases.Since then, his wife and three children have had to live abroad, though he himself has chosen to spend most of his time in Russia.In a recent interview with National Review, his wife, Evgenia explained why he insists on working in Russia: “He believes that he would not have the moral right to call on people to fight if he were not sharing the same risks.”Or as Mr. Kara-Murza put it in a recent CNN interview the day of his arrest.He said, “The biggest gift we could give the Kremlin would be to just give up and run. That's all they want from us.”What a contrast in character to the man currently running the Kremlin.The National Review's story goes on to describe Mr. Kara-Murza's courageous work for democracy through the eyes of his wife of Evgenia, as well as the costs that he and his family have endured along with so many other Russian dissidents.And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this point to insert the National Review story that I referred to into the record.Mr. Kara-Murza’s imprisonment is part of Mr. Putin's larger assault on what remains of political freedom in Russia.In Mr. Kara-Murza’s words, Putin's regime has gone, “from highly authoritarian to near totalitarian almost overnight.”In March, Russian officials passed a new censorship law, forbidding all criticism of Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine.That law has been the basis for more than 16,000 arrests since the war began in February, including that of Mr. Kara-Murza.Another 2,400 Russians have been charged with administrative offenses for speaking out against the war.Meanwhile, Putin's propaganda machine is ramping up.Independent Russian media outlets have all but vanished, having been blocked, shut down, or forced out of the country by the Kremlin.The last embers of freedom in Russia are going cold.Putin's crackdown on domestic freedom began in 2003, when Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on trumped up charges of tax fraud after he simply criticized the government.A former member of the elite, Mr. Khodorkovsky, had successfully led the Yukos Oil Company through privatization after the Iron Curtain fell.And contrary to the Kremlin's claims, the company consistently paid its taxes.But that didn't stop Vladimir Putin from plundering its assets, throwing Mr. Khodorkovsky in jail, where he stayed for ten years.I would note that just before his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky displayed the same courage and patriotism that we now see in Vladimir Kara-Murza.Like Mr. Kara-Murza, he knew very well he could go to jail for speaking out against the government.But Mr. Khodorkovsky did so anyway and refused to flee the country, saying, “I would prefer to be a political prisoner rather than a political immigrant.”Of course, by then, Mr. Putin had already shown himself willing to violate the international laws of war, having leveled the Chechen capital of Grozny in his own Republic of Russia in 1999.In 2008, he launched a new assault on international law with the invasion of Georgia.In 2014 he started a bloody war in eastern Ukraine, and in 2016, Soviet Russian dictator Putin and his forces attacked the Syrian city of Aleppo, killing hundreds of civilians and prolonging the rule of Bashar al-Assad.Meanwhile, Putin ramped up his attacks on domestic freedom as well.In 2015 Boris Nemtsov, leader of the democratic opposition, former deputy prime minister of Russia, was shot to death in broad daylight just yards away from the Kremlin.Three months later, Mr. Kara-Murza was poisoned for the first time.More recently, in 2020, Alexei Navalny, the current leader of the opposition, was himself poisoned and had to seek treatment in Berlin.This is Vladimir Putin's Russia today.When Navalny recovered, he chose to return to Moscow, knowing the risks, and immediately upon landing, he was arrested.This is the deplorable state of Russia and freedom under Vladimir Putin.Time and again, he has shown that he is bent on stamping out the aspirations of his people for freedom and the rule of law.As leader of the free world, America must continue to condemn Putin's lawless acts and stand in solidarity with our Russian friends, who are courageously fighting against all odds for a better future in Russia -- and are suffering as a result.These are modern day heroes: Alexei Navalny, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and we should not forget them.My friend, the distinguished senior senator from Maryland, Senator Cardin and I, along with Congressman Steve Cohen and Joe Wilson, are the four House and Senate leaders of the Helsinki Commission, which monitors human rights and former Soviet countries.We recently sent a joint letter to President Biden calling on the administration to name and sanction all of those who have been involved in the arrest, detention and persecution of Vladimir Kara-Murza.I issue that call again today, and I invite my colleagues from both parties to stand with Vladimir Kara-Murza and work for his release.Thank you, Mr. President.I yield the floor."

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-praises-chips-bill-ahead-of-final-passage,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee, today took to the Senate floor to praise legislation to boost American semiconductor manufacturing capacity and expand U.S. research in fields that will be necessary to outcompete China.“Regrettably, at this moment, we are not in the driver's seat on a range of important technologies,” Wicker said. “China and other nations are increasingly dominant in tech innovation, posing a massive threat to not only our economy, but to our national security. But with today's vote, Congress has a chance to move us back in the right direction and put America back into a place to win the game.”Wicker also expressed support for the measure because it would boost American innovation and investment in advanced technologies.“But of course, chips and semiconductors are not the whole ballgame. This legislation goes much further, advancing American innovation in quantum computing, advanced robotics biotechnology, advanced materials and artificial intelligence – the full suite of technologies that we need to out-compete China,” Wicker said. “And instead of limiting those investments to a small handful of institutions in five wealthy states, this bill casts a wide net, enlisting the talent and expertise of STEM researchers nationwide.”The legislation would authorize additional funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to research these technologies. Wicker negotiated provisions in the legislation that would reduce historic disparities in research funding allocations, ensuring more universities can participate in U.S. efforts to outcompete China. The provisions would require that a minimum of 20 percent of funding be set aside for the 25 states and three territories that are included in NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdictions. These predominantly rural states, which include Mississippi, currently receive only 13 percent of federal research funding.In the floor speech, Wicker noted that the bill enjoys bipartisan support from not only the White House and Congress, but also former Trump Administration officials such as former National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, former trade adviser Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Read the full speech below and watch it here. See a fact sheet on the research and STEM education provisions of the CHIPS Act here.Thank you so much Mr. President.We’ll soon be moving to a vote on the so-called CHIPS legislation.It’s had said several names during its consideration in the Senate and in the House.I prefer to call it the Chips and Science Act, but it is an important bipartisan piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption.So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation. It will expand American semiconductor production, create new opportunities for research into cutting-edge technologies, and enhance our ability to compete with China.There is no more important competition than the one for technological supremacy between the United States and China.The outcome will shape the global balance of power for decades and will impact the security and prosperity of all Americans. Regrettably, at this moment, we are not in the driver's seat on a range of important technologies - China is. China and other nations are increasingly dominant in tech innovation, posing a massive threat to not only our economy, but to our national security, Mr. President.But with today's vote, Congress has a chance to move us back in the right direction and put America back into a place to win the game.This legislation, the Chips and Science Act, I'll call it, will provide a historic boost to our semiconductor industry, which for too long has played on an uneven global playing field. Increasing American chip production is absolutely vital given the importance of chips to our economy, as well as our national defense. The pandemic taught us the hard way that we cannot be dependent on semiconductor production halfway around the globe.But of course, chips, semiconductors are not the whole ballgame. This legislation goes much further, advancing American innovation in quantum computing, advanced robotics, biotechnology, advanced materials, and artificial intelligence - the full suite of technologies that we need to out-compete China. And instead of limiting those investments to a small handful of institutions in five wealthy states, this bill casts a wide net, enlisting the talent and expertise of STEM researchers nationwide.This legislation will guarantee that EPSCOR, a program designed to stimulate competitive research in 25 predominantly rural states, receives 20% of all R&D funding from the National Science Foundation, up from the current 13%. 13%, now 20% when it's finally ramped up. The bill will also reauthorize the National Science Foundation, the gold standard for funding basic research, and it will establish a new Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, called TIP, at NSF to supercharge the process of translating basic research into technology development and then to the commercial market, enabling us to compete better with China across a vast range of technologies.This legislation would not be complete without new safeguards against espionage, which we know is taking place right now. Against intellectual property theft, for which the Chinese have become notorious. I'm pleased we were able to include a number of long overdue reforms to protect the fruits of our nation's R&D investments.Even so, there is more work to be done to protect American research across the whole of government, and I commend my friend Senator Portman from Ohio for moving forward with his initiative, which I hope can be incorporated into the statute at some point. Mr. President, this moment has been a long time in the making, and I want to issue some bipartisan congratulation and words of thanks. My dear friend and colleague from the state of Washington, the chair of the Commerce Committee, Senator Cantwell, is on the floor, and I congratulate her and commend her and thank her for her cooperation with me on this issue. I want to thank Leader Schumer and Senator Young, the original co-sponsors of the Endless Frontier Act, as well as Senator Cornyn, Senator Sinema and many other colleagues who helped make this a better bill.And I also want to congratulate and commend officials from the previous administration, from the Trump administration, who are also telling Americans about the importance of this legislation. This is a bill that will be signed by President Joe Biden, but it's also endorsed by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, President Trump's international trade adviser, by Mike Pompeo, President Trump's CIA director and Secretary of State, and by Robert O'Brien, former National Security Adviser to President Trump.So, three distinguished and knowledgeable national defense officials and foreign policy officials are saying this about the bill we'll soon vote on.Ambassador Lighthizer of the Trump administration said on Kudlow two days ago: “We are in this existential competition with China. The battleground of that competition is technology and chips. That is where we're going to win it or lose it.”And he goes on to point out that the bill, while not perfect, is exactly the bill that we can get done right now. And I don't know of any bill that is ever perfect.Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, a stalwart in the last administration on national defense, says this, and I quote, “Congress must pass the CHIPS Act, for both our national and economic security. We have to become less dependent on China for critical technologies, and this is how we do it. A bipartisan bill supporting R&D for semiconductor chip manufacturing is essential to security, securing vital technologies for our economy and our military.”That's Mike Pompeo, President Trump's Secretary of State.And then Robert O'Brien, former National Security Adviser to President Trump, said “America needs this legislation without delay.”So, I want to also say a note of thanks to my own staff, my personal staff and my committee staff, for their tireless efforts over the last year and a half on this issue.This is the culmination of a great deal of work by some very, very talented personnel. Countless meetings, a legislative hearing in April, a markup in May, a final vote by the Senate in June, after days and days of debate on the floor. All of these staff members work nights and weekends, considering and helping manage almost 1000 amendments, Mr. President, through the committee and the floor. And all of them contributed in many ways.I will single out for recognition my policy director, James Mazol, who was absolutely vital to us in putting it all together, and his entire team.So thank you very much, Mr. President. I urge a yes vote. I think the strong 64 vote we had yesterday on cloture was indicative of the support, and I anticipate its passage and look forward to a successful passage in the House of Representatives. I yield the floor."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-colleagues-protect-american-retirement-from-woke-politics," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., joined his Republican colleagues in introducing legislation to strengthen Americans’ retirement funds. Led by Senator Mike Braun, R-Ind., the Maximize Americans’ Retirement Security Act would clarify the fiduciary duty of plan administrators to select and maintain investments based solely on financial factors. Recently, the Department of Labor proposed a rule that would allow plan administrators to invest in so-called “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) funds by considering factors not tied to their return on investment. A number of studies have shown that ESG investing policies offer worse return rates in comparison to other investment plans, while ESG investors also generally end up paying higher costs for worse performances.“Most Americans trust their retirement plan administrators to look out for them and maximize their return on investments, but recent moves by the Biden Administration threaten to upend this longstanding system in favor of “woke” activism,” Wicker said.  “Retirement accounts should be off-limits to the President’s politics.”“At a time when energy costs are soaring and Hoosiers are grappling with record high inflation, Democrats are politicizing American retirement funds and targeting companies that invest in energy sources that could help alleviate these soaring costs. The Biden Administration should not be sacrificing the retirement savings of thousands of individuals to promote liberal policy objectives,” Braun said.This legislation would amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to require plan fiduciaries to select investments solely on pecuniary factors. It has been endorsed by Americans for Tax Reform, Institute for the American Worker, Foundation for Government Accountability, and FreedomWorks.In addition to Wicker and Braun, co-sponsors include Senators Richard Burr, R-N.C., Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan.The full text of the bill can be found here."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-opposes-noaa-s-red-snapper-rule," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today submitted a public comment to the U.S. Department of Commerce calling for the agency to reject the recent proposed rule by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the annual catch limits for red snapper. If implemented, the rule would reduce Mississippi’s red snapper quota by 60 percent, drastically cutting the red snapper season for Mississippi’s recreational anglers.“This proposed rule is deeply flawed, based on bad science, and does a disservice to the public,” Wicker wrote. Wicker’s comment, addressed to Dr. Richard Spinrad, Administrator of NOAA, highlights the Department of Commerce’s lack of response to concerns he shared with the agency.“It is deeply frustrating that NOAA, fishermen, and environmentalists all agree on the need for better data and Mississippi has spent the resources needed to achieve that goal, only to have NOAA propose a 60 percent quota reduction based on a biased federal survey that shows no accuracy or consistency when producing estimates of harvest.  Clearly NOAA is more interested in giving lip service to better data than properly managing this critical fishery for the public,” Wicker wrote.Read Wicker’s public comment here or below.Dear Dr. Spinrad,This proposed rule is deeply flawed, based on bad science, and does a disservice to the public.  When Amendment 50 gave Gulf States the ability to manage their own recreational red snapper quota, it was embraced throughout the Gulf.  However, NOAA’s implementation of the Amendment has only further highlighted the significant flaws with federal fishery management.  I have expressed these frustrations for the past year to Secretary Raimondo, you, and numerous other NOAA officials.  I have sent letters, asked questions at hearings and meetings, and published an op-ed.  Despite these efforts, and despite the agency’s public commitment to work with Congress on this issue, I have been informed that the only way my feedback will be considered is via a public comment in a rule making.  Had NOAA been open to conversations over the past 18 months, there could have been a more thoughtful discussion.  The agency was not interested in such a discussion.  Instead, it proposed an arbitrary and capricious rule that uses fundamentally flawed data to cut Mississippi’s recreational red snapper quota by 60 percent.The Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP)NOAA’s Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) is a well-intentioned but flawed and biased program.  This program collects data in a suite of recreational fishing surveys and produces catch and effort estimates for recreational fisheries.  It is of note that these survey methods were piloted in high-population states such as North Carolina and Florida, with the assumption that performance would be identical across other states.  Despite this assumption, both state managers and stakeholders have raised concerns about this program, and many of these concerns have been documented by various National Academy of Sciences reports on the topic (2006, 2017, and 2021).  The lack of confidence in MRIP is also demonstrated by the number of states that have chosen to leave the program and developed alternative surveys to improve catch estimates. Of particular relevance, the 2021 report notes that “MRIP is designed as a general survey, and its precision is greatest for annual estimates at larger geographic scales; the precision of MRIP estimates is much lower of shorter periods of time and smaller geographic areas.”  The estimates from Mississippi, which has only 44 miles of coastline and accounts for less than three percent of the coastline of the United States Gulf Coast, routinely has high percent standard errors along with exceptionally volatile point estimates in the annual MRIP count.  This clearly makes MRIP an inappropriate tool to apply to the state.  Doing so is irresponsible and ignores the blatant biases produced by the overarching federal approach. Many States Do Not Use Federal DataIt is also noteworthy that states with more resources have been allowed to transition away from federal surveys without calibration.  In the mid-1990s, Washington State stopped participating in federal data collection for recreational fisheries.  In Oregon, when discrepancies between a state recreational survey and MRIP’s precursor survey (Marine Recreational Finfish Statistical Survey or MRFSS) were discovered, MRFSS was simply discontinued.  In subsequent years, MRIP data was collected in Oregon for supplementing the state data, but the Oregon data was considered the base, as it should have been (https://www.dfw.state.or.us/MRP/salmon/docs/ORBS_Design_2021.pdf).  Since 2004, West Coast States have all collected their own recreational fishery data.  NOAA never demanded those states calibrate their data to federal data, despite their shared management of fish stocks. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/03/09/04-4744/magnuson-stevens-act-provisions-fisheries-off-west-coast-states-and-in-the-western-pacific-pacific#p-61). This notion of a “common currency” seems to target specifically the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery. Within the Gulf, Texas never participated in the MRIP program and is allowed simply to continue using its state data to comply with Amendment 50.  In 2016, Louisiana stopped participating in MRIP.Finally, it is worth noting that the two states most disadvantaged by this rule, Mississippi and Alabama, have the lowest per capita income of the Gulf States and are clearly the most disproportionately affected by the standardized MRIP methodology.Concerns with the MRIP FES-CHTS CalibrationAs NOAA has worked to improve MRIP, it transitioned from the Coastal Household Telephone Survey (CHTS) to a mail-based Fishing Effort Survey (FES) requiring a calibration between FES and CHTS for MRIP.  The CHTS survey was terminated in 2016.  Of relevance to Gulf of Mexico red snapper, the red snapper quota was established in MRIP CHTS pounds, but since the CHTS survey was discontinued, NOAA needed to compare the MRIP FES data to state data. NOAA spent considerable time and effort developing a method to calibrate the MRIP FES data to the MRIP CHTS data.  There was a workshop in 2017 that resulted in a proposed calibration model based on the Fay-Herriot small estimate model.  Despite a large effort by NOAA to develop a scientifically defensible calibration, NOAA opted to use a simple linear calibration of the overlap in FES and CHTS data by state data.  Different survey types are affected by different assumptions, sampling biases, and non-sampling errors, which is why a linear comparison between historical and new survey types is often avoided.  The reason that this simple linear calibration was arbitrarily chosen when the agency had spent such considerable resources developing a scientifically robust calibration between FES and CHTS is not clear.  What is clear is that this is another example of mismanagement of the fisheries by NOAA. A state-by-state calibration, as used in this proposed rule, could amplify MRIP’s known shortcomings with respect to small sample sizes. Moreover, if NOAA’s assentation that continuous datasets are essential to fisheries management is correct, then NOAA should have produced a Gulf-wide calibration between FES and CHTS, rather than needing to calibrate data state by state on an ad hoc basis.  If this calibration has not occurred, it is unclear how NOAA has been calculating the recreational quotas over the last several years.  Finally, when my staff requested the CHTS and FES Mississippi data used to create the calibration, they were told that CHTS was terminated in 2016, but the calibration workshop documents described using CHTS data through 2019.  This inconsistent nature of calibrating FES to CHTS data is not the best available science, and it is an inexcusable injustice to the recreational fishing industry of Mississippi.Based on a presentation from NOAA’s Southeast Regional Office (SERO) to the Science and Statistical Committee on August 11, 2020, the choice not to use the Fay-Herriot small estimate model for Mississippi was never properly explained or justified.  For the calibration years used in this proposed rule, MRIP’s percent standard errors (PSEs) for Mississippi red snapper catch were high (PSE of 51.5 in 2015, PSE of 32.2 in 2016, and PSE of 39 in 2017).  Although I fully appreciate NOAA’s interest in calibrating to a continuous time series, NOAA itself says data with PSEs over 50 are not published because they are unreliable and that even data with PSEs over 30 should be viewed with caution.  Contrary to NOAA’s assumption in using such data in this proposed rule, using bad data is often worse than including no data.  An alternative approach could be to use Gulf-wide red snapper data to calculate a FES:CHTS ratio. This approach would take advantage of the larger Gulf-wide sample size.  NOAA has a responsibility to minimize the impact of well-known issues for small sample sizes in the MRIP data sets.MRIP Values for MississippiAs noted above, NOAA’s MRIP data for Mississippi is neither precise nor accurate.  From 2015-2021, the percent standard error varied between 21.7 and 51.5 and point estimates of harvest fluctuated 400 percent across years with similar season structures.  Moreover, the season of peak catch as inferred from the wave estimates are inconsistent from year to year.  This means MRIP is failing to capture even the basic seasonal cycle of red snapper fishing or base recreational fishing in general.  Additionally, the number of survey intercepts by MRIP’s APAIS does not have any correlation with the estimates of catch. The MRIP data for Mississippi fails two basic gut checks based on data derived explicitly from the MRIP program itself.Tails N’ Scales is Best Available ScienceThe MRIP FES response rate is only 30 percent.  Additionally, though NOAA can follow up on responses to the surveys, there is zero ability for NOAA to verify a survey response with on-the-water results.  Mississippi’s Tails N’ Scales program has a 95 percent trip compliance rate.  Between both water and on-land compliance checks and validation surveys, over 15 percent of the entire fleet is stopped during the Red Snapper season.  The PSE value for Tails N’ Scales for 2018 is 3.8; the PSE for MRIP’s Mississippi red snapper data was 28.8.  For 2019, the PSE for Tails N’s Scales was 1.3; MRIP was 20.9.  These differences are staggering and cannot reasonably be ignored.  MRIP estimates show that Mississippi has 1,500 boats fishing for red snapper per day; the busiest day the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources saw this season was 268 boats.  Again, with only a 44-mile coastline, the state knows what is happening in its waters.It is incomprehensible not to recognize Tails N’ Scales as a robust program that produces the only accurate estimates for harvest of Red Snapper in Mississippi.  It is deeply frustrating that NOAA, fishermen, and environmentalists all agree on the need for better data and Mississippi has spent the resources needed to achieve that goal, only to have NOAA propose a 60 percent quota reduction based on a biased federal survey that shows no accuracy or consistency when producing estimates of harvest.  Clearly NOAA is more interested in giving lip service to better data than properly managing this critical fishery for the public.CalibrationAs noted above, NOAA values its long data sets even where statistically useless and has required the states to calibrate the state data to the MRIP data, despite the many documented failings in MRIP described above.  For the calibration of MRIP to Tails N’ Scales, the Science and Statistical Committee (SSC) for the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (the Council) used two years of data (2018 and 2019) to create a calibration. The Committee did not consider 2020 in the calibration, even though the fishing year was done when they met.  The high variance and imprecise nature of MRIP data means a seeming arbitrary choice, such as not including 2020 MRIP data, has a dramatic impact on the accuracy of the ratio.  NOAA has made the informal suggestion that 2020 MRIP data should not be considered because pandemic-related disruptions resulted in some missing data. However, Mississippi continued to conduct surveys and ensure adequate MRIP coverage throughout the pandemic.  NOAA used imputation, a statistically valid method, to compensate for the missing data, which creates a usable catch number.  Moreover, its PSE of 33.3 is consistent with other years, suggesting the data should be included.  To highlight the arbitrary nature and true volatility of the calibration, if only 2020 were used, Mississippi would have received a 48 percent quota increase.  Notably, Louisiana’s calibration was based on only a single year’s data.  Using 2018-2021 data would be statistically more robust, though again, the overall value of the MRIP data is questionable. In their August 11-12, 2020 meeting, the SSC recognized the shortcoming of the calibration and realized that Mississippi was being treated unfairly.  The meeting minutes state, “The SSC recognized that the difference in methodology by the state and federal surveys should be explored further, as to not penalize a state when the difference after calibration greatly reduce the state’s quota.”  This is exactly what has happened to Mississippi.  Further, with respect to whether Tails N’ Scales data was actually being incorporated, “The SSC also agreed that scaling a state’s data to MRIP-FES is not the same as calibrating those data, and that scaling to MRIP-FES is tantamount to using the MRIP-FES data.”  In short, this was not actually a “calibration,” but instead was a dismissal of what the SSC described as “a near-census of that state’s in-season catch and effort.”Nearly two years ago, the SSC realized the shortcoming of the calibration and suggested the need for more work.  I have also repeatedly asked NOAA to focus on this issue.  Congress appropriated $2 million for NOAA to work on this issue.  The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council allowed for a nearly two-year delay in the rule to take effect so that NOAA could work on this issue.  This proposed rule makes no improvements to the calibration that two years ago was identified as flawed.  It should be rejected by the Administrator and sent back to the Council."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-biden-mandate-hurting-military-recruitment,"Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine was a reminder that the world is a dangerous place. Indeed, the threats to global peace and stability continue to grow daily, with China rapidly expanding its military and Iran inching closer to a nuclear weapon. The world is in serious need of strong American leadership backed by military might. Unfortunately, our military is bleeding service members at the very moment we need them most. President Biden’s self-defeating vaccine mandate is driving away thousands of service members and causing military recruitment to plummet, making our nation less secure.  Worst Recruiting Deficit Since 1973   Of all our military branches, the Army is having the hardest time finding recruits. As of late June, the Army had met only 40 percent of its annual recruiting goal with just three months left in the fiscal year. In light of this shortfall, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Joseph Martin said the Army could find itself short 7,000 troops this year and, by next year, 28,000 troops. This manpower shortage could result in undermanned units and potentially longer deployments, as well as greater dependence on National Guardsmen to meet mission goals.  The Marine Corps is expected to meet its recruiting target this year, but the Air Force and Navy are struggling. Currently, the Air Force is down 1,650 pilots, including 1,100 fighter pilots, and the Navy is short nearly 100 fighter pilots. To offset these shortages, the Air Force has brought back a number of retired pilots to active duty, and both the Air Force and Navy are offering large bonuses for pilots who commit to another five years in uniform. If not reversed, these shortages could call into question the sustainability of our all-volunteer force.  Vaccine Mandate Drives Out Valuable Recruits   There are several reasons for low recruitment that predate President Biden. For example, today only 23 percent of young American adults meet the physical, medical, and academic standards to serve and have no disqualifying criminal record. Of that number, less than half say they are interested in military service, reflecting a broader failure in our society to encourage military service as a noble calling. President Biden inherited these challenges but has only made them worse.  Last August, the Biden Administration imposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate across the entire military. This led to the expulsion of thousands of qualified service members who refused to get the vaccine. To date, the military has lost more than 1,100 soldiers, 800 airmen, 1,000 sailors, and 2,000 Marines because of this mandate, with thousands more separations likely to come. Most of these individuals are young, physically fit, and at the lowest risk of hospitalization or death from COVID. We desperately need these service members, but President Biden seems content to lose them. His vaccine order is threatening our military readiness, and I have forcefully urged his officials to rescind it.  In addition, our military is suffering from cultural decay under President Biden. Many service members have been forced to sit through divisive trainings on critical race theory and transgenderism, which have disrupted cohesion within the ranks. Service members do not want a “woke” military, and President Biden should not be surprised that his policies are alienating scores of patriotic Americans who simply want to protect our country. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am working to correct these mistakes through legislation, including the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act. It is essential that our military attract and retain the best and brightest of the next generation."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-blasts-defense-department-for-vaccine-requirement-recruitment-challenges,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin calling for an end to the Department of Defense’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which has already resulted in thousands of military service members being expelled amid a nationwide recruiting crisis. “The Department is simultaneously bleeding its best and brightest while desperately trying to recruit new talent,” Wicker wrote. “This is not a blueprint for success.”The letter follows an announcement from Army officials that more than 60,000 national guardsmen and reservists are no longer allowed to conduct their military duties after declining to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple senior defense officials also identify recruitment as a serious challenge for the Armed Forces.“Your COVID vaccine mandate is on the precipice of irreversibly damaging the readiness of the U.S. military in the near-term and beyond,” Wicker concluded. “I strongly advise that you discontinue this mandate and work to make the services whole again.”Last year, Wicker held a press conference on COVID vaccine challenges within the force, warning of a looming personnel crisis within the military. The Mississippi senator also joined an amicus brief defending Navy SEALs for their religious objection to COVID vaccines and signed a letter alongside Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., demanding more information from the Department of Defense on forced separations as a result of vaccine refusal.Read the full letter here or below.Dear Secretary Austin,Even as it struggles to meet recruiting goals, the Department of Defense is continuing to terminate experienced, unvaccinated servicemembers by the thousands. The Department is simultaneously bleeding its best and brightest while desperately trying to recruit new talent.  This is not a blueprint for success.You stated in your August 24, 2021, memo that “mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people.”  This was never the case, and it is even less the case now as the country fully recovers from the pandemic. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said this week, “vaccines – because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus – don’t protect overly well, as it were, against infection.” Moreover, service members, the vast majority of whom are under the age of 45 and have no serious or underlying health conditions, are also among those who are at the lowest risk for hospitalization and death from the coronavirus.Despite this low mortality rate in the DoD’s target demographic, you are fast approaching the prospect of expelling more U.S. service members than all Americans who have died of COVID under age 45.  To date, the Army has removed over 1,100 Soldiers, the Air Force has removed over 800 Airmen, the Navy has removed over 1,000 Sailors, and the Marine Corps has removed over 2,000 Marines because of COVID vaccination status.  Each of these services have thousands of outstanding exemption requests that will also likely result in separations.  Additionally, about 13 percent of National Guardsmen, (40,000) and 12 percent of Reservists (22,000) remained unvaccinated the day after the DoD vaccination deadline passed. Your COVID vaccine mandate is on the precipice of irreversibly damaging the readiness of the U.S. military in the near-term and beyond.  I strongly advise that you discontinue this mandate and work to make the services whole again.Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, wicker.senate.gov "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-hyde-smith-oppose-biden-s-flawed-title-ix-proposal-urge-extension-of-public-comment-period,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., today are among 21 Senators registering opposition to the Biden Administration’s proposed changes to Title IX rules that govern the adjudication of sexual misconduct claims on college campuses. The Senators are requesting a 30-day extension for the public to provide comments.In a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, the Senators underscore how the proposed changes threaten students’ constitutional right to due process and run counter to federal court precedent. The lawmakers assert the public deserves more time to review and comment on the rule.“Instead of upholding the key tenets of our judicial system, the Department’s proposal returns to the deeply flawed campus disciplinary process of the Obama administration, which was heavily criticized by liberal law professors, Democrats, and even a former liberal Supreme Court justice,” the Senators wrote.“Allegations of sexual assault and harassment are a serious and difficult issue, which is why the previous administration was careful to get the Title IX regulations right,” the Senators continued.  “By contrast, the new proposed rule encourages institutions to adopt processes that have either been struck down or been viewed skeptically by multiple courts.”“Rescinding or revising the existing Title IX regulations jeopardizes key protections for victims and the due process rights of the accused and places institutions back into legal jeopardy,” they wrote.The Senators concluded, “Therefore, we ask that you, at a minimum, extend the public comment period by at least 30 days to ensure that the American public have the proper time to review this troublesome attack on due process protections and the expansion of Title IX.”U.S. Senator Richard Burr, R-N.C., ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, led the letter.  In addition to Wicker and Hyde-Smith, it was signed by Senators John Barrasso, R-Wyo., John Boozman, R-Ark., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Bill Cassidy, R-La., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, James Inhofe, R-Okla., James Lankford, R-Okla., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Tim Scott, R-S.C., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala..The U.S. Department of Education issued its proposed rule, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance, on July 12 with a Sept. 12 deadline for providing public comments.Read the Senators’ full letter here."

If my colleagues insist on advancing legislation to address Puerto Rico this Congress, I hope they will join me in extending the people of the Commonwealth the full slate of options when choosing their own future.”Wicker’s legislation, titled the Puerto Rico Status Act, would authorize a binding plebiscite vote on four options: independence for Puerto Rico, sovereignty in free association with the United States, statehood, or retaining the status of Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth.Read the full text of the bill here. "

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/biden-creates-perfect-storm-for-energy-crisis,"Paying an arm and a leg for gasoline has become a fact of life under President Biden. For four straight months, gas prices in Mississippi have topped $4 per gallon – more than double what we were paying just two years ago. Electricity costs are soaring as well. Over the past year, electricity rates have risen 13.7 percent, eating up a larger share of our budgets. These heavy costs are falling especially hard on lower-income Americans, retirees, and those on fixed incomes. Recently, when asked how long Americans will have to stomach these prices, President Biden said bluntly, “As long as it takes.”  These high energy prices are a direct result of the President’s climate agenda, which he has refused to abandon in the face of mounting costs. Mr. Biden put his cards on the table in 2019 when he told his supporters, “We are going to end fossil fuel.” He has since shown that he is serious. As President, he has aggressively sought to block oil and gas development across the nation and has waged a relentless war on coal. Many of us had hoped he would alter his course amid out-of-control energy prices, but he has simply resorted to band-aid solutions to try to hide the harmful effects of his policies.  Gimmicks Fail to Lower Prices   Since November, President Biden has released more than 150 million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an attempt to lower gas prices. Predictably, this has not worked. Americans are still paying over $4 per gallon, yet now our oil reserve – which was designed strictly for emergencies – has been largely depleted, leaving us more vulnerable in the future. It is also reported that over five million barrels of this oil were sent overseas, including to China.   President Biden has proposed other short-term gimmicks as well. He has floated a national gas tax holiday, which would save drivers at most 18 cents on the gallon, and which President Obama once derided as a political stunt. He has urged foreign countries, like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, to boost oil exports even as he is crushing American oil production. Recently, he even tried to tell gas stations to lower their prices unilaterally, as if somehow they could control the global oil market. President Biden is in total denial that his anti-energy policies are the real problem.  Green Agenda Could Lead to Blackouts   In addition to hurting the economy, the President’s war on energy poses a growing risk to our power grid. Natural gas and coal currently provide 60 percent of our electricity, yet these are the very power sources President Biden is targeting with heavy regulations. According to the Energy Information Administration, 85 percent of power plant closures this year are expected to be among coal-fired plants – a direct result of the President’s war on coal. With our power supply shrinking, experts say more than half of the country now faces a higher risk of power outages this summer.   Ten years ago, the German government attempted to move away from coal and nuclear power the way President Biden is trying to do. After a few years, they found it unworkable. It became clear that renewable energy sources are not yet reliable and cannot provide 100 percent of a major country’s power needs. President Biden should heed this lesson. Until he shifts course and decides to unleash the full range of our abundant energy resources, we will all continue to suffer."

Both the University of Mississippi Rebels and Pearl River Community College Wildcats secured national championships in the Division I World Series and Division II Junior College World Series, respectively.Wicker touted Mississippi as the “center of the universe for college baseball,” citing a strong season for the University of Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles and last year’s championship for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs.                                                          The Mississippi senator celebrated the leadership of Ole Miss Baseball Captain Tim Elko and Head Coach Mike Bianco, who received this year’s National Coach of the Year award. Wicker also recognized Pearl River’s head coach Michael Avalon, who won this year’s National Coach of the Year award for Division II Junior Colleges.The floor speech follows a resolution Wicker introduced with other members of the Mississippi delegation celebrating Ole Miss’s victory.Read his remarks as delivered below.Mr. President,For the second year in a row, the state of Mississippi is the center of the universe for college baseball.Senator Hyde-Smith and I are proud and delighted this afternoon to congratulate not one but two Mississippi collegiate baseball teams on becoming national champions for their respective divisions this year.Those teams are the Ole Miss Rebels and the Pearl River Community College Wildcats.It was just last year that the Mississippi State Bulldogs won their first-ever College World Series national championship.And with the new year came even more success for baseball in Mississippi.Last month, after sweating out selection day, Ole Miss went to the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament and won 10 out of 11 games, sweeping Oklahoma in the final round of the College World Series to become national champions.Just weeks earlier, Pearl River Community College – located in Poplarville, Mississippi – defeated Madison College of Wisconsin in the Division II Junior College World Series.After spending the entire season ranked in the top five, Pearl River won five out of six games in the playoffs – defeating Florida State College at Jacksonville, Lansing Community College, and finally Madison College in a three-game series finale.The Wildcats dropped Game 1 to Madison, but then roared back with a 19-1 victory in Game 2 and a decisive 7-2 victory in Game 3. They finished their season with a sparkling record of 45 wins and 11 losses.Just think about this for a moment: three college baseball national titles in two years for the state of Mississippi.Congratulations also go to the University of Southern Mississippi, which had an excellent season and even hosted their first Super Regional in Hattiesburg, ending with a record of 47 wins and 19 losses.Mr. President, this year’s Ole Miss championship run is a comeback story for the ages.After spending early parts of the season ranked No. 1 in the nation, the Rebels went into a deep slump in April, losing four straight series and 11 out of 16 games. In May, they were among the last four teams to be included in the field of 64.But, they had finished the regular season hot, and some people believed they just might carry that momentum into the playoffs.  And they did, outscoring their opponents 46 runs to 11 down the stretch.Led by Coach Mike Bianco and Team Captain Tim Elko, Ole Miss beat one team after another – first Arizona and Miami in the Regional, then Southern Miss in the Hattiesburg Super Regional, then Auburn and Arkansas in the College World Series – which led to a final, best-two-out-of-three face-off with Oklahoma.Game 1 was a slugfest.The Rebels put up 16 hits, including back-to-back-to-back home runs in the 8th inning by TJ McCants, Calvin Harris, and Justin Bench – a stunning feat not seen at the College World Series since 1998.On the mound, the Ole Miss pitchers kept things quiet.  Jack Dougherty, Mason Nichols, and Josh Mallitz gave up just three runs, securing a 10-3 victory.The decisive Game 2 was a lot closer. For the first five innings, it was a pitchers’ duel between Ole Miss’s Hunter Elliot of Tupelo, Mississippi, and Cade Horton of Norman, Oklahoma.The bats finally got going for Ole Miss in the 6th when Jacob Gonzalez hit a solo home run.The Sooners quickly answered by knocking in two runs, making it 2 to 1, Oklahoma.But in the 8th inning, Ole Miss tied things up with hits by TJ McCants, Justin Bench, and Jake Gonzalez – and scored two additional runs on wild pitches, making it 4-2.In the top of the 9th, Brandon Johnson took the mound for Ole Miss and closed out the night with three strikeouts, capping off a magical run for the men from Oxford.“From last team in, to last team standing,” exclaimed the announcer.And then, to Oxford they returned, bringing with them the 30th NCAA championship in Ole Miss history.The day after winning the title, these national champions were welcomed back to campus by crowds of jubilant supporters as they walked the hallowed pathway of the Walk of Champions.On behalf of the entire state of Mississippi, I commend the Ole Miss team and their staff on this historic achievement.Justin Bench, Calvin Harris, Kevin Graham, Kemp Alderman, and Dylan DeLucia all were named to the NCAA’s All-Tournament Team.Dylan DeLucia received the Jack Diesing, Sr., Most Outstanding Player of the Series Award for pitching a complete-game shutout against the Arkansas Razorbacks, becoming the first recipient of the award in Ole Miss history.And Captain Tim Elko became only the sixth player in history to earn four hits in a Men’s College World Series final – not to mention his 46 career home runs, the second most in school history.I also congratulate Mike Bianco, who has coached Ole Miss for 22 seasons and led the team to 18 playoff appearances, including two trips to the College World Series in Omaha.He has rightly been named National Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper.He never gave up on his team, and he inspired his players to persevere through the tough times.I wish Coach Bianco the best of luck this week as he now leads Team USA at an international tournament in the Netherlands, where he is joined by two Ole Miss players: Hunter Elliott and Jacob Gonzalez.I also congratulate Michael Avalon, head coach for the Pearl River Wildcats, who after leading his team to a national title was named National Coach of the Year for Division II junior colleges.And so, Mr. President, I commend the University of Mississippi, Pearl River Community College, the University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi State University for carrying on Mississippi’s winning tradition.Two years ago, after a season cut short by the COVID pandemic, Ole Miss catcher Hayden Dunhurst boldly said:“I have never been a part of a team so special. … We will bring a National Championship to Oxford.”And so they did!Congratulations, and Hotty Toddy."

Along the way, the team posted a 10-1 record in the postseason, and 22-year head coach of the team Mike Bianco was awarded the National Coach of the Year award by the American Baseball Coaches Association.The University of Mississippi baseball team’s win brought back-to-back Men’s College World Series wins to the State of Mississippi after Mississippi State University won the national championship last year.Read the full resolution here or below.Congratulating the University of Mississippi Rebels baseball team for winning the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball championship.Whereas, on Sunday, June 26, 2022, the University of Mississippi baseball team won the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble as the ‘NCAA’’) Men’s College World Series at Charles Schwab Field in Omaha, Nebraska;Whereas, by defeating the University of Oklahoma by a score of 4 to 2, the University of Mississippi baseball team became the first team in school history to win the NCAA Division I baseball championship;Whereas the University of Mississippi baseball team lost only 1 game throughout the entirety of the 2022 NCAA-Division I Baseball Tournament Men’s College World Series, finishing the postseason with a record of 10–1;Whereas the Rebels completed a magical run through the postseason, finishing on top after being among the last teams included in the field of 64 for the NCAA tournament;Whereas, on June 26, 2022, University of Mississippi pitcher Dylan DeLucia received the Jack Diesing, Sr., Most Outstanding Player of the Series Award for pitching a complete-game shutout against the Arkansas Razorbacks, becoming the first recipient of the award in school history;Whereas infielders Tim Elko, Justin Bench and Calvin Harris, outfielder Kevin Graham, designated hitter Kemp Alderman, and pitcher Dylan DeLucia were named to the 2022 NCAA Men’s College World Series All-Tournament Team;Whereas Head Coach Mike Bianco, having coached the University of Mississippi baseball team for 22 seasons, including 18 postseason appearances, led the team to a 42–23 record and the 2022 NCAA National Championship victory;Whereas Head Coach Bianco was named National Coach of the Year by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper and the American Baseball Coaches Association;Whereas the University of Mississippi baseball team hit back to-back-to-back home runs and 16 hits in Game 1 of the 2022 NCAA National Championship, the first team to do so since 1998;Whereas Tim Elko became only the sixth player in history to have 4 hits in a Men’s College World Series final and recorded 46 career home runs, the second-most in school history;Whereas Oxford-University Stadium/Swayze Field on the campus of the University of Mississippi is the home of the 2022 NCAA National Champions; Whereas the victory of the University of Mississippi baseball team has brought back-to-back Men’s College World Series wins to the State of Mississippi;Whereas the University of Mississippi athletic program, through its football and baseball teams, was 1 of only 2 athletic programs in the country to appear in both a New Year’s Six bowl game and the Men’s College World Series this year;Whereas the University of Mississippi now boasts 30 total NCAA national championships;Whereas the University of Mississippi baseball team, under the leadership of Head Coach Bianco, displayed outstanding dedication, teamwork, and sportsmanship throughout the 2021–2022 season; andWhereas the University of Mississippi baseball team has brought great pride and honor to—(1) the University of Mississippi;(2) loyal fans of the University of Mississippi; and(3) the entire State of Mississippi: Now, therefore,Resolved, That the Senate—(1) congratulates the University of Mississippi baseball team, including the athletes, coaching staff, administration, faculty, students, and alumni, for winning the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I baseball championship;(2) recognizes the University of Mississippi for its excellence as an institution of higher education; and(3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to—(A) the chancellor of the University of Mississippi, Dr. Glenn Boyce;(B) the athletic director of the University of Mississippi, Keith Carter; and(C) the head coach of the University of Mississippi baseball team, Mike Bianco."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-colleagues,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., joined his colleagues Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Ben Cardin, D-Md., and Chris Coons, D-Del., in introducing legislation that directs President Biden to develop a strategy toward the Black Sea region, which has increasingly become a critical inflection point for European and global security amid Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine. The bipartisan legislation follows the first-ever Black Sea Security Summit hosted by Senator Wicker in Constanta, Romania last week.“The Black Sea occupies a vital strategic position in Eastern Europe,” Wicker said. “Following the Black Sea Security Summit that I led in Romania last week, it is clear that America needs to lead from a position of strength in the region, but we lack a clear plan of action. I look forward to working with the Administration to design and implement a substantive approach to our regional challenges.”“As Putin continues his war in Ukraine, the United States must be prepared to address the challenges he’s created in the immediate and long term for European and U.S. security. That is precisely what our legislation seeks to do by looking at a critical geopolitical region: the Black Sea,” said Senator Shaheen. “Putin has already demonstrated the high strategic value he places upon the Black Sea region by invading Georgia in 2008, followed by his annexation of Crimea in 2014 and further invasion of Ukraine this year. Control over access to the Black Sea is fundamental to his delusional dream of building a Russian empire and the United States cannot allow that to happen. We are already seeing the fallout from Putin’s action toward that end by suffocating key ports in Ukraine that have spurred a global food crisis. His belligerence toward Ukraine today is reaping global consequences, which is why strategic action is crucial to thwart those efforts. Our bipartisan legislation urges the Biden administration to make U.S. policy in the region a priority by developing an interagency report, followed by a strategy, to enhance economic ties, strengthen democratic institutions and bolster military assistance and coordination between the U.S., NATO and Black Sea partners, among other provisions. As a fellow member of the Europe subcommittee, I appreciate Senator Romney’s partnership on this legislation and look forward to engaging lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to join us in this effort.”  “The Black Sea has become increasingly critical as Vladimir Putin continues to wage his unprovoked war in Ukraine, and it has become clear that the United States must have both a strategy and presence in the region. Our legislation aims to accomplish this by requiring the Biden Administration to develop a strategy to strengthen coordination between the U.S., NATO, and partners in the Black Sea in an effort to increase security, support economic prosperity, and promote democracy,” said Senator Romney. “I am proud to work with my fellow colleague on the Foreign Relations Europe subcommittee on this legislation and urge our colleagues to join us in this important effort.” Specifically, the legislation would:  Text of the legislation is available here. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-applauds-direction-of-supreme-court,"It was only six years ago that Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative titan on our nation’s highest court, passed away unexpectedly. With the 2016 election months away, many feared that Hillary Clinton, if elected, would push the court far to the left. Thankfully, that did not happen. Under President Trump, Senate Republicans confirmed three highly qualified Supreme Court justices – a historic feat that cemented a conservative majority. This was a powerful reminder that voters can change the course of our judiciary. With the court recently issuing a number of monumental decisions, it is clear that this majority is committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution as written.  Court Pushes Back on Executive Overreach   One of the court’s most important decisions this year involved the Second Amendment. In a case out of New York, the court held that government cannot restrict gun owners from carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense. Days later, the court vacated several lower court rulings that had allowed for onerous gun and ammunition restrictions in Maryland, New Jersey, and California. These precedents will preserve the right to keep and bear arms for years to come.  Additionally, the court dealt a major blow to government overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency. Siding with West Virginia, the court held that the Biden Administration overstepped its authority when it bypassed Congress to wage war on the coal industry. The court’s 6-3 ruling was a major win for American energy and could relieve some pressure on electricity costs. It was also a firm reminder to regulators that they need permission from Congress to create expansive new rules.In a big victory for religious freedom, the court sided with Joe Kennedy, a high school football coach in Washington State, who was wrongly fired for exercising his faith. As a Christian, Coach Kennedy made a practice of privately praying at midfield after games. The superintendent eventually ordered him to stop. When he declined, the school fired him. In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled in Coach Kennedy’s favor, declaring that he was engaging in free exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment. This sends an important message that public employees can freely live out their faith at the workplace.  The End of Roe v. Wade   Finally, in the most closely watched case of the year, the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 precedent in Roe v. Wade, bringing an end to 50 years of nationwide abortion-on-demand. This case was successfully argued by the state of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In its opinion, the court declared that Roe was “egregiously wrong,” the Constitution does not in fact protect a right to abortion, and abortion policy is now returned to the people and their elected representatives. This historic breakthrough for the pro-life cause was an answered prayer for millions of Americans. Because of this ruling, lawmakers are now finally able to protect the unborn, as we are seeing in many states.  Conservative Court Plays the Right Role   For decades, the political left has sought to use the courts to bypass the democratic process and advance their agenda by judicial fiat. This is wrong and has greatly harmed our system of government. As Alexander Hamilton once noted, a court’s job is simply to exercise “judgment,” not “will.” With these decisions, the Supreme Court has corrected its past overreach and applied the Constitution fairly and straightforwardly. This new majority is helping restore the court’s proper role within our system."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-urges-support-for-nato-during-visit-to-europe,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the U.S. Helsinki Commission, this week led a group of legislators to meet with senior European government officials and discuss opportunities to increase security and cooperation. While in Europe, Wicker met with the President of Finland and the Swedish Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, Speaker of Parliament, as well as other leaders to discuss their applications for NATO membership. “This is a pivotal moment for Europe’s future and how the world responds to Vladimir Putin’s vicious and illegal war in Ukraine,” Wicker said. “Finland and Sweden are taking the historic step to enter NATO, which will benefit the alliance and security in Europe. It was an honor to discuss America’s firm support for their applications directly with their top leadership.” Wicker also recently met with the Swedish and Finnish ambassadors to the United States to discuss their applications for membership, and penned an op-ed in National Review, arguing that both countries’ accession to NATO would be in the American national interest.Prior to his meetings in Finland and Sweden, Wicker led an international Black Sea Security Summit with other European partners in Constanta, Romania. The leaders discussed improving the region’s defense against Russian influence and military operations. Attendees included senior officials from Ukraine, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, United States European Command, and NATO.“The Black Sea occupies a vital strategic position in Eastern Europe, and our summit was a powerful example of American leadership on important transatlantic security issues,” Wicker said. “The United States and its allies must close shoulders to make sure that this brazen invasion ends successfully, not just for the people of Ukraine, but also for all the free people of the world.”Wicker further fulfilled his responsibilities as a co-chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission by leading several sessions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly. Read more about Wicker’s recent work on foreign affairs and national defense here. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-marks-four-months-of-4-gas,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today blasted President Biden’s energy policies after months of sharply elevated energy prices. The average price of a gallon of regular gas has remained above $4 a gallon nationally since March 7, 2022. “President Biden’s war on American energy has become an extended campaign against the American family. A gallon of gas has cost more than $4 a gallon for four months,” Wicker said. “This is a crisis of the President’s own creation, but he has refused to take responsibility for the damage his energy policies have caused.” “As the President bleeds our strategic petroleum reserve dry, he continues to bash energy producers and blame others. Meanwhile, he is doing an apology tour across the world, pleading with dictators to sell us oil that we could be producing ourselves. He is also pushing on with reckless plans to cancel offshore drilling, a clear solution to our catastrophe. The American people cannot afford for the President to waste any more time. It is time for him to admit his policies have failed and unleash American energy production.” The national average of gas per gallon has remained over $4 since March. Even as costs remain high, President Biden announced his modest offshore drilling plans, which shut the door on new projects in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. Earlier this week, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve authorized the sale of 5 million more barrels to foreign countries. As recently as last month, President Biden referred to the rise in energy costs as a direct result of “Putin’s price hike,” despite the fact that energy prices had been rising before the conflict in Ukraine.  "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/noaa-puts-red-snapper-season-in-the-crosshairs,"Fishing for red snapper is a popular pastime on the Gulf Coast, one that brings together fishermen, boat makers, bait suppliers, and restaurant owners. This prosperous industry centers on three months of open fishing during the summer.To my dismay, regulators in Washington are now proposing a rule that could cut Mississippi’s season down to two weeks without any sound science. If they succeed, the Gulf Coast will needlessly suffer.Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a proposed rule that would drastically curb Mississippi’s recreational red snapper catch limit from over 150,000 lbs. to 59,000 lbs., an amount that took less than three weeks for Mississippi anglers to catch last year. This new quota is based on the false assumption we are overfishing.The problem boils down to NOAA’s flawed data collection methods. NOAA calculates our fishing levels based on non-empirical phone surveys. Based on these surveys, NOAA estimates there are 1,500 fishing boats on the water daily in Mississippi. But this figure is overblown.For several years, Mississippi and other Gulf Coast states have been collecting our own field data. In Mississippi, we have pioneered the “Tails n’ Scales” app, which allows anglers to report their own catch through their phones. This has enabled Mississippi to track 95 percent of all red snapper anglers. Based on these and other state metrics, last year Mississippi counted 256 fishing boats on the busiest day of red snapper season. Yet NOAA has failed to give our numbers due consideration.NOAA’s badly informed rule came as a surprise to me.Last year, Congress gave the agency $2 million to explore better data calibration methods, but these appear absent from the new rule. I had even received assurances from Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo that Mississippi would be treated more fairly after getting a raw deal in previous rules. This proposal is yet a disappointment, and I have told Secretary Raimondo as much.Mississippi will not be alone in bearing the cost of NOAA’s poor methods. Anglers in Alabama stand to lose weeks if not months of their fishing season. No state is ultimately safe from federal rules that disregard the best data. With the proposed rule now listed in the Federal Register, I would encourage all stakeholders to provide public comment on why NOAA got this wrong. The public comment period ends July 28. Every voice counts. There is still hope for a reversal before the rule takes effect Jan. 1, 2023.NOAA is rightly concerned about sustainability, but accurate data is essential in balancing the various interests at stake. It is highly disturbing that NOAA’s flawed data caused it to overestimate Mississippi’s fishing effort by almost 600 percent, when Mississippi’s data has been lauded for its accuracy. NOAA will continue to lose our confidence until it starts replacing its outdated estimates with empirical data collected by states. NOAA Director Richard Spinrad needs to treat states as partners, not adversaries.I will be pressing him for answers until he changes course.This op-ed originally appeared in the Biloxi Sun Herald."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/7/wicker-stands-up-for-women-athletes,"June 23 marked the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that brought athletic opportunity to women across America. Passed in 1972, Title IX bans discrimination on the basis of sex in all schools, colleges, and universities that receive federal funds. These institutions are required to give men and women equal access to the programs they offer, including athletic opportunities.Title IX has been a game-changer for women’s sports. At the time it was enacted, only 15 percent of college athletes were women, and in high school just seven percent of athletes were girls. Female athletes received two percent of college athletics budgets, and sports scholarships for women were almost non-existent. All that has changed because of Title IX. Today, 44 percent of college athletes are women, and 3.5 million girls participate in high school sports. Title IX was truly one of the greatest advances for women in our nation’s history.  Biden Puts Women's Sports in Danger   After such remarkable progress, it is troubling that President Biden is now putting women’s sports at risk. On the 50th anniversary of Title IX, Biden officials released new guidance that could require schools to allow transgender athletes who are biologically male to compete against women. This means that from California to Mississippi, middle school girls could find themselves having to compete with biological boys who identify as transgender. This is simply unacceptable and will meet stiff resistance across the country.  Many Americans are already alarmed that transgender athletes who are biologically male are competing against women. Some of these men have won titles that should have gone to women, causing some female athletes to miss out on scholarships. One recent victim is Riley Gaines, a swimmer from Tennessee. At the NCAA championships, she tied for fifth place with Lia Thomas, a 6’4” biological male who was allowed to compete as a woman. Thomas had previously ranked 400th among male swimmers, yet among women he found himself in contention for a national title. Ms. Gaines said her experience going up against Thomas was disheartening. “It’s just not fair,” she added. “It’s not right.”Most Americans agree with Ms. Gaines. A recent survey found that roughly six in 10 Americans believe biological men should be barred from competing in collegiate women’s sports. Even FINA, the international governing body for swimming, is adopting this view and just days ago decided to ban most biological men from women’s swimming. As more people stand up to defend women’s sports, the President will find himself in shrinking company.  Republicans Work to Protect Women's Sports   As with so many of his policies, President Biden has clearly failed to consider the real-world impacts of his transgender proposal. Recently I joined my colleagues in pushing back on the President by cosponsoring the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. This bill would clarify that “sex” in Title IX refers strictly to biology. It would also make it illegal for a recipient of federal funds to let males compete in female sports. In addition, as the lead Republican on the Commerce Committee, I have requested that the NCAA provide an update on how they are complying with Title IX.   Women athletes have come too far to have their opportunities taken away. Republicans will continue to stand up to the President and defend women’s sports. Our work will not be done until every woman and girl can compete freely, fairly, and safely."

Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In the resolution, the senators congratulated the advocates for their courage and commitment to the fight for life. “In the aftermath of the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, millions of volunteers, nonpartisan organizations, and lawmakers came together with a shared voice to stand up for the rights of the unborn, who are the most vulnerable among us,” the senators wrote. “These supporters of the pro-life movement come from diverse backgrounds, with the shared goal of building a society that celebrates, protects, and cherishes life at all stages…The pro-life movement has worked tirelessly over the last 5 decades to reverse the legally unsound and destructive ruling in Roe v. Wade and to ensure that the human dignity of every person is protected by law, regardless of age, background, or belief.” The senators also praised the Supreme Court for their recent Dobbs decision and condemned threats and violence that have followed the ruling. “The decision of the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization does not ban abortion but instead recognizes that under the constitutional system of the United States, the power and the duty to decide whether to permit or limit abortions lies with the States, not unelected Federal judges…As the late Justice Scalia recognized 3 decades ago in his dissent in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), ‘The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.’…The decision of the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization returns the issue of abortion back to the States, for the people of each State to debate and then vote,” the senators continued.  Wicker and Blackburn were joined by Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., James Risch, R-Idaho, Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Todd Young, R-Ind., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, John Thune, R-S.D., and Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.See the full text of the resolution here."

According to BuzzFeed News, the outlet reviewed 14 statements by nine different TikTok employees, each of whom attested to such incidents between September 2021 and January 2022. A member of TikTok’s Trust and Safety Department alleged that “everything is seen in China,” and stated that one Beijing-based engineer had “access to everything.” Further, U.S. employees apparently did not even have the permissions or knowledge needed to access the data.In October 2021, Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s Head of Public Policy for the Americas, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. In response to questioning, Mr. Beckerman referenced a Citizen Lab report, which said, “our research shows that there’s no overt data transmission to the Chinese government. In our testing, TikTok did not contact any servers within China.” Mr. Beckerman also stated that “U.S. user data is stored in the United States. Our backups are in Singapore. And we have a world-renowned U.S. based security team that handles access to user data.” Additionally, Mr. Beckerman said that TikTok did not provide data to the Chinese government on Chinese persons living in the U.S. or elsewhere, because “TikTok is not available in China.” Finally, he noted that Beijing ByteDance Technology “does not have any relation to the TikTok entity.”We are very concerned that, in light of these reports, TikTok’s representative did not provide truthful or forthright answers to the Senate Commerce Committee at its subcommittee hearing. It appears that TikTok is now taking steps to deflect from its knowing misrepresentations by changing the way in which “protected” data can be accessed by its employees.The implications of these findings are stark, but not surprising. Rather, they simply confirm what lawmakers long suspected about TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance—they are using their access to a treasure trove of U.S. consumer data to surveil Americans. And this unfortunately extends beyond consumer data into the national security space. According to a recent article in Task & Purpose, despite a military ban on using TikTok on government-issued devices, the app is widely popular with servicemembers who use it on their personal devices.We would appreciate answers to the following questions Monday, July 18th, 2022:1.         Is it true that TikTok employees located in China currently have, or had in the past, access to U.S. user data? This could include programmers, product developers, data teams, as well as trust and safety and content moderation professionals. a.         If yes, please explain in detail which employees have or had such access and for what purposes. b.         If the employees had this access in the past but no longer do, please identify the applicable date ranges. 2.         TikTok’s privacy policy says you share data you collect with your parent companies and affiliates and that you transmit user information to servers and data centers overseas.  a.         Have any ByteDance employees—located in China or elsewhere—had access to U.S. user data, either currently or in the past? b.         What are the locations of the servers and data centers overseas where TikTok transmits U.S. user data? 3.         Do any ByteDance employees have a role in shaping TikTok’s algorithm? 4.         Do any Douyin employees have any access to American user data or a role in shaping TikTok’s algorithm? 5.         In the past, TikTok has said that it has never—nor would it ever—provide user data to the Chinese government, even if asked. Yet your privacy policy says you can disclose data collected to respond to government inquiries. a.         Has TikTok ever disclosed any U.S. user data to respond to government inquiries from the Chinese Communist Party?  b.         If the Chinese Communist Party asked you for U.S. user data, what is to stop you from providing it? Can the CCP compel you to provide this data, regardless of response? Can they access it, regardless of response?  c.         Has ByteDance ever responded to CCP inquiries on TikTok’s behalf? d.         Has TikTok ever shared U.S. user data with ByteDance for the purpose of responding to a CCP inquiry? 6.         Do TikTok employees in the U.S. use software developed by ByteDance, such as Lark? 7.         Does ByteDance have any role—either in the past or in the present—in hiring TikTok employees in the U.S.? 8.         Does TikTok own or lease its own office space in the U.S., and does ByteDance have any ownership or lease stake in those facilities? 9.         Does the Chinese government have an ownership stake or seat on the Board of Directors, or provide personnel in any other leadership position, of the Beijing ByteDance Technology Company? a.         What role does this seat play in impacting decisions made at ByteDance or TikTok? b.         Does this position afford an opportunity for the board member to determine whether and how TikTok or ByteDance will respond to CCP inquiries?c.         Does this position afford an opportunity for the board member to view TikTok user data?d.         Would you be informed, as a matter of policy, if a board member did view the data? If the board member did share the data, in any capacity, with the CCP?10.       How will TikTok’s new cloud service arrangement be structured, and how will the company determine which data is “protected” such that it is not shared with employees or others in China? 11.       Why is TikTok not planning to ensure that all U.S. user data is blocked from view of employees or others in China?We look forward to your responses.Wicker recently joined a similar letter to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen alongside five other Senators urging the Biden Administration to swiftly address national security concerns stemming from the social media platform."

It could save a life.Thank you. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-statement-on-noaa-s-proposed-red-snapper-rule,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today sharply criticized a rule proposed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the annual catch limits for red snapper that could cut Mississippi’s red snapper season by 60 percent next year.“NOAA’s proposed rule on red snapper represents a gross failure by the agency to improve the quality of data it uses to manage federal fisheries. Mississippi’s recreational anglers are tired of seeing their seasons cut short unnecessarily based on faulty data. The Tails n’ Scales program run by Mississippi produces far more accurate data that should be used. I will keep fighting for the Department of Commerce to develop a higher quality data collection process for recreational fishing,” Wicker said. “I urge all interested Mississippians to submit comments regarding this proposed NOAA rule.”NOAA’s proposed rule is intended to prevent overfishing by modifying each state’s annual catch limits (ACLs) for red snapper. The new formula would require calibrating Mississippi’s high quality ‘Tails n’ Scales’ data, which records accurate information for more than 95% of Mississippi’s annual recreational red snapper catch, to the low-quality Federal Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) data. If enacted, this rule would reduce Mississippi’s red snapper quota by 60 percent in 2023, meaning private anglers could reach their yearly quota in as little as three weeks.The proposed approach is based on outdated data from 2017 and 2018, despite Congress appropriating $2 million to NOAA to investigate and improve calibration methods."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/opportunities-to-help-ocean-freight,"Supply chain disruptions have impacted the quality of life for virtually every American. The delays and bottlenecks, which began early in the pandemic, continue sending shockwaves throughout our economy, leading to higher prices and back orders with no end in sight.This congestion stemmed from the unprecedented surge in consumer demand during the pandemic. Moving such vast amounts of freight around the world is extremely complex and requires optimization across multiple parts of the supply chain. We have all seen images of ships lined up for miles waiting to unload cargo, but the challenges extend inland as well.Port terminal and warehouse space remains limited. A shortage of intermodal equipment, such as truck chassis, has left containers sitting longer at terminals and rail yards. Workforce disruptions have caused slowdowns across the transportation sector. With so much freight to move, each link in the supply chain has not been able to operate at maximum efficiency.Unfortunately, White House policies have done little to help. A massive stimulus bill in 2021 and hostility toward domestic energy production have added pressure to an already strained supply chain. And the president’s call for 24/7 operations at West Coast ports has not panned out — the number of ships waiting to unload remains above pre-pandemic levels. Meaningful steps are needed to address these challenges.Long-term, we need to invest in roads, bridges, ports and railroads, steps I supported in the bipartisan infrastructure law. If implemented as written — without additional requirements that could deter good projects — this law will support American commerce for years to come.There also are near-term steps that could reduce stress on our supply chain. As the lead Republican on the Commerce Committee, I have been pushing several of these initiatives.On June 16, President Biden signed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which will provide the Federal Maritime Commission with tools to help address long-standing concerns about unreasonable fees and a lack of transparency in ocean shipping. Among the more notable provisions, the bill will establish a streamlined process for FMC to receive complaints about unreasonable charges. It will also set standards for surcharge invoices assessed against shippers or motor carriers, provide an easy way to challenge unfair surcharges, and offer greater protection for shippers and truckers who seek redress at the FMC from retaliation by ocean carriers.OSRA also includes provisions I championed last year in my proposed FREIGHT Act. These provisions will help streamline the licensing process to credential truck drivers, formally authorize FMC’s dispute resolution service, and develop best practices for chassis management. American importers and exporters expect fair and transparent rules, and this bill will take important steps to address their concerns.Still, there is more we can do. America’s ports still rank low in performance by global standards, moving goods more slowly to consumers. Republican proposals to modernize our ports have called for adoption of automated port terminals and equipment that could speed up container movement and improve how we organize and stage freight. Other proposals include programs that could help ports integrate data-driven technologies that better inform shippers of the location of their freight, and when they can pick up and drop off containers. Federal grant programs that invest in port facilities could support these upgrades.I am glad we advanced OSRA with the FREIGHT Act provisions with large bipartisan support, but it is regrettable that Congress has not yet advanced technologies that further improve our ports.The challenges facing freight transportation are complex and global in scale, and the private sector will play a lead role in supply chain modernization. But Congress should continue to support this work by making smart investments, lifting regulatory barriers, and enabling innovation at our ports to flourish.This op-ed originally appeared in Transport Topics. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-colleagues-demand-action-from-biden-administration-against-tiktok,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., joined U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and four other senators to call on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to provide answers about actions the Biden administration is taking to combat the national security risks associated with TikTok, a social media platform developed and owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd.TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms, with over 500 million users worldwide. The platform’s owner is subject to control by the Chinese government, which could allow the Chinese Communist Party access to U.S. users’ sensitive personal information. President Trump issued two orders in August 2020 to restrict American access and direct ByteDance to destroy acquired data.While President Biden revoked the first order in June 2021, the August 14 Presidential Order requiring ByteDance to divest its American assets, property, and data is still in effect. The senators called out the lack of action and demanded the Biden Administration take steps to address the severe security concerns.“The Biden Administration has seemingly done nothing to enforce the August 14 order nearly two years since its promulgation,” the senators wrote. “The results of the security reviews, likewise, have not been publicly released after one year. Instead, news reports indicate TikTok is nearing a deal with a U.S. company to ‘store its U.S. users’ information without its Chinese parent ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns.’”“The proposed TikTok deal would do little to address the core security concerns that motivated the August 14 order. That order was not simply concerned about data, but about a Chinese company’s ownership of a social media platform in America. If the Biden Administration focuses solely on data storage and integrity to the exclusion of the critical issue of ByteDance’s ownership, control, and influence of TikTok, serious security risks will remain and the August 14 order will go unenforced,” the senators concluded.The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Todd Young, R-Ind.The full text of the letter can be found here.Wicker supported the August 14 order in 2020, after expressing concerns about TikTok’s policies in the past.

Bremerton School District:“Religious freedom is a bedrock principle enumerated within our Bill of Rights,” Wicker said. “The Supreme Court upheld this principle and our founding documents by coming down on the side of Coach Kennedy. The Court’s protection of the rights of Americans to practice their sincerely-held beliefs is both proper and vital. I will always stand with those who defend one of America’s most sacred traditions and keep the right to religious expression unimpeded.”Kennedy v.

James Lankford, R-Okla. in August urging the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court decision."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-celebrates-end-of-roe-v-wade,"Pro-life Americans are rejoicing this week after the historic reversal of Roe v. Wade, one of the darkest decisions in Supreme Court history. For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade imposed abortion-on-demand on the entire country and kept us from making even modest protections for unborn life. Roe’s downfall was long overdue and is an answered prayer. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito declared that there is no constitutional right to an abortion and that this issue properly belongs to the people and their elected representatives. With this monumental ruling, we are now free to enact laws that protect the most vulnerable members of our society.This victory for life was the result of decades of work from all corners of our nation. It took the constant labors of crisis pregnancy centers, churches, civic groups, and elected officials, all of which helped move the needle toward this outcome. Mississippi should be especially proud of our role in this effort. Mississippi argued the case that led to Roe’s reversal in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, and I was pleased to author a congressional amicus brief supporting Mississippi’s case. As pro-life advocates celebrate this ruling, we should recommit to building a culture of life where every child is welcomed and every mother is abundantly supported.Lawmakers Can Now Protect the UnbornWith Roe v. Wade finally gone, our nation will return to the global mainstream on abortion. For half a century, America was one of seven nations with the most extreme abortion-on-demand policies, alongside China and North Korea. European nations like France, Germany, and Norway – hardly bastions of conservatism – have had stricter abortion policies than we had under Roe v. Wade. Indeed, two-thirds of Americans support a second-trimester abortion ban, which was not allowed under Roe. The Court’s new decision allows us to turn public consensus into durable protections for the unborn.Americans have grown consistently more pro-life as the science has changed. Since 1995, the share of Americans identifying as pro-life has increased from 33 to 47 percent. During that time, parents have used sonograms to look at their unborn children’s hands and feet and see themselves in the faces of their offspring. We now know that the fetal heartbeat begins at six weeks, and an unborn child can feel pain at 20 weeks. Science undeniably points to the humanity of the unborn child. It is no wonder that more and more states have moved to restrict abortion.As a U.S. Senator, I will continue supporting efforts to protect unborn life at the federal level. I will also continue advocating for conscience protections for doctors and medical staff who do not wish to participate in abortion. In addition, Republicans will continue fighting to preserve the Hyde Amendment so that taxpayer dollars are not spent on abortion.Toward a More Perfect Union Since Roe v. Wade was handed down, more than 63 million unborn lives have violently ended through abortion. The Dobbs ruling allows us to turn the page on this tragic era. The fight for the unborn is the leading human rights issue of our time. Just as the civil rights movement brought us into closer alignment with the truth that all men are created equal, the pro-life movement is slowly but surely making our nation a more perfect union."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/deter-china-by-turning-taiwan-into-a-porcupine,"The paramount lesson from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that repeated threats of economic sanctions didn’t deter Vladimir Putin from launching an all-out invasion. This offers a warning for Taiwan, the U.S. and their allies as threats from China loom.The long history of sanctions, embargoes and economic blockades strongly suggests they are difficult to enforce, entail significant costs to the nations imposing them, and trigger market forces that eventually override them. Benefits flow to countries that don’t enforce the sanctions. The enforcement challenges grow significantly if the economy of the targeted nation is large, and as the size of the target country increases, the deterrent effect of threatening sanctions loses credibility.Since the Chinese economy—one-sixth of the world’s economy—is 10 times as large as the Russian economy, effective sanctions would be virtually impossible to enforce. Relying on threatened sanctions to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan could therefore entice aggression that could pull the U.S. into a war with China, an event that would alter the course of world history.Thankfully, there is a far more effective deterrent. Taiwan is an island roughly 100 miles off the coast of mainland China. Unlike Ukraine, a large land army can’t be massed along its border. But because it is an island, supplies also can’t be delivered to an adjacent neighbor and clandestinely driven across the border. Any supplies delivered after an attack would have to be flown in or delivered by ship, putting the supplier directly in harm’s way. Supplying Taiwan on anything like the scale we have supplied Ukraine during a Chinese attack would be a logistical nightmareWhen China was an economic basket case, 100 miles of ocean was more than enough deterrent. But with China now an economic and military powerhouse, Taiwan’s lack of preparedness is increasingly dangerous.Taiwan’s economy is two-thirds larger than Israel’s, but Taiwan spends almost two-thirds less as a percentage of gross domestic product on defense. U.S. support can’t be allowed to abet Taiwan’s neglect of its own defense. As Machiavelli observed, “nothing is so weak and unsustainable as a reputation for power which is not based on one’s own strength.”The good news is that modern technology makes it relatively easy for Taiwan to afford weapons that would make the cost of invasion exceed any reasonable benefit. Ukraine’s valiant resistance has shown how highly motivated defenders with high-tech weapons can scramble the calculus of military power. Like David’s smooth stone that slew Goliath, two Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank the flagship of the Russian navy in the Black Sea. With 400 U.S. Harpoon missiles, costing only 0.3% of its GDP, Taiwan could imperil any Chinese warship in the Taiwan Strait. Modern sea mines are even less expensive, and Turkish Bayraktar drones, which have been so effective in Ukraine, cost less than $2 million each. Two hundred fifty million dollars would buy 5,000 Switchblade drones, which could devastate landing craft, armored vehicles, and small assault ships.Taiwan already has two Patriot missile battalions and for $3 billion could double its air and missile defense. Stinger missiles, used to great effect in Ukraine, cost only $400 million for 1,000 missiles. Taiwan will have more than 200 F-16 fighter jets by 2026, including almost 70 of the newest Block 70 aircraft. With additional F-16s and other aircraft being retired from the U.S. Air Force, more aircraft could be made available at their depreciated value.If the U.S. and its allies are willing to accelerate the sale of these and other force-multiplier weapons at cost, Taiwan could totally upgrade and harden its defenses by simply raising its defense budget from 2% to 3% of GDP. At that level, Taiwan could fund all these weapon purchases over a five-year period. Sustaining its defense outlays at 3% of GDP would allow Taiwan to continue modernizing its defenses while spending at a level roughly equal to Israel’s defense expenditures in real dollar terms.With these investments, Taiwan should focus heavily on training for new weapons systems. It should also consider transforming its army from the current conscript system into a smaller voluntary force that would better accommodate a defense system based on the power of modern technology. Citizens who would have otherwise been drafted could be trained in high-end weaponry and kept in reserve or home-guard forces that could be activated in emergencies.The primary objective of the U.S., its allies and Taiwan isn’t to repel a Chinese attack but to prevent it from ever occurring. Effective deterrence is the key to national security.Any wolf has the ability to kill a gentle porcupine. And yet such an attack virtually never occurs in nature. The defense of the porcupine’s quills, which can rip through the predator’s mouth and throat, is the deterrent that protects the small creature in the violent woods. Through the force-multiplying miracle of modern weapons, we can help make Taiwan a porcupine and deter aggression that could have profoundly negative consequences for Taiwan, China and the world.Mr. Gramm is a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-hyde-smith-guest-oppose-creation-of-unofficial-u-s-consulate-to-the-palestinians-in-jerusalem,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and U.S. Representative Michael Guest, R-Miss., today signed a bicameral joint statement calling on the Biden administration to reverse course on its plan to erode the full and faithful implementation of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995.The Mississippi lawmakers are among more than 80 members of Congress who strongly criticized the administration’s efforts to move the Palestinian Affairs Unit (PAU) out from under the authority of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, and to rename the PAU the “U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs” to serve as an unofficial U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem.Read the joint statement below:“It is alarming that the Biden Administration has opened what amounts to be a separate U.S. diplomatic office to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital.  This decision is wholly inconsistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 that Congress passed into law and has repeatedly reaffirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support over the years.  We strongly supported the Trump Administration’s decision to fully and faithfully implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal and undivided capital of Israel, by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and by closing the U.S. Consulate General for the Palestinians in Jerusalem and merging its functions into the U.S. Embassy’s ‘Palestinian Affairs Unit’ within one diplomatic mission under the authority the U.S. Ambassador to Israel.  The Biden Administration’s disregard for that law, however, undermines our nation’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and signals support for dividing Jerusalem. “Let there be no misunderstanding: this unprecedented arrangement—to turn the Palestinian Affairs Unit into a ‘U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs’ that will no longer report to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel but instead report directly to the State Department in Washington, D.C., and to appoint a Special Envoy to the Palestinians—is an effort to open an unofficial and de facto U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem.  In fact, the Biden Administration admits this decision is one step closer to opening an official U.S. consulate, a plan it refuses to stop pushing despite the Government of Israel’s adamant opposition and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon’s admission to Congress in October 2021 that the United States, under international law, would ‘need to get the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility.’ “The Biden Administration’s decision is wrong and not how America should treat Israel, one of our closest allies in the world.  As sponsors of the Upholding the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Law Act of 2021 to withhold funding for a U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital, we unequivocally oppose the Biden Administration’s decision and will use every tool at our disposal to stop it in the 117th Congress and afterwards.” In all, 34 Senators signed the statement led by U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. and U.S. Representative Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y.  Fifty-five House members also signed the statement."

Then, he blamed energy producers. Now, he is trying to dodge blame for our energy crisis by resorting to a cheap gimmick,” Wicker said. “A gas tax holiday would do next to nothing to relieve the pain Americans are feeling at the pump, which is a direct result of this Administration’s war on American energy. President Biden owns this crisis. He should be calling for more domestic oil and gas production, not more distractions.”"

This proposal goes beyond that and introduces too many unanswered questions about due process and the Second Amendment.”"
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-americans-pay-steep-price-for-biden-agenda,"Last year, as President Biden signed his massive $1.9 trillion “stimulus” bill, he defended it as giving working Americans “a fighting chance.” More than a year later, we are still waiting on that chance at economic recovery. Instead, the President’s spending has given us the worst inflation in 40 years, which is eating up paychecks, savings, and family budgets. Living standards are falling, especially for retirees and those on fixed incomes. Gas prices are through the roof and still rising. And millions of Americans have been forced to take a second job or work extra hours to make ends meet. As former Obama Treasury Secretary Steve Rattner recently said, “We’re all paying the price for overstimulating this economy.”The President has blamed everyone but himself for this crisis he created. At first, he denied that inflation was occurring. He then dismissed it as “transitory.” In December, after finally admitting inflation is real, he said we had reached “the peak of this crisis.” Yet prices still did not let up. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the President quickly tried to shift blame for all our economic pain onto Vladimir Putin, even though inflation long predated the war in Ukraine. Today, Mr. Biden still cannot bring himself to admit his own spending and energy policies are the problem. He insists that his agenda has left “no one behind” and is “changing people’s lives.” His willful blindness is costing us all. Curbing Inflation Will Be PainfulLast month’s inflation reading of 8.6 percent sent shockwaves through our economy. The stock market lost over 800 points in a day, causing more uncertainty for 401ks and savings. In response to this news, the Federal Reserve announced it will raise interest rates by 0.75 percent – the largest increase since 1994. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also signaled an additional 0.75 percent jump could be in store next month. This would undoubtedly cause more economic stress in the near term. Although raising interest rates has always been a last resort, President Biden may have left the Fed with no good options after flooding our economy with reckless spending.Our nation faced a similar inflation crisis in the late 1970s. In the last two years of the Carter presidency, prices were rising by double digits across our economy, with gas prices up 35 percent each year. Some Americans feared the dollar would get so weak they would have to bring bags full of cash to go grocery shopping. Thankfully, we did not reach that point. Inflation was stopped but at a heavy cost. In 1980, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker took the extraordinary step of raising interest rates to 20 percent. This caused a painful economic downturn and hurt job growth, but it ultimately brought inflation down. It was not until 1983, under the Reagan tax cuts, that our economy began a full recovery.Biden Should Focus on Helpful SolutionsPresident Biden should take stock of the damage his policies have caused. If he is serious about giving Americans a “fighting chance,” he needs to work with Republicans to unleash American energy production, which would lower gas prices. He should also lift regulatory burdens on job creators and help Republicans preserve the 2017 tax cuts, which actually increased revenue and which have kept our nation competitive globally. He needs to learn what we know well in Mississippi: that big government is the problem, not the solution."

Additional private sector investment in these institutions would unlock more equity and long-term financial capital for small businesses and individuals in areas with less access to traditional banks or loans. “Small businesses, including those in low-income and minority communities, are a pillar of the economy in Mississippi and across the nation,” Wicker said. “CDFIs support businesses, individuals, and entrepreneurs by providing access to capital and alternatives to predatory loans in low-access areas. I am glad to join my colleagues on this bipartisan measure to create an additional tax credit to support and expand this private-sector investment.” “CDFI investments are a critical source of capital for small business growth in many Mississippi communities and around the country. This bill would create a tax credit structure to attract greater private-sector investments in CDFIs, which would increase their ability to spur more long-term growth in disadvantaged areas,” Hyde-Smith said. Among other provisions, the bill would help to direct support to lenders that focus on underserved communities by creating a CDFI Tax Credit for private sector investors that make equity, equity-equivalent investments, or long-term patient capital available to CDFIs. The bill would benefit CDFIs of all types, including bank CDFIs, credit union CDFIs, venture capital CDFIs, and CDFI loan funds, while providing institutions with the maximum flexibility and financial support they need to increase wealth in low- and moderate-income communities. This legislation has the support of a number of organizations, including Community Development Bankers Association, National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, Community Development Venture Capital Alliance, LISC, Opportunity Finance Network, CDFI Coalition, Inclusiv, and the Enterprise Community Loan Fund.Find the text of S.4418 here and one-page summary of the legislation here."

The legislation, which Wicker helped to write, defines and maps out defense investments and priorities for the years ahead.“Today the Senate Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly passed a forceful proposal that will strengthen our national defense and support our military servicemembers,” Wicker said. “I am appreciative of Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe for shepherding this measure through committee.”“As President Reagan once said, we can safeguard peace only with strength. This year’s NDAA, if enacted, would send a strong signal to nations like China and Russia that the U.S. is serious about our national defense during the most dangerous time since the Cold War. This bill would also help to retain our maritime superiority by boosting our fleet size and strength, while making key investments in emerging defense technologies.”The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a topline figure of $858 billion, surpassing President Biden’s inadequate proposal by $45 billion. The figure is intended to adjust the budget to account for record high inflation while also adding $25 billion more for unfunded requirements.The bill would put forth a 4.6 percent pay raise for Department of Defense employees, a number competitive with the private sector. The measure also would secure a major boost for Navy shipbuilding programming by rejecting President Biden’s long-term plans for the fleet.Among other provisions, the Senate’s defense proposal contains several Wicker priorities, including language that would:The legislation also incorporates provisions Wicker supported that would have a direct impact on Mississippi, including:  Read a full summary of this year’s NDAA here."

The legislation would hold Big Tech platforms accountable for using biased algorithms that covertly alter the way users are able to see emails from political campaigns and take control away from consumers. The senators’ legislation would also require more transparency by revealing the censorship practices used by Big Tech platforms, including Google, to filter certain emails.“It is increasingly clear that Big Tech companies are willing to suppress conservative views and tilt the scale in favor of liberal political campaigns. It’s a direct rebuke to what Americans expect of email providers and violates the basic principles of our political culture,” Wicker said. “I am glad to join my colleagues on a measure that would protect freedom of thought and promote transparency on tech platforms that Americans depend on.”Among other provisions, The Political BIAS Emails Act would prohibit email platforms from using biased algorithms to filter emails from federal political campaigns, unless a user took a proactive action to apply a certain label to that email.The legislation would also bring much more transparency to the practices that large email services use by requiring email services to produce quarterly transparency reports.The senators’ legislation follows the release of a non-partisan study that found during the 2020 election Google’s algorithm marked as spam nearly 70 percent of emails from Republican campaigns compared to only eight percent of emails from Democrat campaigns. The legislation is also sponsored by Sens.

He will be expected to miss votes and committee business this week until he is able to return in person to the Senate.”"
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-urges-democrats-to-abandon-tax-hikes,"President Biden’s tax-and-spend bill is regrettably back on the table. Last December, the President’s plan seemed all but defeated when two Democrat Senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined all Republicans in opposing the bill – with Senator Manchin declaring it “dead.” Yet today, Senator Manchin is once again engaging Democrats on a plan to revive the Biden bill, even as our economy suffers under the weight of Biden-caused inflation. If Democrats pass this tax-and-spend proposal, we can expect even more inflation and economic pain to come.  A Recipe for Recession   Details on the Democrat bill are still emerging, but Senator Manchin has signaled his desire to roll back the Republican-passed tax cuts of 2017, which led to massive economic growth. The West Virginia Senator wants to raise taxes on job creators from 21 percent to 25 percent, making American companies less globally competitive and hurting job creation. He also wants to expand IRS audits on taxpayers, even as millions of Americans are still waiting for their tax refunds. On spending, Democrats are seeking at least $300 billion in taxpayer dollars for their climate agenda while doing nothing to address soaring gas prices.  Given the economic pain we are all feeling, this tax-and-spend bill is an insult to the American people that ignores our most pressing needs. The price of gasoline has doubled under President Biden, with experts predicting we will be paying $6 per gallon by August. Inflation is costing the average family an extra $5,000 per year. Employers are still struggling to find workers. And supply chain problems continue to result in empty shelves. Instead of addressing these problems, Democrats are fixated on tax hikes and socialist spending that would upend any hopes of a recovery. No wonder the President’s approval rating is underwater and 83 percent of Americans rate him poorly on the economy. 2017 Tax Cuts Created Jobs   It is now widely acknowledged that the President’s massive and unnecessary “stimulus” bill last year sparked our current inflation crisis. The results have been felt across our economy. More than 60 percent of small businesses now fear that inflation will drive them out of business, and economic confidence has reached its lowest level since 2009. Indeed, our economy shrank by 1.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, prompting fears of a recession. The last thing we need now is a tax increase.  Despite the President’s missteps, the Republican tax cuts of 2017 remain our biggest economic advantage. These policies, which I helped negotiate, unleashed an economic boom that lasted up until the pandemic. In the first two years of lower tax rates, business investment surged by 9.4 percent. Unemployment dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest in 50 years. Incomes grew, especially among low-income earners and those without high school diplomas. On the whole, 90 percent of workers kept a larger share of their money.  We cannot afford to lose these highly successful tax cuts if we want a real recovery. I hope Senator Manchin takes a step back from these Democrat talks and remembers why he rejected the Biden tax-and-spend plan in the first place. Republicans are committed to protecting tax relief as a bedrock of our post-pandemic economy. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-hyde-smith-act-to-close-illegal-immigrant-catch-release-loopholw,"The Keep Our Communities Safe Act (S.4370) would close the loophole that requires U.S. immigration authorities to release illegal immigrants who have not been accepted for deportation to other countries after being detained for six months. The bill outlines specific situations by which the illegal immigrant can be deported instead of released back into communities around the country.“Illegal immigration is occurring at the highest rate on record. If President Biden will not act to control rampant illegal border crossings, then Congress must do everything possible to deter them from happening,” Wicker said.  “This act would take a critical step toward containing our border crisis by fixing our broken catch-and-release policy and beginning to reestablish the rule of law.”“Under no circumstances should violent criminals be allowed to circumvent our laws and be released back into the United States. This bill is intended to protect our communities by eliminating the loophole known as ‘catch and release’ and ending the exploitation of the law,” Hyde-Smith said.S.4370 would close the “catch and release” loophole that prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from detaining non-removable immigrants beyond the current Supreme Court-mandated six months in these specific situations:“This legislation would close the ‘catch-and-release’ loophole, which puts law abiding citizens, local law enforcement officials and communities at risk,” said U.S. Senator James Inhofe, R-Okla., who introduced the measure.  “Our bill will ensure that illegal aliens who have been found guilty of violent crimes and aggravated felonies are not able to remain in our communities. As the current law stands, an illegal alien with a criminal record is released back into the United States after six months if no other country accepts them for deportation. This bill is a commonsense solution and it’s time for it to become law.”Sens.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-hyde-smith-call-on-doj-to-protect-pro-life-groups-from-violence," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), along with 14 colleagues, today called on U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate and work to prevent violence against pro-life and religious organizations.The Senators issued their call to action because of increased incidences of violence and vandalism against pro-life and religious organizations following the leak of a draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. In late May, a rural Columbus, Miss., church was vandalized with abortion-related messages.“We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats,” the Senators wrote.“The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values,” the Senators wrote.  “We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate.” With a ruling in Dobbs expected soon, the Senators asked the Attorney General to promptly detail his agency’s strategy to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violence and threats of violence against private organizations and individuals who oppose legalized abortion.U.S. Senator Jerry Moran, R-Kan., drafted the letter, which was also signed by Senators Steve Daines, R-Mont., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, John Boozman, R-Ark., Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, James Risch, R-Idaho, Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, John Thune, R-S.D., James Lankford, R-Okla., and Mike Braun, R-Ind.The National Right to Life Committee, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Family Research Council, Catholic Vote, March for Life, Students for Life, and Family Policy Alliance support the letter.Read the letter here or below.Dear Attorney General Garland:We write to request information about how the Department of Justice is addressing the disturbing trend of harassment, intimidation, and violence against religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. While churches and crisis pregnancy centers have been vandalized, pro-life offices in Oregon and Wisconsin have been targeted by arsonists. We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats.Last October, the Department of Justice wasted no time in publicly responding to threats of violence against educators and school administrators related to COVID-19 policies. You issued a memo in which you stated, “While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views.” At the same time, the Department created specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators to help “potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.” The Department also took steps to improve coordination between the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and local law enforcement to “open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response.”Yet in comparison to the current climate, in which multiple acts—not just threats—of violence have been documented, we have not seen the commensurate public response from the Department of Justice that the moment demands. The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values. We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate. We are dismayed that the open and public urgency with which the Department of Justice undertook efforts in the name of public safety last year is not being replicated currently to protect religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals. We seek answers to the following questions:1.         What is the Department of Justice’s strategy to prevent violence and threats of violence against private organizations and individuals who oppose legalized abortion?2.         What resources does the Department of Justice need to publicize and implement this strategy successfully?3.         What role has the Department of Justice played in investigating and prosecuting individuals committing violence against pro-life organizations and individuals? The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs is imminent, and thus we ask for a response to these questions by June 10, 2022.  Thank you for your service to our country and your attention to this important matter."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/voter-suppression-in-georgia-was-a-myth,"This time last year, powerful voices across our country told us that Georgia’s election reforms were a brazen attempt to “suppress” the vote. Politicians, CEOs, and media elites all jumped on the bandwagon, with President Biden leading the way. The President called the Georgia law “Jim Crow 2.0.” He accused Republicans of trying “to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections,” and compared them to segregationists. Corporate America also joined in the frenzy. Coca-Cola and Delta condemned the Georgia law, and Major League Baseball pulled the All-Star Game from Atlanta. Perhaps worst of all, Democrats in Congress – insisting that voting rights were at stake – pushed for a federal takeover of our elections and nearly destroyed the Senate filibuster trying to pass it.  These voices have gone strangely silent now that their dire predictions have proved false. Two weeks ago, Georgia held its first election primaries since the new election law took effect, and far from “suppressing” the vote, there was record turnout. Early voting increased nearly threefold from 2018 and more than doubled from 2020, a presidential election year. Minority early voting soared as well, with African-American voters casting over 100,000 more early ballots than in 2018. All of this must have come as a surprise to voters who had been fed misinformation. One elderly African-American woman told the Washington Post, “I had heard that they were going to try to deter us in any way possible. To go in there and vote as easily as I did … I was really thrown back.” Every leader who spread these lies about the Georgia law owes an apology to the American people.  It Should Be Easy to Vote, Hard to CheatGeorgia lawmakers crafted their new election law to address confusion and controversy around the 2020 election. Their reforms, enacted last year in the Election Integrity Act, were designed to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. Far from raising barriers to the ballet box, the law expanded the window for early voting, allowed no excuse mail-in voting to continue, and added 100 new ballot drop boxes. It also allowed voters to get a government-issued ID for free. These reforms were eminently modest, yet critics apparently did not bother to read the bill.  Democrats Needlessly Threatened SenateI recall sitting in a Rules Committee hearing last year when Washington Democrats repeated the same misinformation about the Georgia law. In response to it, they tried to impose a dramatic overhaul of our election system from Washington. Their proposal, H.R. 1, would have made voting less secure and caused confusion at the polls, including in Mississippi. Among its worst provisions, the Democrat bill would have forced states to hold automatic voter registration, Election Day registration, and online registration – creating lower barriers to fraud. It would have abolished voter ID requirements, which are popular nationwide. And it would have required states to allow ballot harvesting – an unseemly practice in which paid operatives can round up ballots from voters and deliver them to the polls, raising the possibility of mischief. This legislation sailed through the Democrat-run House and was blocked only when Democrat Senator Joe Manchin joined all 50 Senate Republicans in opposing it.Now that these claims of voter suppression have been proven false, I hope my Democrat colleagues will send H.R. 1 to the shredder. This sort of extreme legislation, driven by fast-moving lies and rumors, shows exactly why the Senate should remain a place of careful deliberation and consensus building."

""I am pleased that President Biden has recognized this and nominated Bill Renick to serve on the TVA Board of Directors. Bill has a proven record of serving our state first in public office and then as a business and economic development leader. I look forward to the EPW Committee’s consideration of his nomination and working with him as he looks to bring a Mississippi perspective to TVA.""“I’m pleased the President has nominated Bill Renick to serve on the TVA Board, which would restore Mississippi representation on this important body.  I look forward to the confirmation process and believe Bill’s experience, aptitude, and extensive record of service to Mississippi will serve the TVA and its customers well,” Hyde-Smith said."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-hyde-smith-join-colleagues-to-defend-use-of-crop-protection-products,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., stood up for the continued use of Glyphosate and other critical crop protection products in a letter addressed to President Biden.Senator Roger Marshall, M.D., R-Kan., led the letter, which was also signed by Senator Thom Tillis, R-N.C. It emphasizes how the Biden administration, through multiple agencies, is hindering the use of Glyphosate and other similar substances, which are important tools for farmers and ranchers.“Your Administration has taken an interagency, blanket posture of denying or limiting access to critical crop protection tools, even during times of record inflation, rising food prices, and global food insecurity,” the Senators wrote. “We ask that you direct all levels of your administration to work hand in glove with farmers as they work through supply chain challenges. This includes directing your DOJ, EPA, and USDA to ensure farmers have meaningful access to the tools they use to feed the world.”The Senators argue that the administration’s decisions appear to be based more on politics than science.  The Senators cite a recent Biden administration filing that urges the Supreme Court not to take up a case regarding the use of Glyphosate.  The administration’s brief argues that federal pesticide registration and labeling requirements do not prevent states from imposing additional labeling requirements even though the science surrounding the substance remains unchanged.“It should be noted, DOJ’s recommendation undermines the science and responsible use of this pesticide. For more than 40 years, leading health and safety regulators around the world, including the EPA under both parties, have repeatedly concluded glyphosate is not carcinogenic. In fact, the DOJ brief makes multiple references to EPA’s safety conclusions regarding the tool,” the Senators wrote.See the full letter here or read the letter text below.Dear President Biden:We write today with serious concerns regarding the direction your Administration has taken with respect to crop protection tools. Your Administration has taken an interagency, blanket posture of denying or limiting access to critical crop protection tools, even during times of record inflation, rising food prices, and global food insecurity.The latest example of this occurred as recently as May 10, 2022, when the U.S. Solicitor General (USG) reversed a long-held view on federal preemption, siding with the Plaintiffs Bar on the impending glyphosate litigation and recommending the Supreme Court of the Unites States not hear the case about the safe use of glyphosate - a product American farmers use on roughly 40% of acreage that enables more than $50B of US crop production annually. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even maintains the science on glyphosate remains unchanged. Therefore we are left to wonder if this decision to allow states to utilize unscientific, anti-pesticide scare tactics on labeling is solely a political decision in order to appease progressive activist groups who are not concerned about where their food comes from or how much it costs. As such, we ask that you direct the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reverse its recommendation and defend the product, as consistent with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act requirements on misbranding.It should be noted, DOJ’s recommendation undermines the science and responsible use of this pesticide. For more than 40 years, leading health and safety regulators around the world, including the EPA under both parties, have repeatedly concluded glyphosate is not carcinogenic. In fact, the DOJ brief makes multiple references to EPA’s safety conclusions regarding the tool.Your administration, specifically the EPA, pledged to uphold scientific integrity. However now, EPA only chooses to invoke science when convenient, and uses the courts as a shield to not appear to be at odds with the agricultural industry on pesticide polices. For instance, Administrator Regan keeps pointing to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to its decision to revoke all food tolerances for Chlorpyrifos in August of 2021.  However, the court clearly gave EPA an option to retain 11 safe uses of the product— a point the Administrator himself is either unaware of or likes to ignore when talking to farmers about this issue.Recently, EPA also announced a new additional step in the process for evaluating and registering new active ingredients (AIs) through the Endangered Species Act (ESA). EPA will now evaluate the potential effects of the AI and initiate an ESA consultation with the U.S Fish and Wildlife Services, as appropriate, before registration. A calculation which will add months to the already tedious pesticide registration process. EPA claims this is in efforts to mitigate legal risks, yet it will inevitably have a detrimental impact to U.S. food prices.On the same day as this announcement, the EPA announced the renewal of registrations for Enlist One and Enlist Duo using this new process. Enlist is a critical crop protection tool that many producers rely on. At first blush, this was a welcome announcement. However, hidden in the fine print were county-wide prohibitions on the product that came after many farmers already invested in the seed and the product.Dicamba is another major crop protection tool for U.S. soybean and cotton farmers. On December 21, 2021, EPA put out an unrequired, not mandated report tallying up the “increased number of drift complaints” of Dicamba from last growing season. This could only be interpreted as an attempt to build a record to justify abandoning or restricting the current label in future growing seasons.These are several examples of political decisions your Administration is making to appease unelected activists instead of lowering food prices for Americans. It is a reoccurring theme attempting to placate both constituencies, and it needs to stop here. Access to safe, effective pesticides is vital for allowing farmers to continue to efficiently and sustainably feed, clothe, and fuel the world. Crop protection products like the ones listed above are the key to make no-till farming practical and efficient at a commercial level. They are the reason the government can discuss farmers sequestering the carbon produced by other industries in the U.S. If these tools are not available, farmers will be forced to revert to full tillage methods, which would ultimately set yields and conservation efforts back decades. The bottom line is, pesticides are necessary to continue an efficient, economical, and sustainable system of food, fiber, and biofuels production. Importantly for your administration, they are necessary to sequester the carbon released from other industries. To maintain good conservation practices and the benefits they offer, it is important growers can reasonably access and use pesticides.Our farmers and ranchers are charged with delivering global food security under unprecedented circumstances. We ask that you direct all levels of your administration to work hand in glove with farmers as they work through supply chain challenges. This includes directing your DOJ, EPA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure farmers have meaningful access to the tools they use to feed the world."

The lawmakers announced $16 million in second-round AIP funding in May.“Continually improving aviation infrastructure is essential to maintaining the safety, capacity, and capability of airports in our state,” said Wicker. “These investments in airports across Mississippi will help promote economic development, travel, and tourism jobs.”“Airport improvement grants provide pivotal funding that allows Mississippi communities to repair and improve their airport facilities whether they’re major facilities like Medgar Evers or smaller. These facilities represent assets that can support and grow economic development,” Hyde-Smith said.“Air travel and shipping are critical components of Mississippi’s economy to create robust centers of trade and growth.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/6/wicker-hyde-smith-vow-to-vote-to-block-taxpayer-funding-for-abortions,"WASHINGTON– U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., are among 48 Senators who today pledged to vote against any legislation that undermines the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion, or any other pro-life protections.The Senators delivered their unified message in a letter to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.“We write to express our unwavering support for the Hyde Amendment and all other longstanding pro-life protections. For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children.  As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden in Public Law 117-103,” the Senators wrote.The new pledge follows a similar 2021 pledge that ultimately forced President Biden and other pro-abortion lawmakers to drop their efforts to eliminate the Hyde Amendment and other existing pro-life protections from FY2022 appropriations bills (PL.117-103). Unfortunately, Biden’s FY2023 budget request again recommends ending the Hyde Amendment and increasing taxpayer funding for domestic and international abortion services.“We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in Public Law 117-103, and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry. The American people, born and preborn, deserve nothing less,” the Senators concluded.Click here to read the signed letter, which was led by U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), founder and chair of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, and James Lankford, R-Okla.The Susan B.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-guest-welcome-grant-improving-rail-highway-traffic-in-rankin-county,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and U.S. Representative Michael Guest, R-Miss., today welcomed the approval of a $1.5 million Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to help construct a new rail crossing on Highway 18 in Brandon, Mississippi. The project would eliminate an at-grade crossing and replace it with a grade-separated bridge and additional travel lane over the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS).“For far too long, drivers along Highway 18 looking to get to school, the airport, or to work have faced delays because of the current rail crossing in Brandon,” Wicker said. “Improving this crossing will play a key role in reducing congestion, improving safety, and boosting commerce in Rankin County as it continues to grow.”“Steady and projected growth of Brandon and Rankin County requires important infrastructure improvements.  This important project is exciting because it will expand rail and traffic capacity, while boosting safety in a significant way,” Hyde-Smith said.“Rail is a critical piece of Mississippi’s infrastructure, and creating a more modern rail system in Mississippi will help ensure that our economy remains competitive in the years to come,” Guest said. “The announcement of this funding is welcome news, and I applaud my colleagues and our local, state, and federal stakeholders for their efforts to advance this project.”The project is expected to improve travel time for both commuters and KCS operations, while eliminating crashes at the crossing, The project is considered essential, as daily trips in the area are estimated to increase 49 percent and rail traffic by almost 70 percent by 2040."

Raised on a farm near Liberty, Mississippi, the youngest of three children, John had decided to serve his country by enlisting in the U.S. Navy. Shortly after completing boot camp, he arrived at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS West Virginia. It was on that battleship that he would lose his life in the Japanese attack that pulled our nation into World War II.For nearly 80 years, John Melton’s body could not be identified. He was laid to rest at a national memorial cemetery in Hawaii, with a granite headstone marked “Unknown.” Yet thanks to a recent military initiative, John’s remains have now been identified for the first time. Using DNA and dental analysis, scientists have been working to identify the remains of 35 Sailors from the USS West Virginia, bringing a degree of closure for the families. John Melton’s remains will soon be returned home to Mississippi for a final burial this summer.Although John Melton did not live to see it, the attack on Pearl Harbor rallied millions of his own generation to serve our country in uniform. Tragically, many of them never came home. Between 1941 and 1945, our nation lost more than 400,000 servicemen. Remarkably, John’s battleship – the USS West Virginia – would be salvaged, rebuilt, and returned to service by 1944. A new crew would help liberate the Philippines and would eventually reach Tokyo Bay in 1945 for the formal surrender of Japan. As we honor our fallen heroes this Memorial Day, we should remember John Melton, a son of Mississippi, and his crewmates who did not live to see the day of victory and renewed peace.Freedom Is Not FreeThose who died in World War II stand in a long line of Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Beginning with the War of Independence, American service members have risked life and limb on the battlefield to protect our country, reminding us that freedom is never free. Most recently, in the years since 9/11, thousands of Americans have given their lives to protect us from terrorism. As a member of Congress, I have attended the funerals of fallen Mississippians. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid, and we must never forget their families.Supporting Gold Star Families Our nation first began recognizing Gold Star families during World War I, when we lost 116,000 young Americans in Europe. The families of fallen soldiers would often display a gold star service flag in the windows of their homes. In 1936, President Roosevelt signed a law establishing Gold Star Mother’s Day to honor mothers who had lost a son in combat. And in 2010, the Senate set aside April 5 to recognize Gold Star spouses. However, until recently there was no formal recognition for Gold Star children.Last year, I proposed a resolution to designate August 1 as Gold Star Children’s Day. This resolution honors the unique sacrifices borne by the children of fallen service members and encourages all of us to support them however we can. The measure passed the Senate unanimously, giving Gold Star children the recognition they deserve. As we remember our fallen heroes this Memorial Day, it is fitting that we should renew our commitment to caring for their loved ones left behind."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-rosen-fight-for-rural-health-care,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., introduced the bipartisan Specialty Physicians Advancing Rural Care (SPARC) Act with Senator Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., to help address the shortage of physicians in rural communities by creating a student loan repayment program for specialist physicians practicing in those areas.“Rural communities have a chronic shortage of specialty providers, and Congress should do what it can to address the problem,” said Wicker. “The SPARC Act would move the ball forward by offering much-needed student loan relief for physicians and other medical professionals who serve in rural areas.”“Nevada is facing a dire doctor shortage with all 17 of our counties being designated as physician shortage areas – and this is impacting rural counties the most,” said Rosen. “I’m introducing this bipartisan legislation because we need to do more to incentivize specialty physicians and other specialized medical professionals to work in rural areas and underserved communities.”The legislation would help to address a nationwide physician shortage in rural areas, which is projected to increase within the next 12 years as the U.S. population grows, average ages rise, and more physicians retire. Rural areas are historically medically underserved, and over half of the federally designated health professional shortage areas are located in these communities.Among other provisions, the legislation would establish a student loan repayment program for specialty medicine physicians and non-physician specialty health care providers under the Health Resources and Services Administration. Participants in the program would be obligated to serve in a rural area facing a shortage of specialty physicians.This legislation is endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the American Medical Students Association, the Student National Medical Association, the American Urological Association, and the American College of Rheumatology."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-blasts-democrats-posturing-on-soaring-gas-prices,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, today called out national Democrats for their political posturing on soaring gas prices.Wicker’s comments came at a hearing to consider pending legislation, including a bill titled the Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act that would purportedly direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to identify price gouging and manipulation in oil and gas markets. Wicker has been critical of Democrats’ allegations of price gouging, writing a letter in March to the FTC asking the agency to produce evidence of oil market manipulation.“For decades, when gas prices have spiked, the Federal Trade Commission has been asked to identify price gouging or manipulation in the oil and gas market. And each time, the FTC has found nothing,” Wicker said in his opening statement at the hearing.Wicker called the bill nothing more than an attempt to find a scapegoat for soaring gas prices.“Today, with gas prices hitting record highs, instead of reckoning with how the President’s own anti-domestic energy policies are contributing to this crisis, the President is looking for a scapegoat,” Wicker said. “This bill would do just that…[it] would empower the FTC to harass more small businesses and individuals, but it would do nothing to provide relief to the American people.”Watch Senator Wicker’s opening remarks here.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-colleagues-support-finland-and-sweden-nato-applications,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., today joined 80 colleagues in a letter to President Biden urging him to expedite Sweden and Finland’s applications for NATO membership and pledging to work with the Administration to ensure swift ratification of the Washington Treaty.In the letter, the Senators noted that expanding NATO will send a clear message to Russian President Vladimir Putin and authoritarian leaders across the globe that the free world stands ready to bolster the alliance.“As Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has proven, NATO, along with our democratic partners around the world, is more united than ever in opposition to the illegal acts of war waged by President Putin. Expanding NATO to include Finland and Sweden will send a clear message to Vladimir Putin, and any leader that attempts to follow in his path, that the free world stands ready to defend its values and sovereignty. We will also continue to support NATO’s open-door policy, which affirms that new members are welcome to the alliance,” the Senators wrote.The Senators also affirmed their support for Sweden and Finland’s applications as part of the Senate’s constitutional role to advise and consent. The senators also noted this expansion will further strengthen NATO military and diplomatic capabilities to address emerging threats, and extend mutual security assurances to these two governments.“Members of the U.S. Senate take seriously our role in advising and consenting to NATO enlargement, a process that must be approved by all NATO member states. We affirm our support for Sweden and Finland’s applications for membership. In addition, we pledge to work closely with you and with our Senate colleagues to ensure that their applications are swiftly considered and approved by the Senate,” the Senators concluded. “The transatlantic alliance has never been more crucial to global security and stability. The addition of these two important allies to NATO will ensure the alliance’s resilience and readiness, and we look forward to welcoming Sweden and Finland to NATO.”The letter was led by co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C.In addition to Wicker and Hyde-Smith, signers included U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.,  Thomas Carper, D-Del., Christopher Coons, D-Del., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Angus King, I-Maine, Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Jon Tester, D-Mont., Margaret Hassan, D-N.H., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Mike Rounds, R-S.D., John Thune, R-S.D., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., John Hoeven, R-N.D., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Tim Kaine, D-Va., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Cory Booker, D-N.J., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Patty Murray, D-Wash., Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Ed Markey, D-Mass., Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Richard Burr, R-N.C., James Inhofe, R-Okla., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Chares, Schumer, D-N.Y., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Deb.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-palazzo-guest-colleagues-seek-withdrawal-of-who-abortion-guidelines,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and U.S. Representatives Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., and Michael Guest, R-Miss. joined more than 50 lawmakers asking the World Health Organization (WHO) to retract its recent far-reaching guidelines on abortion.In a letter to WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the lawmakers expressed strong opposition to the agency’s updated Abortion Care Guideline, which advocates for abortion on demand, dismisses conscious objections of healthcare providers, and puts pressure on governments to adopt the recommended policies. The updated guidelines follow years of controversy regarding the role, allegiance, and effectiveness of the WHO, an arm of the United Nations.U.S. Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah and U.S. Representative Doug Lamborn, R-Colo. spearheaded the effort.“We, members of the U.S. Congress, write to you today with concerns about the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) dangerous new abortion guidelines. These extreme new guidelines aim to remove all legal and policy safeguards on abortion, impose restrictions on the conscience rights of health workers, and ignore the right to life and the safety of the mother and child,” the lawmakers wrote.The lawmakers criticize the WHO for attempting to dehumanize preborn children, categorizing abortion as “self-care,” and demanding “the full decriminalization of abortion” without any gestational age limits.“To categorize abortions as ‘self-care’ not only strips away the humanity and dignity of a preborn child but also contradicts international standards recognizing the preborn child as a rights-holding person,” the lawmakers continued.The guidance, the lawmakers assert, also dismisses the rights of individuals and institutions that oppose abortions on ethical, moral, personal, or religious grounds.“The W.H.O.’s radical stance reveals that it is all too willing to cave to pressure from the abortion industry and to force health care providers to choose between committing violence against an innocent baby and her mother, or being unemployed,” the lawmakers added.  “This stance also inevitably threatens patient access to health care in geographic areas that are primarily served by faith-based health care providers given that those who hold conscience objections would be deemed unfit for service.”“Given the W.H.O.’s influence, this guidance will likely cause severe, irreversible harm, not only to U.S. citizens but to women and children worldwide,” the lawmakers concluded. “Such overreach and trampling of national sovereignty also further delegitimizes the W.H.O. and U.N. in the eyes of many people around the world.  For these reasons, we ask that the W.H.O. reverse course and retract the anti-life recommendations that it has promoted through the release of its 2022 abortion care guidelines.”The full text of the letter can be found here."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-brace-for-biden-s-summer-of-inflation,"By now we have all experienced sticker shock, the sense of disbelief that prices have risen so incredibly high. This time last year, we were paying $2.70 for a gallon of gas in Mississippi. Today we are paying over $4 per gallon, taking a huge bite out of our budgets. Meanwhile, diesel has hit a national average of $5.57 per gallon, driving up prices for almost anything that moves by rail or truck. Food prices have also shot up. Groceries are up 10 percent from last year, and restaurants are having to raise menu prices or cut portions. In addition, hotel rates have risen 40 percent since last year, and airfares are up 40 percent since January, forcing many to rethink travel plans. It seems we have escaped the pandemic only to be stuck in the mire of a Biden inflation crisis.This out-of-control inflation is starting to slow our economy, causing fears that a recession may be coming. In the first quarter of this year, our gross domestic product shrank by 1.4 percent. We can expect further dips as the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates to fight inflation. As we enter the summer, we are still worlds away from the recovery President Biden promised.Biden’s Plan: Tax and Spend Even MoreThe President and his party should have foreseen these inflationary impacts from their own spending policies. Last year, Republicans warned Democrats that their enormous $1.9 trillion “stimulus” bill would overheat the economy. Yet they did not listen. Even as prices began to soar last fall, the President refused to face reality, saying the inflation was “transitory.” Instead, he led Democrats in trying to pass even more reckless spending. His $3.5 trillion plan was stopped only when Democrat Senator Joe Manchin, out of concern for inflation, joined all 50 Senate Republicans in opposing the bill. If it had passed, inflation would be even worse than it is now.Many on the left are now admitting that Democrat spending stoked inflation. Yet President Biden remains in denial. Recently, he insisted that “government spending more” had no effect on inflation. Instead, he blamed Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which took place 10 months after prices had already been soaring across our economy. He then said the solution is to impose more taxes on job creators. Until the President takes responsibility for this crisis and shifts course, we will all quite literally be paying the price for his mistakes.Biden Continues War on American Energy With record-breaking gas prices, we should be taking full advantage of our abundant domestic energy resources. Unfortunately, the President has continually waged war on American energy. One of his first steps was killing the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have brought Canadian oil to Gulf Coast refineries. He also halted new drilling leases on federal lands and waters, making us more dependent on foreign powers for energy. Now, faced with record gas prices of his own making, Mr. Biden has chosen to drain our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and seek oil from the socialist dictator of Venezuela. Yet he is doing everything in his power to block new drilling permits here in America.The President’s refusal to correct his own missteps is why we are all paying more for gas and basic necessities. This is not the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel we imagined. Americans did not endure two years of COVID just to end up losing our savings to inflation. The President would do us all a favor by doing some soul searching, abandoning his far-left agenda, and working with Republicans to fix our economy. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/yes-we-should-welcome-finland-and-sweden-into-nato,"NATO is reaching a pivotal moment. Vladimir Putin hoped his war would divide and weaken NATO. Instead, our alliance is emerging stronger and more unified than ever before, with the potential of adding Sweden and Finland to the fold.Having just met with NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, I’ve concluded it is clear that welcoming both countries into NATO is in our mutual interest.Momentum for this has been building for months. Shortly after the invasion began, German prime minister Olaf Scholz vowed to increase Germany’s defense spending to 2 percent of GDP in accord with NATO’s requirement. He also announced plans to buy dozens of F-35 aircraft from the United States. In addition, Poland and the Baltic states have led the way in delivering high-end military aid to Ukraine. Other countries like Italy have begun weaning themselves off of Russian energy. And most of the continent has joined a forceful sanctions regime against Moscow.It is fitting that Finland and Sweden should join this momentum. Adding these friends to NATO would bring new and pivotal military capabilities to our alliance.Finland and Sweden, as current non-NATO countries, have built strong national-defense postures in their own right. Finland already spends 2 percent of its GDP on defense, and it has given special focus to building an Arctic-grade navy, which could be critical in denying Russia naval superiority along the Finnish coast. Meanwhile, Sweden has upped its defense spending in recent years and is on pace to reach 2 percent of GDP in the next decade. The Swedish air force is especially formidable and is adept at patrolling the skies near Russia. Both militaries could seamlessly integrate into the NATO alliance, helping to deter Russian threats.NATO would also benefit from the unique geography of Finland and Sweden. Positioned on NATO’s northern front, these countries could offer direct support to the Baltics, which are constantly being challenged by Russian intimidation tactics. They could also help counter Russian ambitions in its nuclear-armed enclave of Kaliningrad and in the Baltic Sea, effectively making it a floating center of operations for the NATO fleet.Finland’s close proximity to Russia would also enhance NATO’s intelligence-gathering. NATO allies have powerful intelligence-sharing tools, and assets placed in Finland could keep a close watch on Russia’s Sixth Army, stationed in nearby St. Petersburg. Intelligence-sharing and U.S. satellite surveillance ahead of Russia’s invasion were decisive in shaping the early course of the war. Additional help from Nordic allies would do the same in future conflicts.Welcoming these allies into NATO would surely energize the alliance. This is the overwhelming consensus of our NATO partners, and those who have expressed misgivings may still be pliable through shrewd diplomacy. After meeting with both the Swedish and Finnish ambassadors last month, I can say with confidence that they are working to bring aboard all 30 NATO allies in their membership efforts.The United States has an additional interest in this outcome given our strategic competition with China. With NATO shifting more resources eastward, Finland and Sweden would bring a wide reach that could relieve stress from U.S. forces and allow for greater focus on the Pacific. Their inclusion in NATO could also help push Chinese telecom initiatives — like Huawei — out of Europe, removing a threat to European data security. Ericsson and Nokia, two telecom giants from Sweden and Finland, respectively, could offer a secure alternative to facilitate regional security partnerships for years to come.On the eve of our joining NATO in 1949, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, the architect of the alliance, called it “the most sensible, powerful, practicable, and economical step the United States can now take in the realistic interest of its own security.”Today, just as in 1949, our foreign policy should serve the practical interests of the American people. Opening NATO to Finland and Sweden would help deter future conflict with Russia and serve our strategic interests in the world. We should approve their membership without delay.Read the article in National Review here."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-colleagues-introduce-measure-to-uphold-inter-american-democratic-charter,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., today joined colleagues in introducing the Upholding the Inter-American Democratic Charter Act of 2022. Co-sponsored by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Senator Bill Cassidy, R-La., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Ben Cardin, D-Md., in advance of the Ninth Summit of the Americas—scheduled to take place in Los Angeles next month—the new bipartisan legislation proposes a series of initiatives to strengthen the United States’ cooperation with the Organization of American States (OAS).Among these initiatives is programming alongside and member states to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which also addresses ongoing and emerging threats to democratic governance in the hemisphere, corruption, and disinformation.“The Americas are a cornerstone of our national security, economic prosperity, and collective commitment to the rule of law,” Senator Wicker said. “Deepening regional ties at the Organization of American States through this legislation would prove an important step in securing a better future for our hemisphere.”“While important progress has been made to advance good governance and the rule of law since the signing of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we must recognize the fact that the Western Hemisphere is not immune to the current wave of democratic decline and creeping authoritarianism facing the world. From Havana to Caracas, Managua to San Salvador, now is the time to bolster the United States’ diplomatic strategy to help confront challenges that are threatening the underpinnings of the Charter’s norms and principles,” said Chairman Menendez. “To that end, I am proud to be joined by my colleagues today in introducing this critical legislation to advance regional efforts in coordination with the OAS to confront democratic backsliding and threats to free and open society, and to affirm the United States’ leadership as a champion of the shared democratic values enshrined in the Charter.” Among its key provisions, the legislation would: "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-colleagues-combat-baby-formula-shortage,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss. joined Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Bill Cassidy, M.D., R-La. in introducing the Fixing Our Regulatory Mayhem Upsetting Little Americans (FORMULA) Act. This legislation is aimed at combating domestic baby formula shortages and bolstering the supply chain to help American families feed their babies.“Parents are struggling to feed their newborns because baby formula has disappeared from the shelves,” Wicker said. “Congress needs to act quickly to address this problem. I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that would provide relief and allow more product to reach the market.”“American babies are going hungry and the federal government is standing in the way. Current policies, tariffs, quotas, bans, and regulations are preventing mothers and fathers from being able to make the best choices to feed their babies. My FORMULA Act will give these families relief during this unprecedented shortage. Congress needs to pass this bill immediately to protect American babies from going hungry,” Lee, the lead sponsor of the measure, said.The FORMULA Act would target supply chain disruption by temporarily waiving trade barriers like tariffs and quotas on importation that reduce the supply and increase the price of available foreign-made formula. The bill would also waive regulations that prevent the importation of safe baby formula from abroad. This would allow American families to access safe and plentiful formula manufactured in Europe and elsewhere during the current shortage. The bill would also allow recipients of the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to use vouchers to purchase formula from any producer rather than be limited to the brand or product listed on specific vouchers, which may be unavailable.The act was introduced following baby formula shortages across the country. Supply chain challenges have caused the out-of-stock rate for formula to triple from six months ago. The shortages come in the immediate aftermath of a recall and temporary closure of a major American formula factory, but highlight systemic weaknesses in this vital supply chain."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-colleagues-urge-president-biden-to-combat-crime,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., today joined colleagues to introduce a resolution calling on the Biden administration to work with Congress to develop a plan to combat the rise in violent crime across the United States and address the crisis at the southern border.The resolution, offered as the nation honors National Police Week, cited the record-setting rise in violent crime across the nation, including a 59 percent increase in murders of police officers in 2021. It also details the effect the ongoing border crisis on crime rates and illegal drug trafficking.The resolution was led by U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D., R-La. In addition to Wicker and Hyde-Smith, cosponsors include Senators Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Martha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., John Hoeven, R-N.D., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., James Lankford, R-Okla., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Tim Scott, R-S.C., Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., John Kennedy, R-La., and Todd Young, R-Ind.Read the resolution here and below:Whereas rising crime, especially violent crime, in the United States poses a threat to the national interest, as well as to the safety and security of individuals, communities, businesses, law enforcement officers, and the rule of law;Whereas, for the purposes of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, violent crimes consist of offenses that involve force or the threat of force, namely—(1) murder and non-negligent manslaughter;(2) forcible rape;(3) robbery; and(4) aggravated assault;Whereas violent crimes are occurring every day in major cities across the United States in part due to progressive prosecutors declining to charge violent offenders and certain bail reform policies allowing dangerous criminals back into society;Whereas released offenders go on to commit more violent crimes and inflict more terror and death on other individuals in the United States;Whereas rising violent crime destroys families and should be combated by criminal justice systems that prosecute the offenders as offenders, and not as victims;Whereas the murder rate in the United States rose 30 percent between 2019 and 2020, the largest single-year increase in more than a century;Whereas there was a 59 percent increase in murders of police officers in 2021;Whereas, as of April 1, 2022, 101 police officers had been shot this year, 17 of whom were killed by gunfire;Whereas at least 16 cities in the United States set murder records in 2021;Whereas organized retail crime threats in 2020 cost retailers an average of $720,000 for every $1,000,000,000 in sales, and 69 percent of retailers surveyed in 2021 had seen an increase in organized retail crime in 2021;Whereas organized retail crime threatens the safety of retail workers as organized crime groups, gangs, and individuals use weapons other than guns, such as mace chemical spray and Taser stun guns, to rob and assault hard-working retail employees;Whereas rising violent crime in the United States can be directly correlated to a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border of the United States and a surge in the sale, distribution, and consumption of illegal drugs;Whereas, in December 2021, 178,840 illegal immigrants were apprehended attempting to cross the United States-Mexico border, the highest total for December in the history of the Department of Homeland Security, and a 142 percent increase from December 2020;Whereas more than 2,500,000 illegal immigrants have been caught attempting to cross the United States-Mexico border since January 2021, with more apprehended in the 3-month period from November 2021 through January 2022 than in all of fiscal year 2020;Whereas 461 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border in December 2021 alone, enough to kill more than 30 percent of the United States population;Whereas drug cartels have overburdened Border Patrol resources by surging illegal immigrants into strategic locations so that the cartels can traffic narcotics and other contraband into the United States undetected;Whereas violent crimes related to illegal immigration and the illegal drug trade must stop for the sake of the sovereignty of the United States and the safety of the people of the United States;Whereas, with overdose deaths at an all-time high, every State is a border State, as the flow of illegal drugs from the United States-Mexico border puts all States at risk regardless of proximity to the border;Whereas securing the southern border and ensuring the safety of citizens of the United States is one of the most important responsibilities of the Federal Government;Whereas the current Administration’s alleged violent crime reduction strategy is actually a gun control strategy and wrongly puts lawful gun owners and dealers at the center of enforcement efforts instead of focusing on the criminals perpetuating violence, insecurity, and fear across the United States;Whereas the same gun violence reduction strategy unfairly puts the blame for gun violence in major, Democrat-run cities and States on neighboring States with lower crime rates; andWhereas violent crimes can only be combated if the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, other law enforcement agencies, and the private sector work together: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should work with Congress to develop and execute a strategy, drawing on the multiple instruments of power and resources of the United States—(1) to counter the rise in violent crime across the country by reinforcing strong criminal justice policies, by laying blame on the perpetrators of violent acts, and by securing the southern border; and(2) to coordinate with Federal, State, and local agencies and authorities to—(A) implement the strategy; and(B) exhort all those agencies and authorities to strengthen their approaches to combat the violent crime epidemic within the country."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-taiwan-should-arm-to-prevent-chinese-invasion,"The war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that dictators take advantage of weakness. President Biden’s threat of economic sanctions clearly failed to prevent Vladimir Putin from invading. Instead, Putin sensed weakness from the President, making his decision to invade easier. The result has been nearly three months of bloodshed, war crimes, and the continued rise of already-high food and gas prices worldwide. These events hold important lessons for Taiwan, another free nation that is facing potential invasion from a hostile neighbor.Taiwan lies just 100 miles off the coast of China and is frequently subject to Chinese threats. Chinese officials insist that Taiwan belongs to them, and they have openly said they are willing to seize it by force. Indeed, many U.S. military officials expect China to invade Taiwan by 2027. This would be disastrous not only for Taiwan but for regional security and our own economy. Unfortunately, Taiwan is not equipped to repel such an invasion. But America could change that by selling them high-tech weapons, making a military invasion too costly for China to stomach.I recently raised this need with Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who leads the Defense Intelligence Agency. He confirmed that Taiwan is taking valuable military lessons from Ukraine and that the U.S. can play an important role in building up Taiwan’s defenses. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am now leading the push for an arms deal with Taiwan to prevent China from launching a new war.  Sell Taiwan Fighter Jets, Missiles, Drones   As a prosperous first-world nation, Taiwan can easily afford the high-end U.S. weapons needed to deter a Chinese invasion. Unfortunately, Taiwan does not spend nearly enough on its own defenses. This will need to change. Taiwan should consider purchasing large amounts of U.S.-made anti-ship missiles, sea mines, aerial drones, and tank-busting drones. They should also upgrade their air and missile defenses with U.S. technology. We are already selling Taiwan F-16 fighter jets, and we should speed up these sales while making older models available sooner. Taiwan can pay for all this by boosting defense spending by $7 billion – a small price to pay to prevent war.  Biden Letting U.S. Navy Fall Behind   Because Taiwan is an island, these weapons would have to be delivered by sea or by air, putting U.S. assets in a highly contested area. Indeed, China now has the world’s largest navy and would like to prevent U.S. ships from entering the region, and especially from arming Taiwan. Making matters worse, the Biden Administration is allowing our Navy to weaken as compared to China. The President’s recent defense budget and 30-year shipbuilding plan would lead to U.S. naval decline, with too few destroyers and amphibious transport ships, which our generals say we need.At a recent hearing, I challenged Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro over these inadequate shipbuilding plans. A strong U.S. Navy is crucial to supporting our allies and delivering any weapons they may buy from us. As Congress prepares to fund the military, I will be pushing for a major boost to Navy shipbuilding along with the sale of high-tech weapons to Taiwan. This could be pivotal in preventing the next great conflict."
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/senators-keep-focus-on-reopening-government-offices," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. this week demanded answers from President Biden’s top personnel heads regarding plans to bring federal workers back to the office.In a letter addressed to the heads of the office of Personnel Management (OPM), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the senators express concern that the agencies have not instituted plans to transition federal workers back into in-person responsibilities.“We are writing to express our concerns about the lack of federal agency work plans to transition federal workers back to in-person operations,” the senators wrote. “We respectfully request that you take effective and safe action to transition federal agencies back to the physical workplace to ensure they can adequately serve the public.”The letter follows legislation the senators filed in February that would direct federal agencies to submit a comprehensive plan for resuming in-person work, titled the RETURN Act. Wicker also led 42 of his colleagues on a similar letter in November citing examples of government task backlog likely worsened by out-of-office operations.The senators’ efforts are in response to complaints from constituents who have been unable to access federal services despite repeated calls from the President and Congress for federal agencies to resume in-person operations.“Many of our constituents, particularly those in rural communities and areas without broadband, lack adequate access to federal services. It is time to reopen all in-person essential services for the benefit of the American public,” the senators wrote. Read the full letter here or below: Dear Director Ahuja, Director Young, and Administrator Carnahan: We are writing to express our concerns about the lack of federal agency work plans to transition federal workers back to in-person operations.  We respectfully request that you take effective and safe action to transition federal agencies back to the physical workplace to ensure they can adequately serve the public.We recognize the vital services that federal workers provide to the American people, and we maintain that the health and safety of those employees are a priority.  The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges that required our nation’s workforce to adapt to slow the spread of the virus.  More than two years later, widespread vaccines, testing, and safety measures have resulted in a dramatic decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths.  As a result, the private sector and schools have reopened and it is time for the federal government to do the same. We also recognize that a transition to the post-reentry work environment involves extensive communication with employees and their union representatives.  We urge that these progress expeditiously.  We were encouraged by the President’s National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan directing federal agencies to resume in-person operations by April 2022.  President Biden reiterated this call for federal agencies to return to normal in his State of the Union address.  However, most agencies have yet to publish their work plans, and many federal employees are still working remotely.  While we appreciate and encourage the federal government providing employee flexibility and increased telework capabilities, the Administration must ensure that these do not undercut the essential, in-person services that federal agencies provide to the public.Over the last year, Members of Congress have repeatedly raised concerns that constituent issues remain unaddressed.  On February 16, 2022, we introduced the RETURN Act to require federal agencies to submit a comprehensive plan to resume in-person operations and address constituents’ concerns about federal government services. President Biden and Congress have repeatedly directed federal agencies to return to in-person work.  Notably, Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-21-25 outlined procedures for the safe return of federal workers and required agencies to submit reentry plans.  Despite these directives, most federal agencies have not complied and published their work plans.  As a result, many of our constituents, particularly those in rural communities and areas without broadband, lack adequate access to federal services.It is time to reopen all in-person essential services for the benefit of the American public. We are grateful for your attention to this important matter. "

Both Berger and Gilday agreed with the directive for 31 amphibious ships.Wicker also stressed to Del Toro the importance of the congressionally mandated 355-ship requirement for the Navy. He further pressed Del Toro on whether the shipbuilding plans he provided – several of which do not meet the 355-ship requirement – take guidance from this statute. Wicker additionally asked Commandant Berger for an update on Force Design 2030, Berger’s project to modernize the Marine Corps.In a second round of questioning, Wicker questioned Del Toro and Gilday on ongoing engineering issues with the Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) platform following the deployment of the USS Sioux City to the Arabian Gulf. Wicker pressed Del Toro and Gilday on the consistency of deploying these ships even as the Navy purports that they potentially present a class-wide issue.“How many ships have this class-wide failure in the ship's engineering plan? And if the failure is that serious, why is it capable of being sent to the Arabian Gulf for serious duty?” Wicker said. “Either it's not reliable and not capable, or it is capable enough to send it to be sent into harm's way.”Watch the exchange regarding the LCS here.Read a recent op-ed by Wicker on shipbuilding issues here. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-palazzo-guest-welcome-15-million-in-aip-grants-for-mississippi-airports," WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and U.S. Representatives Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., and Michael Guest, R-Miss., today welcomed the announcement of more than $15 million in new investments from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for enhancement projects at 29 Mississippi airfields. The grants come from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), including entitlement and appropriated funding.“Local airports are a critical part of our state’s economy. Their maintenance ensures that Mississippi can continue to grow and remain competitive,” Wicker said. “I appreciate the FAA’s work on these projects and all they do to support aviation in Mississippi.”“Local airports, which support jobs and bolster economies, require regular rehabilitation, construction, and safety projects,” said Hyde-Smith, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee.  “These FAA awards will fund targeted projects at airports across Mississippi to improve safety and operate more efficiently.”“Continually improving the aviation infrastructure of Mississippi will aid in expanding tourism, furthering economic development, and ensuring our airports are safe and able to expand with demand,” said Palazzo. “Investments in America’s infrastructure, such as these AIP grants, benefit the local community, the state, and the nation.”“As a Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I’ve spoken with airport officials across the Third Congressional District about the important role airports play in economic development. These grants will help make Mississippi’s economy more competitive as we seek to attract and retain new businesses and investment. I join my colleagues in applauding the FAA for their support,” said Guest.The 29 AIP grants for Mississippi airports include:"
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-raises-importance-of-flood-control-solution-for-the-yazoo-backwater-area-in-hearing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, yesterday in a committee hearing highlighted the ongoing environmental and economic devastation resulting from severe floods in the Mississippi Delta and the need to work quickly to advance a flood control solution.Wicker questioned Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality Brenda Mallory on her assessment of the flooding situation in the South Delta, asking her about her sense of on-the-ground conditions in the Yazoo Backwater Area. The Mississippi senator mentioned the severe economic conditions that could be alleviated by making progress on a flood control solution He further emphasized that the devastating flooding in the South Delta is primarily manmade and that many Delta residents have expressed intense interest in the completion of a project.“The president has made environmental justice central to his environmental and climate agenda, and I understand you've been asked about that earlier,” Wicker said to Mallory. “But would you agree that the statistics that I have read to you argue strongly for looking at this proposed project in terms of environmental justice?”Mallory agreed with Wicker’s assessment of the severity of the flooding in the South Delta, noting that it is indeed a manmade problem. Mallory added that she would like to visit Mississippi again and discuss the project with her colleagues and local stakeholders. She also committed to providing an update on the project’s scheduling by mid-July.The Yazoo Backwater Pumps project is a longstanding priority for Senator Wicker. Wicker has publicly championed a proposal from the Army Corps of Engineers for flood control and relief for the region. This proposal was reversed in November 2021 by the Environmental Protection Agency, prompting a renewed call from Wicker to complete the project.Watch the full committee exchange here.

https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-defends-right-to-life-on-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., yesterday took to the Senate floor to defend unborn life ahead of a Senate vote on extreme abortion-on-demand legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced the legislation after a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicated a majority of the justices may soon overturn Roe v. Wade.Wicker slammed the leak as a “full-blown assault” on the Supreme Court, and criticized the move by Schumer to hold a vote on legislation that would dramatically expand abortion nationwideWicker noted stark differences between the Schumer bill, which would legalize abortion in all 50 states up until birth, and several European countries, which have stricter abortion laws than even Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. The Mississippi senator cited scientific advances as well as shifting public opinion in favor of life as reasons for Democrats to abandon this legislation.Read the full speech as delivered below or watch here.I thank the Senator from Indiana and join him and my other colleagues in decrying the legislation that we will be asked to move to the floor tomorrow.But before I speak on the substance of the bill, it needs to be reiterated why this bill is even before us.The only reason we're debating this bill today is because an extreme and unprecedented breach of protocol took place in the Supreme Court.The leaked draft in the Dobbs case was a full-blown assault on the United States Supreme Court and on the independence of our judiciary.It was an attempt to incite mob- pressure against the justices, which has in part succeeded, by inciting pressure against the justices, in an attempt to bully them into changing their final votes. And I do trust, based on the information we have about the nine justices, is that attempt will not be successful.We saw over the weekend disturbing videos of protesters outside their homes, outside the homes of Supreme Court justices. There's growing concern for the safety of our Supreme Court justices, and the safety of their families.This is shameful, Mr. President. A Supreme Court justice should never have to fear for his or her safety, or the safety of their families for doing their jobs.We, as elected members of the Congress, are subject to public opinion. The Supreme Court is not supposed to be subject to public opinion and should never have to fear for their safety.The leak and the mob- reaction should be condemned by both parties in the strongest possible terms. And yet, there have been very few voices on the other side of the aisle addressing this matter. Certainly, the Majority Leader of the Senate has not said a word about the outrage of the leak, or the mob protests, nor has the President of the United States.What happened to respect and care for our institutions?Instead of protecting the Court, our Democratic friends seem to be, whether inadvertently or not, legitimizing this attack on the Court by moving to consider extreme legislation, which is out of touch with the mainstream of Americans.And so now, let me speak briefly about the legislation. It has been said that this is a mere codification of the Court's holding in Roe v. Wade.That is, in fact, not the case. Instead, the bill that we will be asked to move to the floor tomorrow is an attempt to expand abortion dramatically across this county, to expand abortion in a way that only a small handful of the most repressive governments on the face of the Earth permit.The bill would eliminate even the most modest protections for unborn children across all 50 states. It would force all 50 states to allow gruesome late-term abortions, that even the political left all over Europe have long ago outlawed.As my friend from Indiana said earlier, some 47 European countries generally ban abortion after the first 15 weeks. Banning abortion after 14 weeks are our allies of France and Spain. Banning abortion after 13 weeks, Finland. Banning abortion after 12 weeks: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland. Certainly not governments that are thought of as prisoners of the extreme right.The nation of Portugal generally bans abortion after 10 weeks. Of course, as we know, the Mississippi law that brought this case to the Supreme Court, the Dobbs case, has a slightly more permissive provision than even these friends that I just mentioned from Western Europe. It would be a 15-week ban.But what this bill that we were asked to vote on tomorrow, and which will certainly fail, would do is push America further outside of the global mainstream than we already are. And we already are way outside this mainstream.Because of scientific advances, we know that an unborn child’s heartbeat begins at six weeks. We know a child can feel pain as early as 20 weeks.Many of us, including my wife and I, have put the sonograms of our grandchildren, have displayed them on our refrigerators in our homes. What we know about the development of children, their faces, their eyelashes, has brought about a change in the minds of many Americans.In 1996, 56 percent of Americans called themselves pro-choice. Only 33% said they were pro-life.But because of science, and because of those sonograms, and because of what we know about their ability to feel pain, their movements, their eyes blinking, their eyelashes – today, the two sides are just about evenly split, pro-choice and pro-life.But even those who identify themselves as pro-choice are deeply opposed to late term abortions. And make no mistake about it, if somehow the Schumer bill tomorrow were to pass, late-term abortions would be legal in all 50 states. 81% of Americans think late term abortions should be illegal.Our friends on the Democratic side should think about that.This bill goes against 81% of American public opinion in that regard. 65% say abortion should be illegal in the second trimester. Not the third trimester. In the second trimester. 65% of Americans.I hope our Democratic friends across the aisle think about that before they vote for this extreme piece of legislation, brought by the Democratic leader, which would put us in league with the People's Republic of China, with all of their respect for life. With North Korea, with its deplorable record of respecting human life. With those two countries, and five others on the extreme left. It would put us in league with them.That's not where the American people want us to be, Mr. President. If a state has a 24-hour waiting period, for example, the Schumer bill tomorrow would outlaw that. Taxpayer-funding of abortion. The Hyde Amendment, which prohibits this and has done, so for decades and decades, would be abolished.The parental rights of teenage girls to have a say and to be able to counsel their daughters on the pivotal decision about having an abortion would be eliminated by this.And religious exemptions – a practicing Catholic who deep in their soul understands this to be infanticide, would be required, if they were a physician, to perform an abortion with no religious exemption.Is that what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are hoping for? It's what they would get if the Schumer bill were to pass.Mr. President, this is not a serious attempt at consensus building. This bill simply reflects, regrettably, the iron grip that Planned Parenthood has on one of our major political parties in this country.We will reject this effort tomorrow. I commend my colleagues who intend to stand with the American people, and vote no on this attempt to rank us with the worst regimes on the face of the globe, and impose late-term abortions on the entire country.I yield the floor, Mr. President. "
https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2022/5/wicker-hyde-smith-to-fws-resist-pressure-to-ban-lead-ammo-tackle-on-public-lands,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., today signed a letter encouraging U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams not to cave in to activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands.The letter, led by U.S. Senator Steve Daines, R-Mont., was prompted by growing pressure being put on Williams to ban the use of lead ammunition and tackle, much like the restrictions imposed in the last days of the Obama administration. The Obama administration’s ban was reversed by the Trump administration.“Policies or actions that reduce or limit sportsmen activities necessarily implicate wildlife conservation programs by affecting state agencies’ revenue. Such policies or actions also handcuff wildlife managers by removing a critical conservation tool while needlessly alienating one of our original conservationists, sportsmen. Phasing-out lead ammo and tackle on wildlife refuges would disproportionately affect lower-income households and those that depend on hunting and fishing for their subsistence as lead alternatives are often more expensive. The impact of such a policy would be devastating to the sportsmen heritage in our states,” the Senators wrote.Senators Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., John Boozman, R-Ark., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Richard Burr, R-N.C., Bill Cassidy, M.D., R-La., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., John Hoeven, R-N.D., John Kennedy, R-La., James Lankford, R-Okla., Cynthia Lummis R-Wyo., Roger Marshall, M.D., R-Kan., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, John Thune, R-S.D., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., also signed the letter.Read the letter here."
