https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-democrats-have-ventured-deep-hyperbole-and-hysteria,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today spoke on the Senate floor about Democrats’ attempts at a partisan takeover of our federal elections. A transcript of his speech can be found below and video can be found here.Given the interest in the priority and the importance of elections, it would have been helpful, prior to preparing this legislation for a vote, for those that were the drafters of this legislation actually invited a Republican—any Republican—to sit down and perhaps negotiate and see if we could find some common ground. But instead, the Democrat leadership dusted off what they had written before on an entirely partisan basis, and then are shocked—shocked—that Republicans don’t want to support what they drafted.Now I’d note that political overstatement and hyperbole may be relatively common and they are often excused, but the President and some of my Democratic colleagues have ventured deep into hysteria. Their cataclysmic predictions for failing to support their entirely partisan election reform—worked out entirely by themselves without any input whatsoever from any single person on my side of the aisle—are far beyond the pale.They are entirely right to call out Donald Trump’s “Big Lie” about the last election being stolen. But in the same spirit of honesty, they should not engage in a similar lie that Republicans across the country are making it much harder for minorities to vote, and thus that the federal government must urgently displace centuries of constitutional practice that gives states primary control over elections. So dire are the consequences, they claim, that this must be done by shredding the rules of our senior legislative body.They point to Georgia as evidence of political election villainy. The President went there to deliver his crowning argument. But as has been pointed out by many before me, it is easier for minorities—and everyone else for that matter—to vote in Georgia than it is the President’s home state of Delaware and in Leader Schumer’s home state of New York. In Georgia, there are more days of early voting, and in Georgia there is no-excuse absentee voting, by mail.They do decry Georgia’s prohibition of political activists approaching voters in line with drinks of water. But the same prohibition exists in New York. And why? So that voters don’t get harassed in line by poll activists. Just like Georgia and New York, many states keep poll activists at length from voters.My Democrat colleagues conveniently ignore the fact that the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibition of any voting practice or procedure that discriminates against minorities is still in effect. Even today, the Justice Department is suing two states under that law. Protection of minority voting is already required by law. Protection of minority voting is a high and essential priority for me and for my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle.To be clear, I want an election system that allows every eligible citizen in every state to be able to exercise their right to vote in every single election.So putting aside the hysteria, let me explain why I don’t support the Democrats’ bill.First, their bill weakens voter ID. I, along with the great majority of voters of all races, favor voter photo ID.Their bill makes it easier to cheat by accommodating unmonitored vote collection boxes.Their bill opens the gates to a flood of lawsuits, pre-and-post an election. And it weakens the safeguards of voter registration.There are other things in the Democrats’ bill that I don’t support:I’m not in favor of federal funding for campaigns.I also don’t think that states should be required to allow felons to vote.And most fundamentally, I think by reserving election procedures to the states, the Founders made it more difficult for a would-be authoritarian to change the law for voting in just one place—here in Washington—to keep himself in office.Let me add that I think the Democrats’ bill is insufficiently focused on the real threat—and that is the corruption of the counting of the ballots, the certification of elections, and the Congressional provisions for accepting and counting a slate of electors. This is where the apparent conspirators were focused in their attempt in the last election to subvert democracy and prevent the peaceful transfer of power.Now, I respect Democrats who disagree with my point of view. I hope they will offer me the same respect.People who want voter ID are not racists.People who don’t want federal funding of campaigns aren’t Bull Connor.And people who insist that vote drop boxes be monitored aren’t Jefferson Davis.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-president-biden-has-had-52-weeks-bad-weeks,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today joined NBC’s Meet the Press with Chuck Todd to discuss Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine, voting rights, and the Biden Presidency.A transcript of the interview can be found below, and video can be found here.Chuck Todd: Let me start with the current situation [with Russia and Ukraine]. It looks like talks failed. I guess my question is, I know you’re probably somebody who says don’t give up on diplomacy, but is there a point where we’re rewarding Putin by keeping the talks up?Senator Romney: I think it’s fine to continue to talk, but I think the most important talk we have is with our allies and making sure that Russia understands that if they take action to overthrow the government in Ukraine or to invade Ukraine that there will be consequences of a severe nature. We didn’t do that as effectively as we should have after the invasion by Russia of Georgia, after their prior invasion taking Crimea. They’ve got to understand that there will be extraordinary consequence. And military options are things we don’t talk about, but other consequences we can align with our allies and make sure that the Russians understand that this time it’s going to make a real difference.Todd: What does that look like and why should Putin believe it if he’s somehow made it through all these tough sanctions before and he’s probably calculated, probably correctly, that there isn’t a political will for the U.S. to engage militarily? So, what is it that the U.S. could do that could really convince Putin he should back down?Romney: Well, the clearest thing we can do is to make sure he doesn’t have the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. As you know, that’s a gas pipeline that provides extraordinary wealth to Putin and to Russia. It bypasses Ukraine, and the big mistake we made is to allow him to build that to bypass Ukraine, as we should have. We should let him know that North Stream 2 pipeline is not going to operate. He’s not going to have that wealth if he does any action to overthrow the government in Ukraine, that’s getting shut down. I’d shut it down now, as a matter of fact, a huge error not to have done so already. And then I think the type of sanctions we put in place have to be of a different nature than those we’ve had in the past. And he has to understand that it’s not just the U.S., but it’s Germany and it’s the UK and France and all of the EU are going to come together on a collective basis. Look, we recognize Vladimir Putin wants to reestablish a type of the Soviet Union. [Senator] McCain used to joke that Russia is a gas station parading as a country. No one buys anything from Russia other than military hardware. Their population is what, 1/10 of what China’s is going to be? And so he’s trying to reestablish what he had before. That can’t be allowed to happen. And that’s something we’re going to have to come together and strengthen NATO. He’s trying to take NATO apart—to weaken it. We need a strong NATO not just for Russia, but for the emergence of China.Todd: Look, if he goes into Ukraine, are you supportive of this idea—that we’ve been very public saying we do, which I think is part of the warning shots to Putin—of us supporting an insurgency? Basically, what we did to the Soviets in Afghanistan, and, arguably, what others may have done to us in Afghanistan?Romney: Absolutely. I think he has to understand that the consequences are going to be significant. And will there be insurgency there? Yeah, the Ukraine people are proud, and they know how to fight for the things they believe in and for their independence. And that and other features are going to be affected by virtue of Russia’s malevolent action.Todd: You know, in your opening op-ed as a senator, you wrote that “in order for America to reassume its leadership in world politics, the country had to repair failings in our politics at home.” It was obvious what you were pointing to at the time. Frankly, things look worse than it was when you penned that op-ed in 2019. But I am curious, where do you think we stand? I mean, if you just read the New York Times op-ed page this week, I think there were two columns in civil war, one about “America is coming apart at the seams.” Is that where you are? Where do you think the nation is right now?Romney: Well, there’s no question that the nation is severely divided. President Biden said he was going to try to unite the country. Obviously, as you pointed out in the last segment, his comments in Georgia did not suggest he’s trying to pull us back together again.He’s got to recognize that when he was elected, people were not looking for him to transform America. They were looking to get back to normal. To stop the crazy. And it seems like we’re continuing to see the kinds of policy and promotions that are not accepted by the American people. Look, James Carville just said that, you know, he’s had a bad week but not a bad year. No, no, as a matter of fact, he’s had a bad year. He’s had 52 weeks of bad weeks. I mean, people are 7% poorer now because of Biden inflation. Gasoline prices are, what, 50% higher than they were when he took office. The border is a mess. COVID was resurgent but he didn’t have in place the tests people needed to keep themselves safe. And then of course, there was a disaster in Afghanistan. Russia is now threatening Ukraine. Things are not going well. And the President needs to stop and reset and say what is it he’s trying to accomplish? And if it’s to try and transform America, he is not going to unite us. Bringing us together means finding a way to work on a bipartisan basis. He had one success, the infrastructure bill, and that was done by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate working together. Build on that kind of success.Todd: You know, here’s the thing with that, and this is what the White House would push back on you on, and they would say this, 147 House Republicans basically don’t accept the idea that he won fair and square. You, yourself, thought he had a really tough challenge to bring unity together when you have half the country not believing the results. There are only a handful of you willing to work with him. So, what do you do?Romney: Well, actually, there are a lot more than a handful that are willing to work with the President. We’re willing to work on issues that we care very deeply about. And so, we care, for instance, about family security and making sure that our kids have the resources they need to be able to have a bright future. We care about education. We care about health care. We obviously care about infrastructure. There’s a lot that we can do together. We care about immigration. These are things we can do together. And the President’s been in the Senate. He knows what it’s like and how you have to work on a bipartisan basis. But the idea of saying blow up bipartisanship and just let whosever got the slight majority to do whatever they want, that’s not the right way to get things done in America. And it’s not the way to unite America. Uniting America finds a pathway in bringing people together and working on a collaborative basis.Todd: The President calls you up tomorrow and says, “Senator Romney, I’d like to figure out something on voting rights. Can we sit down and have a conversation?” You heard Jim Clyburn about the Electoral Vote Act. Look, it may not be what some want on the left, but is that a place to begin, and would you participate in that process?Romney: Yeah. And, Chuck, I already am. The group of about 12 senators, Republicans and Democrats, that are working on the Electoral Count Act will continue to work together. Sadly, this election reform bill that the President has been pushing, I never got a call on that from the White House. There was no negotiation bringing Republicans and Democrats together to try and come up with something that would meet bipartisan interest. Sure, we can work together on almost every issue where there’s common ground. I would note on this, that on the bill they put together they want a real dramatic change, which is they feel that instead of elections being run at the state level, they should really be managed and run at the federal level. And recognize the founders didn’t have that vision in mind. They didn’t want an autocrat to be able to pull the lever in one place and change all the election laws. Instead, they spread that out over 50 states, I think in part to keep autocracy from finding its root here in this country. So, we’re going to—we could work together, and I think it’s important to reform the Electoral Count Act to do so.Todd: Look, I understand you don’t want to federalize elections. Are you comfortable with creating, sort of, floors, you know, that you’ve got to offer—that you shouldn’t—take Jim Clyburn’s complaint that basically African Americans spend longer in line than other voters. If you have a state that has that issue, are you for a baseline that says, “Hey, you can’t have those discrepancies. You’ve got to—we’re not going to tell you how to fix that discrepancy. But you have to fix that discrepancy”? That’s what the Voting Rights Act, some believe, is for. Are you in favor of things like that?Romney: Well, the answer is of course, and that’s what exists in the 1965 voting rights legislation. That is still the law of the land. And that is, you cannot have practices which discriminate against people based upon their ethnicity. And that’s why the Justice Department is using that act, actually, as we speak, to go after one state that has apparently, according to the Justice Department, gone across that line. So we have laws that prevent discrimination based upon race and that should be the case. But what I think we have to point out here is that a state like Georgia—which everybody’s talking about because the President went there—it’s easier to vote in Georgia, even under the new legislation, than it is to vote in Delaware, or to vote in New York, or to vote in New Jersey. And no one is saying that “Oh, New York has discriminatory practices.” New York’s practices are more stringent, more difficult to vote there than Georgia. So this is clearly a political play, to appeal to a base in the Democratic Party, and an effort to really work at a bipartisan basis hasn’t happened yet.Todd: Senator, two quick questions before I let you go. Senator Lindsey Graham said he couldn’t support Mitch McConnell if he doesn’t develop a working relationship with Donald Trump. Is that a litmus test that you think is fair?Romney: Oh, I think there’s full support for Mitch McConnell, no question about that. I haven’t heard anything other than a solid support for his continued leadership. People are always trying to placate Donald Trump. I don’t fall in that camp, of course.Todd: And the January 6th Committee, what you’ve seen with its investigation, do you believe what they’re doing is legitimate?Romney: Well, there’s no question but that they are finding things that we didn’t know. And I think that’s appropriate. Look, there was an attack on the United States Capitol. There was an effort to try and prevent the peaceful transfer of power. That’s unacceptable. And we need to understand why there was not a rescue effort launched well before what finally came. And they’re delving into that. I think it’s an important and legitimate effort.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-statement-nord-stream-2-pipeline,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement regarding the Nord Stream 2 pipeline:“If the United States is going to be successful in deterring Putin’s aggression and maintaining peace, we must be united—both at home and with our European allies and partners. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is detrimental to that end—giving Putin more leverage than he already had over Ukraine, making Western Europe more dependent on Russia, and preventing the U.S. from maintaining a united front with our partners. But let us not forget why this all matters: Russia is trying to blackmail Europe while playing a victim. Putin has amassed over a hundred thousand troops at the border of the Ukraine, all the while manipulating Europe’s energy supply. He has done so after a long history of breaking treaties, invasions, illegal annexations, and assassinations.“No country—certainly no adversary—gets to dictate which countries can be part of NATO by employing the threat of military force. It is time for the Administration to take urgent steps to push back against Russian aggression. I stand ready to work with my colleagues to support their efforts, which should include providing aid quickly to Ukraine and taking steps to strengthen NATO’s position in Eastern Europe.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-democrats-conveniently-ignore-their-own-impassioned-defense-filibuster,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today spoke on the Senate floor regarding the Democrats’ radical attempts to remake our governmental institutions by eliminating the Senate filibuster.Romney’s remarks can be found below, and video can be found here.Mr. President, I prepared some remarks to give this evening, but I had the occasion to watch President Biden as he spoke in Georgia just a few minutes ago, and he said quite a number of things that simply weren’t true. He also accused a number of my good and principled colleagues in the Senate of having sinister, even racist inclinations. He charged that voting against his bill allies us with Bull Connor, George Wallace, and Jefferson Davis. So much for unifying the country and working across the aisle. More troubling however, he said that the goal of some Republicans is to “turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion.” And so, President Biden goes down the same tragic road taken by President Trump—casting doubt on the reliability of American elections. This is a sad, sad day. I expected more of President Biden, who came into office with the stated goal of bringing the country together.Our country has defied the odds for a democratic republic; it has survived and thrived for over 200 years. The character of the American people deserves most of the credit for that. But close behind are our vital institutions.Over the last several years, many of us recoiled as foundational American institutions have been repeatedly demeaned: the judiciary was charged with racial bias; the press was called the enemy of the people; justice and intelligence agencies were belittled; public health agencies were dismissed; even our election system was accused of being rigged.The United States Senate is one of our vital democratic institutions, and the power given to the minority in the Senate and the resulting requirement for political consensus are among the Senate’s defining features.Note that in the federal government, empowerment of the minority is established through only one institution: the Senate. The majority decides in the House; the majority decides in the Supreme Court; and the president, of course, is a majority of one. Only in the Senate does the minority restrain the power of the majority.That a minority should be afforded such political power is a critical element of this institution. For a law to pass in the Senate, it must appeal to senators in both parties. This virtually assures that the bill did not originate from the extreme wing of either one, and thus best represents the interests of the broadest swath of Americans. The Senate’s minority empowerment has meant that America’s policies inevitably tack towards the center. As Senator Biden previously affirmed: “At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it’s all about compromise and moderation.”Consider how different the Senate would be without the filibuster. Whenever one party replaced the other as majority, tax and spending priorities would change, safety net programs would change, national security policy could change. Cultural issues would careen from one extreme to the other, creating uncertainty and unpredictability for families, for employers, and for our friends abroad.The need to marshal 60 votes requires compromise and middle ground, it empowers the minority, and it has helped to keep us centered as a nation, fostering the stability and predictability that are essential for investments in people, in capital, and in the future.Abandoning the principle of minority empowerment would fundamentally change a distinct and essential role of the United States Senate. But today’s Democrats, now with the barest of majorities in a 50-50 Senate, conveniently ignore their own impassioned defense of the filibuster when they were in the minority. Let us be clear that those who claim the filibuster is racist know better. For President Obama to make this absurd charge after he himself made a vigorous and extensive defense of the filibuster just a few years ago, is both jarring and deeply disappointing. After all, I don’t recall a single claim from Democrats that employing the filibuster hundreds of times over the years when they were in the minority, was in any way racist.Over the course of my life, I have found that when presented with a matter of personal advantage that would require abandoning principles, the human mind goes to work overtime to rationalize taking that advantage. Only a few months ago, some of my Senate colleagues—Democrat colleagues—rationalized that the Senate couldn’t function and therefore they had to get rid of the 60 vote rule. But then the Senate functioned quite well when it passed the infrastructure bill, armed services legislation, and a bill on innovation. So a few months later, some of these colleagues argued that in order to raise the debt ceiling, the 60 vote rule has to go. Then with bipartisan cooperation the Senate raised the debt ceiling.So now the Democrats’ latest rationalization is that their partisan new election law must be passed. But Democrats have filed these voting bills numerous times over numerous years, always without seeking Republican involvement in drafting them. Anytime legislation is crafted and sponsored exclusively by one party, it is obviously an unserious partisan effort.Let me note two more truths.The country is sharply divided right now. Despite the truth spoken by a number of good people in my party, most Republicans believe Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was fraudulent, stolen by Democrats—that’s almost half the country. Can you imagine the anger that would be ignited if they see Democrats alone rewrite, with no Republican involvement whatsoever, the voting laws of the country? If you want to see division and anger, the Democrats are heading down the right road.There is also a reasonable chance Republicans will win both houses in Congress, and that Donald Trump himself could once again be elected president in 2024. Have Democrats thought what it would mean for them—for the Democrat minority—to have no power whatsoever?And finally, Mr. President, I offer this thought: How absurd is it to claim that to save a democracy, a party that represents barely half the country must trample on the rules of our democracy’s senior institution.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-health-officials-are-scientists-not-politicians,"WASHINGTON—During a Health Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) highlighted the important role scientists play in the fight against COVID, pressed health officials on the Administration’s failure to build testing capacity, and requested data-driven guidance for the American people on when they should be getting tested.Senator Romney’s exchange with Dr. Fauci (NIH), Dr. Walensky (CDC), and HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Ms. Dawn O’Connell can be found below. Video can be found here.Senator Romney: I want to point out how much I personally—and I believe the great majority of the people in our country—respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do. You are scientists, not politicians.Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals and that comes at a high cost, which unfortunately, I fear, will lead some to not want to participate in helping our government make scientific choices. But I very deeply appreciate your commitment to the American people and your desire to do things as well as we possibly know how to do. That doesn’t mean they’ll be done perfectly. That doesn’t mean you won’t make mistakes. That doesn’t mean there won’t be changes from time to time. Sometimes it’s that data comes in that is different than you had anticipated, and sometimes it’s because you were wrong. It’s the nature of being a human being, that’s where we are.I think, unfortunately, the Administration was wrong in not building testing capacity at a time when we all thought COVID was going away. I remember the summer and the fall, going into a drugstore and seeing two rapid tests on the shelf, and those things stayed there for days. No one was interested in buying a rapid test, and apparently the Administration didn’t think it should be aggressively building rapid tests. Omicron came along, caught people by surprise and we were obviously badly mistaken. The Administration was, and we’re suffering in part because of that. Let me ask with regard to Paxlovid. Ms. O’Connell, is that being subject to Warp Speed? My understanding is that Paxlovid is far superior to other oral antivirals. Should we not be much more aggressively producing that and getting that out, such that it can be prescribed?Ms. O’Connell: Thank you, Senator Romney. We’re in active conversations with Pfizer about how to increase their time limits. My understanding, and the scientists on the panel can feel free to jump in, is that the process required in order to generate this particular antiviral is months long. It’s a chemical process; it’s one that is very, very hard to accelerate. What we have been able to do, is to find additional doses, to work with Pfizer to try to unlock additional capacity where they can find it, and we’re continuing to do that actively.Senator Romney: Thank you. Dr. Walensky, good to see you again, and I appreciate the chance we had to speak last week. As I’ve looked on the CDC’s COVID tracker report, I note the data goes through November 20th. I remember my days in business, and if we didn’t have daily information, we couldn’t make good decisions. I wonder, do we need to invest in either developing a new sub-agency or a task force to get basically immediate data, daily data so we know what’s going on? And that’s not just for the public, that’s for those of you who are making those decisions. Do we need to do a much better job moving faster and getting data?Dr. Walensky: Senator, first of all let me thank you for your earlier comments, but also to comment on our COVID data tracker. I think you’re speaking to the 27 jurisdictions that we now compile data that allows those jurisdictions to report together their testing data, their cases data, their immunizations data, their age data, as well as their death data. It’s over two-thirds of the country that we do, and we update that about once a month and it’s about three or four weeks in arrears, so mid-January we will be having data through the end of December. It simply does take that long for our jurisdictions to compile those data. And of course our death data are generally lagging, and it takes a while for those to get reported and adjudicated. So we’re now updating those, and they are about six weeks in arrears and we’re working hard to keep those in real time.Senator Romney: I note retailers, like Zara for instance, apparently get data and correlate it daily, so I’d hope we could find a way to increase the speed with which we get that data. I know my time is up, but I’m just going to make a comment, and that is that I think it would be helpful if people knew when they should get tested, when it’s called for. Because I think a lot of individuals, myself included, get tested when there’s no indication that I need to get tested, other than to just want to make sure I’m not sick. There’s huge demand for tests which are in short supply, in part because of that. And number two, when you say “when people have been exposed,” please let us know what it means to be exposed. We’re in a room right now, I’m sure someone here has Omicron. Are we all exposed, and therefore need to get tested? What does it mean to be ‘exposed,’ and when do we need to get tested? I wanted to ask that of Dr. Fauci, I can’t do that given my time, but those are topics I’d love to have elaborated on. Thank you.Dr. Fauci: Well, the CDC guidelines make that very clear, and it is if you are exposed to an individual with known—if you are in a period of 15 minutes at a time, or a total of 15 minutes over a 24-hour period, in a situation where you come into close contact. Perhaps Dr. Walensky could expand on that, but that’s the fundamental core of the CDC guidelines.Dr. Walensky: That’s exactly right, in terms of the definition of exposure. In terms of who should get tested. You should get tested if you have symptoms of COVID-19. If you do a rapid at-home test and you continue to have symptoms and that test is negative, you should do another test or get a PCR. You should get tested within five days of your exposure, or after five days of your exposure, with the definition Dr. Fauci mentioned. We’re testing through tests-to-stay and other mechanisms as well. So, many reasons to test, but really most importantly if you are exposed, if you have symptoms, and also if you’re going into a setting where you might be seeing an immunocompromised person, somebody who is vulnerable, and not able to take a vaccine.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-statement-anniversary-january-6,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today released the following statement on the anniversary of January 6.“Today, we call to mind the memory of those who were tragically lost on the 6th and in the following days, and we reflect with gratitude on the heroic efforts of those who protected the U.S. Capitol and all of us inside the building. It is because of their courage that Congress ultimately fulfilled its responsibility to count the votes and that the transfer of power continued unimpeded.“We ignore the lessons of January 6 at our own peril. Democracy is fragile; it cannot survive without leaders of integrity and character who care more about the strength of our Republic than about winning the next election. I said last year that the best way we can show respect for voters who are upset is by telling them the truth. The responsibility that elected officials have in this regard is fundamental to reversing the malaise gripping our current politics and ensuring that our democracy endures.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-highlights-progress-infrastructure-china-strategy-and-utah-priorities-2021-year-review,"SALT LAKE CITY—As 2021 comes to a close, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) released a report detailing the policy and constituent services highlights from the past year. Major legislative highlights included passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the enactment of a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games, and passage of Romney’s China strategy amendment in this year’s defense bill. The Romney team also assisted with more than 1,800 constituent casework claims, responded to more than 720,000 pieces of constituent mail, and met with hundreds of constituents and businesses throughout the state. Keep reading for a brief recap of 2021’s highlights:“In Washington, Democrats took control of Congress and the White House. Despite their efforts to push bad policies that would add to our debt and raise taxes, most Senate action this year focused on bipartisan efforts to address some of our long-term challenges. As Democrats pushed a massive multi-trillion dollar package of spending and tax hikes—euphemistically called “Build Back Better”—I started working with a small, bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues on a bipartisan infrastructure bill. While often conflated, these are two drastically different bills.“While Democrats’ BBB legislation called for increased benefits to illegal immigrants, huge tax breaks to blue state millionaires, federal government provided pre-k, and components of the Green New Deal, our bipartisan infrastructure bill provided an historic investment in roads, highways, bridges, power grids, and broadband throughout the country. Importantly, the bipartisan bill will help Utah mitigate wildfires and drought, and accommodate challenges brought on by our state’s rapid growth. The bill also secures funding I fought for to bring running water to Utah Navajos.“This year, Congress ramped up efforts to bring awareness to the rising threat China poses to the global order. I’m pleased that my amendment requiring a grand strategy to address the new era of competition with China was included in this year’s defense bill, which is now law. To shine a light on the grave human rights abuses being carried out by the Chinese Communist Party—including the genocide of the Uyghur people—I called for the U.S. to enact a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The Administration recently announced the diplomatic boycott as official U.S. policy, and several other free nations, including Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and Australia, have followed suit.“I also kept up the fight for other Utah priorities, including securing funding for rural programs, bolstering the role of Hill Air Force Base in our national security, and working to return more local control to our state’s public lands. I met with Utahns from around our state to learn more about challenges they were facing and what my team and I might be able to do to help. Additionally, our outreach and constituent services team provided help to thousands of Utahns seeking federal assistance on COVID relief resources and passport renewals, and sprang into action to help evacuate Utahns and vulnerable Afghan partners out of Afghanistan amid the botched withdrawal.“Just as important as the aforementioned progress, Republicans were also successful in stopping bad policy that would result in higher taxes, more spending and debt, a federal takeover of our election system, the elimination of the filibuster, and the deterioration of some of our country’s core values.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-curtis-announce-reintroduction-bill-advance-popular-bonneville-shoreline-trail,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Representative John Curtis (R-UT) announced the reintroduction of bicameral legislation to enable the construction of high priority sections of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST) to enhance recreation opportunities near Utah’s most urban areas. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act, also supported by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT), Rep. Blake Moore (R-UT), and Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT) will adjust management boundaries to allow the advancement of the BST while also designating nearby U.S. Forest Service land for permanent protection. The BST is planned to eventually connect the Idaho border to Nephi, Utah—stretching over 280 miles. The legal map for the legislation can be found here. Romney and Curtis first introduced the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act last Congress.“The Bonneville Shoreline Trail provides great outdoor recreational opportunities for Utahns, but several wilderness-designated areas along the trail are hampering full use of the trail,” Senator Romney said. “We are reintroducing our legislation to adjust the boundaries of the trail to ensure that construction can be fully completed and Utahns can enjoy its wide range of recreational opportunities for many years to come.”“This legislation balances creating new recreational opportunities with protecting the environment,” Representative Curtis said. “With a rapidly increasing population, Salt Lake and Utah Counties are in need of more widely accessible opportunities to hike, bike, and get outdoors. This legislation will do this is a responsible manner and help pave the way for all Utahns to enjoy this world class trail.”

Statements of Support:“I love your effort to complete the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. As you surely know, the trail is a decades long project with both recreational and historical significance. It has the potential to be both a beautiful recreational asset for Utah residents and a tool for teaching us about ancient Lake Bonneville and Utah’s fascinating geologic history. For the past 30 years, numerous Utah political jurisdictions, businesses, recreational users, and private landowners have played a role in securing portions of the trial. Much remains to be done, but your bill, the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act, is a next step in that process.” – Utah Governor Spencer J. Cox

“The International Mountain Bicycling Association is excited to support the Bonneville Shore Trail Advancement Act reintroduced by Congressman John Curtis (R-UT) and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT). The Senator and Congressman and their offices continue to be staunch supporters of public lands protection through outdoor recreation. This legislation will establish better trail connectivity to create more trails close to home, making mountain biking and trail-based recreation more accessible for communities along Utah’s Wasatch Front. We look forward to working with the Congressman and our partners in Utah on this important legislation.” – David Wiens, Executive Director, International Mountain Bicycling Association

“On behalf of the human powered outdoor recreation community, we write to express our support and gratitude for your efforts to introduce the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act (BSTAA). The BSTAA will help facilitate completion of the multiple-use 280-mile Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST). The proposed boundary adjustments will remove 326.27 acres from Wilderness management across 19 carefully drawn areas, and these adjustments will be offset by the addition of an equal area of new Wilderness protection in Mill Creek Canyon. These adjustments will ensure bicycle access on the BST and allow for work on the trail to proceed using tools impermissible under Wilderness management. In addition to the direct benefits of the trail itself, the BST is a central component for trail planning efforts for jurisdictions across the Wasatch Front.” – Louis Geltman, Policy Director, Outdoor Alliance

“In 2017, Utah’s outdoor recreation economy generated more than $12.3 billion in consumer spending and directly supported more than 100,000 jobs in Utah. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act will help to complete the vision of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail; giving mountain bikers, runners, hikers, equestrians, cross-country skiers—and families—new opportunities to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. We look forward to working with you to advance the legislation through Congress and to achieve the promise of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.” – Bill Lee, Senior Vice President for Policy, Advocacy, and Government Relations, The Trust for Public Land

“Trails Utah is delighted to join forces with Congressman Curtis, IMBA and local organizations in the effort to secure a shared-use future for Northern Utah’s iconic Bonneville Shoreline Trail. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act is needed to maximize recreational opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts—including mountain bikers—along the populous Wasatch Front. The demand for secure access to trails and open space and the need for careful, consistent management is greatest at the wild/urban interface where the BST resides. We are enormously grateful to Congressman John Curtis for his support for this bill and the active lifestyles that Utahns enjoy. We look forward to being a part of the effort to build a sustainable and enjoyable Bonneville Shoreline Trail in the years to come.” – Sarah Bennett, Executive Director, Trails Utah

“The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Committee was formed thirty years ago to promote development of a 280 mile long shared use trail along the urban wildland interface of  the northern Wasatch Front in Utah. However, there are many obstacles in completing the entire envisioned trail which is still only about halfway complete. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act is important to overcome one of those obstacles by adjusting wilderness boundaries so that mountain bikes can use the entire trail as originally envisioned. The Bonneville Shoreline Trail is enjoyed by thousands of trail users every year and the mountain bike community is a large and important user group.” – John Knoblock, Chairperson, Bonneville Shoreline Trail Committee

“The Utah High School Cycling League has nearly 2,000 registered student-athletes and coaches living within ten minutes of the trailheads connecting to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. As a league, our vision is to enable Utah teens to strengthen body, mind and character through the life-long sport of cycling. We have witnessed first hand how mountain biking has strengthened families and communities. The culture of our league and mountain biking in general is one of inclusivity and respect. We fully endorse the efforts of IMBA and other local associations striving to implement the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act.” – Dallen Atack, League Director, Utah High School Cycling League

“The Salt Lake Valley Trail Society enthusiastically supports the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act as an opportunity to provide accessible outdoor recreation for a wide variety of trail users. Hikers, cyclists, families, and adaptive athletes will be sure to be recreating in a more sustainable fashion as the sections of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail facilitated by the Act are built out and authorized for local recreation. Please join us in supporting this bill and the recreation and community-building opportunities that local trails create.” – Kevin Dwyer, Executive Director, Salt Lake Valley Trails SocietyBackground:The Bonneville Shoreline Trail is a popular trail in Utah that will ultimately stretch 280 miles. However, small segments of wilderness designations have prohibited biking on parts of the trail, preventing the full vision multi-use trail connecting dozens of Utah’s communities.The Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act:Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

We should cooperate with the PRC when possible, but we cannot turn a blind eye to the government’s blatant disregard for the human rights of its own citizens.”“I’m proud to join Senator Coons in introducing this bipartisan resolution condemning the egregious human rights violations, including genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang,” said Senator Rubio. “The Trump administration was right to issue a genocide determination and the time is now for the Biden administration to take meaningful action and lead our allies and partners to put an end to these abusers and bring forth accountability and justice for the perpetrators.”“We must speak in one voice against China’s campaign to deprive its Uyghur and other Central Asian and religious minorities of their fundamental rights,” said Senator Markey, Chair of the East Asia Subcommittee. “While President Trump’s pursuit of a trade deal with China reportedly took precedent over his concern for atrocities committed by Beijing, I know that the Biden administration will use every economic and diplomatic tool at its disposal to hold perpetrators to account for their crimes – and rally the world to take similar action. Beijing’s attempts to erase the identity of an entire group, in the 21st Century, will not succeed.”“The Chinese Communist Party continues to pursue repressive and cruel dictatorial rule against people in China, including engaging in genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang,” said Senator Hagerty. “I’m proud to join my colleagues to introduce this bipartisan resolution strongly condemning the CCP-controlled Chinese government for these barbaric actions and demanding an investigation.”“For years, the Chinese government has waged a horrific campaign to forcibly assimilate Uyghur Muslims and eliminate their cultural and religious practices,” said Senator Kaine. “Congress must continue to call out the ongoing abuses in Xinjiang and pressure China about its devastating treatment of other religious and ethnic minorities as well.”“This resolution lends critical support to a simple proposition: that no government, including one as powerful as China’s, should expect impunity when it commits serious human rights violations,” said Sophie Richardson, China Director at Human Rights Watch.Full text of the resolution is available here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-37-colleagues-calling-president-biden-become-first-us-president-officially-recognize,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 36 Senate colleagues in requesting the Biden administration join the U.S. Congress in officially recognizing the Ottoman Empire’s genocide against the Armenian people. To date, no U.S. president has made it U.S. policy to affirm the historical facts of the Armenian Genocide, which lasted from 1915 to 1923 and resulted in the forced deportation of around 2 million Armenians, 1.5 million of whom were brutally killed.“We join the Armenian community in the United States and around the world in honoring the memory of these victims, and we stand firmly against attempts to pretend that this intentional, organized effort to destroy the Armenian people was anything other than a genocide,” the senators wrote in a letter to President Biden. “You have correctly stated that American diplomacy and foreign policy must be rooted in our values, including respect for universal rights. Those values require us to acknowledge the truth and do what we can to prevent future genocides and other crimes against humanity.”Beyond recognizing the facts of the Ottoman Empire’s systematic extermination of Armenians, the senators stressed that the move would rectify the executive branch’s position regarding the Genocide by aligning it with congressional consensus as well as President Biden’s previous remarks.“Administrations of both parties have been silent on the truth of the Armenian Genocide. We urge you to break this pattern of complicity by officially recognizing that the Armenian Genocide was a genocide,” added the senators.Joining Senators Romney and Menendez in signing the letter to President Biden were Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Rob Portman (R-OH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ed Markey (D-MA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jack Reed (D-RI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Gary Peters (D-MI), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Angus King (I-ME), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).Find a copy of the letter here and below.Dear President Biden:We write today to strongly urge you to officially recognize the truth of the Armenian Genocide. In the past you have recognized the Armenian Genocide as genocide, including in your Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day statement during the 2020 campaign. We call on you to do so again as President to make clear that the U.S. government recognizes this terrible truth.From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire systematically sought to eliminate the Armenian population, killing 1.5 million Armenians and driving hundreds of thousands more from their homeland. We join the Armenian community in the United States and around the world in honoring the memory of these victims, and we stand firmly against attempts to pretend that this intentional, organized effort to destroy the Armenian people was anything other than a genocide. You have correctly stated that American diplomacy and foreign policy must be rooted in our values, including respect for universal rights. Those values require us to acknowledge the truth and do what we can to prevent future genocides and other crimes against humanity.In December 2019, after decades of obstruction, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the facts of the Armenian Genocide. The House also overwhelmingly passed its own resolution recognizing the facts of the Armenian Genocide in 2019. We appreciate that in your April 2020 Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day statement you pledged “to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide,” but Congress has already made its position clear. It is time for executive branch to do so as well.As you said in your Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day statement last April, “It is particularly important to speak these words and commemorate this history at a moment when we are reminded daily of the power of truth, and of our shared responsibility to stand against hate — because silence is complicity.” Administrations of both parties have been silent on the truth of the Armenian Genocide.  We urge you to break this pattern of complicity by officially recognizing that the Armenian Genocide was a genocide.Sincerely,Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Spencer Cox, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Brad Wilson and Attorney General Sean Reyes issued the following statement in response to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s announcement of her upcoming visit to Utah to tour Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.
     
“As Utah leaders, we urged the administration to extend the 60-day timeline outlined in President Biden’s Executive Order calling for a review of our national monuments and invited Secretary Haaland to visit Utah to tour the monuments and engage state, local, and tribal leaders. We are encouraged that the administration has extended the deadline for review of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, and we welcome Secretary Haaland’s decision to travel to Utah, tour the monuments in question, and receive meaningful input from the local elected officials and residents. Her trip to Utah will allow her the opportunity to speak with the people who live and work on the lands, whose voices may otherwise go unheard, before making any recommendations to the President. We are also confident that this trip will successfully highlight the need for a permanent legislative solution for determining appropriate boundaries for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, with statutory protections to prevent abuses under the Antiquities Act for the State of Utah. We look forward to continuing our work on these issues with Secretary Haaland after her visit.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

It is also our understanding that key constituencies have yet to be engaged on this initiative. As such, we respectfully urge you to provide state and local governments, the energy, minerals, and agriculture sectors, tribes, sportsmen, and recreationists an equitable and meaningful voice in the process.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-senate-gop-biden-escalating-border-crisis-unlawfully-freezing-border-wall-funding,"WASHINGTON – Amid the rapidly escalating crisis along the southern border, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today was among 40 Republican U.S. senators, led by Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, who sent a letter to GAO Comptroller Gene L. Dodaro highlighting President Biden’s suspension of border wall funding and construction without lawful justification, as required by the Impoundment Control Act.“On January 20th, in one of the first official acts of his presidency, Joseph Biden suspended border wall construction and ordered a freeze of funds provided by Congress for that purpose,” the senators wrote. “In the weeks that followed, operational control of our southern border was compromised and a humanitarian and national security crisis has ensued. The President’s actions directly contributed to this unfortunate, yet entirely avoidable, scenario. They are also a blatant violation of federal law and infringe on Congress’s constitutional power of the purse.

The senators continued, “We write regarding these actions. We believe they violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), as interpreted by your office, and we request your legal opinion on the matter. Prompt action to end these violations is required to restore order at the border.”Due to efforts by the Trump administration to secure the southern border with new infrastructure, illegal crossings in the Yuma Sector decreased by 87 percent from Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) to FY20 in areas with new border wall system. In the Rio Grande Valley Zone 1, an area that did not previously have border infrastructure, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) saw a 79 percent decrease in apprehensions and a 26 percent decrease in narcotics seizures after completion of the border wall. Additionally, in El Paso Zone 14 and 15, CBP saw 60 percent and 81 percent decreases in apprehensions, respectively, when comparing the second half of FY20 to the first half of FY20.Since President Biden’s election in November 2020, CBP numbers have increased significantly. In February 2021, CBP had 100,441 border encounters, amounting to a 39 percent increase from 71,946 encounters in October 2020 and a 173 percent increase from the 36,687 encounters in February 2020 – just one year prior. Additionally, there have been 325,012 border encounters since November 2020, while there were only 220,563 in the four months prior – a 68 percent increase.Currently, CBP is overwhelmed and overcapacity. Reports indicate that nearly all border patrol sectors are above 100 percent capacity, with some sectors double, triple, or even at significantly higher levels of overcapacity.The letter was also signed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), as well as Senators Richard Shelby (R-AL), John Barrasso (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Braun (R-IN), Richard Burr (R-NC), Susan Collins (R-ME), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Hoeven (R-N), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Rick Scott (R-FL), Marco Rubio (R-FL), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN).The full text of the letter is available here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

This legislation develops additional tools to help us understand China’s intent, guards against China’s malign influence, and safeguards our interests.”“The Chinese Communist Party presents an unprecedented threat to not only U.S. values and interests, but also to the free and open international system characterized by individual freedom and the rule of law – something the United States has carefully built over seven decades,” said Senator Risch. “Any legislation that aims to confront this threat must address the full range of challenges posed by the CCP and marshal broad bipartisan support. That is why I am proud to re-introduce the first comprehensive legislative package on competition with the PRC with several colleagues that have strong records on China. We are committed to working with our Democratic colleagues to ensure the United States and its allies and partners are prepared for this competition.”Senator Romney and Ranking Member Risch were joined by Senators Todd Young (R-IN), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Rob Portman (R-OH).Key provisions of the STRATEGIC Act:The STRATEGIC Act was previously introduced in the 116th Congress.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-propose-bill-support-role-agricultural-community-plays-confronting-climate-change,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) in introducing the bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act, legislation to break down barriers to farmers and foresters interested in participating in carbon markets so they can be rewarded for climate-smart practices. The bill has garnered broad, bipartisan support from over 60 leading agricultural and environmental organizations.“The agricultural community has a vital role to play in addressing climate change,” Senator Romney said. “By increasing access to the voluntary carbon credit market, our legislation will help reduce confusion and improve information for farmers and ranchers looking to implement practices that capture carbon, reduce emissions, improve soil health, and empower them in their stewardship of the land. I’m proud to join my colleagues in this effort and look forward to our continued work on the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus.”“As a Main Street entrepreneur and conservationist, I know firsthand that if we want to address our changing climate then we need to facilitate real solutions that our farmers, environmentalists, and industry can all support, which this bill accomplishes by breaking down barriers for farmers and foresters interested in participating in carbon markets so they can be rewarded for climate-smart practices,” said Senator Braun.

“Addressing the climate crisis is one of the most urgent challenges we face and our farmers and foresters are an important part of the solution,” said Senator Stabenow, Chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “The bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act is a win-win for farmers, our economy and for our environment. Our bill is a perfect example of how we can work across the aisle and find common ground to address a critical issue affecting all of us and our future.”“As Americans, we have the ability to come up with climate solutions that can benefit our economy and our way of life,” said Senator Graham. “The United States has long been a leader in innovation. This legislation is an opportunity to put our knowledge and can-do spirit to work to promote business opportunities for the agriculture industry while promoting the protection of our environment.”“Farmers and foresters are seeing firsthand the effects of climate change on their livelihoods, and I’m glad to have them at the table working on solutions,” said Senator Whitehouse. “We will need nature-based solutions like the ones this bill seeks to incentivize in order to rapidly get to net zero emissions, as science tells us we must.”Background:
The Growing Climate Solutions Act creates a certification program at USDA to help solve technical entry barriers that prevent farmer and forest landowner participation in carbon credit markets. These issues – including access to reliable information about markets and access to qualified technical assistance providers and credit protocol verifiers – have limited both landowner participation and the adoption of practices that help reduce the costs of developing carbon credits.To address this, the bill establishes a Greenhouse Gas Technical Assistance Provider and Third-Party Verifier Certification Program through which USDA will be able to provide transparency, legitimacy, and informal endorsement of third-party verifiers and technical service providers that help private landowners generate carbon credits through a variety of agriculture and forestry related practices. The USDA certification program will ensure that these assistance providers have agriculture and forestry expertise, which is lacking in the current marketplace. As part of the program, USDA will administer a new website, which will serve as a “one stop shop” of information and resources for producers and foresters who are interested in participating in carbon markets.Through the program, USDA will help connect landowners to private sector actors who can assist the landowners in implementing the protocols and monetizing the climate value of their sustainable practices. Third party entities, certified under the program, will be able to claim the status of a “USDA Certified” technical assistance provider or verifier. The USDA certification lowers barriers to entry in the credit markets by reducing confusion and improving information for farmers looking to implement practices that capture carbon, reduce emissions, improve soil health, and make operations more sustainable.Today, many third-party groups are developing protocols and testing methods to calculate emissions reduction and sequestration in agriculture and forestry. The landscape is evolving rapidly. The Growing Climate Solutions Act recognizes this fact and provides the Secretary with a robust advisory council composed of agriculture experts, scientists, producers, and others. The advisory council shall advise the Secretary and ensure that the certification program remains relevant, credible, and responsive to the needs of farmers, forest landowners, and carbon market participants alike.Finally, the bill instructs USDA to produce a report to Congress to advise about the further development of this policy area including: barriers to market entry, challenges raised by farmers and forest landowners, market performance, and suggestions on where USDA can make a positive contribution to the further adoption of voluntary carbon sequestration practices in agriculture and forestry.Cosponsoring the Growing Climate Solutions Act include John Boozman (R-AR), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Coons (D-DE), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Angus King (I-ME), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Todd Young (R-IN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), John Hoeven (R-ND), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (R-OR), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY).Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The Department of Interior made an investment of $1.6 billion in deferred maintenance funding for critical projects nationwide, yet Utah, with 67 percent federal landownership, received just $7.3 million. Utah’s project funding award is shockingly low compared to the State’s nearly $81.5 million contribution in federal royalties.As you are aware from your recent visit, nearly two-thirds of Utah is public land; its five National Parks and eight National Monuments span more than 2.2 million acres, and its backlog is sizeable at $225 million. The deferred maintenance award hardly reflects the scope of land, need for funding, or contribution to the federal government. Investments in maintenance backlog are necessary across the country, but to put our award in perspective, just 9.25 percent of the Commonwealth of Virginia is public lands, yet it will receive $247.5 million – more than enough to cover our entire state’s backlog.We request a response explaining the formula used to calculate each state’s award, and the extent to which percent of public lands contributed to the award amount. As the nation’s second highest public lands state by percentile, Utah’s contributions to the federal government and outdoor recreation must more seriously be considered in future deferred maintenance funding allocations.Thank you for consideration. We look forward to your prompt response.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The U.S. and our allies maintain a small number of troops with an outsized ability to prevent the Taliban from providing terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS the ability to train and flourish. Our military presence also helps to buttress the democratic government and its military, foster human rights for women and girls, and hold the Taliban accountable to their promises.

The bill passed the Committee by a voice vote and now awaits consideration by the full Senate.“Under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party, China has made it very clear that their objective is to replace the U.S. as the world’s dominant player – and that they intend to break rules to achieve that goal,” Senator Romney said. “These amendments will help the U.S. craft a clear strategy which encourages the CCP to change their behavior or face meaningful consequences. One of my amendments requires a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in response to China’s ongoing human rights abuses. We must to come together with our allies and the free nations of the world if we are going to be successful in our effort to counter China.”Amendments authored by Senator Romney:Amendment cosponsored with Senator Cruz, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Rubio:Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

We will not participate in an inherently wasteful spending practice that is prone to serious abuse.”“Earmarks are rife with waste and abuse, and they open the door to excessive spending on unnecessary government projects,” Senator Romney said. “I’m proud to join my colleagues in this effort to preserve the ban on earmarks.”The letter was also signed by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mike Braun (R-IN), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Rand Paul (R-KY).Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-sinema-introduce-bill-reduce-student-loan-debt-make-college-more-affordable,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) introduced the Earn to Learn Act, legislation to reduce student loan debt and make college more affordable for students. The bipartisan bill establishes a college matched-savings program that helps qualifying low-income students, including adult learners, pay for tuition, books, fees, and other education-related expenses.“We must do better to ensure American students have the skills and training necessary to pursue good-paying jobs that keep up with our changing economy,” Senator Romney said. “Our legislation will help students pursue their education by equipping them with the financial resources and knowledge they need to attend college, career, and technical schools without the burden of being saddled with debt when they graduate.”“Education was my key to opportunity, and I’m committed to ensuring all Arizona students have the same access to higher education that I did. Creating a college-matched savings program helps Arizona students save for school while teaching the importance of money-management,” Senator Sinema said.

“For nearly a decade, Earn to Learn has been changing the lives of Arizona students who may have thought a college education was financially out of reach. I applaud sponsoring Sens. Sinema and Romney for their efforts to make this innovative program available to students across the country, fostering economic opportunity for low-income American families and helping to break the cycle of multigenerational poverty,” said Kate Hoffman, Earn to Learn founder and CEO.Background:Romney and Sinema’s Earn to Learn Act establishes educational savings accounts to allow students to save for higher education. For every $1 a student contributes, the amount is matched by an additional $8 from the participating state or non-profit. This money will go to the student’s chosen educational institution once the student enrolls. Participating states and non-profits are awarded grants to provide the tuition assistance and financial literacy training. Romney and Sinema also introduced the Earn to Learn Act in the 116th Congress.The legislation is modeled off Arizona’s successful Earn to Learn program, which has a nearly decade-long track record helping underserved and underrepresented students access and complete a college education. Earn to Learn scholars, who must qualify for Pell Grant aid, have a first-year retention rate that approaches 90%, and the majority graduate with little or no student loan debt.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-leads-bipartisan-coalition-introducing-trust-act,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today led his colleagues in introducing the Time to Rescue United States’ Trusts (TRUST) Act, bipartisan and bicameral legislation which would create a process to rescue the endangered federal trust funds and rein in the national debt. Romney initially introduced the legislation last Congress. A one-pager of the legislation is available here.Some of the nation’s most important federal programs are financed through dedicated revenue sources and managed through trust funds. A number of the largest trust funds are heading towards insolvency—made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that four of the major trust funds will exhaust their reserves within the next 11 years. The bipartisan, bicameral TRUST Act would provide a vehicle to address the key structural issues behind the debt and allow Congress to put our major federal programs on a stronger footing.The TRUST Act is cosponsored by: Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Angus King (I-ME), Rob Portman (R-OH), Mark Warner (D-VA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). U.S. Representatives Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Ed Case (D-HI), Scott Peters (D-CA), Jodey Arrington (R-TX), and Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-GA) have introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.“There is broad recognition that we need to address the looming insolvency of our federal trust funds,” Senator Romney said. “Getting our country through the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to borrow trillions of dollars, which has in turn threatened essential programs like Medicare and Social Security. Congress must respond in a way which will address this long-term problem, which is coming down the pike much sooner than was expected. Our TRUST Act is a bipartisan solution which will shore up our federal trust funds and put us on a path toward a stronger fiscal future.”“Future generations of Americans should not be burdened by our poor financial decisions today,” Senator Manchin said. “Generations of irresponsibly cutting taxes combined with spending beyond our means has left the important programs on which we all depend – Medicare, Social Security, highways, and pensions – on the brink of insolvency. We must work to put the federal budget back on track to reflect our priorities while being fiscally responsible. It is past time we got our fiscal house in order, and I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues in reintroducing this legislation to put our budget back on track.”“We need to act now to save programs like Social Security and Medicare. If we don’t, these programs will go bankrupt and America’s safety net will disappear,” said Senator Young. “With the TRUST Act, we can set in motion a bipartisan national plan to finally begin tackling the long-term drivers of our national debt.”“As we work to fuel a full economic recovery from the pandemic for Arizona, we must also plan for sustainable federal spending in the future. Our bipartisan, commonsense bill protects the retirement benefits Arizonans have earned and grows Arizona’s economic opportunities while helping address our nation’s debt,” said Senator Sinema.

“Without responsible action, many of our nation’s trust funds will eventually be depleted. I’m proud to join my colleagues once again to reintroduce the TRUST Act, which provides a path toward commonsense, bipartisan solutions that strengthens these programs and puts them on a solid foundation for years to come. Preserving these trust funds is critical to America’s future,” Senator Capito said.

“Social Security, Medicare, and the Highway Trust Fund fulfill some of our nation’s most pressing needs – healthcare and income for our senior citizens, repairs to our federal highways, care for our disabled citizens, and more,” said Senator King. “At the same time, the federal trusts that fund these programs are on unsteady financial ground; without action, they will become insolvent, and result in drastic benefit cuts, a heavy strain on the federal budget, or both. We can take on this challenge, and secure Social Security, Medicare, and our highways for future generations, if we act now. Every day that we delay, the problem grows larger and more difficult to solve. Now is the time for bipartisan work to secure the long-term financial health of our federal trusts and the vital programs that they fund.”“If left unaddressed by Congress, federal trust funds will cause our nation’s deficit to rise and have detrimental effects on taxpayers, especially seniors,” Senator Portman said. “The TRUST Act takes a critical step in restoring, strengthening, and modernizing these important, yet endangered trust funds.”“Millions of Texans rely on the safety net provided by programs like Social Security and Medicare,” Senator Cornyn said. “We cannot continue to kick the can down the road and must ensure these funds are available for future generations, and this legislation would help ensure the solvency of these critical programs.”“If programs like Medicare and Social Security are not reformed, they will continue down a path toward insolvency, and the benefits our seniors rely on will become unavailable to them,” said Senator Cramer. “The TRUST Act would form bipartisan committees tasked with crafting solutions to consider which would be aimed at fixing these vital programs and ensuring current and future recipients receive the benefits they have earned. We cannot continue to pretend doing nothing is acceptable and this problem will magically go away on its own. Congress needs to act.”“Our national debt and fiscal deficits threaten our position as the world’s economic leader and the U.S. Dollar as the global reserve currency. We can’t stick to the status quo and expect our outlook to get better. I applaud Senator Romney for his leadership to begin righting our fiscal ship when it comes to federal trust funds. We cannot stop here and the bipartisan, bicameral TRUST Act is an important step in the right direction and gives me optimism about our fiscal future,” said Senator Lummis.Support for the TRUST Act:“More than a decade after the Fiscal Commission we co-chaired released common-sense, comprehensive recommendations to fix the debt and to secure our major entitlement programs, those programs still remain in serious financial jeopardy. The Social Security, Medicare, and Highway Trust Funds are all predicted to be insolvent in the next 11 years, triggering deep, across-the-board cuts in benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped the timeline to insolvency and makes solutions even more urgent. While most people in Washington would prefer to burrow – or leave! – their heads in the sand, the TRUST Act would create a truly bipartisan process to save these important programs. We know from personal experience that when Democrats, Republicans, and Independents work together in good faith, they can identify real and lasting solutions: the Fiscal Commission recommendations were supported by 11 of 18 commissioners. We earnestly thank Senators Romney and Manchin, Representatives Gallagher and Case, and other co-sponsors for taking the lead on this important and vital effort. Time is running out to enact critical and thoughtful reforms to appropriately fund our infrastructure and return solvency to Social Security and Medicare.” – Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform

“Senator Romney and these cosponsors deserve immense credit for developing a plan to fix the federal government’s most important trust fund programs, which are headed toward insolvency due to years of neglect. We just can’t wait any longer to fix a problem that leaves all who depend on these programs dangerously vulnerable. The TRUST Act is a sensible, bipartisan and balanced approach that would bring together lawmakers to develop fixes, without pre-baking any of the outcomes. We have known for decades that we must shore up the finances of these critical systems, and the current crisis is a reminder of how being prepared is a must in responsible governing. The TRUST Act would provide much-needed fiscal leadership.” – Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget

“The Senate expressed bipartisan support for the TRUST Act in its recent budget resolution. It’s good to see momentum behind this and other proposals that would help ensure we don’t lose sight of the serious fiscal challenges that lay ahead.” – Michele Stockwell, Executive Director of BPC Action

“This proposal could prompt bipartisan action on key trust fund depletion dates that threaten indiscriminate across-the-board cuts to vital programs within the next 15 years. It is, in effect, a responsible call to repeal and replace the irresponsible ‘do nothing plan.’ Democrats and Republicans may have very different ideas about how to address the shortfalls in these trust funds, but neither party should want to be responsible for the damaging and disruptive consequences of inaction. Time is running out to enact reforms. The TRUST Act is a credible way to get the process started and The Concord Coalition applauds its bipartisan, bicameral leaders.” – Robert L.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-bennet-curtis-garamendi-reintroduce-bipartisan-bicameral-emergency-wildfire-cleanup-bill,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) with Congressmen John Curtis (R-UT) and John Garamendi (D-CA) today introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Making Access to Cleanup Happen (MATCH) Act, legislation to expedite disaster cleanup, save taxpayers money, and prevent further disasters. The MATCH Act was first introduced last Congress.“After seeing the many bureaucratic hurdles communities in Utah and Duchesne counties faced after the wildfires of 2018, Congressman Curtis and I saw a need to streamline the mitigation process,” Senator Romney said. “With more than 126 wildfires burning more than 6,200 acres of land, Utah’s 2021 fire season has already surpassed the five-year average for this time of year. We are proud to continue advocating for leaders in our state by reintroducing this legislation, which would cut through the red tape that local communities face in the aftermath of wildfires to make it easier for them to recover.”“Last year, Colorado faced the three largest wildfires in our history. When communities in Colorado and across the West are knocked off their feet by devastating wildfires, they need a steadfast partner in Washington,” Senator Bennet said. “The Emergency Watershed Protection Program is an essential resource for post-fire recovery, but often Coloradans face challenges with local match requirements and delays in project approval. The bipartisan MATCH Act would remove hurdles to securing funding and help communities act quickly to mitigate damage and protect their watersheds and infrastructure.”“As Utahns know, the impacts of a wildfire do not end when the fire is put out. Without quick action to rehabilitate and restore the land, it is left open to additional damage,” Congressman Curtis said. “While federal cleanup programs have been a significant recovery tool, administrative delays and backlogs too often lead to extra work and unnecessary cost overruns. Communities need the flexibility to begin cleanup activities as soon as possible. To that end, I am proud to introduce the MATCH Act which will allow communities to begin certain rehabilitation activities immediately following a disaster while saving local funds and taxpayer dollars.”“California is experiencing historically devastating wildfires with regularity and a year-long wildfire season. We must take forward-thinking steps to recover from wildfires as quickly as possible to support our communities. The MATCH Act takes critical steps to prioritize wildfire prevention and recovery, and I am proud to support this legislation,” Congressman Garamendi said.Statements of Support:

“Thanks to the ongoing efforts of Sen. Romney and Rep. Curtis, Utah communities affected by wildfires will get the vital resources they need to recover and rebuild quickly. We thank them for this legislation and, as a former mayor, city councilman and county commissioner, for keeping the needs of locals in mind.” – Governor Spencer Cox

“The MATCH Act will eliminate the crippling delay we encountered after the Bald Mountain Fire. Had this been in place during last year’s fire season, we would be better equipped to handle the threats we will face this summer from wildfires. We appreciate Senator Romney and Congressman Curtis for hearing our concern and doing something about it.” – Ty Ellis, Mayor, Elk Ridge

“I appreciate the efforts of Congressman Curtis and Senator Romney in helping local communities recover from the aftermath of a natural disaster. The MATCH Act will greatly assist the city of Woodland Hills in our post-fire mitigation efforts as we prepare for potential flooding, debris flow, and mudslides after the devastating Bald Mt/Pole Creek fires of 2018.” – Kari Malkovich, Woodland Hills City Council Member

“The city council and I greatly appreciate the efforts of Representative Curtis and Senator Romney in sponsoring the MATCH Act. For communities like ours that are vulnerable to the devastation of wildfires, this provides an opportunity to take additional preventative measures, and would speed up the recovery process if a wildfire should occur.” – Troy Walker, Mayor, Draper CityThe MATCH Act will:Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Governor Deidre Henderson, Attorney General Sean Reyes, Senate President Stuart Adams, and Speaker of the House Brad Wilson, issued this statement following Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s visit to Utah to discuss the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.“We appreciate Secretary Haaland’s visit and thank her and her team for taking time to meet with us and with state, local, and tribal leaders as part of the ongoing review of these monuments. During these discussions, we reiterated our desire to find a permanent legislative solution, which we believe is the only path to finally resolving the longstanding dispute over the monuments’ boundaries and management. If the Administration decides to act unilaterally, a legislative solution that provides certainty will be nearly impossible to achieve. And without protections against the Antiquities Act, Utah is left vulnerable to the whim of future presidents. We continue to urge the Administration to work with us to craft a collaborative, consensus plan that reflects the input of the people most directly impacted and ends the political back-and-forth that our communities have been subjected to for more than 25 years.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Our $618 billion proposal was a first offer to the White House designed to open bipartisan negotiations. Our package included the core Covid relief elements of the Biden Administration’s plan, such as providing an identical amount—$160 billion—to support vaccines and testing.  In addition, we later upped our offer to $650 billion to increase the size of the stimulus checks.“The Administration roundly dismissed our effort as wholly inadequate in order to justify its go-it-alone strategy. Fewer than 24 hours after our meeting in the Oval Office, the Senate Democratic Leader began the process of triggering reconciliation which precluded Republican participation and allowed for the package to pass without a single Republican vote.”Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) sent a letter to President Biden on Sunday, January 31, outlining their Covid-19 relief compromise.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-administrations-failure-acknowledge-border-crisis-damning,"WASHINGTON—In response to tough questioning from U.S. Senator Mitt Romney at today’s hearing, Secretary Mayorkas repeatedly dismissed and refused to acknowledge problems with the Administration’s handling of the crisis at the southern border.“What I find astonishing…is that we have the Secretary responsible for securing our border and our immigration system, who doesn’t recognize these charts as being a problem. And there are human beings behind these numbers. And is not saying, ‘Hey we’ve got to make some changes immediately.’ I find that extraordinary and extremely damning,” said Romney.Romney also expressed his deep concerns about cartels taking advantage of overwhelmed border agents, and pushed Mayorkas on whether he would support mandatory E-Verify, which would ensure legal status of employees and help address one of the drivers of illegal immigration.Highlights of Senator Romney’s exchange with Secretary Mayorkas can be found below, and a video of their exchange can be found here.BORDER CRISISSenator Romney: I must admit that I have found this hearing to be stunning in that, it seems Mr. Secretary, that you’re proud of the progress being made by the Administration, that things are going well at the border. I look at this chart that was prepared by Senator Johnson, and I see an extraordinary crisis. I mean, do you recognize this as an alarming crisis?Secretary Mayorkas: Senator, I look at immigration as a challenge that has been persistent for many years.Romney: Of course, but we were running along here, and now, we’re seeing apprehensions at the border that have skyrocketed. And just as alarming, perhaps even more so, is the chart that came from Senator Portman, which is unaccompanied children who are being let into the country at explosive numbers. I mean, is this not a massive failure that would suggest that the Administration needs to take immediate action to remedy what we’re seeing here?Mayorkas: Senator, we have taken immediate action with respect to the unaccompanied children.Romney: Is the number coming down?Mayorkas: We are addressing that challenge with increasing efficiency every single day.Romney: Increasing efficiency to get them moved to other parts of the country and with families and out of these crowded facilities, I understand that. I’m delighted that we’re not having kids sleeping on floors and in cages. But, the number coming into our country and being released into our country is at a skyrocketed level, as is this. The question is, do you have plans to do something dramatically different such that those numbers come down to an acceptable level because as you can imagine this overwhelms our border control agents. I mean, if they’ve got numbers like this they’re dealing with, this means that the drug cartels can be smuggling through drugs because our folks are taking care of kids, they’re taking care of people coming in illegally. Do we have plans to dramatically address what’s happening here?Mayorkas: Two points if I may Senator, both of which are extremely important. The laws of our country provide certain procedures and certain rights for children who arrive unaccompanied and have claims of asylum. Who claim fear of persecution by reason of their membership in a particular social group, so we have an obligation.Romney: I understand that. But we were turning those kids away under Title 42, and the new administration came in and said we won’t turn them away, we’ll let them come in, and I presume as a result of that, the numbers went through the roof.Mayorkas: Senator, we are addressing the numbers consistent with the law under the trafficking…Romney: Well, propose a new law. We have a crisis both for children – I mean you talk about the humanitarian concerns of kids that come here, and I understand, we’ve addressed that. They’re children! Think of them coming here all the way from Honduras. Think of the trial of going across the entire country of Mexico to get here, and then not being able to come into the country. I mean, yeah let’s bring this up, the fact that these kids are coming here making that kind of journey, and they’re not going to be allowed to stay in this country.Mayorkas: Senator, if I may, we’re the United States of America. 90% of these children have a parent or legal guardian in the United States, and they have a claim, a fear of persecution.Romney: So this is not a problem then. Your view is that this is the way it’s going to be.Mayorkas: If I may, Senator. They have a claim under the law for humanitarian relief, either their claim of asylum, or their claim for special immigrant juvenile status. And we can, in fact, meet the challenge.Romney: Yeah. What I find astonishing, Mr. Chairman, is that we have the Secretary responsible for securing our border and our immigration system, who doesn’t recognize these charts as being a problem. And there are human beings behind these numbers. And is not saying, “Hey we’ve got to make some changes immediately.” I find that extraordinary and extremely damning.E-VERIFYRomney: You indicated the last time we were together that you would study E-Verify. Senator Portman and I, among others, have proposed a mandatory E-Verify system in our country. Do you believe that’s a good idea? Florida is using that effectively. Should we have an E-Verify system for our country that is mandatory?Mayorkas: Senator I believe in E-Verify, I think it is an effective tool. Its effectiveness grew under my administration as the Director of USCIS.Romney: Should it be mandatory? So that our businesses are required to check the legal status of people they are hiring?Mayorkas: Whether it should or should not be mandatory is actually something that I have not yet determined.Romney: I’ll look forward to that determination.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-colleagues-urging-potus-stand-israel-and-not-provide-iran-sanctions-relief,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined 43 Republican colleagues, led by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), in urging President Joe Biden to stand with our closest ally in the region, Israel. As Israel is under attack from Iranian-back terrorists, the Biden Administration is negotiating and potentially offering sanctions relief to Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The Senators called on President Biden to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided. The Senators also highlighted that “[t]he United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies.” “Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel,” wrote the senators. “They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel’s capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.”“The United States must not do anything to enrich Israel’s enemies, such as by offering sanctions relief to a regime that seeks to destroy Israel,” continued the senators. “As a longtime friend of the Jewish state, we also urge you to unequivocally support Israel’s right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks.”Joining Romney and Rubio was Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-ID), Senate Committee on Banking Ranking Member Pat Toomey (R-PA), Senate Committee on Armed Services Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-OK), and SFRC Middle East Subcommittee Ranking Member Todd Young (R-IN), as well as Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), James Lankford (R-OK), Steve Daines (R-MT), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Barrasso (R-WY), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Boozman (R-AR), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike  Braun (R-IN), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), John Thune (R-SD), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Hoeven (R-ND), John Kennedy (R-LA), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Mike  Lee (R-UT), Richard Burr (R-NC), Bill  Cassidy (R-LA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa  Murkowski (R-AK), and Rob Portman (R-OH).The full text of the letter is below. Dear Mr. President: We write with regard to the ongoing rocket attacks against Israel by the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas. Over the past couple days, Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, who are funded by Iran, have launched a series of rocket attacks into Israel. They are targeting Israeli civilians and cities, including Israel’s capital Jerusalem. This is troubling as members of your administration are currently in Vienna negotiating with Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. In light of these recent attacks by Hamas against Israel, the United States should take all steps necessary to hold Tehran accountable and under no circumstances, provide sanctions relief to Iran. This is especially important as Iran is supporting terrorist activity against the United States’ closest ally in the region, Israel. As you know, Palestinian terrorist groups launched more than 1,000 rockets targeting Israel over the last few days alone. This includes the first rockets aimed at Jerusalem since 2014. While the United States and countries around the world condemned these rocket attacks, Iran resoundingly supports this aggression.  Shortly after the attacks began, and as they continued, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted that Palestinians should unite to “use the tools of their disposal” to attack Israel, which he recently called not a nation, but a “terrorist garrison.” Even the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, who currently is supervising Iran’s negotiating team in Vienna, called Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh to express Iran’s support for the group’s actions.   The United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization in 1997 and as such, is prohibited from providing any funds to Hamas. Iran, however, is a longtime financial and material supporter of Hamas. The United States engaging in active negotiations with Iran and potentially providing billions of dollars in sanctions relief will no doubt contribute to Iran’s support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations who attack Americans and our allies. We call on you to immediately end negotiations with Iran, and make clear that sanctions relief will not be provided. Doing so would demonstrate a firm commitment to our closest ally in the region and to our own security interests. The United States must not do anything to enrich Israel’s enemies, such as by offering sanctions relief to a regime that seeks to destroy Israel. As a longtime friend of the Jewish state, we also urge you to unequivocally support Israel’s right to defend itself against any and all terrorist attacks. Respectfully,Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-curtis-condemn-attempted-land-grab,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Congressman John Curtis (R-UT) today introduced the bicameral Shawnee Wilderness Area Designation Act of 2021, legislation to lock up 289,000 acres of land in Illinois and make it part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The bill comes in response to legislation introduced by Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) this week that betrays an agreement to designate nearly one million acres in Emery County for multiple use, which was made as part of the Natural Resources Management Act, the public lands package signed into law in 2019. Senator Romney and former Congressman Rob Bishop (R-UT) first introduced the Shawnee Wilderness Area Designation Act last Congress.“Senators in the East shouldn’t be telling people in the West what to do with our land,” Senator Romney said. “If wilderness is so important to Senator Durbin, he doesn’t need to go all the way to Utah to designate it. Our bill would designate the 289,000 acres of national forest in Illinois as wilderness so he can save himself a trip across the country and enjoy the wilderness in his own backyard. So long as Senator Durbin continues to introduce his bill, we will continue to introduce ours.”“Senator Durbin refused to meet with me and has now attempted to lock up land in Utah two Congresses in a row,” Congressman Curtis said. “It is clear the Red Rock Wilderness Act is not serious legislation, but an effort to fundraise off a liberal base that doesn’t know any better. A senator from Illinois should not be bullying rural Utah, especially when he has land back home that needs protection.”Background:
An agreement and compromise made by conservation, recreation, mineral development, ranchers, and elected officials, the Emery County Public Land Management Act resolved a decades-long controversy over federal land designations in Emery County. It designates nearly one million acres in Emery County for multiple use including recreation, conservation, development, and grazing.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-urges-administration-fill-watchdog-vacancies,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined his colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in encouraging President Biden to swiftly fill Inspectors General (IG) vacancies to help safeguard taxpayer dollars and strengthen independent oversight of federal agencies. The letter emphasizes the importance of Senate-confirmed IGs to Congress’ oversight efforts and notes Senate-confirmed IGs are likely to be more independent than those in acting roles.“As the members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we have a duty to conduct oversight of executive branch agencies. Integral to that oversight is the work of inspectors general to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs,” the senators wrote.
        
The senators continued, “There is no substitute for the steadying effect of Senate-confirmed leadership. Although many acting inspectors general have admirably performed their watchdog responsibilities, the lack of a confirmed leader threatens to impede the ability of these offices to conduct the oversight and investigations necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars are protected, public safety risks are identified, and that whistleblowers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse are protected.”IG vacancies are a long-standing issue in the federal government. There are currently thirteen vacancies of presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed IGs. Ten of these vacancies have existed for over a year. The senators’ letter represents a bipartisan commitment from committee members to ensure government works efficiently and effectively by strengthening independent oversight of federal agencies.The letter, led by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Gary Peters (D-MI), was also signed by Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rand Paul (R-KY), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), James Lankford (R-OK), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Alex Padilla (D-CA), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA).The full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Mr. President:We write to urge you to take swift action to address the vacant inspector general positions in the federal government and nominate qualified individuals to these positions.  As members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we have a duty to conduct oversight of executive branch agencies.  Integral to that oversight is the work of inspectors general to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs.There are currently 13 vacant presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, inspector general positions.  These include the inspectors general for the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education; and the Intelligence Community; the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Central Intelligence Agency; the Export-Import Bank; the Federal Communications Commission; the Office of Personnel Management; and the Tennessee Valley Authority.  An additional vacancy exists at the International Trade Commission—an agency-appointed inspector general. Ten of these positions have been vacant for over a year and four positions have been vacant for more than five years.There is no substitute for the steadying effect of Senate-confirmed leadership.  Although many acting inspectors general have admirably performed their watchdog responsibilities, the lack of a confirmed leader threatens to impede the ability of these offices to conduct the oversight and investigations necessary to ensure that taxpayer dollars are protected, public safety risks are identified, and that whistleblowers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse are protected.  In addition, the lack of a confirmed inspector general can create the potential for conflicts of interest and diminish the essential independence of inspectors general.Inspectors general have a dual reporting responsibility—both to the head of their respective agency and to Congress.  Agency heads rely on inspectors general to ensure their agencies are effectively carrying out their duties and serving the American people.  Congress relies on inspectors general to report on notable activity and concerning actions at their respective agencies, and also provide invaluable testimony to Congress on various matters.  This ensures Congress maintains operative and reliable insight into agency actions.As you continue to submit nominations for your administration, we respectfully request that you prioritize nominating inspectors general to fill those vacancies.  We stand ready to work with you and the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to identify and confirm qualified and capable candidates for these positions.We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-support-computer-science-educators,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), announced the re-introduction of their Teacher Education for Computer Science Act (Teach CS) Act. This bipartisan legislation would support teacher training and schools in educating students in the area of computer science. The senators first introduced the bipartisan Teach CS Act last Congress.“We need to make sure our kids have the tools they need to succeed in the 21st century global economy,” said Senator Romney. “Our legislation will strengthen computer science curriculums in Utah and around the country and create more opportunities for students to gain important skills which our changing workforce demands. I appreciate Governor Cox’s commitment to prioritizing computer science for every student in our state, and I’m proud to support similar efforts in the Senate.”“As a former computer programmer, I understand firsthand the value of a STEM education,” said Senator Rosen. “That’s why I’ve made it a priority in Congress to increase access to STEM education to students. But we can’t adequately educate our students without first properly training our educators. I’m re-introducing this bipartisan legislation to provide educators with the professional development they need to teach our students computer science knowledge and skills. I will continue working in Congress to provide Nevada’s educators and students with the resources they need to succeed.”“Addressing America’s shortage of computer science graduates starts with investing in teachers,” said Senator Wicker. “This legislation would make targeted changes to place more qualified computer science instructors in our schools, which would better equip our students to pursue careers in STEM.”“In order to ensure that Granite State students are prepared to compete in the 21st century economy, we must strengthen and expand computer science education,” said Senator Hassan. “This bipartisan bill would do just that by helping provide more educators with the skills to teach students computer science. I am glad to join this effort, and I will continue to work with my colleagues across the aisle on legislation to strengthen opportunities for Granite Staters to secure good-paying jobs.”Background:
The bipartisan, bicameral Teach CS Act would amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) to include computer science education eligibility for multiple teacher preparation grants and graduate fellowships, and authorize a new program for competitive grants for eligible institutions of higher education to establish centers of excellence in teacher education programs for computer science. Representative Derek Kilmer (D-WA) plans to introduce companion bipartisan legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-merkley-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-protect-long-term-health-saline-ecosystems,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced their Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act, bipartisan legislation to facilitate an integrated regional assessment of saline lake ecosystems that would fill a critical data gap that has made it nearly impossible to address a variety of problems caused by declining water levels. Saline lakes line wetlands across the West Coast, serving as habitats for a diverse array of wildlife and providing important economic and social benefits to nearby communities.“The Great Salt Lake is the largest saline lake in the Western Hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. It is also an iconic and cherished part of Utah,” Senator Romney said. “I’m proud to lead this legislation with Senator Merkley, which will establish a scientific foundation and ongoing monitoring system to inform coordinated management and conservation actions for threatened Great Basin saline lake ecosystems and the communities who depend on them. This legislation should complement and help elevate the work already being done by the State of Utah to understand this key resource and the role it plays as part of the larger landscape.”“Our lands and waters—including our saline lakes like Lake Abert and Goose Lake—are integral to the futures of countless animals and migratory birds, as well as Oregonians’ quality of life and livelihoods,” said Senator Merkley. “These ecosystems must be protected, but we can’t do that without sufficient data. So let’s work to secure the studies and science we need to put long-term plans into action, so we can ensure that our saline lakes ecosystem can thrive for generations to come.”“This is a superb bill for the future of the Great Salt Lake and the animals and people who rely on it,” Governor Spencer Cox said. “It would address the economic value associated with the lake and the importance of migratory birds, help fill gaps in science around hydrology, integrate existing work being done on water quality, and assess future water needs. This legislation could be a key to ensuring the viability of the Great Salt Lake far into the future.”“Saline lakes and their wetlands in the arid West sustain millions of migratory birds while also benefitting local communities and their economies,” said Marcelle Shoop, Audubon’s Saline Lakes Program Director. “This science-based legislation comes at such an important time—as we see lakes across the Great Basin drying at an alarming rate. The regional program will build on existing knowledge to help us understand how water supplies and habitats are changing, and identify opportunities where we all can work together on solutions that protect bird habitat and communities. We’re grateful for the leadership of Senator Merkley and Senator Romney in championing this important legislation.”Background:
The Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act would authorize a study by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)—in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and other federal, state, tribal, and local agencies, research universities, non-profit organizations, and other partners—in order to form an action plan for a robust multi-year integrated program to assess, monitor, and conserve saline lake ecosystems. Cosponsors of the legislation include Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-comments-presidents-address-congress,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) released the following statement after President Biden’s address to a joint session of Congress.“It’s hard to live within a budget and much easier to spend money like there’s no tomorrow. Unfortunately, the President has a lot of things he’d like to do, but he’s spending like crazy. In his first 100 days, he has proposed six trillion dollars of new spending. That is a modern record. To put that in context, six trillion dollars is about four times our total federal budget. That is an amazing amount of money, and it has the potential of jeopardizing our kids’ future and burdening them with decades of interest costs.“When you get down to the kinds of policies that unite the country, the President says he wants unity, but it’s impossible to unify America if you’re only appealing to the liberal wing of your own party. So let’s get back to the job of bipartisan governing. I hope he will do that, and we Republicans are ready to work with him.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-introduce-legislation-protect-great-basin-and-mormon-pioneer-national-heritage,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) with Congressmen Steven Horsford (D-NV) and Chris Stewart (R-UT) introduced the Great Basin National Heritage Area and Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area Extension Act. This bicameral, bipartisan legislation would reauthorize federal funding for both National Heritage Areas (NHAs), ensuring their continued ability to promote conservation, expand recreation opportunities, and preserve the unique heritage of the Western United States.
          
“The Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area highlights our rich history and culture. I’m proud to sponsor the effort in the Senate to ensure that these heritage areas continue to impact the lives of our community for many years to come,” said Senator Mitt Romney.“The Great Basin National Heritage Area distinction has brought essential federal funding, tourism dollars, and outdoor recreation opportunities to Nevada,” said Congressman Steven Horsford. “I’m proud to introduce this legislation alongside a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers who understand the importance of maintaining the unique culture and heritage of communities in the Western United States.”“Nevada’s Great Basin National Heritage Area is unique in the Silver State, encompassing stunning Western landscapes, historical and archeological sites, state parks, tribal areas, and Great Basin National Park,” said Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. “This bipartisan legislation will help safeguard this unique part of our nation’s history, and I’m proud to work across the aisle with my colleagues in Utah and Nevada to protect our region’s rich cultural and environmental resources for future generations.”“The Great Basin National Heritage Area is a vast landscape full of parks, wilderness areas, and numerous trails that bring visitors from all over the world to Nevada and Utah,” said Senator Jacky Rosen. “I’m proud to help introduce this important bipartisan legislation to protect these lands and historical sites that not only contribute to our booming outdoor recreation industries, but also hold cultural significance for both our states. I will continue working to safeguard the natural wonder and beauty of Nevada’s public lands and heritage areas for generations to come.”“The Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area is a great means of sharing, preserving, and discovering Utah’s history. I’m proud to work across the aisle and across state lines on this bipartisan legislation that will protect and promote the heritage of both Utah and Nevada,” said Congressman Chris Stewart.“I can’t overstate the impact that the Great Basin National Heritage Area has had on our small, rural communities. The federal seed money enables heritage area partners to establish and grow programs that then become self-sustaining and provides volunteer opportunities for teens, seniors, and everyone in between. Since designation, we’ve helped dozens of partners complete scores of projects that have benefitted thousands of residents and visitors to our communities,” said Abe Johnson, Great Basin Heritage Area Partnership President.“When the late Senator Robert F. Bennett introduced the legislation to create the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area, he said that it would ‘serve as special recognition to the people and places that have contributed greatly to our nation’s development.’ Over the last 15 years, the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area has generated $44 million in leveraged funds for our projects and programs, helping us revitalize communities, restore historic buildings, and enhance communities along the 400-mile corridor,” said Monte Bona, Executive Director of the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area. “Reauthorizing the Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area will generate an estimated $50 million over the next 15 years. In the words of Joyce Bennett, Senator Bennett’s widow, these funds will help us tell the story of the Mormon pioneers to instill pride in our communities and motivate people to plan for the future by remembering the past.”Background:
Great Basin National Heritage Area is located in White Pine County, Nevada, and Millard County, Utah. Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area stretches across six Utah Counties (Kane, Garfield, Piute, Sevier, Wayne, and Sanpete). In 2006, Congress designated the Great Basin National Heritage Area and Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area, authorizing them to receive federal funding for 15 years. This funding allows the areas to conserve, interpret, and promote the natural cultural, historic, and recreational resources with their boundaries. Since the initial designation, Great Basin and Mormon Pioneer have received a combined $6 million in federal funds, which have produced projects and programs valued at over $50 million. Without reauthorization, the ability to receive and leverage these federal funds will expire on October 12. The National Heritage Area designation does not result in any change in land use regulations or ownership. Reauthorization of the NHA distinction would not affect water rights, grazing, rights, or mineral rights.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-calls-taiwans-participation-world-health-assembly,"WASHINGTON—In a video released today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to invite Taiwan to participate in the 74th World Health Assembly (WHA). Joining him in calling for Taiwan’s participation in the WHA are subcommittee chairman Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representatives Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, respectively.Senator Romney’s remarks can be found below:

It’s critical that Taiwan participate in the annual World Health Assembly in May. Excluding Taiwan from participation would play right into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party in its quest to strategically isolate Taiwan from the global community. The United States cannot sit by and allow China excess influence on global organizations. I stand in support of the Taiwanese people, who continue to stand up for freedom and democracy, holding strong against the Chinese Communist Party.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-colleagues-introducing-legislation-advance-us-strategic-competitiveness-china,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN) in introducing the Endless Frontier Act, legislation to advance and solidify the United States’ leadership in scientific and technological innovation through increased investments in the discovery, creation, and manufacturing of technology critical to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. Romney serves as the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, and has led multiple efforts to improve U.S. strategy to better compete with and counter China’s influence.As China seeks to pursue technological supremacy as a means to increase its power and spread its brand of authoritarianism abroad, the U.S. needs to shore up its own leadership in emerging technology and assure that China will not define the future of these technologies. The bipartisan legislation seeks to ensure new research investments translate into American industries, manufacturing, and high-tech jobs in regions across the country to become global centers of emerging technology. Text of the Endless Frontier Act be found here and a one-pager can be found here.“China represents an enormous threat to freedom and liberal democracy,” Senator Romney said. “Under the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, China has very clearly and repeatedly expressed their ambition to dominate the world—to become the leading geopolitical, military, and economic power. The United States, with our partners and allies, must take decisive action now to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter China’s growing aggression. By spurring investment and innovation in technology and bolstering U.S. national security, the Endless Frontier Act will better position us to compete with China on the world stage.”“I am proud to reintroduce the bold, bipartisan and bicameral Endless Frontier Act today with Senator Todd Young and Representatives Ro Khanna and Mike Gallagher to address several dangerous weak spots in America’s economic and national security that threaten our global technological leadership,” said Majority Leader Schumer. “This legislation will enhance American competitiveness with China and other countries by investing in American innovation, building up regions across the country to lead in the innovation economy, creating good-paying American manufacturing and high-tech jobs, and strengthening America’s research, development, and manufacturing capabilities. The Endless Frontier Act is the key to preserving America’s position on the world stage as a current and future technological leader in the 21st Century. In the coming weeks, the Senate will turn to this legislation and other pieces of bipartisan China related legislation to ensure that the U.S. Government’s hand at home and abroad is as strong as possible as we compete with China on all fronts.”“We face a pivotal time in history. Right now, the Chinese Communist Party is emphasizing to the world that the United States is a divided nation. This is a rare opportunity to show the authoritarians in Beijing, and the rest of the world, that when it comes to our national security, and most importantly our China policy, we are united. The Endless Frontier Act is our path forward. I’ve worked with my colleagues to ensure the Endless Frontier Act will help invest in innovative small businesses that create jobs, invest in critical emerging technologies, and put America in a position to outgrow, out-innovate, and out-compete our leading geopolitical foe,” said Senator Young.Background:
The Endless Frontier Act will reinvigorate the U.S. innovation economy, support research and development throughout the country, help lead to the creation of new jobs of the future here in America, and keep the U.S. economically competitive against China and other countries. Without a significant and sustained increase in investment in research, education and training, technology transfer and entrepreneurship, manufacturing, and the broader U.S. innovation ecosystem across the nation, it is only a matter of time before America’s global competitors overtake the U.S. in terms of technological primacy, threatening national security and prosperity.The Endless Frontier Act is cosponsored by Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Coons (D-DE), Rob Portman (R-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Gary Peters (D-MI), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Mark Kelly (D-AZ).

Last week, we learned that Secretary Haaland submitted her recommendations to you on the national monuments’ boundaries. As you consider a final decision regarding the monuments’ boundaries and management, we request that the Secretary’s report be made available to Congress and that you meet with us before making a final decision.Since you issued Executive Order 13990, we have on many occasions urged your administration to work with the Utah delegation towards a permanent, legislative solution to the monuments’ boundaries. We appreciated the decision to extend the initial 60-day timeline and that Secretary Haaland accepted our invitation to visit Utah to tour the monuments and engage state, local, and tribal leaders before submitting her recommendation. We also appreciate the continued dialogue between the Department and our staff.During discussions with Secretary Haaland in Utah, our delegation, along with state, local, and tribal leaders, reiterated our desire to find a permanent, legislative solution, which we believe is the only path to resolving the longstanding dispute over the monuments’ boundaries and management, as well as providing much-needed certainty to our communities. We also articulated if the administration acts unilaterally, a legislative solution will be nearly impossible to achieve and it would only lead to further conflict, division, and lawsuits.Our delegation, tribal governments, local partners, and department officials have worked in good faith to share and listen to differing viewpoints on this issue. In that same spirit, we request you meet with us before making a final decision and publicly release the Secretary’s report recommendations.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-leads-colleagues-introducing-bill-reduce-traffic-congestion,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today led his colleagues in introducing the Smart Intersections Act, legislation which would reduce traffic congestion and improve roadway efficiency by establishing a grant program at the Department of Transportation (DOT) with the purpose of improving the functioning of traffic signals throughout the country. U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) are cosponsors of the legislation.“Traffic congestion has increasingly become a problem which needs addressing in Utah’s cities and in many metropolitan areas around our country,” Senator Romney said. “Our bill proposes a multifaceted solution to reducing traffic congestion and improving the safety and effectiveness of our roads, while also reducing fuel costs and air pollution. As we continue to have discussions on improving our country’s infrastructure, I will work to ensure that our legislation be included in any deal that is agreed upon.”“Improving traffic signal functions across the country will not only reduce congestion and help ensure the safety of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians on the road, it will also reduce fuel costs and air pollution caused by carbon emissions,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. “I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan bill, which will help address traffic congestion and improve traffic safety, making Michigan an even better place to live, work and raise a family.”“We can cut traffic jams and make our roads safer by just improving our traffic lights,” said Senator Schatz. “Our bill will help Hawaii and states across the country modernize their traffic signals so that everyone – walkers, bikers, and drivers – can get to where they need to go more safely and efficiently.”“I am glad to work across the aisle on this commonsense bill that can provide direct support to New Hampshire cities and towns for updates to their traffic signals. Improvements to traffic signals can help to address traffic congestion and support road safety, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill,” said Senator Hassan.Background:
The Smart Intersections Act establishes a Smart Technology Traffic Signals Grant Program where the Department of Transportation would make grants to state, local, or tribal governments to improve the functioning of traffic signals.These grants could be used to:Other provisions:Support for the Smart Intersections Act:“ATSSA is proud to support this bipartisan legislation that aims to improve roadway safety and reduce fatalities through innovation and the modernization of traffic signals. More than ever, it is important for our industry to look to the future and ensure that roadway safety infrastructure keeps pace with the technological advances we are seeing across the roadway system. With this legislation, Sens. Romney, Schatz and Peters are ensuring that we have the tools to do so.” – President and CEO of American Traffic Safety Services Association, Stacy Tetschner

“The National League of Cities appreciates the bipartisan leadership of Sen. Romney and Sen. Schatz on the Smart Intersections Act of 2021 to partner with communities in this essential transportation technology and keep our economic hubs moving. Cities and towns want to keep everyone moving in their areas safely, and the best way to keep traffic flowing and pedestrians safe is to invest in advanced transportation signal technology that can keep the green lights coming and better manage flow.” – CEO and Executive Director of the National League of Cities, Clarence Anthony

“As the fastest growing state in the nation, Utah is increasingly utilizing smart technology to alleviate our traffic congestion and air quality challenges. Wasatch Front Regional Council is grateful to Senator Romney for his leadership in introducing the bipartisan ‘Smart Intersections Act of 2021’ that will help state and local governments across the U.S. to implement smart technology traffic signals systems that will help to reduce traffic congestion, improve mobility and air quality, and increase safety on our roadways for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.” – Executive Director of the Wasatch Front Regional Council, Utah’s largest Metropolitan Planning Organization, Andrew Gruber

“The Smart Intersections Act of 2021 is a positive step in bringing our nation’s surface transportation network into the 21st century. ASCE applauds Senator Romney’s legislation that creates a Smart Technology Traffic Signals Grant Program that would improve the active management of traffic signals through enhanced corridor timing and detection systems, implementing connected vehicle technology, and replace outdate traffic signals.

We will seek avenues to bolster Taiwan’s defenses to deter armed aggression, and just as importantly, discuss how we bolster Taiwan’s standing in the world to withstand Beijing’s efforts to deny it partners overseas and access to the international community. We look forward to hearing from the Administration about what practical steps can be taken to strengthen the foundational commitments of the United States to Taiwan and promote Taiwan’s remarkable democratic success story in a region where authoritarianism is on the rise.“At a time of our greatest need during the pandemic, Taiwan stepped up to supply personal protective equipment to frontline workers in hospitals across the United States—and its generosity has extended to other countries struggling to return to health. The U.S. must similarly help Taiwan address the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We call upon the Biden administration to expedite its commitment to supply 750,000 vaccines to Taiwan, stand ready to field additional requests from Taipei, and allot doses for use by the Taiwanese Armed Forces,” the senators continued.  In April, Senators Romney and Markey, along with Representatives Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, released a statement urging the World Health Organization to invite Taiwan to participate in the upcoming 74th World Health Assembly.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

With this resolution, we honor the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and condemn the ongoing repression of human rights in China and Hong Kong.”“Today we remember those who lost their lives 32 years ago as they peacefully expressed their desire for democracy and the protection of human rights in China,” said Chairman Markey. “The battle for fundamental freedoms continues as the Chinese government continues to crack down on pro-democracy activists, religious and ethnic minorities, free speech, and human rights defenders. Congress must continue to stand against this authoritarianism and hold the Chinese government accountable for atrocities carried out against its own people. Today, on this dark anniversary, we stand in solidarity with the brave activists in Hong Kong and throughout China who have and continue to put their own safety on the line to stand against oppression.”“Today marks the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when the Chinese government mowed down thousands of its own citizens taking to the streets to demand basic freedoms and democratic reforms,” said Chairman Bera. “Over three decades later, Beijing continues its violent repression and persecution, including imprisoning those who dare commemorate the anniversary of Tiananmen Square, committing genocide against the Uyghur Muslims, jailing journalists, human rights lawyers, and pro-democracy activists, and imposing authoritarian restrictions on Hong Kong’s autonomy and electoral system. On this solemn anniversary, the United States Congress stands in solidarity with those who lost their lives during the Tiananmen Square massacre, and in support of freedom, democracy, and justice for the people of China.”“Today marks the terrible anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre,” said Ranking Member Chabot. “The world must never forget the victims or that they suffered for the dream of a free China. On June 4, 32 years ago, the Chinese Communist Party showed its true nature, which is on full display today in the genocide against the Uyghurs, the crackdown on Hong Kong, the persecution of Christians and Falun Gong practitioners, and so many other abuses. This is the real CCP, an evil communist dictatorship fundamentally incapable of fulfilling the core aspiration of the Chinese people, a simple desire to live in freedom.”Click here to view the full resolution.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Romney’s amendments would require the President to develop and submit to Congress a grand strategy with respect to China, promote rare earth mineral independence from China, and call for partnerships with allies to prevent Chinese companies from profiting from stolen intellectual property. His amendments also require reporting on Chinese propaganda efforts and direct the Administration to begin negotiations of a free trade agreement with Taiwan.“It is becoming increasingly urgent that we develop a comprehensive strategy to counter the China threat, which has grown during the COVID pandemic as the Chinese Communist Party exerts its political leverage over other countries,” Senator Romney said. “These amendments will strengthen the United States’ ability to compete with China. By partnering with our allies to ensure no goods made from stolen intellectual property make their way into our economies, we can encourage the CCP to change its predatory behavior. We must also address our dependence on China for rare earth minerals to shore up our supply chains and support the independence of Taiwan by entering into negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement.”Amendments authored by Senator Romney:Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Joining them in introducing the LifeBOAT Act include Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI).

Importantly, this legislation will bolster the significant work Utah has done to combat the opioid epidemic by helping to fund our state’s treatment and recovery support services.”“Many Americans and West Virginians who struggle with substance use disorder aren’t able to access the treatment they need because we simply don’t have enough facilities, beds, or healthcare providers in our communities,” Senator Manchin said. “This bipartisan legislation would create a 1 cent stewardship fee for every milligram of opioids in a prescription pain pill which would be used to support and expand substance use treatment options for our fellow Americans in need. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this vital bipartisan legislation to help address the drug epidemic facing our nation.”Background:In 2020, more than 90,000 Americans died from drug related overdoses—the highest year of overdose deaths ever recorded—with more than half of those likely involving an opioid or synthetic-opioid. The LifeBOAT Act would establish a stewardship fee to fund efforts to provide and expand access to substance use treatment through the existing Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. The bill would establish a 1 cent stewardship fee on each milligram of active opioid ingredient in a prescription pain pill and would include a rebate for cancer related pain and hospice patients and an exemption for opioids used as part of medically assisted treatment.The funding would be used to improve access to substance use disorder treatment, including but not limited to:Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-urges-administration-step-vaccine-aid-countries-need,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today urged the Administration to implement a vaccine distribution strategy which ensures access to countries in need around the world. He highlighted also the national security concern that China and Russia pose by distributing their own, less efficacious vaccine to help advance their political agendas in various countries.Last week Senator Romney raised this issue at a Senate Foreign Relations hearing, where he asked Gayle E. Smith, the Department of State’s Coordinator for Global COVID Response and Health Security, what the Administration’s plans are for vaccine allocation around the world.The full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Blinken,I write with concern regarding the Administration’s lack of urgency to distribute COVID vaccines to countries in desperate need. While Russia and China have taken action on this matter, the United States appears to still be in the process of deciding what it is going to do. It is necessary that the United States implement a strategy which ensures that the world’s most vulnerable populations have access to the vaccine as soon as possible.On May 12, 2021, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, I asked the Honorable Gayle E. Smith, Coordinator for Global COVID Response and Health Security at the U.S. Department of State, what the United States’ priorities and plans are for vaccine allocation around the world.I was dismayed to learn that while China and Russia are pushing out vaccines to countries in desperate need, the U.S. is still in the stage of planning and prioritizing, and has yet to communicate in any detail to countries around the world when they can expect doses. The U.S. must urgently prioritize moving beyond the planning stage to the implementation stage of vaccine distribution.The U.S. public and private sector efforts to develop COVID vaccines is one of the great scientific successes of the past decades. Given their success in safely inoculating millions of people, U.S. COVID vaccines will be extremely welcome around the world. Facilitating vaccine access to other countries will also increase the resiliency of our neighbors, allies, and partners, which is in our national security interests.I was pleased to see the Administration commit an additional 20 million doses by the end of June. However, I am concerned that a total of only 80 million doses are far too few to effectively stymie the pandemic and prevent new variants from reaching our shores.While the U.S. continues to “plan” and “prioritize” vaccine distribution, China is using its weight and its own, far less efficacious, vaccine to push countries needing vaccines to follow China’s political goals. On May 19, 2021, “Carlos Alberto Madero, Honduras chief cabinet coordinator…told the Financial Times that the country wanted to avoid breaking longstanding ties with Taipei. But he warned that access to vaccines was ‘much more urgent than anything else.’”If Honduras chooses to change its official recognition from the “Republic of China” to the “People’s Republic of China” due to the effective vaccine diplomacy pushed by the PRC, the U.S. will have failed in its own strategic objectives regarding Taiwan, all because we were not successfully using our resources to aid the world in the fight against COVID.I respectfully urge you to immediately enter discussions with countries around the world and implement a strategy for vaccine distribution to those countries. Upon doing so, I urge you to announce and publish timelines for vaccine distribution by country.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-washington-shouldnt-tell-parents-how-raise-their-kids,"
WASHINGTON—In a Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee hearing on paid family leave today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney questioned proposals put forth by Democrats that put an emphasis on young children being in a professional child care setting approved by the government rather than being at home with their parents and family. President Biden’s American Families Plan proposes a new $425 billion government day care program, increases the marriage tax penalty, and favors families with two working parents over parents who prefer to have one parent stay at home.
           
Romney recently proposed the Family Security Act to provide greater financial security for America’s families. Romney’s proposal would ensure that expecting parents receive the help they need to face expenses associated with preparing for a child, and low-income families would no longer have to choose between a bigger paycheck or maintaining eligibility for support. Parents would be eligible to receive the cash benefit 4 months prior to their child’s due date, and it would continue to be administered on a monthly basis.
        
Senator Romney’s exchange with Marcia St. Hilaire-Finn, founder and CEO of Bright Start Early Care and Preschool in Washington, D.C., can be found below. Video of the exchange can be found here.
               
Senator Romney: …Looking at the Democratic proposals with regards to child care, there seems to be a very significant bias toward providing [free] child care and pre-k education and so forth, which encourage, if you will, women and men going into the workforce, as opposed to saying, “Hey, if one of you wants to stay and raise the child, that’s acceptable too.” And it does seem like the Administration strongly prefers getting kids out of the home and getting both parents into the workforce, and I understand there’s an economic reality to that, or an advantage to that – and yet I also think there is a developmental advantage to a child—if parents want to have one, or both, remain home to raise a child—there’s a childrearing advantage to that as well. Are you concerned, and I guess I’m going to direct this to the member of this panel that is responsible for child care. Are you concerned that too much focus on federal mandates actually may be detrimental to the effects on children who might otherwise be raised with the intensive involvement and investment on the part of the parent or one of the parents for that child?
        
Marcia St. Hilaire-Finn: Thank you Senator for the question, yeah I think two things here. For one thing, children develop better in an environment where they can engage with others besides their family members, and allowing a child to be in a setting where they can develop the cognitive and social, emotional skills will allow the parents to go to work, and won’t have to worry about their child falling behind by the time they are ready for kindergarten.
      
Romney: Let me just interrupt, your first point was that—make sure I understand—you believe it’s better for a child to not be in the home in their neighborhood with parents—let’s say a 3-or 4-year-old child—they are better being in a professional child care center approved by the government than being in their home and their neighborhood?
      
St. Hilaire-Finn: Well, it’s more beneficial for the child. Children learn better in a setting outside the – well with families first, always the family is the child’s first teacher.
       
Romney: I didn’t realize I was at a disadvantage because I was raised by my mom who stayed home. I guess what you describe is a perspective on the part of the Administration which I find contrary to personal experience and contrary to the perspective of many parents. I would think that as we think about the policies that we want to have with regards to child rearing, that we would give authority to the parents to make that decision, as opposed to an Administration to make it for them.
    
St. Hilaire-Finn: Sir, yes, well Senator again, parents are the first teachers and a child’s preference is to be with the family. But if the family cannot allow to do that, it’s greatly beneficial for a child to be in a setting where they can get the support to develop their social, emotional, and cognitive skills. We have seen studies that show that children outside of the family who are in group settings do much better socially, emotionally, and cognitively. So I know we don’t want to dethrone the nation to take care of parents’ responsibility, but it’s a partnership and it helps foster a child’s development better than just being with the parent.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Given that the previous administration opposed repeal of the 2002 AUMF and the Obama administration cited the 2002 AUMF as an authority to intervene against ISIS, the Senate and the American people should hear from the Biden administration regarding their legal analysis and their strategy to continue to protect the American people, our personnel, and our allies and partners in the region. The administration should also make its case to Congress in a closed, classified setting to ensure every question is answered.”The text of the letter can be found below.Dear Chairman Menendez,We respectfully request that S.

As such, we would support this Committee undertaking serious deliberations to carefully evaluate S. J. Res. 10, which would repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (“2002 AUMF”) and the 1991 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution. Whether and when to authorize the use of military force is among the most consequential matters that this Committee or the Congress ever considers.There are weighty questions, however, about the implications of repealing the 2002 AUMF, which should cause this committee to pause before we act. We believe it is critical that every member of this Committee fully understand the scope and use of existing legal authorities, the current threats to the U.S. and its allies and partners, and the implications for our national security and foreign policy.We should fully evaluate the conditions on the ground, the implications of repealing the 2002 AUMF for our friends, and how adversaries—including ISIS and Iranian backed militia groups—would react.

Last week, Senator Romney held a press conference with Draper City Mayor Troy Walker and Acting Director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands Jamie Barnes to announce the legislation. A one pager summary can be found here.“With nearly 400 wildfires burning more than 40,000 acres of land, Utah’s 2021 fire season has already surpassed the five-year average for this time of year,” Senator Romney said. “As the American West continues to get drier and fires become more destructive, it doesn’t make sense to continue to adhere to the fire policies of the past. Our legislation lays out a comprehensive strategy which would bring together officials from all levels of government—including county and city representation—and outside experts to improve strategies to prevent future wildfires from becoming catastrophic disasters in Utah and across the West.”“Right now, we are witnessing one of the worst early starts to a fire season that Arizona has ever seen,” said Senator Kelly. “Every year, we see these fires grow larger and more threatening, putting communities, first responders, and small businesses in harm’s way. We cannot expect outcomes to change unless we try a new approach. In order to protect Arizonans and their property, I am introducing this bipartisan legislation with Senator Romney to bring together experts from local communities and the private and public sectors to figure out how we can get better at wildfire prevention, mitigation, and response.”“Right now Utah is experiencing multiple extreme wildfires and land managers are preparing for another unprecedented fire season. The current drought combined with decades of poor federal forest management has made wildfires more likely, fire behavior unpredictable, and fighting fires more difficult,” Representative Curtis said. “As those charged with ensuring our land is healthy and available to future generations, we must do better and follow the advice of professionals to mitigate fire risk in the first place, ensure our national fire response is sufficient, and help our communities swiftly recover. The Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Act will bring together experts to inform Congress and land managers on best practices. I’d like to thank Senator Romney for sharing my commitment to proper wildland management and stopping the devastation and destruction that wildland fires leave in their wake.”“Utah is currently experiencing unprecedented wildfire and drought conditions. Above normal temperatures and critical fuels have produced extreme fire conditions,” said Utah Governor Spencer Cox. “There is no better time than now to work together to improve policy and focus on practices that can make a difference for our future, including better prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation. I appreciate the good work of Senators Romney and Kelly and Representative Curtis on this legislation. Working together with the experts in the field will lead us to the best policies and practices on our landscapes for years to come.”Background:
Last year, nearly 60,000 fires burned across ten million acres, more than 53,000 of which were human-caused fires, according to the National Interagency Fire Council. So far this year, in Utah, nearly 400 fires have burned more than 40,000 acres of land. Almost 90% of these fires are human-caused.Current federal wildland fire policy is a patchwork of legislation and agency guidance across departments and jurisdictions, further complicated by mixed landownership.

SALT LAKE CITY— In Draper City today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) announced the upcoming introduction of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Act of 2021, legislation to establish a wildfire commission which would conduct a national review of wildfire policy and make recommendations to Congress. Romney was joined by Draper City Mayor Troy Walker and Acting Director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands Jamie Barnes, who spoke in support of the Senator’s efforts. Senator Romney plans to formally introduce the legislation next week with U.S. Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ). Companion legislation will be introduced in the House by Representative John Curtis (R-UT).Last year, nearly 60,000 fires burned across ten million acres, more than 53,000 of which were human-caused fires, according to the National Interagency Fire Council. So far this year, in Utah, nearly 400 fires have burned more than 40,000 acres of land.

This bill would require a review of the nation’s wildland firefighting strategy, accompanied by specific policy recommendations, by a commission made up of the nation’s top experts, including state and local stakeholders. A one-pager of the legislation is available here.“It’s getting drier in the American West—our state is getting drier. The fires are becoming bigger. The loss of life is more significant.  And continuing to do things the way we’ve done them in the past doesn’t make a lot of sense. And that’s the reason that Senator Kelly of Arizona and I have introduced a piece of legislation to create a commission which would be focused on mitigating the effects of fires and preventing them from happening,” said Senator Romney. “The policies of the past are hung up on the fact that we have land owned by different folks. Sometimes one department of the federal government takes responsibility for land…other times it’s state land, [or] private land. Each has different rules and regulations and we just don’t get a coordinated, comprehensive approach to preventing fire. So the focus of this commission is to make sure that we have a comprehensive strategy for preventing fires from occurring, to the extent possible, and also getting them out as quickly as possible.”“In Draper, we have homes that are right in this wildland interface and many communities in Utah are in the same situation we are. Our entire state is in the driest phase it’s been in since 1895 and its not getting any wetter… Senator Romney’s plan is a long-overdue and much-needed plan to address fire mitigation practices and rehabilitation of our forests and grasslands in Utah. It’s a commonsense approach which would elevate local leaders and make sure they have a seat at the table with federal partners to assess and make recommendations on wildland fire mitigation and land maintenance in order to prevent future wildland fires from becoming catastrophic disasters.” – Troy Walker, Draper City Mayor

“The issues here in Utah with regard to wildfire and drought are real and unprecedented… With over 380 fires on Utah’s landscape and more than 40,000 acres burned, addressing mitigation, management, rehabilitation, and prevention is a priority… We must convene and make the best policy decisions. We must manage lands and prevent catastrophic wildfire. This Act addresses the importance of collaboration, bringing forward the best tools, and addressing major problems—we support that.

The legislation that created this program, the Save Our Stages Act, was signed into law more than six months ago, but delays in distributing grant funds are too often resulting in event venues going out of business. Before the pandemic, Utah was the third fastest growing state for creative workers and its cultural industry employed 155,000 Utahns.“The Save Our Stages Act, now the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program, was created to prevent widespread closures of venues that have been devastated by the loss of revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the senators wrote. “As supporters of the SVOG program, we urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the relief reaches eligible applicants without further delay.”“It has been nearly six months since Congress passed the Save our Stages Act, nearly two months since the second launch of the program, and 51 days since the Small Business Administration (SBA) began receiving applications,” the senators continued. “Bureaucratic process cannot stand in the way of getting these desperately needed funds out the door.”“Utah’s arts, cultural, and entertainment industry has been devastated by COVID. Our losses total $88M, 29,000 jobs, and we’re sitting on $17.5M in ticket liabilities,” said Crystal Young-Otterstrom, Executive Director of the Utah Cultural Alliance. “As the debacle of SVOG continues to drag on into mid-June, our pathway to economic recovery becomes ever more difficult. We applaud Senator Romney for showing once more how Utah values the arts. It’s part of who we are and we need this help to survive.”The text of the letter can be found below.Dear Administrator Guzman:The Save Our Stages Act, now the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program, was created to prevent widespread closures of venues that have been devastated by the loss of revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As supporters of the SVOG program, we urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the relief reaches eligible applicants without further delay.With each passing day, more independent businesses are forced to shutter permanently or file for bankruptcy. Landlords and banks are no longer permitting deferrals and are pressing for immediate payment of past due accounts; businesses are receiving eviction notices; mom-and-pop businesses are being forced to sell.It has been nearly six months since Congress passed the Save our Stages Act, nearly two months since the second launch of the program, and 51 days since the Small Business Administration (SBA) began receiving applications. We urge you to immediately take steps to ensure the funds are distributed to qualified applicants.The SVOG program is unique, with necessary restrictions built in to ensure taxpayer funding goes only to eligible applicants in need. Under the terms of the law, the SVOG program requires the award of funding to eligible applicants who meet the simple requirements of the program. In this context, the insistence on strict compliance with competitive grant rules has created unnecessary delays in funding. Similarly, restrictions that SBA has placed on communication with grant applicants are unnecessary and have prevented the agency from providing administrative support to individual applicants that could have streamlined the application review process. Bureaucratic process cannot stand in the way of getting these desperately needed funds out the door.Further delays are unacceptable and would have irreversible consequences for these industries.

Taiwan is an important friend of the United States. It plays a significant role in promoting democracy and countering China’s aggression in the region. The United States must support Taiwan in this pivotal effort.“We must also support Taiwan’s standing in the world by advocating for their participation in international organizations, especially as the Chinese Communist Party seeks to isolate Taiwan from the global community. I commend the G7 for coming together and affirming the importance of a peaceful Taiwan Strait, supporting a peaceful resolution of the issues, and strongly opposing unilateral attempts to change the status quo.“The U.S. must work with its allies to present a united front on Taiwan. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan offered help to the United States by supplying personal protective equipment to hospitals across the United States, and it a lent hand to its neighbors in need. As Taiwan faces a surge in COVID-19 cases, the Biden Administration must expedite its commitment to supplying 750,000 vaccines to Taiwan, and they should continue to allocate additional vaccines that Taiwan needs without delay.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The legislation is cosponsored by the Utah congressional delegation, including the subcommittee’s Ranking Member, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT).
    
“The legislation would trade 326 acres of wilderness for 326 acres of Forest Service land, such that the trails can be connected, and there would be a 280 mile long Bonneville Shoreline Trail that would stretch from Utah all the way up into Idaho, allowing people for generation after generation to walk this trail along the side of the mountains and see nothing but the beauty of the landscape,” Senator Romney said. “It would be a treasure for the people of our country and a legacy for future generations. I hope this committee will see fit to bring this proposal to the floor so that this trail can be completed and future generations can enjoy it.”

The package passed the Senate by a vote of 98-0.“The brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police work tirelessly to keep the Capitol and the lives of those inside of it safe. Their heroic actions—and sacrifice—have been on full display this year. It’s important that Congress now fulfills its most basic duty to the Capitol Police by ensuring they have the funding necessary to pay their officers and secure the Capitol complex,” said Senator Romney. “I am especially proud that this security funding bill honors the life of my friend, Officer Howie Liebengood, by designating the wellness program of the Capitol Police as the ‘Howard C. Liebengood Center for Wellness.’“When the nation needs help, Utahns answer the call. Following the events of January 6, members of the Utah National Guard and guard members around the country left their homes, jobs, and loved ones to travel to Washington in service to our country—supporting security efforts and importantly, protecting our democracy. The security funding bill will reimburse the National Guard for their vital support,” Romney continued.

“Also included in this bill is support for the Afghans who risked their lives, and the lives of their families, in aid of the U.S. over the past two decades.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/utah-congressional-delegation-introduces-legislation-rename-provo-vet-center-after-candy-bomber,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) with Representatives John Curtis (R-UT), Chris Stewart (R-UT), Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Blake Moore (R-UT) today introduced legislation to rename the Provo Vet Center in Orem, Utah after Colonel Gail S. Halvorsen, the “Candy Bomber.” The delegation also wrote a letter to the Chairman John Tester and Ranking Member Jerry Moran of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in support of the name change.“Col. Gail S. Halvorsen was a force for good and a beacon of hope for many in the aftermath of the Second World War,” said Senator Romney. “What began as a gesture of compassion quickly grew into an official U.S. Air Force operation as he and his fellow pilots dropped candy rations from their planes to the children of West Berlin. Gail is an American hero who exemplifies the best of humanity and embodies our state’s kindness and spirit of service, and it is only fitting that we rename the Provo Vet Center in his honor.”“Col. Gail Halvorsen exemplifies the best of the Utah spirit of service,” said Senator Lee. “His creativity and compassion helped to heal the wounds of the Second World War, and softened the relationship between occupied Germany and the United States. Renaming the Provo Vet Center in his honor is a fitting and deserved recognition of this American hero.”“Gail Halvorsen represents all that is good about Utahns—and our men and women in uniform,” said Representative Curtis. “I am proud of our bill to honor his legacy and service to the United States with the soon-to-be renamed, “Gail S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center.”“Col. Gail S. Halvorsen is a Utah veteran and an American hero,” said Representative Owens. “He embodies our state’s spirit of service, faith, and community, and I’m proud to join this united effort to honor him and his family in a way that will continue his extraordinary legacy.”“Gail Halverson embodies the ideals that Utahns, and all Americans, strive for every day: Bravery, compassion, and service. As a fellow Air Force veteran myself, I can think of none more fitting to represent the Veteran Center in Provo. I am proud to stand among a united Utah delegation in honoring his legacy,” said Representative Stewart.

“Colonel Gail Halvorsen epitomizes Utah’s humanitarian spirit,” said Representative Moore. “As an ambassador of the American Armed Forces, he provided more than candy. He brought hope to a German nation suffering from the wrath and destruction of the Second World War. No one is more deserving of our gratitude than Gail, and I am proud to join my colleagues in honoring his compassion and creativity.”Background:Col. Halvorsen performed military service of an extraordinary character during the Berlin Airlift in 1948, dropping candy rations from his plane to destitute German children as he undertook his airlift missions. An estimated 250,000 parachutes with 21 tons of candy were dropped by Halvorsen and his fellow airmen to the starving children of Berlin as part of “Operation Little Vittles.”After 31 years of service and more than 8,000 hours of flying time, Col. Halvorsen retired from the military in 1974. Since then, he has continued engaging in humanitarian and community service, representing the U.S. Airforce abroad and re-enacting his famous candy drops in Berlin, the Middle East, and around the world in an effort to bring peace and relief. He has been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, a German Order of Merit, an Air Force Commendation Medal, and a Medal for Humane Action. He has also founded the Gail S. Halvorsen Aviation Education Foundation, which advances aviation and STEM education, promotes youth leadership development, and encourages humanitarian service.The bill would rename the Provo Vet Center to “The Col. Gail S. Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center.”The text of the letter can be found here and the bill text is available here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-introduce-bill-hold-e-cigarette-companies-accountable-youth-vaping-crisis,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes. The Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act would require that e-cigarette manufacturers pay user fees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help to fund more activity at the FDA to conduct stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase awareness for the danger of e-cigarettes. Companion legislation will be introduced in the House by Representatives Cheri Bustos (IL-17) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01).“Electronic nicotine devices should be subject to the same user fees that the FDA assesses on the manufacturers and importers of cigarettes and other forms of tobacco,” said Romney. “By granting the FDA the authorization to collect user fees on e-cigarettes, our legislation will further efforts to tackle the vaping crisis and protect the lives of children in Utah and across the country.”“New Hampshire is acutely experiencing the youth vaping crisis – and has one of the nation’s highest rates of e-cigarette use among high school students. It’s outrageous that e-cigarette manufacturers are directly marketing their harmful products to young people with no consequences,” said Shaheen. “That’s why I’m leading bipartisan legislation to respond to this crisis by holding these companies accountable and closing a loophole that allowed them to avoid paying fees to the FDA to help fund the agency’s crackdown on youth vaping. There’s no excuse not to act – we must stop this exploitation of kids and teens before another generation falls victim to the nicotine addiction epidemic.”“As we face alarming increases in youth vaping, it is crucial that we continue work to prevent another generation of Americans from becoming addicted to nicotine. While we have made progress in reducing the number of teens who use cigarettes, we know the numbers—more and more teens and high school students are using vaping products. I’ve worked with my colleagues to remove flavored products from the market that were clearly designed to target kids, but there is a lot more that needs to be done. This bill supports the agencies that can hold e-cigarette companies accountable while also raising awareness about the dangers of vaping,” said Murkowski“Big Vape has hooked nearly four million kids on e-cigarettes, creating a vaping epidemic that is threatening our next generation with a lifetime of nicotine addiction and disease,” said Durbin. “The FDA needs to clear the shelves of these dangerous and addictive products, and Congress needs to pass the Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act, which will help provide FDA with the resources to better regulate this market.  Enough is a enough. The health of our children cannot wait any longer.” “The use of e-cigarettes by our young people threatens the progress we have made to reduce overall tobacco use. I have heard from teachers across Maine about the issue of vaping in our high schools and middle schools,” said Collins. “Although we have taken important steps that are already making a difference in reducing the rate of youth vaping, more work remains to be done.  This legislation would impose fees on e-cigarette manufacturers similar to fees for other tobacco products, which could be used to support youth education and prevention initiatives.”“The rise of teen vaping is an epidemic and we must take action to protect children from the dangers of e-cigarettes and prevent them from using harmful tobacco products,” said Baldwin. “This legislation is an important step forward to fund stronger oversight of the e-cigarette industry and increase our prevention and youth awareness efforts.” Background:In recent years, the use of e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products has skyrocketed, particularly among teens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that:The Resources to Prevent Youth Vaping Act increases the total amount that will be collected in tobacco user fees by $100 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 and indexes that amount to inflation for future years. Critically, the bill also authorizes FDA to collect user fees from all manufacturers of products that have been deemed as tobacco products by FDA, including e-cigarettes. Currently, manufacturers of traditional combustible tobacco products pay into FDA user fees, but e-cigarette companies are exempt due to a loophole in the law. The amount collected from individual e-cigarette manufacturers will be proportional to their share of the overall tobacco market, as determined by FDA. FDA would be able to use this additional revenue from e-cigarette user fees to conduct safety review of vaping products, prevent sales of e-cigarettes to minors, help support efforts to educate youth on the dangers of e-cigarettes and increase the agency’s oversight and enforcement capabilities.Full text of the legislation is available here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/video-romney-border-crisis-threatens-our-national-security-economic-vitality,"WASHINGTON—During a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) pressed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the Biden Administration’s lack of action concerning the crisis at the United States’ southern border. Romney also asked Secretary Mayorkas about the potential risks of the Administration’s spending plans amid historic levels of inflation.A transcript of Senator Romney’s exchange with Secretary Mayorkas can be found below, and video can be found here.BORDER CRISISSenator Romney: Obviously one of the key responsibilities of Homeland Security is to secure our border—securing our homeland, if you will, and the numbers and the human stories that are coming from our border are both alarming and obviously threatening to our domestic tranquility and safety and economic vitality. I don’t know exactly why the Administration doesn’t want to acknowledge the crisis that we’re seeing at the border, and I guess the real question in my mind is why we politicize everything. I mean, you know I’m one of those that’s critical of people who politicize vaccination, but I’m also incredulous that there seems to be politicization about whether we should complete the border barrier that’s already been contracted to be completed. There are gaps in it, the steel is there, the contracts have been let, contractors, as Senator Lankford has pointed out, are standing by guarding the steel. Why in the world don’t we complete the barrier that’s already been contracted for? Surely it would help our security of the border.Secretary Mayorkas: Senator, I know that we will not agree on this issue, but the decision with respect to the border wall was not a political decision but a substantive one. The 15 billion dollars that was dedicated to construction of the border wall was ill-advised, and we can use the government’s funds and taxpayers funds, more wisely—through investment in innovation, through investment in technology—that is the greatest force multiplier.Romney: Mr. Secretary, the great majority of that money has already been spent, the overwhelming majority, and now there’s some gaps in what’s already been spent…President Obama’s Administration expanded the border barrier. I mean, I’m all in favor of technology but as long as we’ve paid for it and have contracts to complete the wall, I simply can’t understand any logical reason not to complete it…And with regards to the comment that we’re going to invest in root causes, I don’t understand what you’re inferring to there. Are you suggesting that somehow, we should be able to invest to make sure that all of Latin America gets rid of their dictators, gets rid of their corruption, ends violence, and if we do that, maybe there’ll be less people trying to get to the border? That’s unrealistic, that’s of course absurd. We can’t do those things even domestically, let alone around the world. People want to come to this country, they always will – you’re responsible for securing our borders. I just don’t get why you don’t address this in a way, well frankly like President Obama did—complete the barrier, use technology, have ICE carry out the responsibility of removing people that are here illegally. I’ve noticed that the House Democrats recently approved plans to slash the budget for Enforcement and Removal Operations. They cut it by hundreds of millions of dollars. Is that a mistake and do you believe that those funds should be restored?Mayorkas: Senator, you mentioned three different subjects. I will move very quickly through the three of them.

Romney: I didn’t ask for a response to some of them, those were my comments. The response I wanted was, do you believe in restoring and not cutting the funding for Enforcement and Removal Operations contrary to what the House has passed?

Mayorkas: I believe in smart and effective immigration enforcement, and that is what we are executing. And I do not believe in spending taxpayer money unwisely, and not consistent with enforcement priorities that are designed to achieve the greatest public safety objective.Romney: Well of course I agree with motherhood and apple pie as well, but the House has voted to reduce spending on enforcement. Is that something with which you concur, or do you believe that would be a mistake and you want to make sure that we don’t reduce spending on enforcement?Mayorkas: What I am focused on is the wise expenditure of funds, and I have a responsibility…Romney: And given that focus on the wise expenditure of funds, do you believe we should cut the funding for enforcement, or do you believe we should maintain it or increase it?Mayrokas: In certain respects I think we should increase it, in other respects I think we should reduce it, because some of it is not spent wisely to achieve the most important outcomes, and I’ve seen that. Senator if I may, because I know you disagree with me by your physical reaction but if I may, I know that, from being in the trenches and actually doing the work.DEBT AND DEFICITSRomney: The federal government is spending as much on interest right now as we spend on the combined budgets of Commerce, Education, Energy, Department of Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, the Justice Department, and the State Department. Let that sink in. That overspending is contributing to the highest level of inflation we’ve seen in some 12 years. Would you say that trillion dollar deficits like these, before the pandemic as well as after the pandemic, that they pose a threat to our national security?Mayorkas: Senator, that’s a question that I’m ill-equipped to answer. That is not my area of expertise.Romney: Well you have an opinion I’m sure, I mean, you’re head of the Department of Homeland Security, and the question I’m asking is, are we reaching a point where the level of our debt and deficits and the interest we’re paying represent a threat to our homeland security?Mayorkas: Not to my knowledge, Senator.Romney: So at no level, trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see, that doesn’t pose a threat to our national security?Mayorkas: I believe that this Administration’s efforts to rebuild this country contribute to the security of this country, it’s national security, it’s homeland security, it’s economic security, and it’s possibilities and promise.Romney: That’s an answer to a question I didn’t ask.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/video-romney-opening-statement-subcommittee-hearing-combating-climate-change-east-asia-and-pacific,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy, today gave the following opening remarks at a subcommittee hearing on combating climate change in East Asia and the Pacific. During his remarks, Romney emphasized the importance of maintaining U.S. leadership in the world and partnering with our allies to dissuade China from pursuing its predatory path.Senator Romney’s remarks, as delivered, can be found below. Video of his opening statement can be found here.I appreciate the panelists being here today, and the topic that we’re discussing is obviously of great significance to each of us in this room and to people around the country and around the world. It is my view that, 50 years from now, as people look back to our generation and ask what our legacy might have been, that upon which they will be most critical was our failure to act to prevent the warming of the planet and the climate change associated with that warming, and that the political winds that prevented us from acting will be seen as an extraordinary lapse in America’s judgment, and that this is a time for us to come together and to find solutions that will actually help protect our planet for future generations.I know, of course, that the challenge we’re dealing with is global. It’s not simply regional. It’s not simply, obviously, an Asian issue, even though that’s the topic for today–climate change as it relates to much of Asia but also climate change here in the United States is of significance and around the world.I will also note, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, that my own perspective is that the only effective way we will have in dealing with climate change is through the advance in technology, technology which will be adopted not just here but around the world, and adopted because it is effective in reducing emissions and also lower-cost than some of the carbon-based alternatives.  Because I think it’s unlikely that poor nations, in particular, that are becoming developed, will adopt technologies that are far more expensive, even if they reduce CO2.They will move to those things which are less expensive, so it’s incumbent upon nations that have the resources we have to invest in technology, as fortunately our colleagues have recently voted to do–invest in technology which will help not only us reduce our emissions but also help others and the rest of the world.I know that sometimes we’re tempted to politically get behind initiatives that sound good. Doing things here, that people here feel like, ‘boy, we’re doing green things here isn’t that wonderful?’, but the reality is that those things won’t make a hill of beans worth of difference to reducing global emissions. They’ll cost us a lot of money, sometimes cost us jobs, maybe not, maybe they’ll actually create jobs in some cases, but they won’t actually reduce emissions. What will reduce emissions is adopting technologies and developing technologies which will be used around the world.I’m fully concurrent with the view that America is responsible for a huge slug of the CO2 that’s in the atmosphere, as the chairman indicated, beginning in the 19th century. This, of course, was at a time we didn’t know we were doing anything wrong. But now we understand the consequence of this CO2 going into the environment and not acting would be extraordinarily shameful.I would note that in the future, the growth in emissions of CO2 and other warming emissions is going to be driven not by the United States, because over the last decade our emissions have been coming down, as have those of the EU, but instead the developing nations, which understandably are getting washing machines, and more automobiles, more electricity in the home, air conditioning, and as a result, China, Brazil, Indonesia, and India are expected to dramatically increase their emissions of greenhouse gases. And so it’s incumbent on us to take a close look at those places in particular to see how we can help and encourage them to take action that does not add to the extraordinary burden that’s in our environment.I’m concerned that China is hiding their CO2 plans by, if you will, exporting the production of facilities through Belt and Road, and putting infrastructure in place in other countries that will be emitting vast amounts of a greenhouse gases and they’ll say, ‘See we’re not doing it, it’s just being done in other countries, which, by the way, we happened to put that coal power plant there.’So, understanding China’s role and how we can work together is important. At the same time I note that, I know the Chairman and I agree on this, it’s critical as we deal with China that yes, we want them and other nations to reduce their emissions in their plans going forward, but at the same time we will not forget or look beyond—look away rather—from the predations of their economic activities, their military activities in the South China Sea and elsewhere, and, of course, their extraordinary human rights abuses.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

https://www.romney.senate.gov/bicameral-foreign-affairs-leaders-send-letter-president-biden-expressing-concern-over-continued,"WASHINGTON – Today, on the one-year anniversary of the promulgation of the intentionally-vague national security law in Hong Kong, the four leaders of Congress’s foreign relations subcommittees on Asia sent a letter to President Biden regarding the continued crackdowns on freedoms of speech and press in Hong Kong.In the letter, Representative Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia; Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH), Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia; Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia; and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), Ranking Member of Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, condemned the actions taken by the Governments of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including the arrest of pro-democracy activists, the cracking down on the media, and the stifling of freedom of expression on school campuses.Members also requested, among others, answers regarding the Administration’s plans to encourage international partners to hold PRC and HKSAR officials accountable for undermining Hong Kong’s high-degree of autonomy and to assist Hong Kongers seeking to leave Hong Kong for fear of retribution due to their political beliefs and activities.Full text of the letter is here and below:The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
President of the United States
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20500Dear Mr. President,We write on the first anniversary of the promulgation of the intentionally vague national security law in Hong Kong to express our continued concern over the ceaseless assault on Hong Kong’s democracy by the Governments of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).Since its enactment, the national security legislation has been weaponized to severely undermine the rights and high-degree of autonomy guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law.The PRC and HKSAR Governments are working together to undermine the Hong Kong people’s freedoms and to silence political opposition, including through sweeping arrests and imprisonments for alleged crimes committed during the 2019 protests. Pro-democracy advocates and former lawmakers have been subject to mass arrest for exercising political rights and attempting to take part in a primary election, being accused of “conspiracy to commit subversion” under the law.The national security law has been used to arrest pro-democracy activists such as Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying and to crack down on press freedoms. Just two weeks ago, the Hong Kong police raided the offices of Lai’s pro-democracy paper Apple Daily and arrested five executives and editors on suspicion of “collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.” The HKSAR government also froze Apple Daily’s assets, forcing the newspaper to shutter after 26 years.This crackdown on media freedom has been accompanied by concerning educational reforms that stifle freedom of expression on school campuses. After the passage of the national security law, school textbooks were reviewed to ensure they were in accordance with the legislation, and under a newly established National Security Education Day students as young as three years old participated in parades, quizzes, and exhibitions in effort to popularize the law with Hong Kong’s youth.The U.S. support for the people of Hong Kong has been bipartisan and unequivocal. As the situation in Hong Kong continues to deteriorate, however, we respectfully request answers to the following questions:We thank you for your attention to this urgent matter and look forward to working with you to continue supporting the people of Hong Kong in their struggle for their rights, freedoms, and autonomy.Sincerely,Ami Bera, M.D.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-bipartisan-effort-urging-administration-immediate-evacuation-siv-applicants-full,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined a group of 52 colleagues, led by senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Joni Ernst (R-IA), in sending a bipartisan letter urging the Biden administration to address the quickly deteriorating situation in Afghanistan that threatens the lives of tens of thousands of Afghan partners.In the letter, the senators call for the urgent evacuation of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and their families, as well as the full and immediate implementation of their legislation to expand the Afghan SIV program and streamline the application process. They urge the administration to enforce strategic agency coordination and hold the Hamid Karzai International Airport to ensure the safety of Afghan partners and their families, in addition to U.S. citizens. The letter marks the latest Congressional response to the Taliban’s takeover and the danger posed to Afghan allies who served alongside the U.S. mission.“The Taliban’s rapid ascendancy across Afghanistan and takeover of Kabul should not cause us to break our promise to the Afghans who helped us operate over the past twenty years and are counting on us for assistance. American inaction would ensure they become refugees or prime targets for Taliban retribution,” the senators wrote.“Specifically, we urge continued coordination between the Departments of State and Defense to secure and hold Hamid Karzai International Airport, including to allow for the continuation of military flights and the resumption of commercial and charter flights. We also urge your Administration to assist with the passage of individuals to the airport to safety – both those within Kabul and those outside of the capital – as well as to consider cases where Afghans fleeing quickly may not have been able to collect or gather appropriate documents,” the senators added. “We were pleased that you immediately signed [our]…legislation to make extensive improvements to the SIV program into law three weeks ago, and now ask that you move just as quickly to ensure it is properly and fully implemented ensuring applicants and their families can get out of harm’s way.” Joining senators Romney, Shaheen, and Ernst in signing the letter were senators Durbin (D-IL), Reed (D-RI), Collins (R-ME), Leahy (D-VT), Graham (R-SC), Peters (D-MI), Rounds (R-SD), Menendez (D-NJ), Lummis (R-WY), Coons (D-DE), Sasse (R-NE), Warnock (D-GA), Cornyn (R-TX), Van Hollen (D-MD), Daines (R-MT), Duckworth (D-IL), Moran (R-KS), Gillibrand (D-NY), Marshall (R-KS), Markey (D-MA), Cardin (D-MD), Murphy (D-CT), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Stabenow (D-MI), Warren (D-MA), Kaine (D-VA), Manchin (D-WV), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Bennet (D-CO), Hassan (D-NH), Rosen (D-NV), Blumenthal (D-CT), Klobuchar (D-MN), Padilla (D-CA), Murray  (D-WA), King (I-ME), Heinrich (D-NM), Merkley (D-OR), Whitehouse (D-RI), Feinstein (D-CA), Schatz (D-HI), Sanders (I-VT), Hirono (D-HI), Carper (D-DE), Lujan (D-NM), Smith (D-MN), Ossoff (D-GA), Tester (D-MT), Brown (D-OH) and Kelly (D-AZ).Find a copy of the letter here and below.Dear Mr. President,We write to urge the immediate and full implementation of recently-passed legislation amending the process and eligibility for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program and for the urgent evacuation of SIV applicants whose service to the U.S. mission has put their lives in jeopardy. As you know, this critical program provides safety for the brave Afghans who served alongside United States troops in support of the U.S. missions in Afghanistan. As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates, these individuals face increased danger at the hands of the Taliban that has sworn retribution. For this reason, Congress provided additional authorities to improve and expedite the application process while maintaining the program’s security and integrity. We implore your Administration to expeditiously implement these changes and immediately evacuate our Afghan allies to safety.The United States led coalition forces in Afghanistan for nearly twenty years following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Our mission safeguarded the American homeland safe from terrorist attacks, eliminated Osama bin Laden, and delivered freedom and education to a generation of Afghan women and children. At every step of the way, our mission was supported by Afghans who fought alongside us for a better future for their country. They risked their safety and the well-being of their families to work with the United States. With the departure of U.S. forces and Taliban rule in place, the safety and security of our Afghan allies who put their lives on the line to help our service members and diplomats must be a top priority.For this reason, we urge you to continue the expeditious evacuation of SIV applicants and their families. At your direction, on July 17 the United States launched Operation Allies Refuge in order to evacuate SIV applicants in danger from the Taliban’s advances. We appreciate that this effort has already brought 2,000 Afghans, including primary SIV applicants and their families, to the United States. However many more remain. The Taliban’s rapid ascendancy across Afghanistan and takeover of Kabul should not cause us to break our promise to the Afghans who helped us operate over the past twenty years and are counting on us for assistance. American inaction would ensure they become refugees or prime targets for Taliban retribution.Specifically, we urge continued coordination between the Departments of State and Defense to secure and hold Hamid Karzai International Airport, including to allow for the continuation of military flights and the resumption of commercial and charter flights. We also urge your Administration to assist with the passage of individuals to the airport to safety – both those within Kabul and those outside of the capital – as well as to consider cases where Afghans fleeing quickly may not have been able to collect or gather appropriate documents.Additionally, the support and protection of our Afghan allies is why Congress recently passed, with broad bipartisan support, legislation to make extensive changes to the SIV program. We did so with the goal of improving the process for applicants while maintaining our national security. We were pleased that you immediately signed this legislation to make extensive improvements to the SIV program into law three weeks ago, and now ask that you move just as quickly to ensure it is properly and fully implemented ensuring applicants and their families can get out of harm’s way.To this end, we respectfully request that your Administration immediately implement all aspects of the statute as Congress intended, including:We appreciate the efforts that you and your Administration have made on behalf of Afghans who worked in support of the U.S. in Afghanistan. We must now concentrate all U.S. efforts on supporting and protecting our Afghan allies. Anything short of full implementation results in grave security implications. You have the strong support of both chambers of Congress to ensure that no additional Afghan lives are needlessly lost.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/senators-romney-lee-working-assist-evacuation-efforts-us-and-afghan-citizens,"SALT LAKE CITY—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) issued the following statement about casework efforts to assist the evacuation of U.S. and Afghan citizens from Afghanistan amid the Taliban takeover:“The Administration must do everything in its power to bring American citizens home from Afghanistan and safely evacuate our Afghan partners. Over the past 20 years, thousands of Afghans have risked—and in many cases sacrificed—their lives, and the lives of their families, in aid of the United States. Oftentimes, they have safeguarded the lives of American troops. Now under immediate threat by the Taliban, we have a duty and moral obligation to assist these brave men and women. “Our joint casework team has been working around the clock, engaging with those who have requested assistance—both U.S. and Afghan citizens—for evacuation, as well as visa and refugee application assistance. We have put in inquiries with the State Department on these requests. We and our teams will continue doing everything in our power to assist our citizens and our partners.”BACKGROUND:Senators Romney and Lee merged their casework operations in 2019–a first in the Senate—to best serve the needs of Utahns.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-klobuchar-urge-biden-administration-ensure-safety-journalists-afghanistan,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) sent a letter urging the Biden administration to ensure the safety of journalists, support staff, and their families in Afghanistan.Writing to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, the senators highlighted that “the Taliban have long targeted journalists” and “despite this risk, journalists have been on the front lines…keeping citizens informed and government leaders accountable. Those who contributed to a free and open press in Afghanistan will likely face retribution by the Taliban, and must be brought to safety.”They also noted that just last week, “suspected Taliban members reportedly targeted members of the press, including an Afghan radio station manager in Kabul and a journalist in Helmand province, who were killed and kidnapped respectively.”The senators concluded: “We must ensure journalists are able to do their jobs without fear of harm and provide protection when they are in danger. We appreciate your efforts to ensure the safety of U.S. and Afghan citizens who have supported U.S. efforts over the last 20 years and we look forward to working with you to ensure the continued protection of our citizens and allies.”Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, and Secretary Mayorkas:It is of utmost importance that we continue to prioritize the safety of U.S. citizens and our partners in Afghanistan. Our immediate priority must be ensuring we are doing everything possible to evacuate American citizens, U.S. Embassy personnel, Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and their families, and Afghans targeted by the Taliban.As you work to evacuate American citizens and allies, we encourage you to honor the United States’ commitment to the freedom of press and to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of journalists, supporting staff, and their families in Afghanistan.The Taliban have long targeted journalists, which continues today. Despite this risk, journalists have been on the front lines reporting on the conflict in Afghanistan for 20 years, keeping citizens informed and government leaders accountable. Those who contributed to a free and open press in Afghanistan will likely face retribution by the Taliban, and must be brought to safety. Last week, suspected Taliban members reportedly targeted members of the press, including an Afghan radio station manager in Kabul and a journalist in Helmand province, who were killed and kidnapped respectively. It is of concern that if we do not act now, the Taliban will continue such attacks.There are an estimated 200-plus journalists and support staff in addition to their families in Afghanistan seeking to evacuate the country. Please ensure that as evacuation flights continue, journalists and support staff are not forgotten.We must ensure journalists are able to do their jobs without fear of harm and provide protection when they are in danger. We appreciate your efforts to ensure the safety of U.S. and Afghan citizens who have supported U.S. efforts over the last 20 years and we look forward to working with you to ensure the continued protection of our citizens and allies.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Contrary to his claims, our choice was not between a hasty and ill-prepared retreat or staying forever. The decision to place a higher priority on a political promise than on the lives of innocent men, women, and children is a stain on America’s reputation and undermines our credibility around the world.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The bill represents the largest investment in infrastructure in our nation’s history.“This vote is a historic victory for the American people. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will modernize and upgrade our roads, bridges, ports, and other key infrastructure assets. In doing so, this landmark piece of legislation will create jobs, increase productivity, and pave the way for decades of economic growth and prosperity – all without raising taxes on everyday Americans or increasing inflation.“Importantly, this achievement is a testament to what we can achieve when we join together and do the hard work it takes to move our country forward. This historic bill is the product of months of good-faith negotiations between Republicans and Democrats unified in their desire to do right by the American people.“Congress has talked about truly modernizing our nation’s infrastructure for as long as we can remember.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-amendment-35-trillion-reckless-tax-and-spending-bill-would-prevents-democrats-passing,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today offered an amendment to the Democrats’ fiscal year 2022 budget resolution which would ensure that Democrats do not use reconciliation to pass the largest tax increase in American history.“The Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget proposal—the largest spending bill in American history—would expand government by creating wasteful programs and requiring excessive social spending,” Senator Romney said. “Not only would the plan blow a $1.75 trillion hole in the deficit, it would also include another $1.75 trillion in steep tax increases on hardworking Americans. My amendment would prevent Democrats from passing devastating tax increases on individuals, hiking taxes on job creators, super-charging the IRS, and eliminating the current cap on the SALT Deduction – which is nothing more than a tax cut for the wealthy living in blue states.”Background:
Under the budget resolution, the Senate Finance Committee is directed to increase revenues, including massive tax hikes. The Romney Amendment would preserve the successful tax reforms found in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and ensure the reconciliation bill is not used for any tax increases.Text of the amendment can be found here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The legislation, which passed by a vote of 69-30, now heads to the House.“For decades, elected officials have talked about addressing our nation’s aging infrastructure. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed out of the Senate today turns that talk into reality. While this bill is not perfect—as is the case with a true compromise—it provides a once-in-a-generation investment in our country’s physical infrastructure without raising taxes. That is what people and communities across the country demanded of us.“As one of the fastest growing states in the country, Utah is in serious need of additional infrastructure. This bill would provide Utah the funding to construct new, and rebuild and maintain, its existing roads and highways. It would also help our state mitigate drought conditions, prepare for and respond to wildfires, expand broadband to rural communities, and fulfill critical water needs—which includes funds to bring running water to a substantial part of Utah’s Navajo Nation. I’m proud to have helped negotiate this bill because it gave Utah a seat at the table and benefits Americans across the country.”Background:The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was the work of bipartisan collaboration which will address decades of neglect of our nation’s hard, physical infrastructure. The bipartisan bill represents $550 billion in new spending—not $1.2 trillion—and it includes fiscally responsible pay-fors, such as unused COVID-19 relief funds.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-counters-misinformation-about-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill,"WASHINGTON—Today in a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) countered misinformation about the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, bipartisan infrastructure legislation negotiated by Senator Romney and his colleagues. He highlighted how the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was the work of bipartisan collaboration which will address decades of neglecting our nation’s hard, physical infrastructure. The bill represents $550 billion in new spending—not $1.2 trillion—and it includes the fiscally responsible pay-fors, such as unused COVID-19 relief funds. Details on how the bill would benefit Utah can be found here, and text of the legislation can be found here.Excerpts of Romney’s remarks can be found below and a video of his full speech can be found here.It is said that politics is the art of the possible, and I’m afraid that over time someone might argue that politics has become the art of confusion. There’s so much confusion that goes on around issues of significance, that in some cases the media has a hard time of what is a fact and what is not a fact. Perhaps in some cases the confusion is purposefully spread by politicians and I would like to reduce the confusion for those paying attention to this debate. I’ll begin by focusing on some things that I think we can all agree on.The first is that we as a nation need to invest in our infrastructure. Our highways are often in disrepair. People spend too long getting to and from work. People in business that are shipping goods from one place to another find they get stuck in traffic for a long period of time, it hurts our economy and makes it difficult for us to be competitive globally. I think we can agree with that… I think we can do a better job connecting communities through transit systems like buses that can change their routes as commuting routes also change. I think we can agree broadband ought to be available to all Americans whether in rural areas or low-income areas. Kids need to be able to connect to their schools and get their assignments and follow what’s going on in the world through the media, through the internet. People need to be able to use telehealth to get consults with doctors. If we’re going to have economic growth in our urban areas or rural parts of our country, we need to have businesses know they have access to high-speed internet or they simply won’t go there. Our water systems are in need of repair. We have some water systems that date back a hundred years—pipelines back a hundred years. We’re going to have to upgrade some of these…Wildfires are becoming a bigger and bigger issue in the American West, and we need to have a better program to mitigate and prevent wildfires. Our power grid in many cases needs to be upgraded. It’s vulnerable to cyberattack. It’s also vulnerable to various weather events that cause blackouts in various parts of our country. Fortunately with regards to power in this legislation, we also add some efforts to look at new technologies, nuclear, hydrogen, battery power and so forth as a way to reduce our dependence on oil and gas. Permitting reform—I think we also recognize that sometimes it takes us way too long for projects to get under way. That adds to cost and it’s frustrating to consumers as well. All these elements and more are addressed in this bipartisan infrastructure agreement that’s before the Senate right now. That’s what this bill is all about: addressing those infrastructure needs. I would note that this is not a partisan issue. It has not been. Every modern president—well, I should say every president in the modern era has proposed an infrastructure package, the need to improve our infrastructure.…There’s confusion also about how many pages there are. I mean, the reality is there are 2,700 pages in this bill. And I think the public says how in the world could anyone possibly read something like that and keep up with it. Well, as the presiding officer knows, about 2,000 pages of this were already passed by the various committees of jurisdiction. And some of the people that are most vocal criticizing these 2,700 pages to read—they’ve had access to portions of them because they’re on the committees that passed them. And of course in addition to the 2,000 pages, there are other pages that have been written and are before committees to consider. Something else I’d note—and that is in addition to not having raised taxes to pay for this $550 billion infrastructure program, this bill is paid for. The Congressional Budget Office has scored about one half of it as being paid for under their rules. The other half is also paid for by real dollars…Sometimes, for instance, a pile of funding, a pile of cash, has been previously allocated and not used. And so it goes back to the Treasury and the CBO says we can’t score that because it’s already been appropriated once. I understand that, but it’s real dollars. And you might say why don’t we just let it go back to the Treasury and reduce the deficit? Let me tell you something. That will never happen because our Democrat friends are planning on putting in place a $3.5 trillion bill of their own which would surely grab all of that money and everything else that comes along. So it’s not going to go back into the accounts of the federal government to reduce the deficit and debt. Instead it’s going to be used on the spending spree that my colleagues across the aisle are planning on carrying out soon.I affectionately call that $3.5 trillion spending spree the blue whale. It’s very, very large, the largest. It’s soft and it’s blue. But ours is going to be used for real, hard infrastructure. Of course it’s about one-seventh the size of the blue whale, and I might call it the roadrunner by comparison. I recognize there’s been some criticism of this bill, and it’s not without faults. It was after all the product of work by Republicans and Democrats. Ten of us were tasked by our group of 22 to see if we could come up with something. And to get Republicans and Democrats to agree to something together means that there are some things we like better and some things my colleagues across the aisle like better. There are some things if it just were up to Republicans we wouldn’t have in there. My guess there are some things if it was just up to Democrats they wouldn’t have in there.…I know some people would say, we don’t want to spend any money at all, no bill. Let’s not spend a dollar on infrastructure. That’s, I’m afraid not an option in reality because we have to options. One is to accept the bipartisan work of our respective colleagues and the other is to say hey, because the Democrats have the House and the Senate and the White House, just let them do it all by themselves without any Republican input at all. And I’m pleased that the president decided not to take that course and that the Democrat leadership here in the Senate concluded as well. That’s not the right course to take. The bipartisan approach was better.…Now, there’s another criticism that gets raised and that’s that this bipartisan agreement and the bill before us is just a gateway to the blue whale, that this is going to open the door to the $3.35 trillion—$3.5 trillion plan that the president has proposed. I don’t really follow that one terribly well, that argument, because obviously if there’s no agreement on this legislation, if it doesn’t pass or if the House blows it up in some way, why then this effort, the hard infrastructure effort will just be added to the blue whale, to the $3.5 trillion. That’s going to get done anyway. And this would become part of that. So there’s going to be an effort to pass a blue whale one way or another. I hope it doesn’t pass, by the way, but this is not a gateway to anything but a gateway to better roads, better bridges, better water, better broadband in rural communities and a better economic vitality for our country.…One criticism that’s being made of this bill by some in my party, which is by being in favor of this legislation for $550 billion, we’re going to confuse the voters and they’re going to think that we’re also all part of this big blue whale thing. We’re spending $550 and my colleagues across the aisle want to spend $3.5 trillion, it’s all one big massive spending mess, and it’s going to be hard for the voters to understand the difference. And we’re going to get blamed for the whole mess. I subscribe to what Lindsey Graham said. He said, I think we can make it pretty clear to our voters that we love one and we hate the other. That’s what my Republican colleagues would hopefully say. That’s the way I would say it. I love one and hate the other. But I happen to feel that this is not so much a matter of confusion as a matter of recognition what’s right for America.Because by being for this bill, even though there is a risk of some confusion, we do save about $500 billion for the American people and reduce the deficit over time by about $500 billion…So in my opinion we have to put aside sometimes the politics for what’s absolutely right for America. I’m sure some people are a little disturbed when they see headlines that say oh, this bipartisan effort would look like a win for Biden. Well, it’s a win for Republicans. It’s a win for Biden. It’s a win for Democrats and a win for the Senate to say we can work together. That we can overlook partisan differences to do something that’s right for America. I’m convinced that this is a win for America. I support this legislation. I’m proud to have been part of the effort to help draft it and negotiate it.I admire and respect my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that have worked on this legislation. We calculated just the other day that we had had over 50 meetings amongst that group of individuals, just ones that I attended, over the last several months in preparation for this bill. It is not a slap together effort. It was carefully considered. It was drawn upon and built upon legislation already passed by committees overwhelmingly time and time again wherever we could. And I certainly hope that the senators from both sides of the aisle will join together in passing this legislation, sending it to the House, that the House will address it in a way that’s consistent with what we have agreed to, and we can send it to the president and help America finally get its infrastructure in order.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-republicans-can-vote-bipartisan-bill-or-let-democrats-pass-partisan-infrastructure-bill,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today spoke on the Senate floor about the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, bipartisan infrastructure legislation negotiated by Senator Romney and his colleagues. Details on how the bill would benefit Utah can be found here, and text of the legislation can be found here.Highlights of Romney’s remarks can be found below and video can be found here.I think there is general agreement on both sides of the aisle that we need to improve our infrastructure. If you travel in other countries and you see what they’re doing and then you compare where we are, you think, boy, we used to lead the world in these things and now we’re not. It is having an impact on our productivity as a nation because of the additional travel time necessary for us to get to and from work, as well as other endeavors.    If that’s going to happen, we have only two options right now, and probably for the indefinite future. Right now we have a circumstance where my party is in the minority, not by much. We’re basically tied here in the Senate, although the tie is broken by the Vice President. So the Democrats have a majority in the Senate, in the House, and of course with the White House. Given that circumstance, it’s possible for the Democrats to write an infrastructure bill all by themselves and simply pass it through a process known as reconciliation. That’s one option. The other option is to work together on a bipartisan basis where we craft a better bill with the input of Republicans and Democrats. That’s the option that’s before us now. There is not a third alternative, which is Republicans only draft the bill. I’d love that alternative. It’s just not available to us because we don’t hold the House, the Senate, and the White House. So we have two options. Do we want our Democrat colleagues to draft a bill all by themselves or do we want to work together with Republicans and Democrats and fashion something that’s bipartisan?Now some would say we could do better. Let’s have another alternative, a different bipartisan approach. My answer is, go at it. Have at it. No one’s keeping people from working together if they want to come up with a better piece of legislation. Boy, I’d be anxious to see what it is. But in order to get a bill passed, it must be acceptable to Democrats and Republicans.Again, the alternative is if you can come up with a better bipartisan bill, do it. Two, amend it as you feel appropriate, and I think there are good amendments that are coming forward that I have supported and will support going forward. But we must not let the desire for perfection on the part of people like myself overcome the desire to have a good bill ultimately reached. I think it’s actually counterproductive for either side to take attack shots at the items in the bill they don’t like. Instead bring forward amendments, see if you can improve the bill. If you can’t do that, come up with a bill that has bipartisan support because that’s the only alternative we face other than a bill drafted exclusively by Democrats.I for one think this bill is a good bill on balance. It will be good for my state. I think it will be good for every state. We’ll get an upgrade, a badly needed upgrade in the infrastructure of this country. Again, is it ideal? Perfect? Far from it. But it’s a big step forward and one heck of a huge step of advantage relative to having one party alone write a piece of legislation. I think it’s fair to say if Democrats alone write an infrastructure bill, my state of Utah won’t be real happy by the time that’s done.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/great-news-utah-what-utahns-are-saying-about-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill,"WASHINGTON—Support grew across Utah this week for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, bipartisan infrastructure legislation negotiated by U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) and his colleagues. Details on how the bill would benefit Utah can be found here, and text of the legislation can be found here.“Our bill is not perfect—it is paid for. I want to note that if the Democrats were to have written the bill entirely on their own, Utah would probably have ended up with the short end of the stick. Because of our involvement in this effort, some of our rural states like mine have been able to have a seat at the table. This means limiting the spending on bad policy that only benefits the rich, coastal cities in the East and the far West,” Senator Romney said on the Senate floor this week. “So, I’m proud of this bill because it benefits Americans across the country. For decades elected officials have talked about addressing our nation’s infrastructure. This infrastructure bill turns that talk into reality, without raising taxes on hard working Americans or adding to our debt.”“We’re thrilled with [money] for the Navajo Utah Water Settlement to bring drinking water to our Navajo neighbors. Also happy to see other Utah priorities, like the Central Utah Project and [money] for water storage, drought, [and]  fire mitigation. Thanks to Senator Romney for the great work.” –Utah Governor Spencer Cox“We are grateful for the funding for the Navajo Utah Water Settlement Act in the pending infrastructure bill, which will bring desperately needed drinking water to the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation. We commend Governor Cox, Senator Romney, and Senator Sinema for their leadership.” –Jonathan Nez, President, Navajo Nation“Transportation infrastructure is key to economic vitality and enhancing our quality of life, especially for fast growing states like Utah.  We appreciate Senator Romney’s good work to develop and advance provisions in the infrastructure bill that provide Utah with the flexibility and tools we need to tailor transportation solutions that meet our needs.” –Carlos Braceras, P.E., Executive Director, Utah Department of Transportation“Senator Romney, I want to personally thank you for your support of the infrastructure bill and thank you for your leadership on this. Utah really needs this kind of visionary thinking and leadership and I want to offer whatever personal support I can. Again thank you for your leadership and you have my full personal support.”—Mike Caldwell, Mayor, City of Ogden, and President, League of Cities and Towns“I appreciate Senator Romney’s work to reach a compromise which can garner bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill our country and our state desperately need.  Once again, the Senator has demonstrated his commitment to bipartisan leadership. I recognize this is a bill which does not please everyone, however, improving our transportation and broadband infrastructure is critical to our economic competitiveness in global markets and to provide good-paying jobs for our citizens.  I support this bill both in my capacity as Mayor and as Chair of the Wasatch Front Regional Council. If there is anything I can do to help advance this critical bill, please let me know how I can help.” –Jeff Silvestrini, Mayor, City of Millcreek and Chair, Wasatch Front Regional Council“The funding provided in the bipartisan infrastructure bill will allow us to complete the Central Utah Project in half the time allowing us to deliver much needed additional water to the Wasatch front. This is great news for Utah and our efforts to combat the drought.” –Gene Shawcroft, Commissioner, Central Utah Water Conservancy District General Manager, Utah Colorado River“Utah is the fastest growing state in the nation and is now facing its worst drought on record. These challenges illustrate the importance of additional investments in water conservation, water supply development and infrastructure. The bipartisan infrastructure bill is a great step forward as Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District works to cultivate a resilient water future for our community.” –Bart Forsyth, General Manager, Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District“Weber Basin Water Conservancy District would like to express our gratitude for the time and effort expended in securing additional funding for the Department of the Interior’s WaterSMART program. The WaterSMART program has augmented the District’s aggressive water conservation efforts. These efforts include the completion of a Drought Contingency Plan, secondary meter installations, lining of large canals, completion of a water conservation and management plan, and several other educational programs. We recognize the importance of conservation in our often water-short basin due to the effects of drought. Weber Basin Water Conservancy District is continually working to promote the conservation and efficient use of the limited water supply in Northern Utah. Continued funding of programs like WaterSMART ensure the completion of costly conservation programs are prioritized and aggressively pursued.” –Tage Flint, General Manager, Weber Basin Water Conservancy District“We applaud Senator Romney’s leadership on this important legislation. The bill is critical for Utah’s water future given the current drought situation. It provides robust funding for programs that facilitate water infrastructure investment, comprehensive drought planning, and promotes water conservation measures. Washington County Water Conservancy District’s priorities are made possible through this legislation especially through the new funding opportunities available for water recycling and reuse projects that can help us to achieve the most efficient use of our limited water supplies.” –Zach Renstrom, General Manager, Washington County Water Conservancy District“After weeks of negotiating the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, an agreement was reached and the U.S. Senate voted to bring the bipartisan deal to the Senate floor for consideration. The Salt Lake Chamber supports this historic investment that will help Utah expand and repair its roads, mitigate devastating drought conditions, fulfill critical water needs, and prepare for and respond to the wildfires. The investment in Utah’s infrastructure is not only key for the local economy but also vital in the competition of the global market. The Salt Lake Chamber  urges our delegation to advance meaningful infrastructure legislation to help ensure that our economy remains competitive.” –Derek Miller, President and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber“UTA strongly supports the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we commend the efforts of the bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Mitt Romney, who have tirelessly worked to make this infrastructure bill a reality. This important legislation will provide for much-needed federal investment in our nation’s critical infrastructure, which includes funding for improvements and expansion to our public transit system here in Utah. This bipartisan infrastructure bill will help Utah build out the transportation infrastructure projects needed to address our state’s population growth, air quality, and traffic congestion challenges.” –Carlton Christensen, Chair of the Board of Trustees at Utah Transit Authority“We recognize Senator Romney’s significant role in moving ahead a bipartisan infrastructure bill. This bill will provide improved mobility for the citizens of Utah and the United States. We appreciate the critical funding that this bill provides to smaller urban transit systems like Cache Valley Transit so that we can continue to connect individuals to the people and places that matter most.” –Todd Beutler, CEO and General Manager, Cache Valley Transit District“Wasatch Front Regional Council is grateful for Senator Mitt Romney’s leadership as one of the primary authors and negotiators of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, giving Utah a seat at the table and advocating for Utah’s and the nation’s pressing infrastructure needs. As the fastest growing state in the nation over the past ten years, Utah is well-poised to put these infrastructure investments to work. Through our extensive and collaborative planning and prioritization processes, Utah’s Unified Transportation Plan identifies the priority investments needed in our roads, transit, and active transportation in the decades to come. This critically important infrastructure legislation, when paired with historic state investments in Utah’s multi-modal transportation system and local investments, will help Utah address its transportation needs into the future. And by reauthorizing the core transportation programs for five years, this legislation provides Utah the stability and predictability it needs for its infrastructure development. This legislation will help us to maintain a strong economy, good mobility and access, and high quality of life.” –Andrew Gruber, Executive Director, Wasatch Regional Council“If our nation is going to invest tens of billions of dollars in broadband infrastructure, Americans should have an expectation that those investments will last and deliver meaningful service for decades. Fiber Networks are essential for delivering such service. Funding for such advanced networks should be targeted to those Americans most lacking in the ability to access sufficient service now, with funding directed to additional areas only after we’ve focused first efforts on those Americans most in need. Further, private industry is better at building and managing such fiber networks and any legislation should not favor government networks. If implemented properly, this bill could drive such results—but careful execution will be essential. We look forward to continuing to work with the Administration and Congress to talk through potential refinements to the legislation that could better ensure such outcomes and ultimately on the successful implementation of any programs created through such legislation once enacted.” –Brock Johansen, CEO, Emery Telcom“The bipartisan infrastructure bill would be terrific news for the new Salt Lake International Airport. We have three more years of construction in front of us, and this financial support comes at exactly the right time for us to complete this project. The new Salt Lake City International Airport will help propel Utah’s economy forward for decades and decades to come, exactly the intent of infrastructure spending.” –Bill Wyatt, Executive Director of the Salt Lake City International Airport“Increased funding of the Emergency Watershed Program is critical to Duchesne County’s citizens to help recover from wildfire damages and resulting flooding happening currently.  Likewise, Duchesne County supports the increased funding for wildfire mitigation and recovery in the Senate infrastructure package.  We thank Senator Romney for his hard work in fighting for these important issues impacting our County today.”  –Duchesne County Commissioners“Cache Valley is facing unprecedented growth and at the same time we find ourselves in the midst of historic drought. The Senate infrastructure legislation makes valuable investments not just in roads, bridges, transit and airports but also much need water infrastructure and specifically western drought resilience for agriculture and communities, something we desperately need right now.”  –Holly Daines, Mayor, Logan City“In our region (Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan Counties), the possibility for funding to improve rural infrastructure is paramount. The region is very grateful for Senator Romney’s effort to provide that funding through the infrastructure bill. Often projects in the region are funded by mineral lease revenues, which have decreased annually. The region’s needs can be addressed with this bill and provide enhanced sustainable funding options for diversifying our energy and tourism economies. Thank you for supporting rural Utah.” –Geri C. Gamber, Executive Director, SEUALG/SEUEDD“We commend the United States Senate and Senator Romney for including in the infrastructure package vital funding for flood control, including repair and replacement of bridges damaged from flooding.  We also support funding for airport infrastructure.  Uintah County’s residents, like much of rural Utah, are in need of these infrastructure investments and we are hopeful that rural Utah is included in the disbursement of these funds.” –Uintah County Commission“No bill is perfect, but we applaud Senator Mitt Romney for staying in the discussions and ensuring this bill doesn’t add to the deficit or inflation. Our nation cannot keep kicking this can down the road. Thank you, Senator!” –Professional Republican Women of Utah“The Utah Lake Commission (Commission) wholeheartedly supports the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Commission was created with a primary goal of focusing efforts on enhancing Utah Lake to help it flourish as a natural resource and facilitate restoration work to the Lake and its shores. Investments in water infrastructure help the public and the State of Utah assure that one of the State’s largest natural treasures is restored, protected and enhanced. These critical investments will allow current and future generations to enjoy this incredible resource. As we have followed the work of Senator Romney and those members of the Senate involved in putting together this Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, it has been great to observe the focus given to water resilience and western water infrastructure. The Commission has partnered with the Utah Division of Water Quality on the Utah Lake Water Quality Study and work closely with the Utah Lake Restoration Project that was authorized by the Utah State Legislature and signed by Governor Herbert in 2017, all in an effort to reach similar water goals. Federal funding will play an important role in restoring the lake and we are grateful for Senator Romney’s leadership on this vital issue. Thank you very much for your leadership and support.” –Eric J. Ellis, Executive Director, Utah Lake Commission“America’s productivity, global competitiveness, and quality of life depend on Congress making a durable commitment and clear strategy that will invest in and modernize our crumbling roads, bridges, transit, rail, water and energy infrastructure, broadband access, and more. We applaud Utah’s Senator Romney and the bipartisan Senate group, who’ve worked tirelessly to achieve agreement on this much-needed infrastructure proposal.” –Utah Valley Chamber of CommerceUpdated to include additional statements on August 13, 2021.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-biden-administrations-border-immigration-policies-are-monumental-disaster,"WASHINGTON—At a Homeland Security Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) pressed Secretary Mayorkas on the Administration’s disastrous border and immigration policies, particularly its reconciliation bill which would provide $250-$300/month, per child, to every illegal immigrant with an ITIN, which he argued would encourage illegal immigration and create a major expense for the federal government. He also expressed concern to FBI Director Wray regarding the rise of domestic violence and extremism in the United States.His exchange with Secretary Mayorkas and Director Wray can be found below and video can be found here.Senator Romney: Director Wray, are the threats from domestic violent extremists rising, and if they are, are they rising based on those that are, if you will, inspired from foreign groups? Or are they rising from those that are inspired by domestic groups? I don’t know whether you distinguish that way, but my impression is that it’s substantially increasing but largely domestic, but that may not be the case. Are the threats greater from these individuals and by source, domestic or international?Director Wray: So when it comes to sort of homeland-based terrorist threats, we have two buckets, really, that we primarily focus on as the highest priority right now: what we call homegrown violent extremists, which is a reference to people here radicalized by foreign terrorist organizations and ideologies, and then domestic violent extremists, who are radicalized more by everything from racial immanence all the way over to anti-government, anti-authority. The first bucket, the homegrown violent extremists, has been humming along fairly consistently at about 1,000 investigations, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, over the last few years. The domestic violent extremist bucket has been going up quite significantly over the last few years, which is why we’re now at 2,700 domestic terrorism investigations, when if you went back two and a half years ago, we were probably at more about 1,000. So it’s been a really significant jump there. We are concerned that with developments in Afghanistan, among other things, that there will be more inspiration to the first bucket, as well. So I think we anticipate, unfortunately, growth in both categories as we look ahead over the next couple of years.Romney: That is daunting and we may get a chance to talk about why you might believe that the latter group, the homegrown domestic-inspired violent extremists, is rising. Secretary Mayorkas, I think any unbiased person would say that the Biden Administration’s border and immigration policies have been nothing short of a monumental disaster. And were there not so many other disasters that the Administration is encountering, it probably would be, by itself, enough for a government to be hanging on by a thread. We’ve had our disagreements in the past about how much of the illegal immigration problem is caused by pull versus push factors, and your view that we need to address so-called root causes, which is poverty and corruption in other countries. My view is that we can’t solve the problems of the rest of the world. In fact, we can’t solve all of our own problems, let alone for the rest of the world. But what we can address are the unnecessary pull factors, if you will, the unnecessary features that we have in place that draw people into coming into our country illegally. And let me just discuss with taxes. If an illegal individual wants to work here and wants to pay U.S. taxes, they’re able to do that, is that right? They’re able to do that by getting an identification number, is that right?Secretary Mayorkas: I believe they are, Senator.Romney: I think they’re called an ITIN, they can apply for an ITIN, they are able to do so. Under the Administration’s human infrastructure bill, their children can also get an ITIN, can also get that tax number for the same purpose or for whatever purpose they might have?Mayorkas: I don’t know the answer to your question, Senator.Romney: The answer is, yes, they can. The President’s so-called human infrastructure bill also provides $300 per month for every child who obtains such a number. So under the bill that is being proposed and considered by Congress, we’ll be paying the illegal immigrant $300 per month for each and every one of their children that obtain such a number. So a family of four who would come here illegally would receive as much as $1,200 per month in checks from the U.S. government—well above the wage and the average wage throughout major parts of Latin America. Do you think that this provision, which would allow the children of those that have come here illegally to receive monthly payments, would represent an unfortunate and damaging pull factor that would draw more and more people into our country illegally?Mayorkas: Senator, I think that speaks to the fact that we have more than 11 million undocumented individuals already present in the United States, a population that has been growing for decades by reason of a broken immigration system. I don’t think it speaks to individuals who have not arrived in the United States.Romney: Clearly, if you can get paid $300 per child even though the child is here illegally and you’re here legally, that’s going to encourage people to come here. It’s also going to represent a major expense for our government to pay the children of those that are here illegally at $300 per month. One, it’s expensive, and two, it creates a greater draw to come to the country.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/colorado-river-trip-romney-and-bennet-collaborate-bipartisan-western-approach-building-climate,"
SALT LAKE CITY—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) today led a Colorado River trip focused on solutions to building climate resilience in the West. From Hittle Bottom to the Rocky Rapid campground outside of Moab, Utah, the senators floated the river with Colorado and Utah leaders from water, agriculture, business, and environmental communities and local government and discussed a bipartisan approach to address drought, wildfire, mudslides in the West. Photos and video of the trip are available for download here.“I appreciate Senator Bennet for the kind invitation to join him for today’s float trip down the Colorado River. It was an honor to have Utah’s Lieutenant Governor, local officials, and community leaders from our state join us, as well. What we are witnessing in Utah and throughout the West is an historic drought. The changing climate means that we are going to have to rethink how we solve the West’s water challenges, and today’s trip was an opportunity to begin to build consensus toward addressing them,” said Senator Romney. “I look forward to our continued work in the Senate to find solutions to climate-related challenges so that we can do our part to leave the world in a better place for our children and grandchildren.”“I’m grateful to Senator Romney for welcoming me to his beautiful state. Days like today are why I feel optimistic that we will find a way forward on our climate challenges, and why I feel strongly that the West has to lead in this endeavor,” said Senator Bennet. “In the West, we come together to take on shared challenges, and we need that same spirit in Washington to create meaningful and durable solutions to climate change.”“Utah is known for its national parks and beautiful landscapes. Right now, we’re also the fastest growing state in our nation,” said Utah Lt. Governer Deidre Henderson. “As our kids and grandkids grow up, it’s important that we make sure our state remains a place where they want to raise their families—and the historic drought facing the West complicates that. We have an opportunity here to work with our neighbors to the east on solutions that help ease the burdens our communities face because of the drought.”“Water issues are not new to the West. This drought came on quickly, and we’ve seen our communities come together and act to conserve our outdoor water resources,” said Gene Shawcroft, Commissioner, Utah Upper Colorado River Commission. “Today’s trip provided us the opportunity to meet with our counterparts from Colorado to discuss ways in which we can work together to find solutions that better manage our water and mitigate drought conditions. Understanding other people’s perspectives is critically important to tackle these big issues.”Romney and Bennet have worked together for years to find meaningful solutions to issues affecting the West. In 2019, the senators asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP), specifically asking GAO to recommend improvements and consider the challenges the senators have heard about in using the program for wildfire recovery. In December 2019, the GAO accepted their request and is currently reviewing the program.Romney and Bennet later introduced the MATCH Act in January 2020 and again in 2021 to improve the EWP program, which will expedite wildfire recovery, save taxpayers money, and prevent further disasters.Download photos and video from the trip HERE.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/senator-romney-commemorates-constitution-day,"SALT LAKE CITY—In honor of Constitution Day today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) delivered a speech titled “Our Constitutional Order: Freedom, Responsibility, and Power,” at BYU’s Wheatley Institution. A full video of his remarks can be found here.Senator Romney’s remarks as prepared for delivery:I appreciate the honor of being asked to speak at my alma mater—especially after such a big week. It’s a great time to be a Cougar!The school looks different than when I was in school here. I know that I look different, as well. I haven’t minded getting older, but my body isn’t taking it very well. Sometimes I long for those simpler times, when bread was good for you and no one had heard of kale.Today, we address the Constitution. Truthfully, I didn’t give much thought to the Constitution when I was here. And even in law school, I thought of my constitutional law class as just one more subject to pass.Studying history more thoughtfully, reading the works of the Founders, and traveling to dozens of other countries changed that.Our Constitution was a far more dramatic departure from history than I had appreciated.From the beginning of humanity, history was characterized by strong men assembling the muscle from collaborators to dominate, rule, and generally oppress others. They were the feudal lord, Tzar, Caesar, Pharaoh, warlord, Chief, Emperor, or king. All authoritarians, most of them tyrants.I have a chart in my office that traces the military and economic might of civilizations from 2,000 BC until today. In the over 4,000 years of human history, dominating civilizations have come and gone: the Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Mongolians, Romans, Chinese, and even the British. Only a few short-lived sparks of democracy intrude on a virtually uninterrupted flow of authoritarian domination.Why am I telling you this? Because authoritarianism is the default setting of human history.Knowing history as they did, some of our Founders may have wondered whether to include some form or aspects of authoritarianism in our governmental structure in order to improve the likelihood of national survival. After all, America’s geographic isolation and the potential to someday build a robust military could have made that a credible option. But the Founders wanted something more than national survival: they wanted the people of America to enjoy “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” They earnestly believed that God had endowed every person with “unalienable rights.” They believed that all persons were equal in His sight.Throughout history, autocracies had oppressed people, and had denied people these fundamental rights. So, the Founders worked assiduously to escape the perilous attraction of authoritarianism. But authoritarianism, as you know, was not the only peril they feared. They also feared pure democracy.James Madison described such pure or unfettered democracies as “spectacles of turbulence and contention…incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.”I think John Adams expressed the peril of pure democracy best:“Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true…and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men… and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty….Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.”The Founders’ task…and brilliance…was crafting a system of government that would thread the needle between the two perils that had doomed every human civilization for 4,000 years: autocracy on one side and pure democracy on the other.This they accomplished in the ways in which we are all familiar: three separate and equal branches of government, an electoral college to elect the president, two senators from each state regardless of state population, lifetime appointments for members of the judiciary, and the primacy of state powers except for specific narrow, enumerated federal powers. I acknowledge that some of the constitutional provisions to safeguard against pure democracy have eroded since the founding, but most do in fact endure.What the Founders crafted was not just elegant in design: it was a radical departure from history. Note the uncertainty for the nation’s future in Benjamin Franklin’s purported response to a questioner: “A Republic, if you can keep it” was shared by his colleagues and his countrymen. A nation ‘by, for and of the people’ had never long survived.It is important to note that the Founders did not craft a perfect union. They, instead, crafted a way for the American people to build a “more perfect union.” Institutions and norms were in fact built over the ensuing decades. The sin of slavery was eventually eradicated. The first president voluntarily transferred power to his successor. The Supreme Court established the power of judicial review. The departments of the executive branch were created. Rules and procedures were adopted by each of the three branches of government. Through our Constitution and the institutions and norms that have followed, the nation has avoided the shoals of authoritarianism and pure democracy that the Founders feared. We have threaded the needle.During my adolescence, the world was divided between two competing systems: Russian-led authoritarianism and American-led liberal democracy. True to historic precedent, the authoritarian competitor sought to conquer its competition through the use of force rather than through persuasion.Growing up in the 50’s and 60’s, we experienced a shadow of fear. We actually had drills in school where we got under our desks for protection from possible Soviet bomb blasts. In my science class, there was a scale model of the Soviet satellite, Sputnik. It hung on the ceiling above our heads, reminding us that Russians would be able to watch us and attack us from space. There was a little ditty we sang back then: “button up your overcoat, put you goggles on, close your eyes when you realize it’s an atom bomb.” I tried to convince my dad to build a bomb shelter in our back yard. We scoped it out together on afternoon, but in the end, he demurred.Many of you cannot imagine the relief, the lifting of an oppressing cloud, when the Soviet Union fell. History was over. Liberal democracy had won. Russia was going to emulate the West. China began to open up its economy. We even began to dismantle parts of our military.Unfortunately, history has reasserted itself, with vengeance. I say “with vengeance” for two reasons: first, because the authoritarians of today are a good deal stronger relative to us than was the Soviet Union of the last century. And second, because America’s resolve to hew to the constitutional bulwarks against authoritarianism and pure democracy is less certain.I’m sure you recognize that authoritarianism is in ascendency. Freedom House reports that liberal democracy is in a decade-long decline. This is quite a reversal from what we had expected. Not many years ago, we thought that China would ultimately become democratic as it adopted capitalism and joined the G-20. We cheered as Russia held elections. Then, the only poster boys of authoritarianism were the little chubby guy with a bad haircut in North Korea and the septuagenarian revolutionary in Cuba.Today, China censors its media, shreds its promise of self-rule for people of Hong Kong, and oppresses minorities and even people of faith. Chinese leaders insist that crosses be removed from churches and be replaced with the Chinese flag, that the national anthem be sung in all church services, that church officials are approved by the government, and that the only legal Bible that may be purchased is one that the government has re-written.China is carrying out genocide against its largest minority. Nearly one million Uyghurs have been imprisoned in concentration camps, complete with brainwashing and forced labor. Children are separated from their parents. And when fathers are taken, Han Chinese men are sent into their home to “monitor” their wives. Sexual assault and forced sterilizations are common occurrences. What the Chinese Communist Party is perpetrating on the Uyghur people is atrocity not seen or imagined coming from a nation in our era.Russia’s Putin actually murders his political opponents. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny—after an unsuccessful assassination attempt—was arrested, subjected to a sham trial, and subsequently jailed. Dissenters Boris Nemtsov and Sergei Magnitsky were both assassinated.Venezuela’s Maduro brutalizes what citizens have not already fled. Assad has killed hundreds of thousands of his Syrian countrymen. And sadly, the Taliban flag flies atop the presidential palace in Afghanistan.What is even more surprising than the appalling brutality of the authoritarian regimes is their relative economic and military strength. Russia has expanded and modernized its nuclear arsenal. Today, it is not only larger than ours, it is more advanced. China’s navy is also larger than our own and it has been specifically designed to defeat us. It’s space weapon, missile, and nuclear weapon programs are in high gear.Military might is limited by a nation’s economic might. The communism of the old Soviet Union was simply unable to keep pace with the robust strength of capitalism in the West. But China jettisoned Marxism and much of socialism and has adopted a form of capitalism, combined with Leninism. China’s economy will surpass ours within the next ten years—measured by purchase power parity, it is already larger. And given China’s population, its economy will eventually be much larger than ours. GDP is the product of two things: the size of a nation’s workforce and the output per worker. More Chinese workers will mean a larger GDP. China has made it clear that it intends to be the economic, military, and geopolitical leader of the world.Yes, today’s autocracies, led by China, are becoming stronger. But at the same time, our resolve to follow the Constitution’s path, avoiding the perils of authoritarianism on one hand and pure democracy on the other, is wavering.No more stunning evidence of this was the attempt to prevent the lawful and constitutional transfer of power on January 6th. It followed from the President of the United States claiming that the election had been stolen from him. His purported evidence spun from pillar to post, from counterfeit ballots imported from China, to stuffed ballot boxes, to dead voters, to voting machines manipulated from afar.Even more recently, a prominent TV pundit traveled to Hungary to extol Victor Orbán as a model for us to emulate. Orbán censors the media in his country, ignores the will of the people in elections, and amasses wealth and power for himself and his cronies. Hungary is ranked as one of the least free, least democratic countries in the developed world. Hungary, a model for America?As I was running for the Senate, I held quite a number of town hall meetings. In one, a woman asked me if I would vote to remove NBC, CBS, and ABC from the air. I said no, of course. I presumed that she had a point she was going to make about something I had said. But no, her point was simply that they should not be allowed on TV. She said that networks like that said things that were wrong and that they should be shut down. I have since learned that her perspective is not as singular as I had imagined.Constitutional and institutional guardrails are under less obvious but just as real challenges elsewhere. Politicians clamor to eliminate the electoral college. Many of my Democrat colleagues want to pack the Supreme Court, the logic apparently being that whoever has the majority in Congress should be able to conform the Court to its political philosophy. The Court would cease to be a separate and equal branch and become instead a subsidiary, partisan branch.The same sentiment applies to the effort to eliminate the filibuster. Despite its name, this is not really a rule about senators giving interminable speeches; it is a rule that requires 60 votes for most major legislation to pass. Accordingly, compromise between the two parties is required for a bill to pass and this, in turn, gives the minority a voice and a certain measure of power. And it therefore slows things down. Madison explained that the Senate would serve as a “necessary fence” against the “fickleness and passion” that often influenced the public and the House of Representatives. George Washington is said to have described the Senate as a “saucer” that cooled legislation passed out of the House, like a saucer catches hot tea that overflows from a cup.Since its early history, Senate rules have therefore allowed unlimited debate. The filibuster rule has been a cornerstone of the institution for nearly two centuries. Eliminating it would forever change one of the key institutions of our Republic, one that checks the power of the majority and preserves the influence of the minority. Doing so would draw us closer to the shoal of pure democracy.With the economic and military power of autocratic China and Russia increasing and American resolve to avoid authoritarianism and pure democracy declining, freedom itself—the right of every person to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness—is in the balance.What is required of us who love freedom, the Constitution, and America?First, our leaders in Washington must take action to prevent China from continuing to build its economic might through predatory means, through practices that violate the rules of international trade and order. China must not be allowed to continue to steal intellectual property. It must not be allowed to massively subsidize industries that then bankrupt the companies that abide by international rules. It must not be allowed to monopolize key raw materials. The United States alone is not able to enforce these restrictions—our economy is simply not large enough to discipline their malevolent behavior. It is imperative that we join forces with the other nations that abide by the rules of international order to clearly establish accepted practices and deny access to our markets to China if it flaunts them.But there is work to do here at home as well. Among many other things, we must modernize our military. We must endeavor to make our businesses more successful and competitive. We should invest a great deal more in emerging technologies. One commentator has truthfully said that every bill before Congress should be evaluated by whether or not it strengthens America vs. China. Every bill.One more thing for all of us here. Please excuse me for a personal reference. The founder of my religion is reported to have said that the Constitution of the United States would someday “hang, as it were, by a thread.” Further that “the Elders of the Church would save it.” Now they didn’t have tape recorders or smart phones back then and I’m not at all sure he actually said that. But if you’ll allow me some literary license, I’d suggest that this sentiment may apply to all of us—not just to a few Latter-day Saints and Elders. We can help “thread the needle” between authoritarianism and pure democracy by exercising what the Founders called “public virtues:” listening respectfully to the opinions of others, expanding our sources of information beyond those we agree with, defending the entire Constitution rather than just the parts we like, voting for men and women of character and probity, and acknowledging that there is a great deal that we just don’t know.The Founders gave us a Republic. As Benjamin Franklin said, it is up to us to keep it.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-rubio-reintroduce-bill-giving-parents-option-paid-leave,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) reintroduced the New Parents Act, legislation which creates a voluntary option for paid parental leave by allowing new parents to use a portion of their Social Security after the birth or adoption of a child. The bill also provides parents the flexibility to use their benefits in a way that works best for their household by allowing parents to combine their leaves, or transfer them to one parent. Many parents, especially those with low incomes, will be able to finance three months of leave, or longer, under the New Parents Act. A one pager of the bill, which the senators first introduced last Congress, is available here.“American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low,” Romney said. “In Utah, and throughout the United States, a majority of working parents do not get paid when they take time off from work after the birth or adoption of a child, which can mean depleted savings, credit card debt, and student loan defaults. We are reintroducing the New Parents Act in order to give parents the flexibility to take time off from work with pay during the first weeks of their children’s lives, without growing our national debt, raising taxes, or creating a new entitlement program.”“Our economic policies need to reflect our values, and right now far too many young, working families are falling behind,” Rubio said. “We can support working and stay-at-home moms and dads alike without raising taxes or expanding federal bureaucracy. Our New Parents Act would give young families much-needed flexibility in how they choose to use their money and support their family.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-presses-secretary-blinken-disastrous-afghanistan-withdrawal,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing pressed Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. He highlighted the importance of ensuring that U.S. legal permanent residents and partners, including SIV applicants, are safely evacuated from Afghanistan. In response to the Senator’s questioning, Secretary Blinken also confirmed that the Taliban’s relationship with Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network “has not been severed,” and acknowledged that in light of renewed terrorist threats, the Administration may have to reevaluate its stance on the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force.Excerpts of his exchange with Secretary Blinken can be found below.Romney: I was one of those that felt that President Trump was wrong to enter into an agreement to withdraw, and that President Biden was wrong to continue with that agreement to withdraw, and I was appalled by the disastrous withdrawal process itself. For us today, however, I would like to focus more on the moral stain of leaving people behind and understand what we can do to make sure that we’re not leaving people behind. I understand that we’re down to a small number of Americans—it is hard to know exactly how many are left behind. But in terms of legal permanent residents, is your priority just as high to get them out as it is to get out citizens or is there a different level of commitment for a legal permanent resident’s return to the United States relative to a citizen?Blinken: Senator, our number one priority is American citizens and that has long been the case. In this situation, in Afghanistan and this emergency evacuation in Afghanistan, we did everything that we could, as well, to make sure that legal permanent residents, green card holders, would identify themselves to us. We don’t know at any given time how many there are at any given country around the world and to make available resources to help them but our number one priority is any remaining American citizens who wish to leave.Romney: I didn’t recognize there is a second level of priority for a legal permanent resident. If that’s the case, we don’t know the exact number, but how many legal permanent residents are we convinced are still in Afghanistan?Blinken: We don’t have an exact number, but it is in the thousands.Romney: Likewise, in terms of SIV holders or applicants or people who have worked with us that have been our partners through the years, how many of them approximately are still in Afghanistan that want to come to the United StatesBlinken: So this is what we’re doing an accounting of right now, based on two things. Based on the pipeline of applicants as it existed, before the evacuation, and then looking at those who we were able to evacuate. We don’t have those numbers yet because as we moved to evacuate people, a number of them are still at transit points around the world.Romney: But it would be tens of thousands?Blinken: So, realistically, two things. One, we talked about this a little bit earlier, but of the applicants in the program, and as I said we inherited about 18,000. About half of those, and this remains more or less the case now, are at a point where it is before the chief of mission has given his or her approval that they are eligible for the program.Romney: I was looking for a number, and the question I was leading to is that given the fact that the SIV process was too slow and not undertaken during the Trump years in a significant way. You sped it up. That is great. You knew that there was no way you were going to get all of these people out in time…Given the rapid collapse of the Afghan security forces, and you said yesterday that you inherited a date, but in fact you didn’t inherit the date. The date was May 1st and you pushed it to August 31st. Why didn’t you push it much later so we would have been able to process the SIV applicants, as well as those who have worked with us that had not yet applied? I don’t understand why a date was actually not inherited and a date was not selected that would be sufficient to actually remove people from the nation in a way that would be in keeping with our moral commitment to honor our citizens, our green card holders, as well as those who have worked with us over the years?Blinken: Two things if I may. First, we took some risk in terms of what the Taliban would do or not do after May 1st in pushing beyond May 1st, and we of course worked this very hard.Romney: Well it is a risk with other people we took. The risk was on people we care for.Blinken: The military told us in order to do the drawdown from Afghanistan in a safe and orderly way, it needed three to four months. That’s why we pushed to move beyond May 1st and get to the end of August, early September. Second, to your point, which is an important and good one, our expectation was that beyond August 31st, beyond the military drawdown, the government, the security forces were going to remain in control of Kabul, of the major cities, our embassy was fully planned to remain up and running. We were leaving about 600 military behind to make sure that we could secure the embassy so that it would continue to operate. We had a robust plan to include bringing out anyone who wished to leave, notably SIVs. That was very much the plan and the expectation. What we did not anticipate was that 11-day collapse of the security forces. That’s what changed everything.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-klobuchar-urge-biden-administration-support-work-journalists-fleeing-afghanistan,"SALT LAKE CITY—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) sent a letter urging the Biden Administration to help Afghan journalists resettle and continue working. Earlier this month, Senators Romney and Klobuchar sent a letter urging the Biden Administration to ensure the safe evacuation of journalists, support staff, and their families from Afghanistan.Writing to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, the senators said, “as the Taliban takes over, there are concerns that given their long history of attacks on journalists, the Taliban will eliminate a free and open media and continue to suppress, imprison, and violently target the press.”The senators continued, “We urge the Administration to expand partnerships with members of the media, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and other concerned governments in an effort to support employment opportunities for Afghan journalists who can use their accreditations and skills to continue to provide open and transparent news on Afghanistan. Their knowledge of Afghanistan and the region is invaluable and their skills should be used to provide news not only to the people in Afghanistan but to inform those outside of the country about current events in Afghanistan.”Full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas: We appreciate the continued efforts to evacuate American citizens, Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants, Priority 1 and 2 designees, vulnerable Afghans, and their families, including more than 200 journalists and support staff, from Afghanistan. As evacuation efforts continue and we welcome Afghans into the United States, we encourage you to take steps to help Afghan journalists resettle and continue their important work.Afghan journalists served alongside their American counterparts for 20 years, risking their lives to report the truth and to hold government leaders accountable. As the Taliban takes over, there are concerns that given their long history of attacks on journalists, the Taliban will eliminate a free and open media and continue to suppress, imprison, and violently target the press.We urge the Administration to expand partnerships with members of the media, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and other concerned governments in an effort to support employment opportunities for Afghan journalists who can use their accreditations and skills to continue to provide open and transparent news on Afghanistan. Their knowledge of Afghanistan and the region is invaluable and their skills should be used to provide news not only to the people in Afghanistan but to inform those outside of the country about current events in Afghanistan. This is especially important in light of recent reports by Reporters Without Borders that the Taliban has begun imposing “very harsh constraints” on Afghan media, and an estimated 100 private media companies have shut down operations in response to the Taliban.The U.S. is stronger and safer when our values—including defense of a free press—are protected at home and advanced as a central component of our foreign policy. We appreciate your efforts to ensure the safe evacuation and resettlement of U.S. and Afghan citizens who have supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, and we look forward to working with you to ensure we continue to support the fundamental values of a free press in the U.S. and around the world.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-crisis-afghanistan-humanitarian-and-foreign-policy-tragedy,"SALT LAKE CITY—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) today discussed the crisis in Afghanistan with Jake Tapper on CNN’s State of the Union.Excerpts of his interview can be found below. Full video can be found here.Leaving Americans behind and leaving our Afghan friends behind, who worked with us, would put upon us and will put upon us a moral stain. This is the result of very ineffective decisions, terrible decisions, by the prior Administration and the current Administration. This did not have to happen. It was preventable. And let me note that’s very different than the military. Our military came in at the very last moment and has performed admirably, as far as I can tell, to move people out as quickly as possible. We didn’t have to be in this rush, rush circumstance with terrorists breathing down our neck. It’s the responsibility of the prior Administration and this Administration that has caused this crisis to be upon us and has led to what is, without question, a humanitarian and foreign policy tragedy.…There’s a political slogan, “end endless wars.” That doesn’t translate into a serious policy decision, and the real policy is this: You can’t, as one party, end a war. It takes two parties to end a war. The Taliban and the radical violent jihadists in the world haven’t stopped fighting. They’re going to continue to fight us. The war is not over. We’re just no longer in a place where the war had its apex, where the Taliban was able to allow Al-Qaeda to grow and attack us on 9/11. We went to Afghanistan because we got attacked on 9/11 and lost thousands of American lives. Now America is in more danger. The reason we have a military is to protect America, and the decision to pull our military out of Afghanistan puts us in greater danger. Don’t forget, we went to Afghanistan to knock down Al-Qaeda, but we stayed in Afghanistan to make sure they couldn’t reconstitute to attack us again. So, pulling out means we are less safe. And also recognize the war is not over. We’re just in a weaker position. We don’t have boots on the ground. We don’t have eyes on the ground. When they say we have over-the-horizon capacity, that’s a fancy phrase. What does it mean? It means we’re not there. The nearest American Air Force base is 1,000 miles away. I had over-the-horizon capabilities on my teenagers, which means I had no idea what they were doing. Likewise, this idea that we are still in control is not real, and America is in greater danger.…[W]e’re certainly less safe than we were when we had a group of, let’s say, 5,000 American service people in Afghanistan standing up as the backbone behind some 250,000 Afghan troops, who were keeping at bay the Taliban and other terror groups. That made us a great deal safer. We have tens of thousands of troops in Germany, South Korea, Japan. Why are they there? Not just as favors to those countries but because we believe that keeps us and the world safer. And the idea that we would keep several thousand troops in Afghanistan, as long as necessary, to keep us more safe is, of course, the appropriate policy to take. These political slogans come in the way—“End endless wars.” The war is not ended when only one party pulls out and the others continue to fight and now fight with more aggression. Going forward, we are going to have to recognize we are in a much more dangerous position and will have to invest, I’m afraid, more resources to keep ourselves safe.…The reality is, we even have a greater reason to remain troops in a place where there is hostility, because those people are going to bring their hostility to America, to Americans and our friends, whether we like it or not. The idea that somehow we could pull out of a dangerous place where radical violent jihadists are organizing, that we could pull out of that and that is going to stop them, that’s fantasy. They’ll continue in their effort to regroup and come after America. Don’t forget what they did in 9/11. The reason we were in Afghanistan is to keep another 9/11 from happening. Now we pull out and the Taliban is much stronger than they were before, in part because of all the armament we’ve given them. ISIS-K is now alive. The old ISIS that is still in Syria and Iraq, they’re stronger. These forces of hate that consider America the great Satan, they’re still out there. They’re still fighting us. That war, unfortunately, goes on. And the idea that we pulled out of one of the places that was essential to push back against them is an idea that makes me far more concerned than had we retain a small footprint there to support the people on the front lines—the Afghan national security forces that were doing a pretty darn good job.…I believe in their heart of hearts that they recognize that we have a moral responsibility, and in keeping with our national character, we welcome people into our country who seek asylum, and those particularly who have fought alongside our troops and have enabled our troops to have a higher degree of safety than they would have had otherwise. Those are people to whom we owe a debt of gratitude, and we would welcome them into our country. I think it’s one of the characteristics of our great nation that we are a nation that welcomes with open arms our friends around the world. We’re talking 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, maybe 50,000 Afghans. How many are coming across the border illegally? That number is exceeded almost every month. So let’s put this in perspective. I for one, am very pleased we’ll have individuals that come to our country that can contribute to America and believe in the principles upon which our nation was founded.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

We have been given every indication that evacuation efforts cannot be concluded by August 31. Americans are still stranded in the provinces outside of Kabul and it’s unacceptable that there is still no plan to get these individuals to safety. And it’s not just Americans that are stranded. Leaving vulnerable Afghans—many of whom risked their lives, and their families’ lives, in service to our country—to face the wrath of the Taliban would be an utter disgrace and moral failure. Evacuation efforts should end only when the job is done.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-bipartisan-letter-blinken-asking-immediate-appointment-official-address-directed,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), joined a bipartisan letter led by SFRC Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-ID), and Committee member Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the immediate appointment of a senior-level official to lead efforts on anomalous health incidents following the resignation of Pamela Spratlen. In the letter, the senators asked that this position report directly to Secretary Blinken in recognition of the severity of these attacks. They also pushed for the full implementation of the HAVANA Act—which was co-led by Shaheen and signed into law last week—to ensure victims can immediately access the care and benefits they need.Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Chris Coons (D-DE), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) also signed onto the letter.“We believe this threat deserves the highest level of attention from the State Department, and remain concerned that the State Department is not treating this crisis with the requisite senior-level attention that it requires. Further, while there has been progress, we continue to hear concerns that the Department is not sufficiently communicating with or responding to diplomats who have been injured from these attacks. We are also concerned that the Department is insufficiently engaged in interagency efforts to find the cause of these attacks, identify those responsible, and develop a plan to hold them accountable,” the senators wrote.“We urge you to immediately announce a successor to Ambassador Spratlen to lead the Department’s Health Incident Response Task Force. Critically, this post must be a senior-level official that reports directly to you,” the senators continued. “We ask that you take this step now to demonstrate that the State Department does take this matter seriously, and is coordinating an appropriate agency-level response.”“We urge you to make swift implementation of the HAVANA Act a top priority. Many victims have waited for this legislation to pass in order to receive access to much needed financial and medical support. The President’s signature and the bipartisan support behind the law sends the unambiguous message that all affected individuals must have access to benefits and financial support,” they concluded in the letter.Full text of the letter can be found below.Dear Secretary Blinken:We write regarding the ongoing anomalous health incidents (AHIs) affecting State Department and other U.S. personnel and their family members around the world. We are extremely alarmed that reports of these incidents continue to grow. It is clear that this threat continues to target U.S. diplomats and related personnel, and reflects a significant, unmitigated threat to our national security. We believe this threat deserves the highest level of attention from the State Department, and remain concerned that the State Department is not treating this crisis with the requisite senior-level attention that it requires. Further, while there has been progress, we continue to hear concerns that the Department is not sufficiently communicating with or responding to diplomats who have been injured from these attacks. We are also concerned that the Department is insufficiently engaged in interagency efforts to find the cause of these attacks, identify those responsible, and develop a plan to hold them accountable.We urge you to immediately announce a successor to Ambassador Spratlen to lead the Department’s Health Incident Response Task Force. Critically, this post must be a senior-level official that reports directly to you. It is incumbent that this individual has the experience to engage effectively with affected individuals and with the interagency.  As you know, pending bipartisan legislation in the Senate would require the Secretary to designate an agency coordinator for AHIs who reports directly to you. We ask that you take this step now to demonstrate that the State Department does take this matter seriously, and is coordinating an appropriate agency-level response.We also welcome President Biden’s recent action to sign the HAVANA Act into law. This law reflects Congress’ concern that affected individuals are facing too many hurdles to receiving treatment and benefits. We urge you to make swift implementation of the HAVANA Act a top priority. Many victims have waited for this legislation to pass in order to receive access to much needed financial and medical support. The President’s signature and the bipartisan support behind the law sends the unambiguous message that all affected individuals must have access to benefits and financial support. We ask for your expeditious implementation of these provisions to ensure victims of these attacks are receiving equitable access to care and treatment. We owe it to our diplomats to exhaust every effort to try and guarantee a full recovery.We wish to support the State Department and U.S. personnel through every means possible, and to support the Department in effectively addressing this national security threat.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-bicameral-group-demanding-renewal-national-coal-council,"WASHINGTON— Today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined a bicameral group of colleagues, led by Senator John Barrasso (R-WY), calling on Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to renew the National Coal Council (NCC).In the letter, the group highlights the importance of the NCC in advancing coal policy, technology, and markets. The NCC plays a major role in new coal production for environmentally responsible uses including energy production and innovative new carbon products and materials.Along with Romney and Barasso, the letter was signed by Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Hoeven (R-ND), James Lankford (R-OK), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Todd Young (R-IN), and Representatives David McKinley (R-WV), Bruce Westerman (R-AR), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Mike Bost (R-IL), Larry Bucshon (R-IN), Liz Cheney (R-WY), Tom Cole (R-OK), John Curtis (R-UT), Morgan Griffith (R-VA), Bill Johnson (R-OH), John Joyce (R-PA), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Alex Mooney (R-WV), Greg Pence (R-IN), and Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA).Read the full letter here and below.Secretary Granholm:We write in support of renewal of the National Coal Council’s (NCC) charter, which must be renewed by November 20, 2021. The NCC is a Federal Advisory Committee (FAC) that provides valuable recommendations and insights to your office on coal policies and technologies. The NCC is a talented and multifaceted organization of coal producers and consumers, carbon researchers, academics, environmentalists, and policy experts.  It is our understanding that the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management has proposed to decline to recharter the NCC.FACs formally advise the executive branch, but their reports are read and relied upon more widely. We are grateful to the NCC for the analysis, research, and policy recommendations it provides. The NCC publishes reports on a variety of coal and carbon ore-related subjects to the Secretary. Comprised of nearly 125 members, the NCC is essential to advising the Department and other stakeholders on policy opportunities for coal. Over the last four decades, the NCC has been an excellent resource for lawmakers, helping to inform our approach to energy and manufacturing policy.As global coal consumption is projected to increase, it is essential that the United States remains a leader in advancing coal and carbon related technologies. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese recently said, “The global nature of climate change also provides an opportunity for U.S. industry to help others meet their climate targets. We were once the arsenal of democracy for the world during World War II. We can again be an arsenal for the world dealing with climate change.”The NCC provides the Department with the tools and information it needs to ensure America’s carbon management technologies are cutting edge and are deployed around the world. America’s leadership in advancing coal and carbon-management technologies will have a profound impact on meeting global climate targets, while allowing emerging economies access to reliable, affordable energy.Denying newly mined coal a position in the domestic energy and manufacturing mix will come at a serious cost, both here at home and around the world. A politically driven rejection of understanding the benefits of newly mined coal and carbon research today kill thousands of jobs and innovation. It will leave our children and children around the world without the tools they need to both meet electricity demand and manage carbon.We strongly encourage you to renew the charter before November or reconstitute the NCC with the same aims of advancing coal policy, technology, and markets, including for new coal production for environmentally responsible uses including energy production and innovative new carbon products and materials.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

Rather than take the opportunity to build unity in a divided region and bring resources and lasting protections to sacred antiquities by seeking a mutually beneficial and permanent legislative solution, President Biden fanned the flames of controversy and ignored input from the communities closest to these monuments. We will continue to support efforts to ensure that our monuments’ boundaries and management reflect the unique stakeholder interest and uses in the area, but today’s “winner take all” mentality moved us further away from that goal.” Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

This means families will start to rely on them, only for them to disappear. If these new programs were to be made permanent, he pointed out that there would be only two ways to pay for them: further adding to the national debt or more tax increases on millions of Americans. Instead of new costly government programs, families should be given the freedom to decide what is best for their children’s early education.His exchange with Secretary Cardona can be found below and video can be found here.Senator Romney: Secretary Cardona, as young families are thinking about having children, they consider the plans for what it will mean to have a child. And they consider about pre-K, about child care, about college expenses down the road. And I note that in the President’s plan, the so-called reconciliation bill of $3.5 trillion, that the plan is that child care and early learning expire after six years instead of ten years for the full program, that pre-K expires after seven years, and that community college coverage expires after five years. Do you think that young parents should therefore plan on these programs disappearing in six, seven, and five years, as proposed under the Administration’s legislation?Secretary Cardona: Thank you, Senator Romney, for the question. We’re at a point in our country’s history where we have the opportunity for transformational change for our students.Romney: I totally agree. I don’t want to go on a different topic here, which is, the transformation. Is this a permanent change—it’s transformation, if it’s permanent. But if it’s just temporary—five, six, seven years, and all these programs go away, that’s not transformational. That’s bait and switch.Cardona: Senator, I do believe at this point the families, especially post-pandemic, providing community college access, that only helps the economy.Romney: But should it expire at the end as it is planned now?Cardona: I’m hopeful, Senator, that today goes really well for our families across the country and that in the coming years, we’ll find ways to continue to support those strategies that we know lift American families.Romney: You mean it’s your anticipation these programs, then, that parents should count on them continuing?Cardona: That is the goal, to have community college for all families.Romney: If that’s the goal for all these programs, not the five years, six years, seven years that’s in the legislation, how are you going to pay for it? Because there’s only one of two ways. Either more debt or higher taxes. Which do you prefer?Cardona: Senator, I know in this proposed budget no one making under $400,000 will see an increase in taxes.Romney: That’s right away. But if you’re saying that down the road, when these programs are set to expire, you would expect them to continue instead. That means any promises about not raising taxes on people making under $400,000 today, those are going to expire as well.Cardona: As a lifetime educator I can tell you what’s being proposed is transformational.Romney: I agree it’s transformational, but I’m not sure it’s transformational in the right way. I’m concerned that we’re going to double the child tax credit which allows people to help people pay for child care. At the same time we’re going to give them Pre-K for two years. Why double? Why give people free pre-K and double their child tax credit which they could use for themselves to either decide to care for their own children at home, to go to Head Start, to go to a private child care facility. Why do we have to both double the child tax credit and at the same time provide free Pre-K and by the way, build new school classrooms to do so.Cardona: Sir, for me as an educator, early childhood education is a foundation for a strong educational program.Romney: Totally agree, but why do we have to pay for it twice?Cardona: I’ve seen the benefit of it and I know for many of these families, the ability to get back to work and add to their income is…Romney: Look, I’m perfectly happy with providing funding to families so they can provide child care for their child. I think they ought to have the choice of one providing it themselves if they want to, either with a family member or a spouse or number two, sending a child to a child care facility of their choice. But to say you’re going to do that and we’re also going to give you public school child care, that’s two programs, doubling the cost, and it’s taking away the incentive for people that might choose to decide to have the child cared for at home.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-opposes-nomination-tracy-stone-manning-lead-bureau-land-management,"WASHINGTON—In a speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) voiced his opposition to the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Senator Romney cited Stone-Manning’s past involvement in eco-terrorism and believes that her attempt to conceal her participation in these activities from the Senate disqualifies her from serving as the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.His speech as prepared for delivery can be found below and video can be found here.From our red rock canyons to our alpine meadows; from the sprawling salt flats to the towering mountain peaks, it’s hard to overstate the beauty of Utah’s majestic landscapes. So much about being a Utahn is our connection to and care for our land—these values have been engrained in our culture since the pioneers first found refuge here in 1847. We take great pride in the fact that folks from all over the country, and the world, travel to our state to experience these rich and diverse landscapes.Out of all of the states in our country, Utah has one of the highest percentages of its land owned by the federal government—nearly two-thirds of our 52 million acres. And of that federal land, more than 23 million acres is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.Now, this land has been cared for and used by Utahns for generations—recreationists and sportsmen who take advantage of the access to hike, hunt, mountain bike, ATV, and camp throughout our state; the ranchers who graze their livestock to provide our food and fiber; the communities that rely on the oil and gas development in the Basin, or the coal mines and power plants that provide more than 70% of our electricity; individuals interested in exploring the cultural anthropology of our land; and simply the residents that look to our open spaces for solitude.Utahns deserve, and demand, that our public lands be managed by someone they can trust. And it is quite obvious that the President’s nominee for Director of the Bureau of Land Management, Tracy Stone-Manning, is not worthy of our trust.Ms. Stone-Manning’s history of aiding ecoterrorism is extremely troubling—and alone should be disqualifying for the position in which she has been nominated. It would be like nominating Bernie Madoff to serve as Treasury Secretary!For those who aren’t familiar with tree-spiking—an action with which Ms. Stone-Manning has been associated—let me offer a brief synopsis.Tree-spiking involves hammering a metal or ceramic rod into a tree trunk with the purpose of preventing a tree from being logged. Loggers could be seriously harmed, or even killed, when they cut into the trunk of a tree that has been spiked. And the same goes for sawmill workers who are later processing the log in a mill. Ecoterrorists who engage in tree-spiking are willing to cause the gruesome injury or death of hardworking Americans who are simply trying to provide for their families.But it’s not only her efforts aiding ecoterrorists that is of concern—it’s Ms. Stone-Manning’s blatant dishonesty about being investigated over a tree-spiking incident to the Senate that should disqualify her from serving as BLM Director.I take my constitutional duty to provide advice and consent with regard to presidential nominees very seriously, and with limited exception, believe presidents—regardless of party—should be able to put in place qualified individuals to lead their team. I’ve supported several of President Biden’s nominees, even though I may have disagreed with them on particular policy issues because I believed they have been qualified for the position in which he or she had been nominated.Simply put: Tracy Stone-Manning’s past involvement in ecoterrorism, and her attempt to conceal her participation before the Senate, make her unfit to serve as Director of the Bureau of Land Management.I will be opposing her nomination and urge my Democratic friends—especially those who represent states with large amounts of federal land—to oppose her nomination, as well.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-introduce-comprehensive-afghanistan-legislation,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined his colleagues, led by U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-ID), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in introducing the Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act, legislation to address the outstanding issues related to the Biden Administration’s rushed and disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.“Administrative oversight has long been a responsibility of Congress,” Senator Romney said. “The withdrawal from Afghanistan was nothing short of a humanitarian and foreign policy disaster, and the current administration must be held accountable. This legislation provides oversight tools to do just that. It includes important measures to ensure that the Administration continues to prioritize the evacuation of American citizens, green card holders, and SIVs. It would also impose sanctions on the Taliban and entities supporting it, as well as develop a counterterrorism strategy for Afghanistan in light of the ever-changing situation on the ground.”“We continue to see the grave implications of the Biden Administration’s haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan. An unknown number of American citizens and Afghan partners remain abandoned in Afghanistan under threat from the Taliban, we face a renewed terror threat against the United States, and the Taliban wrongly seek recognition at the UN, even as they suppress the rights of Afghan women and girls,” said Ranking Member Risch. “I’m proud to introduce the Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act today to address these concerns and rebuild the United States’ credibility. I hope the committee will be able to mark it up soon so that we can quickly help those we left behind and protect America’s national security interests before it’s too late.”This Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act:Cosponsors include Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Rob Portman (R-OH), Todd Young (R-IN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Thune (R-SD), Rick Scott (R-FL), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Richard Burr (R-NC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Jerry Moran (R-KS), John Boozman (R-AR), John Hoeven (R-ND), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Roger Marshall (R-KS).Text of the legislation can be found here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-and-kaine-press-fda-delay-e-cigarette-sales-decision-request-guidance-menthol-flavors,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Tim Kaine (D-VA), both members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent a letter to Dr. Janet Woodcock, Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expressing concern over the FDA’s delay in issuing a decision on whether companies with the largest shares of the e-cigarette market can keep selling their products. In their letter, the senators also call on the FDA to provide clarity on menthol e-cigarettes, which have placed young people at continued risk of exposure to harmful products and dangerous marketing techniques.“Studies have clearly demonstrated the risk that electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products pose to young people, including increasing the likelihood of future consumption of cigarettes. In response to this risk, your agency was given one year to determine whether these products provided more public health benefit than harm to youth, including whether they were safe for smokers and unappealing to children. Despite reassurances that the FDA would prioritize firms with the largest market share, your agency failed to meet its court-ordered deadline and delayed action on Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) from several companies associated with the youth e-cigarette epidemic,” said the senators.“Your agency’s failure to issue a timely decision on all PMTA applications and its failure to provide clarity on menthol ENDS products have placed young people at continued risk of exposure to harmful products and dangerous marketing techniques. In fact, in 2020, nearly 20% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported using e-cigarettes, with mint and menthol flavors being consumed by 56% and 37% of young flavor e-cigarette users, respectively,” continued the senators.Full text of the letter can be found below:Dear Commissioner Woodcock,We write you to express concern about the recent actions taken by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products. While we applaud the decision to pull more than 5 million of these products from shelves, we are dismayed at the delay in issuing a decision on Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) representing companies with the largest market shares. The FDA has also failed to provide clear guidance on menthol-flavored ENDS products, which make up an increasingly large share of e-cigarette sales. We request a staff briefing and ask that you provide a timeline for issuing decisions on the remaining PMTAs and guidance on the sale of menthol-flavored ENDS products.Studies have clearly demonstrated the risk that ENDS products pose to young people, including the increasing the likelihood of future consumption of cigarettes.  In response to this risk, your agency was given one year to determine whether these products provided more public health benefit than harm to youth, including whether they were safe for smokers and unappealing to children.  Despite reassurances that the FDA would prioritize firms with the largest market share,  your agency failed to meet its court-ordered deadline and delayed action on PMTAs from several companies associated with the youth e-cigarette epidemic.Further, your agency has yet to provide clear guidance on menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. After the FDA’s harmful decision to exclude menthol-flavored e-cigarettes from restrictions on flavoring in 2020,  the sale of these products increased drastically.  In a recent announcement the FDA stated that the scientific review of menthol-flavored ENDS products raised “unique considerations,”   and we are concerned that the FDA will continue to overlook the risk of these products to youth. The recent announcement that the FDA would issue product standards to ban menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and cigars is a step in the right direction.  The FDA must also take strong action on menthol flavoring in ENDS products in order to curb the youth vaping epidemic.Your agency’s failure to issue a timely decision on all PMTA applications, and to provide clarity on menthol ENDS products, have placed young people at continued risk of exposure to harmful products and dangerous marketing techniques. In fact, in 2020, nearly 20% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported using e-cigarettes with mint and menthol flavors being consumed by 56% and 37% of young flavor e-cigarette users, respectively.  To increase transparency on the agency’s progress towards removing these harmful products from the market, we request a staff briefing and a response to the following questions by October 1, 2021:1. What is FDA’s timeline for issuing decisions on the remaining PMTAs for ENDS products? Please provide an outline of the plan.
2. How does the FDA plan to evaluate the PMTAs for menthol-flavored ENDS products given their harmful impact on youth?
3. How will the FDA ensure that products not authorized for sale are not marketed unlawfully?
a) In particular, what will you do to enforce the removal of new products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization?
b) How will you ensure the removal of products that received Marketing Denial Orders (MDOs)?Thank you for your continued efforts to protect youth from harmful ENDS products, and we look forward to your timely response.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-joins-utah-officials-highlight-water-wins-infrastructure-bill,"SPANISH FORK—At the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA) construction site in south Utah County, U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined state and local officials to highlight how the recently-passed bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will help improve Utah’s water infrastructure for families and communities across our state. The legislation, authored and negotiated by Senator Romney and his colleagues, includes $50 million in funding for the Central Utah Project Completion Act, which provides water for both municipal and recreational use throughout Utah. Details on the how the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will deliver for Utah can be found here.“All of us are responsible for serving the people of our state and our community—and our state is growing. It’s essential that we have the water that we have the rights to and that we use the water in a way that’s appropriate and responsible. We needed more water for Salt Lake County and for Utah County and this project, the Central Utah Water Project, allows us to get more water…We’re not increasing the amount of water coming out of the Colorado—we’re getting the same amount that we had before—but this allows us to bring water in efficiently into the communities in Salt Lake County and Utah County that need it,” said Senator Romney. “You guys are my boss—those who are citizens of Utah—you tell me what I should do and I was told loud and clear: we need to make sure we get the funding to get this water…I’m very, very pleased that the infrastructure projects—hard, physical infrastructure projects—that are part of this legislation—that are the entire part of this legislation—are going to help Utah maintain the kind of vitality and good quality of life that we have long-enjoyed and provide a place where our kids, and their kids, will be happy to raise their families.”“Water is the lifeblood of Utah. Our pioneer forefathers built tunnels, diversions, and other facilities to bring additional water to this area in south Utah County, as well as to the entire Wasatch Front, including Salt Lake County. The Central Utah Project expanded limited water supplies by bringing more Colorado River water to the population centers of Salt Lake and Utah counties. More than 60% of the drinking water and Salt Lake County comes from diversions from the Colorado River…The additional funds for the Central Utah Project will provide a more rapid completion of the system in south Utah County and facilitate deliveries into Salt Lake County. Our communities are growing quickly and completion of the system will provide for the increase in water demands. Also, the funding for the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement is crucial to the state of Utah to secure our Colorado River water and, more importantly, deliver clean drinking water to many in the Navajo Nation who currently don’t have running water.” – Gene Shawcroft, General Manager, Central Utah Water Conservancy District

“We would like, me representing the Department, to express our appreciation to Senator Romney for the support of the Central Utah Project and for the additional funding that comes at a very critical time. Once completed, this pipeline…will provide water for 100,000 people right here in south Utah County. These funds will also provide much-needed help with our fish, wildlife, and recreation in the area, including support of the endangered species.” – Reed Murray, Program Director, Central Utah Water Project Completion Act Office

“As the fastest growing state in the nation, Utah has critical infrastructure needs. Not only do we need new infrastructure to support our growth, we also need to maintain and replace our aging infrastructure to preserve the quality of life Utah is famous for. We are grateful to Senator Romney and all the work he has brought to us with this bipartisan infrastructure bill…It provides critical infrastructure resources to construct, rebuild, and maintain our roads, water projects, and wildfire management. The funds dedicated to water will help complete the Central Utah Project, bring safe, clean drinking water to the Utah Navajo Nation people, as well as [complete] critical upgrades to drinking water systems throughout the state…These funds will benefit Utahns for many generations.” – Todd Adams, Deputy Director, Utah Division of Natural Resources

“If you were to ask me, and constituents were to ask me, what’s the number one issue facing south Utah County—it’s growth…it’s growth and water…I just want to express my appreciation for Senator Romney. We have tremendous needs in south Utah County and putting this infrastructure in place is huge for this community.” – Mike McKell, Utah State Senator, District 7

“As it’s been stated before: we can’t be here if there’s no water. Our city can’t grow without water and the foresight of the people that came before us saw that we needed water, made these projects available for us, and you see it all come to fruition now…As a city, we love knowing that we have water for our residents and we know we have water for future growth because as we continue to grow, the demand for water is going to keep increasing…So projects like this, and for the good people that make it happen for us, and provide the funding for us, is great and we sure appreciate it.” – Steve Leifson, Spanish Fork City Mayor

“When we talk about the delivery of water and the importance of it, it’s not just the importance of the arid state that we live in, but south Utah County, as a whole. To see the success of this happening, with the additional funding, is really important for our area—to deliver water at pressure is a huge benefit for the struggles and the problems that we have in Spanish Fork and in this area with growth. This is a huge step to help overcome those. So, I’m excited for this—for the extension of this project—and again grateful to the good Senator for making sure this happened.” – Mike Mendenhall, Spanish Fork City CouncilmanPlease complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."

The legislation passed the Senate on August 10 by a vote of 69-30.“After months of unnecessary delay by House Democratic leadership, today’s passage is a win for Utah, as we will now be better positioned to meet transportation challenges, mitigate drought conditions, prepare for and respond to wildfires, extend broadband to rural communities, and fulfill critical water needs. In stark contrast to Democrats’ efforts to pass a separate bill to drastically expand social programs, the bipartisan group I worked with proved that it’s possible to achieve solutions without raising taxes or adding trillions to the national debt. I urge President Biden to keep his promise to sign this legislation without delay, so we can modernize our nation’s physical infrastructure, address supply chain issues, and demonstrate that, even in polarized times, Congress can still come together on behalf of the American people.”Utah Highlights:Authorizes $3 Billion for Utah’s Roads and HighwaysIncludes key legislative priorities championed by Senator Romney:Delivers $219 million to Utah for water revolving fundsInvests in Utah’s AirportsProvides $65 billion to expand broadband access across the countryEliminates federal red tape by reforming the permitting process to speed construction projectsProvides $40 billion in funding for bridge construction, maintenance, and repairBackground:The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was the work of bipartisan collaboration which will address decades of neglect of our nation’s hard, physical infrastructure.

https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-portman-king-hassan-applaud-house-passage-more-20-million-office-national-cyber-director,"WASHINGTON–today, U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rob Portman (R-OH), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Angus King (I-ME), Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, and Maggie Hassan (D-NH), applauded the House passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act that includes their bipartisan priority to provide $21 million in funding for the Office of the National Cyber Director (NCD). The NCD is a brand new position tasked with coordinating the implementation of national cybersecurity policy and strategy. Because the position was created in the middle of a fiscal year, Congress has not yet directly appropriated funding for the Office. With cyberattacks increasing in both scope and consequence, it is crucial to provide the National Cyber Director with the funding and resources necessary to accomplish this important mission. The inclusion of this bipartisan priority in the broader, bipartisan infrastructure package will provide a one-time funding allocation of $21 million through Fiscal Year 2022. The Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act in August and it will now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law.“The size, scope, and frequency of cyber attacks has made it abundantly clear that the United States’ cyber warfare readiness is extraordinarily weak,” said Senator Romney. “This important funding will support the Office of the National Cyber Director in developing and implementing a national cybersecurity policy and strategy, which will better protect our country from growing cyber threats.”“I applaud the House for passing our bipartisan priority of $21 million in important funding for the new Office of the National Cyber Director as part of the bipartisan infrastructure package and I urge the president to sign it into law quickly,” said Senator Portman. “This funding is critical because the position was created in the middle of a fiscal year and thus Congress has not yet directly appropriated funding for the Office of the National Cyber Director which is tasked with coordinating the implementation of national cyber policy and strategy. As we face increasing cyber threats, it is crucial that the National Cyber Director has the funding needed in order to able to effectively and efficiently develop national cyber policies that best protect federal networks, data, and critical infrastructure.”“As we work hard to negotiate investments in our infrastructure priorities, it’s essential to support and strengthen the security of our digital networks  — which connect our economy and culture just as much as our highways, railways and bridges,” said Senator King, Co-Chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission that created the position of National Cyber Director. “As we strengthen our networks against global cyberthreats and ransomware criminals, we must ensure that Director Inglis has the resources to implement a comprehensive plan to protect our society, economy, and nation from those seeking to do us harm.”“Strengthening cybersecurity is a fundamental part of protecting our infrastructure, from energy grids to health care systems,” said Senator Hassan. “I am pleased that we worked on a bipartisan basis to immediately provide funding for the Office of the National Cyber Director in the infrastructure package. This will help us better protect our economy and national security alike from cybersecurity threats.”Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-introduce-bill-bolster-deterrence-taiwan-strait,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-ID) and Senators Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) in introducing the Taiwan Deterrence Act, legislation to bolster deterrence across the Taiwan Strait and strengthen Taiwan’s ability to defend against Chinese aggression and coercion.“Taiwan is an important friend of the United States, and it plays a significant role in promoting democracy and countering China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific,” said Senator Romney. “This legislation would ensure that the United States continues to support Taiwan in its effort to counter Chinese aggression and coercion by bolstering our support of Taiwan’s defense capabilities.”“The defense of Taiwan is critical to the future peace and security of the entire Indo-Pacific region,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This legislation authorizes $2 billion a year in Foreign Military Financing for Taiwan, but it is not a blank check. This funding is contingent on Taiwan’s commitment to further advance initiatives championed by President Tsai to build a credible defense. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress, the executive branch, and Taiwan on our shared vital interests in the Indo-Pacific.”“China’s increasing efforts to militarily overwhelm Taiwan is a threat to international diplomacy and regional security,” said Senator Crapo. “It is imperative to get asymmetric capabilities, training and readiness resources to Taiwan quickly so it can protect itself from China’s encroaching aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.”“As former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, I prioritized strengthening the U.S.-Japan Alliance to advance the vision for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. A free and democratic Taiwan is critical to realizing that vision, and the United States should work with our allies and partners to push back against the Chinese Communist Party’s malign behavior and aggressive threats against Taiwan. This legislation is imperative to maintaining the United States’ posture toward Communist China by supporting our allies in the region and helping them build up and maintain their defenses,” said Senator Hagerty.“We all bear witness as China continues to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region, and as Americans we must honor our commitments to defend our allies and diplomatic partners like Taiwan,” said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation will make sure the U.S. is ready and able to come to Taiwan’s aid in the event China further encroaches on their autonomy.”“As Beijing continues to pose a direct threat to our interests in the Indo-Pacific, it’s important Taiwan has the necessary tools to defend itself,” said Senator Rubio. “I’m proud to join Senator Risch and colleagues in introducing this bill, which takes the long overdue step to bolster Taiwan’s defense by providing much-needed assistance with military financing.”This legislation:Full text of the Taiwan Deterrence Act can be found here.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-colleagues-urge-return-work-federal-workforce,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) joined 41 of his colleagues, led by Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), in a letter to the heads of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to request immediate action to transition federal workers back to in-person operations. The letter follows months of delays from the Biden Administration on implementing plans for agencies to return their workforce to the office and to address the mounting backlog of cases that arose while workers were working from home. The text of the letter can be found here.“The pandemic has affected all Americans who participate in the workforce. Every working individual was forced to adapt quickly during the onset of the pandemic to do their part to reduce the spread of the virus and protect capacity in our health care systems. Fortunately, with the widespread availability of vaccines, testing, and other safety measures, new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are all now steadily declining,” the senators wrote. “Businesses have now reopened, children and teachers have returned to in-person learning, and health care and public safety workers continue to show up for work. Yet we continue to hear from constituents in our states about a lack of responsiveness from federal agencies.”The senators continued, “We understand the unique challenges that COVID-19 has presented, but Americans continue to face unprecedented delays in accessing their federal government. This is unacceptable, particularly since agency heads have had the ability to address productivity since June 2021, when the Biden Administration lifted its 25 percent cap on the number of federal employees allowed to report to worksites.”“We appreciate the work of America’s federal workforce and maintain that the health and safety of those employees and their families are a priority. However, with the resources available to each agency and every federal employee, it is now time to bring back our federal workers and deliver the service that the American people have been promised and expect of their government,” the senators concluded.In the letter, the senators cite several examples of the impact the extended absence has had on government services:Background:On June 10, 2021, GSA, OMB, and OPM issued a memo regarding the return of federal employees and contractors to physical workplaces. The deadline to submit their plans was July 19, 2021. However, given President Biden’s new vaccine mandate and the spread of the Delta variant, many agencies have had to produce new plans, which are currently still unavailable to the general public and to Congress despite ongoing requests.Please complete the form below to subscribe to Senator Romney’s email newsletter."
