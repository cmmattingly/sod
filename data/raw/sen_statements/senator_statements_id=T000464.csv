https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9231,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester, Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, today released the following statement following a failed vote to advance the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022:“This eleventh-hour act of cowardice will actively harm this country’s veterans and their families. Republicans chose today to rob generations of toxic-exposed veterans across this country of the health care and benefits they so desperately need—and make no mistake, more veterans will suffer and die as a result.”Tester was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to vote to advance the bill.Named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson who died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act will expand health care for Post-9/11 combat veterans, create a framework for the establishment of future presumptions of service connection related to toxic exposure, expand VA’s list of service presumptions, and improve resources to support VA’s claims processing.Tester is the only member of the Montana delegation who sits on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. He has long been dedicated to identifying a path forward for unaddressed toxic exposure issues alongside Veterans Service Organizations—remaining committed to delivering comprehensive relief to all generations of toxic-exposed veterans. In May, he announced a bipartisan agreement on the comprehensive bill and expressed urgency that a Senate floor vote take place swiftly."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9228,"As part of his continued push to strengthen veterans’ health care and benefits, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester is introducing the Build, Utilize, Invest, Learn, and Deliver (BUILD) for Veterans Act of 2022—legislation to modernize the delivery of medical facilities and other infrastructure projects at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).“When it comes to delivering new hospitals, clinics, cemeteries, benefits offices, and other facilities for veterans and the employees that serve them, we’ve got to set VA up for success,” said Chairman Tester. “The BUILD for Veterans Act pushes VA to modernize and manage its current and future infrastructure needs through commonsense provisions that’ll save taxpayer dollars in the process. This bill is critical to making sure VA is well-positioned to get new facilities off the ground while maintaining existing ones, and I’ll be fighting tooth and nail to get it across the finish line as quickly as possible.”Currently, VA lacks a clear roadmap, the internal capacity, and consistent funding to initiate the building or remodeling of facilities identified by the Department. Tester’s BUILD for Veterans Act would strengthen the Department’s internal capacity to initiate these projects to better meet the need of current and future veterans—including women veterans, veterans in need of long-term care services, and veterans with spinal cord injuries and diseases.Among its many provisions, the BUILD for Veterans Act would bolster and invest in VA’s infrastructure by requiring the Department to:Tester’s new legislation builds off of historic infrastructure investments in his Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act—bipartisan legislation to deliver toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits. Specifically, the PACT Act invests in VA’s infrastructure workforce through new recruitment and retention incentives, provides $5.5 billion in funding for 31 new facilities in 19 states—and for additional facilities in the future—and delivers additional tools to build clinics more efficiently. It also allows VA to partner more easily with the Department of Defense and universities on health facilities while also including good government provisions allowing VA to lease unused building and property to third parties to serve veterans while saving taxpayer funds.Veterans Service Organizations threw their support behind the Senator’s new legislation:“With the Asset and Infrastructure Review process effectively ended, Congress must take the lead in strengthening VA’s health care infrastructure, and Sen. Tester’s BUILD for Veterans Act is a critical first step toward that goal,” said Disabled American Veterans Washington Headquarters Executive Director Randy Reese. “The legislation would strengthen VA’s ability to construct, manage and maintain hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities across the country. DAV strongly supports the BUILD for Veterans Act and commends Sen. Tester for his continued leadership and commitment to the men and women who served, particularly those injured, ill or disabled from their service.”“Veterans expect that the VA will welcome them with facilities that can help deliver the care that they need,” said Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Executive Vice President Tom Porter. “The BUILD for Veterans Act provides badly needed reforms to enable the VA to modernize facilities and strengthen oversight and management of the agency’s capital asset program and project execution. Sen. Tester should be commended for taking the significant step forward for veterans’ healthcare needs with this important bill.”“Ensuring VA has state-of-the-art facilities to support the medical and mental healthcare needs of veterans is a top priority of The American Legion,” said National Commander of The American Legion Paul E. Dillard. “Investing in and revitalizing the aging VA infrastructure is vital to the overall success of the VA healthcare system. We must ensure that VA is properly resourced and structured to manage the infrastructure of the largest integrated healthcare network in the nation. By improving VA capital asset programs and increasing congressional oversight, the BUILD for Veterans Act will help establish a foundation for VA’s infrastructure modernization efforts.”“The VFW fully supports the BUILD for Veterans Act which would improve VA’s facilities around the country,” said Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) National Legislative Director Pat Murray. “VA infrastructure has been underprioritized for far too long and left without a plan for addressing many of the outdated buildings or the backlog of work. The BUILD for Veterans Act will require VA to develop and implement plans, to remedy this problem that has plagued VA for years. We are grateful for Senator Tester’s efforts to deliver infrastructure solutions to VA and for bringing attention to this often-overlooked problem.”“VA’s infrastructure processes must be modernized and now is the time to come up with new ways for the department to identify, prioritize, and fund its construction needs,” said Paralyzed Veterans of America’s Associate Executive Director for Government Relations Heather Ansley. “The BUILD for Veterans Act provides a comprehensive approach to help address problems with VA’s internal processes that have hindered its ability to meet the ever-growing demand for health care and benefits by veterans.”Text of the BUILD for Veterans Act can be found HERE.A one-pager on the bill can be found HERE."

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9223,"Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester released a statement today following a report issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) that found VA prematurely denied burn pit claims to toxic-exposed veterans: “The OIG’s findings are alarming, and highlight the urgent need for the Senate to take immediate action on my Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act and get it to the President’s desk as quickly as possible. The bottom line is that when it comes to getting veterans the health care and benefits they’ve earned, VA needs to get it right the first time. We’ve got to pass the comprehensive measures in the PACT Act that’ll reform the toxic-exposure claims process and finally recognize and treat the toxic wounds of war.”  The OIG’s report found that in one random sample, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) incorrectly processed 97 percent of burn pit claims. Many errors cited in the report could be resolved by provisions included in Tester’s bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. This includes using presumptions to simplify how VBA processes burn pit claims, requiring the VA Secretary to presume that veterans who served in specific locations were exposed to a prescribed list of substances and chemicals, and directing VBA to provide all veterans filing toxic exposure claims with a medical exam and opinion. Chairman Tester introduced the PACT Act earlier this year to deliver eras of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits from the VA for the first time in the nation’s history. Among its many priorities, this legislation will expand health care for Post-9/11 combat veterans, create a framework for the establishment of future presumptions of service connection related to toxic exposure, expand VA’s list of service presumptions, and improve resources to support VA’s claims processing. The Senate is expected to vote on the PACT Act next week."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9222,"Following years of work from Montana ranchers, recreationists, loggers, mountain bikers, and business owners, U.S. Senator Jon Tester’s Blackfoot-Clearwater Stewardship Act (BCSA) today received its first vote in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Tester’s legislation, which is supported by 83% of Montanans, would create jobs, protect thousands of acres of public land, and ensure future generations can access the world-class outdoor recreational opportunities available in the Blackfoot River watershed. “Montanans expect their elected officials to get stuff done, and after today’s hearing, we’ve taken a critical step for our businesses, outdoor recreationalists, and conservationists,” said Tester. “The BCSA is the result of years of collaboration between a diverse set of stakeholders, and with overwhelming support from the majority of Montanans, it should serve as a model for balanced use of our public lands. I look forward to gaining the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle so that we can get this bill out of committee and signed into law as soon as possible.” Tester’s bill received a 10-10 tie vote, setting up a future vote to move the bill out of Committee. Tester is the only member of the Montana congressional delegation who supports the BCSA. Tester’s BCSA is a multi-use proposal that would protect thousands of acres of public land, ensure future generations can access outdoor recreational opportunities, and strengthen Montana’s outdoor economy in the Blackfoot River Watershed. Specifically, the bill would protect 79,060 acres of wildlife habitat in the Bob Marshall, Mission Mountains, and Scapegoat Wilderness Areas, open 2,013 acres of currently closed land to snowmobiling, and protect 3,835 acres for mountain biking and hiking. It would also require the Forest Service to prioritize its review of future recreational trail proposals from the collaborative group, and to conduct a forest health assessment that will help identify new timber projects on the landscape. Tester’s bill is endorsed by:Tester first introduced the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act at the request of the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Project with the support of the local timber industry, and he re-introduced the bill last April. Text of Tester’s Blackfoot-Clearwater Stewardship Act is available HERE."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9221,"The Senate today voted to confirm Dr. Shereef Elnahal to be the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Under Secretary for Health with strong backing from U.S. Senator Jon Tester, Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, who released the following statement: “Dr. Shereef Elnahal has an impressive record of leading health care systems and agencies, and has shown a strong commitment to serving millions of veterans and hardworking employees at VA. Now more than ever, the Department needs permanent, qualified leadership to guide the nation’s largest integrated health care system in the right direction. I look forward to working with him in his new role to implement needed reforms to ensure veterans have access to the timely health care and services they’ve earned.”  Tester took to the Senate floor today ahead of the vote to urge his colleagues to support the nominee. In May, Tester called on his colleagues to put aside partisan politics and confirm the bipartisan nominee following a political hold on his confirmation. He also led the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee in unanimously advancing President Biden’s pick to lead the Veterans Health Administration, a role that has been without permanent leadership since 2017. In this role, Elnahal will oversee the VA health care system—providing care to more than nine million veterans and employing more than 347,000 health care workers. In a Committee oversight hearing yesterday on the VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) Program, Tester underscored the critical role the Under Secretary for Health will play in overseeing needed changes for the EHRM Program to best serve veterans and taxpayers, and reiterated his call to confirm Dr. Elnahal. Dr. Elnahal is a physician who most recently served as President and Chief Executive Officer of University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey from 2019 through 2022. Prior to this role, Elnahal served as New Jersey’s 21st Health Commissioner. He also served as Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Quality, Safety, and Value at VA from 2016 through 2018. He earned a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University, and went to Harvard Business School and Harvard Medical School, graduating from both in 2012."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9220,"At a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee oversight hearing yesterday, Chairman Jon Tester pressed Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Oracle Cerner officials on serious reforms needed to the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) Program. During his questioning, Tester pushed VA’s Assistant Under Secretary for Health for Quality and Patient Safety, Dr. Gerald Cox, on patient safety issues in the new EHR, as highlighted in a recent report from the VA’s OIG. The Senator went on to stress the urgent need to implement the independent watchdog’s recommendations, stating: “The Inspector General’s [IG] recommendations need to be followed-through [on] and taken seriously…the fact that we have six recommendations that have gone out over two years….is completely unacceptable and needs to be addressed.” Continuing his longtime push to increase the safety and effectiveness of the new EHR system, and press VA to address the serious concerns voiced by VA’s front-line medical staff using the technology, Tester called on VA Secretary Denis McDonough earlier this week to hire a permanent Executive Director for the Office of Functional Champion (OFC) and relocate that office to report directly to the Under Secretary for Health, the Department’s top health official. During their testimony, VA officials confirmed steps to improve the new EHR’s pharmacy system, at the request of Tester and a bipartisan group of Senate and House leaders. Following a push from Tester to not deploy the new system while patient safety and other concerns remained unresolved, VA yesterday also announced a delay of its planned deployment of the new EHR to Boise, Idaho, to allow time to resolve known risks and issues. In his opening statement, Tester also underscored the critical role VA’s Under Secretary for Health (USH) plays in overseeing needed changes for the EHRM Program to best serve veterans and taxpayers, and reiterated his call to confirm Dr. Shereef Elnahal—the pending USH nominee. In May, Tester took to the Senate floor to urge his colleagues to put aside partisan politics and confirm the bipartisan nominee following a political hold on his confirmation. Last month, President Biden signed the bipartisan and bicameral VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act into law. This law will increase transparency and oversight of the EHR program by requiring the VA Secretary to submit additional reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics, and patient safety issues related to the new EHR—areas of concern the VA OIG and Congress have repeatedly identified."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9217,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester pushed David Pekoske, the nominee to be the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), on staffing and pay equity issues for the Transportation Security Officers (TSO) who protect America’s airports and on oil and gas pipeline security during a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee this week. “So when it comes to the airport staffing, you’re about eight percent down,” said Tester. “How have you dealt with, I mean you’re getting an influx of two million passengers a day, how have you dealt with the line issue with your staffing being eight percent down?” “We’ve dealt with it successfully with a lot of hard work at the local level, we have really, really good relationships between our airport leadership and the owners and operators of the airports and the carriers,” said Pekoske. “We all work together to try to make sure that a passenger gets onboard the plane and can depart as quickly and safely and securely as possible.” “You have previously testified before the House, I believe, that you support writing into law full collective bargaining rights and pay equity for Transportation Security Officers at TSA,” said Tester. “This Committee has [my] legislation before it that would do exactly that. Tell me why you are supportive of these provisions and why you think it will make a difference.” “Pay equity is critically important as I said before just to make sure we can hire retain an d be fair—fairly compensate our employees who have critical national security roles,” said Pekoske. “With full collective bargaining, I support full collective bargaining, TSA has had limited collective bargaining since its inception 20 years ago….As I look at this, we’ve been 20 years doing limited collective bargaining and it hasn’t gotten us to where we need to be.” 68 million travelers passed through TSA checkpoints in June, which is 89 percent of June 2019 levels. Security risks associated with long wait times and crowded checkpoints have been a concern during the air travel rebound, and in June, TSA had a current staffing level of roughly 48,000 Officers and Transportation Security Managers, which is approximately 8.5 percent below the planned staffing level. Tester also pushed Pekoske on staffing needs at TSA’s divisions covering pipeline security, which is essential to America’s energy supply and national defense. TSA has primary responsibility for overseeing the physical security and cybersecurity of pipeline systems, which face ongoing cybersecurity threats, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack in 2021. Senator Tester has been Montana’s leading champion for improving our nation’s homeland security and national defense. He recently cosponsored the Rights for TSA Workforce Act of 2021, which would guarantee collective bargaining rights for TSOs and transition TSA employees to the Government Service pay-scale to ensure pay equity, and give them similar merit service protections to the rest of the civil service workforce. He also fought for and secured $8.49 billion—a $176 million increase—in last year’s government funding package. Tester has also led the charge to upgrade Montana’s airport infrastructure. He recently secured approximately $144 million for 69 Montana airports through his bipartisan infrastructure law, which will be awarded over five years through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Grants, which can be used to construct or repair runways and taxiways as well as make terminal and gate improvements.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9215,"Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and U.S. Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) introduced bipartisan legislation this week aimed at helping Native American veterans achieve homeownership. The Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act would reform the Native American Direct Loan (NADL) program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and improve the marketing of the program—making it more accessible to Native American veterans living on trust land. Specifically, it would allow Native American veterans to use the NADL program to refinance any other existing mortgage on the same property, and create a relending program to allow Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to obtain loans through the NADL program and relend those funds to qualified Native American veterans. The bill would also expand the VA’s existing NADL program outreach to include collaborating with local service providers to offer homebuyer education and housing counseling to Native American veterans who are looking to qualify for mortgage financing. “Native Americans serve our nation at the highest rates, so there’s no question that we’ve got to keep expanding resources to help them access safe and affordable housing here at home,” said Tester. “Our bipartisan bill will do just that by offering additional services and support under the Native American Direct Loan program that’ll connect more Native Veterans and their families with the tools they need to buy, build, or fix up homes on our tribal lands.” “Homeownership is part of the American dream and a key to building wealth,” said Rounds. “This legislation would improve the Native American Direct Loan program and enhance outreach and other assistance as needed to Native American veterans seeking to qualify for mortgage financing. By creating expanded access to Native American veterans, our bill would help make the dream of homeownership a reality.”  “For the first time ever, thousands of Native Veterans will be able to access the resources needed to build and buy homes on Trust lands,” said Bob Gauthier, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) Tribal Member. “Thanks to Senator Tester, we have taken a monumental step in ensuring Native Veterans are given the support they need.” “The National American Indian Housing Council supports the Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act and thanks Senators Rounds and Tester for taking the lead to bring more homeownership opportunities to American Indian, Alaska Native and native Hawaiian veterans. Many of our brave veterans are unsheltered or living in overcrowded or substandard homes. That is not honor. Native veterans deserve access to affordable housing,” said National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC) Chairman Thomas Lozano and Tribal Councilman for Enterprise Rancheria. “The Native American Direct Loan Improvement Act would open the VA’s Native American Direct Loan for refinancing and support tribes, tribal programs and Native CDFIs in helping veterans become homeowners. NAIHC encourages our allies in the Senate to support Native veterans and their families and co-sponsor or support the bill.” Full bill text can be found HERE."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9212,"Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Ranking Member Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Ranking Member Mike Bost (R-Ill.) issued the following statements on two reports released today from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) revealing serious issues with the deployment of VA’s new Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program: “These reports are unacceptable,” said Chairman Tester. “They demonstrate a clear failure by the federal government to uphold its commitment to our nation’s veterans, and speak to the fact that Oracle Cerner needs to step up its game and deliver a functioning, quality system that’ll do right by taxpayers. They are also further proof of why the political games need to end so the Senate can quickly confirm Dr. Shereef Elnahal to serve as VA Under Secretary for Health—a critical leadership role needed to turn this program around.” “A year after the OIG raised issues with VA’s execution of the EHRM program, we are again receiving troubling reports on the EHRM program,” said Ranking Member Moran. “The lack of care the department has provided to veterans impacted by the new system is unacceptable. Today’s reports illustrate patient safety issues that can be traced directly to failures at the highest levels at VA, including the department’s failure to ensure that personnel are candid and open with OIG investigators working to uncover problems in the system. Patient safety and honesty within the VA should be the top priorities, and without those two things, we cannot even begin to address issues with the EHRM system.”  “We have been concerned about patient safety and the possibility of patient harm from the very beginning of this project,” said Chairman Takano. “We have repeatedly been assured by the highest levels of VA and the program office that no veterans had been harmed by the transition to the Oracle Cerner Millennium product. Today’s report by the VA Office of the Inspector General shows that we had not been given the whole story. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and expect better from VA.” “Today’s VA OIG reports on the persistent problems with the new electronic health records are very concerning. Instead of fixing the issues with the system, VA and Cerner seem much more interested in hiding them. We expect honesty, at the very least, and a plan to resolve the training and referral issues so they never happen again,” said Ranking Member Bost. “Both reports reaffirm exactly what I heard last week with dozens of VA employees and veterans on the ground in Washington state. This program should not move forward anywhere else until the problems in Washington state – and now at other sites – are finally fixed. Timely care for veterans depends on it.” The OIG released two reports today outlining issues with the electronic health record system and management. One report detailed serious patient safety and health care operations concerns resulting in nearly 150 cases of harm to patients at VA’s Spokane hospital. An additional report revealed that two of the EHRM program’s officials in charge of change management failed to provide timely, complete, and accurate information in response to OIG requests, which impeded oversight efforts. Last month, President Biden signed the bipartisan and bicameral VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act into law. This law will increase transparency by requiring the VA Secretary to submit reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics, and patient safety issues related to the EHRM—areas of concern the VA OIG and Congress have repeatedly identified. Continuing their efforts to increase oversight over the program, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee will be leading an oversight hearing on the EHRM program on July 20th."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9211,"Following reports from Montanans about unreliable mail service in Bozeman, U.S. Senator Jon Tester yesterday sent a letter to United States Postal Service (USPS) leadership urging them to find immediate solutions to the challenges facing the Bozeman office and restore timely mail service as quickly as possible. “I am hearing directly from members of the Bozeman community that are experiencing significant gaps and delays in mail service,” wrote Tester. “…While it appears hiring additional staff is likely the best long-term solution to current mail service issues, I urge you to consider options that would provide more immediate relief to the community, such as bolstering the Bozeman office with staff detailed from other locations that are sufficiently staffed. I also ask that you take steps to inform local postal customers about the current status of mail service in Bozeman and USPS’s plan to address the shortcomings.” Senator Tester has been Montana’s leading champion on ensuring reliable mail service across Montana. Last month, Senator Tester successfully led the charge to prevent the closure of the Coram post office, and earlier this year, the President signed his bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act into law, which will ensure long-term, reliable mail service in rural America and put the USPS on sound financial footing. He has repeatedly pushed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on USPS policy changes that have delayed mail, threatened to undermine the agency, and harmed rural America. In 2020, Tester blew the whistle on USPS for removing dozens of mail collection boxes from towns across Montana, leading USPS to pause its removal of collection boxes nationwide until after the November election. Since the beginning of the pandemic, thousands of Montanans have contacted Tester to express concerns about mail delays and their effects on Montana’s frontier communities.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9208,"The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee held a hearing today to solicit feedback from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) officials and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) on 13 pending proposals—including four priorities authored by Chairman Jon Tester to improve oversight of disability exams, streamline access to education benefits, support veteran cemeteries, and help disabled veterans with rising costs of living. During the hearing, Tester pressed VA on its ability to implement the Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act, legislation authored by the Senator to streamline education benefits for student veterans by fixing a requirement known as the 85/15 Rule. Recent changes in VA’s implementation of the Rule have caused significant confusion for schools in Montana and across the country. “In Montana, five schools have had programs suspended over the last year due to the 85/15 Rule, including two major universities—Montana State and the University of Montana,” said Chairman Tester. “My bill on the agenda today will clarify 85/15 requirements and make it easier for student veterans to enroll in legitimate education programs…assuming it [the Ensuring the Best Schools for Vets Act] passes, would the VA have the capacity to implement the provisions quickly so that student veterans wouldn’t be turned away from programs this fall?” “Yes we would,” replied James Ruhlman, VA’s Deputy Director for Program Management. “The streamlining measures are very clear.” Tester also pressed VA officials on deficiencies with veterans’ contract disability exams as noted in a recent report by the VA Office of Inspector General. The Senator’s No Bonuses for Bad Exams Act would expedite claims for veterans who received bad exams and require those exams to be expunged. During the second panel, the Committee heard from stakeholders on the Chairman’s Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act, No Bonuses for Bad Exams Act, and Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, in addition to other bills put forth by Committee members."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9209,"This week, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed Senator Tester’s First Responders Fair Return for Employees on Their Initial Retirement Earned (RETIRE) Act which will help federal firefighters, law enforcement officers, Customs and Border Protection officials, and other federal employees with potentially dangerous jobs receive their full retirement benefits if they get hurt while on duty. Tester introduced the bipartisan legislation in the Senate in January 2021. “Our first responders put themselves in harm’s way to keep Montanans safe, and we owe them their full retirement benefits if they’re hurt on the job,” said Tester. “This bipartisan legislation will help to make our first responders whole, and I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get this bill across the finish line and signed into law.”  Because of the physically demanding and dangerous nature of these federal jobs, designated “6c” occupations, Congress created an accelerated retirement system and established a mandatory early retirement age of 57. These employees pay a higher percentage of their wages toward their retirement, and are entitled to an annuity after 20 years of service. Currently, if they are injured at work and unable to complete their mandatory years of service, funds that they’ve paid into early retirement are eliminated, even if they return to the federal government in a non-6c position. The First Responders Fair RETIRE Act will allow federal public safety officers to retain their enhanced 6c retirement status when they return to the federal government after getting injured in the line of duty. They would still be able to retire after 20 years of federal service and will also be eligible to receive a lump sum payment of the benefits owed from their 6c retirement funds. The First Responders Fair RETIRE Act is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Federation of Federal Employees, and the International Association of Fire Fighters. Tester is a tireless advocate for the nation’s law enforcement and first responders and recently secured a pay increase for federal wildland firefighters through his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. His Putting America’s First Responders First Act, which clarifies the current tax code and ensures injured first responders do not have to pay taxes on injury-related compensation, was also signed into law late last year."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9210,"U.S. Senators Jon Tester and Steve Daines today urged the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) to hold a hearing on their St. Mary’s Reinvestment Act, which will provide critical resources to North Central Montana and make rehabilitating the St. Mary’s Diversion Dam more affordable. In a letter to ENR Chair Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Ranking Member John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tester and Daines said the project is critical to ensuring the Milk River Project can continue providing water to farmers, ranchers, and Tribes in Northcentral Montana that depend on it. “St. Mary’s Diversion Dam is the keystone of the Milk River Project, which provides water for over 121,000 irrigated acres, and provides water for four municipalities, two rural water systems, and the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” wrote Tester and Daines. “…Our bill builds on the $100 million for rehabilitation in the bipartisan infrastructure package to provide targeted funding for rehabilitating the St. Mary’s Diversion Dam, the highest priority piece of the Milk River Project for rehabilitation.  Past rehabilitation efforts have stalled due to the current 74 percent nonfederal costshare for rehabilitation work on the Milk River Project.  In response, our legislation sets the costshare for water users on an ability-to-pay study conducted by Bureau of Reclamation, setting the price tag for the remaining rehabilitation needs on what water users can actually afford.” The St. Mary’s Reinvestment Act will authorize $52 million to rehabilitate the St. Mary’s Diversion Dam, part of Bureau of Reclamation’s (BoR) Milk River Project in Northcentral Montana, and require the BoR to use an ability-to-pay study on what the current water users could afford to pay for the project and set the cost share for the rehabilitation based on that study. Currently, water users on the Milk River Project cover 74 percent of operations and maintenance costs, but that funding structure is unsustainable for the hundreds of millions of dollars in needed rehabilitation across the project. “Advancing this legislation, which has been a bipartisan priority for Montana’s delegation for years, will provide critical support to rehabilitating water infrastructure that is integral to supporting agricultural producers, Tribal water rights, meeting international commitments, and mitigating the impacts of the ongoing drought in north central Montana,” the Senators concluded. The Milk River Project provides water to 18,000 Montanans and irrigates enough cropland to feed one million people.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9201,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced that he secured more than $10 million for the construction of a new terminal at Yellowstone Airport in West Yellowstone. This funding will come from his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and will finance the replacement of a terminal that was built in 1963. The new terminal will be expanded to include adequate space for ticketing and will be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. “As interest in the Park and its surrounding communities grows, this new terminal will have a big impact on both the travel experience to and from Yellowstone, and on our economy as we recover from historic flooding,” said Tester. “Projects like this state-of-the-art upgrade for Yellowstone Airport are at the heart of our bipartisan infrastructure law—making targeted investments that create local jobs and grow our economy well into the future. As we work to help rebuild after flooding, this key investment is a sign that the region is back open for business.” Tester secured approximately $144 million for 69 Montana airports through his bipartisan infrastructure law, which will be awarded over five years through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Grants, which can be used to construct or repair runways and taxiways as well as make terminal and gate improvements. Tester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate his bipartisan package with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families. Tester secured significant wins for Montana in the legislation, including $2.82 billion for Montana’s roads, highways and bridges; $2.5 billion to complete all authorized Indian water rights settlements; $1 billion to complete all authorized rural water projects through the Bureau of Reclamation; $65 billion to deploy broadband to areas across the country that lack internet access and additionally make online connectivity affordable; and $3.37 billion to reduce wildfire risk nationwide, among others. Tester also worked to ensure that all iron, steel, and construction materials used for these projects must be made in America.

This funding will come from his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and will finance phase two of the terminal replacement. The new terminal will be larger, more energy-efficient, and compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. “With more and more people flying in and out of Missoula every day, this new terminal will have a big impact on both the travel experience and our local economy,” said Tester. “Projects like this state-of-the-art upgrade for Missoula’s airport are at the heart of our bipartisan infrastructure law—making targeted investments that create local jobs and grow our economy well into the future.”  Tester secured approximately $144 million for 69 Montana airports through his bipartisan infrastructure law, which will be awarded over five years through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Airport Improvement Grants, which can be used to construct or repair runways and taxiways as well as make terminal and gate improvements. Tester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate his bipartisan package with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families. Tester secured significant wins for Montana in the legislation, including $2.82 billion for Montana’s roads, highways and bridges; $2.5 billion to complete all authorized Indian water rights settlements; $1 billion to complete all authorized rural water projects through the Bureau of Reclamation; $65 billion to deploy broadband to areas across the country that lack internet access and additionally make online connectivity affordable; and $3.37 billion to reduce wildfire risk nationwide, among others. Tester also worked to ensure that all iron, steel, and construction materials used for these projects must be made in America.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9203,"As a part of their ongoing push to support rural communities impacted by the devastating flooding in Montana, Senators Tester and Daines and Congressman Matt Rosendale secured assurance from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) that guides, outfitters, and small businesses would receive support and flexibility in finding alternative options to operate on public lands. “The assurance from USFS is absolutely critical for Montana small businesses affected by the recent flooding,” the Montana delegation said in a joint statement. “As the busy season ramps up in Yellowstone and the surrounding areas, it’s especially important that we support the guides and outfitters who fuel our outdoor recreational economy by giving them the flexibility they need to keep their businesses up and running. We look forward to working with BLM and USFS to implement this flexibility as quickly as possible.” The USFS’s announcement is in direct response to a letter sent by the Montana delegation to BLM Acting State Director Theresa Hanley and USFS Regional Forester Leanne Marten urging them to provide outfitters, guides, and other members of affected communities support and flexibility in the wake of catastrophic flooding in Southwest Montana. “We urge you to bring any relevant authority you have to bear to identify recreation options on public lands in the area, apply flexibilities to permit administration, and to expedite any necessary permitting for businesses affected by the recent flooding on the Yellowstone,” wrote the Montana delegation. “Without other options, these businesses could face significant cancellations during the most important part of their year, just as the communities they live in attempt to rebuild after this historic flood.” The Montana congressional delegation also successfully urged the Federal Highway Administration to take immediate action and provide much needed funding through the FWHA Emergency Relief Program to areas affected by flooding resulting in $3 million in funding for Montana roads and highways. They also sent a letter to President Biden, which led to the approval of a major disaster declaration and activation of critical FEMA public assistant and support for recovery efforts. The State of Montana submitted a disaster declaration request to the federal government on June 15, 2022 in response to major flooding across south-central Montana, which was approved by President Biden the next day.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9195,"Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Ranking Member Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) are pushing the Biden Administration to streamline hiring of mental care professionals to fill critical mental health vacancies as directed under their Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act (Hannon Act)—landmark law to bolster the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) mental health workforce and increase rural veterans’ access to care. The Senators’ bipartisan Hannon Act, signed into law October 2020, required the VA and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop an occupational series for Licensed Professional Mental Health Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists at VA within one year of enactment of the law to deliver more timely mental health care to veterans. As of May 2022, VA reported a 23 percent vacancy rate for these critical positions. “The absence of an occupational series for these two positions can add difficulties to the hiring process for human resources personnel attempting to fill vacancies and candidates researching and applying for positions at VA,” the Senators wrote to VA Secretary Denis McDonough and OPM Director Kiran Ahuja. “This high vacancy rate means VA is less equipped to provide veterans with counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, military sexual trauma, readjustment to civilian life, marriage and family matters, and other issues. VA and OPM must act with haste to create an occupational series for these positions in order to ensure VA human resources personnel and potential qualified candidates for these positions are able to fill these vacancies as quickly as possible.” In the letter, Tester and Moran also requested VA and OPM report back on their progress establishing the occupational series requirement under the Hannon Act, stating: “Please provide an update on the status of the IPT’s [Integrated Project Team’s] work and a timeline…Ensuring VA is able to hire sufficient staff to provide high-quality counseling services in a timely manner is critical to meeting the mental health needs of veterans.” Read the Senators’ full letter HERE."

The Individual Assistance designation will allow individuals whose homes or businesses were damaged by the flooding to access additional resources, including through the Individuals and Housing Program, Disaster Case Management, Crisis Counseling and Assistance, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Unemployment Assistance, and Clean Removal Assistance. “We are glad to see FEMA approve the State’s request for Individual Assistance in Carbon, Park, and Stillwater counties, which were hit particularly hard by the severe flooding in southern Montana” the Montana delegation said in a joint statement. “This approval is critical to rebuilding our rural communities and reviving small businesses, and we look forward to working with FEMA to ensure these resources are delivered to folks as soon as possible so they can start getting back on their feet.” The state of Montana submitted a request to FEMA on June 23, 2022 for individual assistance for communities affected by the severe flooding in Montana. That same day, the Montana congressional delegation sent a letter to FEMA Administrator Criswell, urging the agency to approve the request. Earlier this month, the Montana congressional delegation urged the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to provide outfitters, guides, and other members of affected communities support and flexibility in finding alternative options to operate on public lands in the wake of catastrophic flooding in Southwest Montana. The Montana congressional delegation also successfully urged the Federal Highway Administration to take immediate action and provide much needed funding through the FWHA Emergency Relief Program to areas affected by flooding resulting in $3 million in funding for Montana roads and highways.

The recently implemented Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), which limited traffic in the park, will also be suspended. “With the reopening of the Yellowstone’s north loop, Montana’s gateway communities are open for business,” said the Montana delegation. “We appreciate the swift work of the Department of Interior and the National Park Service to reopen the park, and we look forward to continuing to work together to spur activity in gateway communities as we recover from recent flooding. This is a great step towards rebuilding, and will provide a needed boost to economies in southwest Montana.” The Department of Interior announced that Yellowstone National Park’s north loop will officially reopen on Saturday, July 2, 2022, effectively opening 93% of roads in the park. In addition to roads in the south loop, visitors will now be able to access: Norris Junction to Mammoth Hot Springs; Mammoth Hot Springs to Tower-Roosevelt; and Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass). Visitors can access the south and north loops via the East Entrance (Cody, Wyoming), West Entrance (West Yellowstone, Montana), and South Entrance (Grand Teton/Jackson, Wyoming). Additionally, the park will also be suspending ALPS, opening the park to full visitor capacity. The North Entrance Road (Gardiner, Montana to Mammoth Hot Springs) and Northeast Entrance Road (Cooke City/Silver Gate, Montana to Tower-Roosevelt) remain closed to visitor vehicular traffic while temporary repairs are completed. Visitors may access the park on foot through these entrances in order to recreate (fish and hike) in areas not identified as closed, and the park will evaluate authorizing bicycle use through these entrances up to damaged road sections in the near future. On June 20, 2022 the National Park Service announced expedited plans to re-open 80 percent of Yellowstone National Park, making use of $50 million in emergency Federal Highway Administration funding from the Biden Administration requested by U.S. Senators Tester and Daines and Congressman Matt Rosendale. The initial $50 million will be used to restore temporary access to Gardiner and Cooke City, Montana and other additional sites. Plans are being finalized for improving the Old Gardiner Road for temporary access between Yellowstone and Gardiner, Montana. In partnership with the Federal Highways Administration, road construction crews and materials that were already in the park for a previously scheduled road project to repair 22 miles of the Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and West Thumb Geyser Basin will be diverted to the Old Gardiner Road project.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9191,"To better protect student veterans and their hard-earned benefits in Montana and across the country, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jon Tester is introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) 85/15 Rule—a school reporting requirement that prohibits VA from paying benefits to students enrolling in education programs where more than 85 percent of the students in that program use the G.I. Bill or other funding from the Department. VA recently rescinded all exemptions for schools where the number of students receiving VA assistance is less than 35 percent of the total campus population, placing many schools’ ability to enroll veterans in jeopardy due to burdensome administrative red tape. The Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022 will clarify the requirements of the 85/15 rule, ensuring education programs can continue accepting veterans while maintaining oversight to prevent fraudulent programs from taking advantage of veterans. “We’ve got to remove roadblocks standing in the way of our veterans and their families getting the quality education they deserve at colleges and universities across the country,” said Chairman Tester. “Our bipartisan bill will do just that—cutting red tape and strengthening necessary oversight to prevent for-profit colleges from preying on veterans’ hard-earned benefits.” Last November, Tester expressed his concerns with the Department’s latest interpretation of the law and requested VA take action to remove barriers for both schools and veterans utilizing their earned VA education benefits. The Senator’s bill received strong backing from Veterans Service Organizations and stakeholders nationwide. “We’ve heard from schools and SVA Chapters for well over a year now concerned with the trickle-down effects of VA’s recent changes to its 85/15 rule. The potential, unintended consequences of the new requirements to limit student veterans’ access to quality institutions cannot be overstated,” said Lauren Augustine, Vice President of Government Affairs with Student Veterans of America. “The Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022 addresses these concerns and better aligns the rule with Congress’ intent. We thank Chairman Tester, Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost for their dedication to addressing this critical issue.” “The Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022 is exactly what veteran students and institutions needed,” said Stephen Patterson, Executive Director of the Veterans Education Project. “This legislation is a great step forward to ensuring veteran students are able to use their earned benefits at excellent schools, while providing more oversight and flexibility to colleges and universities.” Full text of the Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022 can be found HERE."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9190,"U.S. Senators Jon Tester and Steve Daines and Congressman Matt Rosendale today sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell urging the agency to make Montana eligible to receive funds through FEMA’s new Swift Current Initiative, which would make communities affected by severe flooding eligible for Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA). Currently, FEMA is only offering this funding opportunity to Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, states affected by Hurricane Ida. “We write to you today to urge you to make Montana eligible to receive funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Swift Current Initiative,” the Montana delegation wrote. “By getting federal resources that include mitigation assistance to folks impacted by flooding as quickly as possible they can start their recovery while reducing the risk of facing these same challenges in the future… While the full extent of the damage is still unknown, it is imperative that we immediately begin directing sufficient federal resources to the affected communities, and we must help these communities rebuild in a way that mitigates similar damage in the future.” The Swift Current Initiative provides flood mitigation assistance funding to properties insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that suffer severe flood damage, and is a new program stemming from the recently implemented bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The initiative explores ways to make flood mitigation assistance available within the disaster recovery timeframe for repetitively flooded and substantially damaged buildings insured under the NFIP in advance of the annual grant process. The delegation is requesting FEMA expand the initiative beyond states affected by Hurricane Ida. Last week the Montana Congressional Delegation urged FEMA to approve the State of Montana’s request to designate Carbon, Park and Stillwater counties for Individual Assistance. It is recommended that individuals and businesses in affected communities document disaster related damages and expenses in order to be prepared if individual assistance is made available. This includes taking photos of damage and repairs; keeping receipts for hotels, clothing, and other personal property used to replace or address damage caused by the flooding; and keeping notes on how it is connected to the emergency. Last week, the delegation urged the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to provide outfitters, guides, and other members of affected communities support and flexibility in finding alternative options to operate on public lands in the wake of catastrophic flooding in Southwest Montana. Earlier this month, the Montana delegation successfully urged the Federal Highway Administration to take immediate action and provide much needed funding through the FWHA Emergency Relief Program to areas affected by flooding resulting in $3 million in funding for Montana roads and highways.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9189,"Last week, President Joe Biden signed into law the VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act—bipartisan legislation championed by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester to increase transparency of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program. The VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act will hold VA accountable and increase transparency by requiring the VA Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics, and patient safety issues related to the EHRM—issues the VA Office of Inspector General has repeatedly identified with the deployment of the program. “It’s clear that VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization program is not working for veterans, VA employees, or taxpayers,” said Chairman Tester. “I’m proud to have worked with Senator Moran and our colleagues to get our bipartisan bill across the finish line, allowing us to increase oversight and transparency on behalf of the VA medical staff using this program, so we can better provide our nation’s veterans the quality care they have earned.”  A long-time advocate of increasing transparency around the EHRM program, the Senator led the charge in demanding transparency from the Trump Administration on the system’s roll-out—specifically calling for program evaluation metrics, strategies to bolster access to care during roll-out, the need for provider engagement and training, and accurate cost estimates for the significant upgrades to VA’s physical and information technology infrastructure needed for the system. To address these and other EHRM challenges, VA Secretary Denis McDonough launched a strategic review under the Biden Administration following a bipartisan, bicameral push by Tester and his colleagues. At a Committee hearing last July, VA announced an initial set of critical reforms consistent with those championed by Tester to tackle issues with the planning and deployment of the EHRM system. In addition, last December, VA announced a further restructuring of the program’s management to include new senior leadership personnel. Continuing his push to address long-standing and new issues with the deployment of the system, Tester will lead a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee oversight hearing on the EHRM program on July 20."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9188,"Continuing his aggressive push to fully reopen the northern border, U.S. Senator Jon Tester pressed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to finally end the vaccination mandate for international truck drivers and travelers entering the United States through land ports of entry, and to fully reopen all land ports along the U.S.-Canada border to pre-pandemic hours. “We have made significant progress in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and I continue to encourage all individuals to get vaccinated. However, we must also work to address inflation and improve the economy,” Tester wrote to DHS. “That’s why I am concerned about continued restrictions for land travel that disproportionally affect truck drivers from Canada who are responsible for bringing food, farm inputs, and other vital goods into the United States.  I believe removing these restrictions for truck drivers and increasing trade with our neighbors is key to improving our supply chain and decreasing inflation.”  Tester concluded: “Reducing restrictions on international travel and restoring hours of operations at our land ports of entry will help the American economy stay strong.  I stand ready to assist DHS in fully reopening the northern border, increasing trade, and improving our economy and national security.” Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announcement that it would end the COVID testing requirements for international travelers entering the United States by air, DHS has not announced any change in vaccine requirements for foreign travelers and truck drivers entering the country through land ports of entry. In April, DHS extended vaccination requirements for individuals entering the United States by land. Tester has been Montana’s leading champion to reopen the northern border and ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have the resources they need to secure the border and protect Montana communities. Earlier this month, Tester and John Hoeven (R-N.D.) led a bipartisan group of senators in urging the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee to provide CBP with the necessary resources to properly staff and secure the U.S.-Canada border in Fiscal Year 2023. Last Month, Tester grilled Secretary Mayorkas about the Department’s plans for retaining Customs and Border Protection agents, securing the northern border, and restoring U.S.-Canada points of entry to pre-pandemic operating times. Tester first called for the northern border to fully re-open in May 2021, urging the Biden Administration to work with Canadian officials to swiftly and safely open the border. He followed up with a letter to Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas pressing the Administration to move forward with the Canadian reopening in a “safe, fair, and efficient manner.” In November, the Biden Administration heeded Tester’s call and reopened the border to vaccinated travelers. Montana shares a 545 mile border with Canada and is home to many border towns whose economies rely on Canadian trade and commerce. According to the Canadian Trade Commissioner, Canada is Montana’s top international trading partner, buying more from the state than the next six states combined. Reports by the U.S. Trade Representative estimate that Montana exported $692 million in goods to Canada is 2018, representing 42 percent of the state’s total goods exports.

We believe the recommendations put forth to the AIR Commission are not reflective of that goal, and would put veterans in both rural and urban areas at a disadvantage, which is why we are announcing that this process does not have our support and will not move forward. The Commission is not necessary for our continued push to invest in VA health infrastructure, and together we remain dedicated to providing the Department with the resources and tools it needs to continue delivering quality care and earned services to veterans in 21st century facilities—now and into the future.”  In 2018 Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law the VA MISSION Act. Among its many provisions, the law required the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to research, develop and publish a list of recommendations intended to modernize VA medical facilities and health care delivery—including through facility expansions, relocations, closures or changes in services. The law further directed those recommendations to be reviewed by a presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed Commission, which would then report its views of the recommendations to the President who could end the process or present recommendations to Congress for a vote. Without the Senate’s approval of the nominees, no Commission will be established and the process as outlined by the VA MISSION Act will not move forward."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9184,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills championed by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester last week as part of a comprehensive veterans’ mental health package called the Support The Resilience of Our Nation’s Great (STRONG) Veterans Act. This package now heads to the Senate where it must pass before heading to the President’s desk to be signed into law. “Far too many servicemembers return home suffering from the invisible wounds of war, and it’s on us to make sure the Department of Veterans Affairs has the tools it needs to connect those who served with their earned support,” said Chairman Tester. “I’m glad the House took steps to combat veteran suicide by clearing my bipartisan bills that’ll strengthen VA’s mental health care workforce, bolster the Veterans Crisis Line, and expand life-saving resources to those who need it.” The House’s STRONG Veterans Act included the following bipartisan bills authored by Chairman Tester. Post-9/11 Veterans’ Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2021—Bipartisan legislation to strengthen VA’s mental health care workforce, expand care options, and support mental health research at the Department. Revising and Expediting Actions for the Crisis Hotline (REACH) for Veterans Act—Bipartisan legislation to improve the Veterans Crisis Line’s (VCL) staff training, management, and response to veteran callers at risk of suicide. As the only member of the Montana delegation who sits on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Chairman Tester led a Committee hearing in November aimed at increasing collaboration between VA and the Department of Defense to better support transitioning servicemembers and veterans’ access to mental health resources nationwide. In March, the Senator also publically urged VA to eliminate copayments for outpatient medical care and reduce prescription copayments for veterans at high-risk of suicide."

There’s still plenty of work to be done as we recover from these historic floods, but I’m confident that we’ll continue to come together and get the job done.” Tester helped negotiate the American Rescue Plan Act, which provided this funding. Thanks to the ARPA, Montana’s unemployment rate is currently at the lowest rate in state history."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9182,"Senator Tester led 21 of his Senate colleagues in urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reconsider the agency’s proposed rule to update Medicare payment policies and rates for skilled nursing facilities. Tester and his colleagues highlighted that this action would result in a $320 million overall decrease in payments to long term care facilities, and expressed concerns that the proposed payment cut could worsen current challenges and lead to the closure of rural facilities. “Rural long-term care facilities are facing a historic labor crisis, losing more than 400,000 caregivers since the beginning of the pandemic….In the worst cases, rural facilities are being forced to permanently close their doors. When a small community loses a health care provider, there is no guarantee it will ever come back,” Tester and his colleagues wrote. “With these challenges in mind, we believe now is not the time to reduce CMS’s payments to facilities that are vital to health care and quality of life in rural America.” The senators concluded: “We stand ready to partner with CMS to ensure the most vulnerable in our county are not put at further risk as our nation continues to grapple with the consequences of the pandemic.”  Tester has worked tirelessly to ensure that Montanans and Montana’s health care providers have the resources to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. In March of 2020, Tester voted to deliver critical, urgent relief to Montana workers, families, small businesses, and hospital through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This funding included $200 million for CMS to assists nursing homes with infection control. That April, he secured $111.5 million for Montana’s hospitals and $9.1 million for Montana Community Health Centers to respond to the pandemic, and secured an additional $3 million for the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council Public Health Workforce Expansion in Indian Country. Last December, Tester secured $25,647,522 in Health and Human Services (HHS) funding for 286 Montana health care providers through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). This HHS funding was issued through Provider Relief Fund Payments to health care providers who had experienced revenue losses and expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used to recruit and retain staff, purchase personal protective equipment, and modernize health care facilities.

The Montana delegation sent a letter to the Biden Administration on June 17 requesting these FHWA funds to support the recovery of affected communities. “We are just beginning to get an assessment of the full damage that resulted from the catastrophic flooding in Southwestern Montana, but that doesn’t mean we have time to sit around and wait to get relief to communities in need,” said the Montana delegation. “This funding is a critical early step to begin to repair and restore essential roadways that have been damaged or destroyed by this disaster. We urge federal agencies to continue to work hand in hand with folks on the ground and provide immediate emergency support to affected Montana communities so they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.” The funding announced today will be used for the repair or reconstruction of Federal-aid highways that have suffered serious damage as a result of the flooding in Southwestern Montana. Eligible repair work includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential traffic, minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining facilities as well as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition. Earlier this week, the National Park Service announced expedited plans to re-open 80 percent of Yellowstone National Park, making use of $50 million in emergency Federal Highway Administration funding from the Biden Administration requested by the Montana delegation. The park’s northern loop is expected to reopen in two weeks or less following completion of clean-up, repairs and final inspection of the northern loop infrastructure. This will allow visitors to access Dunraven Pass, Tower, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris opening visitor access to approximately 80 percent of Yellowstone National Park. Additional details on access will be announced in the coming weeks. The initial $50 million will be used to restore temporary access to Gardiner and Cooke City, Montana and other additional sites. Plans are being finalized for improving the Old Gardiner Road for temporary access between Yellowstone and Gardiner, Montana. In partnership with the Federal Highways Administration, road construction crews and materials that were already in the park for a previously scheduled road project to repair 22 miles of the Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and West Thumb Geyser Basin will be diverted to the Old Gardiner Road project. The Montana congressional delegation sent a letter to President Biden, urging the approval of a major disaster declaration and activation of critical FEMA assistant and support for recovery efforts.

Now we need to put these bills on the Senate floor, because we have to hold massive multi-national corporations accountable as they continue to price gouge consumers while ripping off our family ranchers.”  Tester’s Meat Packing Special Investigator Act with Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) would create the “Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters” within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The new USDA special investigator will have a team of investigators, with subpoena power, dedicated to preventing and addressing anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries and enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. They will coordinate and act in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and create a new bridge between the USDA and the Department of Homeland Security to protect the continuation of the food supply and increase our national security. With a team of dedicated staff, the USDA will now have the ability to investigate the tough issues facing producers and hold bad actors accountable. Tester’s Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act with Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Grassley, and Ron Wyden (R-Ore.) would: As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, Tester has long been an advocate for increased market transparency and more competitive practices for Montana producers and consumers. Earlier this year, Tester introduced his Agriculture Right to Repair Act to finally guarantee farmers the right to repair their own equipment and end current restrictions on the repair market. Last year, he introduced his bipartisan American Beef Labeling Act, which would ensure that only beef raised in the United States is labeled as a product of the USA, and his bipartisan New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act, which allows meat and poultry products inspected by Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) approved state Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs to be sold across state lines.

The funding will come from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Tester negotiated and helped pass into law last year.In the next few months, the Administration will retroactively increase firefighters’ pay up to $20,000 or 50 percent of their annual base from October 2021 to September 2023. The Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will also establish a joint DOI-U.S. Forest Service program that will address firefighter mental health needs and establish a stress management staffing response. The Administration has also committed to increasing staffing and recruitment of wildland firefighters. “For too long, Montana’s wildland firefighters have been overworked and underpaid,” Tester said. “With wildfires becoming all too common in our state, it’s critical that our brave first responders have the resources and support they need to continue protecting our communities and public lands, while staying safe themselves.” Tester has led the effort to support firefighters and provide relief for communities most affected by wildfires in Montana.Last month, Tester urged Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, and Office of Personnel Management Director Kiran Ahuja, to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters in order to combat staffing shortages as fire season approached.In April, Tester secured $19.3 million for wildfire mitigation in Kootenai National Forest through IIJA, which required the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in conjunction with land management agencies, to create a wildland firefighter class within 180 days and to seek to convert 1,000 firefighters to year-long positions, along with $100 million for workforce training, including fire crews. The bill also included $600 million for wildland firefighter pay salaries, with a requirement to increase the base pay for wildland firefighters a minimum of $20,000.Last year, wildfires burned nearly 940,000 acres across Montana, making it the worst wildfire season the state had seen since 2017. National Guard troops were deployed to help combat what was declared a wildfire emergency. This year, Montana is expected to suffer from another severe wildfire season. "

I want to thank Chair Tester and Ranking Member Moran for their remarkable work to pass the PACT Act, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this bill so I can sign it into law right away.” “IAVA applauds the leadership of Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester and Ranking Member Jerry Moran in forging this landmark bipartisan legislation, and Senators for delivering long-overdue benefits to millions of veterans and servicemembers suffering from military toxic exposures,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). “IAVA has been fighting for years to get comprehensive legislation to the finish line, and it has been an honor to work beside countless advocates, survivors, and family members who helped make this possible so that toxic exposed veterans never have to bear the burden of battling for the benefits they deserve.” “Our country makes a promise to Service members that if they get wounded in the line of duty, they will receive the support of a grateful nation when they return home,” said Mike Linnington, CEO of the Wounded Warrior Project. “For far too long, that promise has been broken for veterans suffering from toxic wounds.

On behalf of our more than one million members, we thank Senators Tester and Moran for their steadfast leadership and commitment to keeping our promises to the men and women who served, particularly those injured, ill and disabled from their service.” “This is an enormous victory for veterans, servicemembers, and their families,” said Matthew “Fritz” Mihelcic, Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and its Auxiliary. “I commend every senator who voted in favor for those who have borne the burden of toxic exposure, for the military families struggling to care them, and for the military men and women who will face toxic exposure in the future.” “The U.S. Senate has saved lives and truly delivered for veterans,” said Paul E. Dillard, National Commander of The American Legion. “By passing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, the 117th Congress has put substance behind the phrase, ‘Thank you for your service.’ The American Legion is grateful for the service of millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits, atomic radiation, Agent Orange, and other environmental poisons. Thanks to the U.S. Congress, these men and women will be able to receive the care and benefits they have earned. The PACT Act is a historic bipartisan achievement.

Passing the PACT Act is a national security issue. Young Americans considering the military must know that their government will take care of them—and not abandon them when they come home sick or disabled.” The Senators worked for months with colleagues from both chambers, VA Secretary Denis McDonough, the Biden Administration, and Veterans Service Organizations to deliver the historic bill.

I’m in touch with local, state and federal officials to make sure that folks on the ground are getting the help they need as swiftly as possible, and I appreciate the work of our first responders in keeping folks safe.”  Tester has been in touch with officials at several federal agencies including Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Park Service, the Small Business Administration, and others, and is urging the agencies to work with state and local governments to quickly distribute resources to mitigate damage and make repairs. He has also been in touch with state and local officials to learn about the degree of damage in communities across the state. Tester was one of five Republicans and four other Democrats to craft the recently signed bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains urgently needed funding to repair and replace outdated infrastructure.

Tester was joined by Montana State University Director of Veteran Services Joe Schumacher and toxic-exposed veteran Robert Hunter. “In Montana, more than 60,000 veterans may have been exposed to toxic substances during their service,” said Chairman Tester. “As a result of their toxic exposure, many folks have developed rare, deadly cancers, respiratory conditions, and other debilitating illnesses. Next week, the Senate will have an opportunity to do right by these folks by passing my bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. To put it simply—it’s the bill our veterans and their families deserve, and are counting on.” The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 is comprehensive legislation championed by the Senator to deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the first time in the nation’s history.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9141,"Following a push from Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today announced it will suspend its annual reassessment process for participants in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (Caregivers Program) as part of its ongoing review of the Program’s eligibility criteria. The annual reassessments of veterans and their caregivers is an extremely invasive process, often taking a mental and physical toll on family caregivers. VA also announced it will not discharge participants in the program or reduce stipends based on a reassessment. “VA’s decision to pause discharges and reassessments in the Caregivers Program is the right move for our nation’s veterans and their caregivers,” said Chairman Tester. “I’m glad the Biden Administration is taking the concerns from family caregivers in Montana and across the country seriously, and continuing to move the ball forward on getting these folks the support they deserve.” Under the Trump Administration, VA defied Congress and the concerns of veterans and caregivers by enacting regulations that narrowed the Program’s eligibility to veterans with a 70 percent or higher service-connected disability rating, and those with an inability to perform an activity of daily living without assistance each and every time the activity occurs. These new regulations would have led to an estimated 90 percent of Post-9/11 veterans losing their eligibility for the program. Following the Biden Administration’s pause in discharges from the Program, veterans and caregivers remained concerned that ongoing eligibility reassessments would be used to discharge them from the program in the future. In response to the Trump Administration’s restrictive regulations, Tester raised concerns and urged Secretary McDonough to reconsider the Department’s tighten eligibility and delayed roll-out of the Caregivers Program. Following Tester’s push, McDonough announced sweeping changes to the Program earlier this year. Tester led the fight for years to expand the Caregivers Program to veterans of all eras—successfully including language in the bipartisan VA MISSION Act of 2018. At a Committee oversight hearing in March, Tester called on VA Secretary Denis McDonough to revise the Program’s eligibility requirements and reform the reassessment processes to ensure the Caregivers Program is meeting the intent of Congress. The Senator also led a bipartisan push in April, urging transparency and updated guidance on the Department’s recent changes to the Program."

I’m proud to have worked hand-in-hand with Senator Boozman, our Senate colleagues, and veteran stakeholders to deliver these wins for the men and women who served and sacrificed.” President Joe Biden signed the following bills championed by Tester:Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021 – Bipartisan legislation to provide the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) authority to subpoena testimony from former VA employees who have left federal service, former contractor personnel who performed work for the Department, or other potentially relevant individuals during the course of its inspections, reviews, and investigations. Under current law, VA OIG does not have this essential oversight tool, which can limit VA OIG and Congress’ ability to conduct complete and thorough oversight.Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act – Bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand veterans’ access to high-quality breast cancer screenings and lifesaving cancer care. This bill would require VA to develop a strategic plan to improve breast imaging services, create a telemammography pilot program for veterans in areas where VA does not offer in-house mammography, and expand veterans’ access to clinical trials through partnerships with the National Cancer Institute.A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer the name of property of the Department of Veterans Affairs designated by law to other property of the Department – Bipartisan legislation to streamline the transfer of Congressionally-approved VA facility names.

The increase in funding will eliminate the Post Office’s reliance on local tax dollars, freeing up approximately $64,300 in Local Resort Tax dollars to support the growing community.“Folks in Montana rely on the Postal Service for everything from prescription drugs to Social Security benefits,” said Tester. “As Big Sky continues to boom, it’s critical that its residents have access to everything the Postal Service has to offer. This funding will allow the Big Sky Post Office to support the current population – while freeing up local tax dollars – and is a big step towards necessary, permanent facility expansion.”“As Big Sky grows, it’s critical we adapt for our future and build on the spirit of collaboration that makes this community special,” said Big Sky Resort Area District Executive Director Daniel Bierschwale. “The District is proud to have supported the Big Sky Post Office and thrilled with the recent collaboration across local, state, and federal government helping plan for the future of postal operations in Big Sky. We appreciate the efforts of Senator Tester and his staff in helping to secure this funding increase, and look forward to working together to find further long term solutions.”Tester’s push was prompted by outreach from Big Sky community members citing recent, rapid population growth as the cause for post office capacity issues and the urgent need for permanent facility expansion. Following outreach from the community, Tester facilitated meetings between USPS representatives and local stakeholders resulting in the increased funding for the current facility, and the start of the surveying process for permanent facility expansion. Tester also sent a letter in May to USPS Director of Post Office Operations, Ms. Leslie Johnson Frick, urging her to visit Big Sky and hold meetings with postal customers and assess capacity of the local contracted USPS facility. In his letter, Tester noted the success of the Big Sky Post Office during the past 20 years and cited the tremendous growth of the community as a reason for potential facility expansion.Tester has been Montana’s leading champion holding the USPS accountable. In April, his Postal Reform Act was signed into law, which ensures long-term, reliable mail service and put the USPS on sound financial footing. He has repeatedly pushed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on USPS policy changes that have delayed mail, threatened to undermine the agency, and harmed rural America. In 2020, Tester blew the whistle on USPS for removing dozens of mail collection boxes from towns across Montana, leading USPS to pause its removal of collection boxes nationwide until after the November election. Since the beginning of the pandemic, thousands of Montanans have contacted Tester to express concerns about mail delays and their effects on Montana’s frontier communities. "

Thanks to ARPA, Montana’s unemployment rate is currently at the lowest rate in state history. “Investing in public lands and education are two of the most effective ways to support our rural communities, and AmeriCorps excels at both.” Tester said. “These funds will help boost our state’s robust recreation economy and create opportunities for young Montanans as they enter a competitive job market.” A breakdown of the funding can be found below:In 2020, Tester held hundreds of meetings with Montana’s workers, small business owners, frontline health care workers, educators, Tribes, and local officials to solicit input about what Montanans need to make it through the pandemic. Tester used that input to help craft the American Rescue Plan, which provided $20 billion to get folks vaccinated and back to work, $382 million to get Montana schools reopened, legislation to restore long-distance service to the Empire Builder Amtrak route, and billions for small businesses, rural hospitals and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In September of 2021, Tester secured more than $2 million in ARPA funding for AmeriCorps to address conservation and community needs in Montana.

In January 2021, the Senate passed the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, which required the Department to establish a national policy regarding medical exams required to certify volunteer drivers for the VTN no later than 90 days following its passage. As of June 1, 2022 VA has not completed this requirement. “In rural areas across the country, a pressing concern of veterans is access to transportation to get to and from appointments,” the Senators wrote to VA Secretary Denis McDonough. “This is especially true for veterans unable to drive themselves to and from medical appointments for financial or medical reasons. The VTN has stepped in to fill that gap, with the DAV [Disabled American Veterans] providing volunteer drivers, and even covering costs. Despite the difference these efforts make for veterans, the DAV continues to struggle to receive reciprocal support from VA, which is not certifying volunteer drivers in a timely manner.” In the letter, the Senators highlighted various instances where red tape prevents VTN drivers from helping veterans access the care they need and earned. This includes drivers failing to receive a response from the Department regarding necessary paperwork to participate in the program and prolonged wait times for physical exams required to become certified as a volunteer driver. They continued, “We are calling on VA to quickly develop and disseminate a straightforward, standardized and timely process for certifying volunteer drivers…Once this process is finalized, VA should undergo a concerted effort to not only disseminate the updated guidance, but also seek out and recruit volunteers, especially those who began the certification process but discontinued it after facing too much bureaucracy to continue.” Read the Senators’ full letter HERE."

Tester and Hoeven outlined the importance of providing CBP with sufficient personnel, technology, and tools to secure the northern border and to alleviate the need for temporary duty assignments that draw northern border officers away from their posts. They also pushed for the full re-opening of northern border ports of entry to pre-pandemic hours to allow for accessible and lawful travel and trade. “U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents have the critical mission of protecting the American people by securing our borders,” the Senators wrote. “Continued temporary duty assignments take a significant toll on officers and agents as well as families assigned to northern border duties. We encourage the subcommittee to provide the necessary resources to ensure personnel on the northern border can fulfill their mission without the constant need for temporary duty assignments. Finally, [it is] essential to have ports of entry open to accommodate lawful travel between the United States and Canada. As we turn the corner on the pandemic, the subcommittee should ensure that CBP has the necessary resources to resume pre-pandemic operating hours at northern border ports of entry.”  Tester first called for the northern border to fully re-open in May 2021, urging the Biden Administration to work with Canadian officials to swiftly and safely open the border. He followed up with a letter to Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas pressing the Administration to move forward with the Canadian reopening in a “safe, fair, and efficient manner.” In November, the Biden Administration heeded Tester’s call and reopened the border to vaccinated travelers. Last Month, Tester grilled Secretary Mayorkas about the Department’s plans for retaining Customs and Border Protection agents, securing the northern border, and restoring U.S.-Canada points of entry to pre-pandemic operating times. Montana shares a 545 mile border with Canada and is home to many border towns whose economies rely on Canadian trade and commerce. According to the Canadian Trade Commissioner, Canada is Montana’s top international trading partner, buying more from the state than the next six states combined.

The St. Mary’s Reinvestment Act will authorize $52 million to rehabilitate the St. Mary’s Diversion Dam, part of Bureau of Reclamation’s (BoR) Milk River Project in northcentral Montana, and require the BoR to use an ability-to-pay study on what the current water users could afford to pay for the project and set the cost share for the rehabilitation based on that study. “The St. Mary’s Diversion Dam is a cornerstone of northern Montana’s agricultural economy and way of life that irrigates over 121,000 acres, provides water for four towns, and serves a critical role in the water rights for two Tribal communities,” said Tester. “[The St. Mary’s Reinvestment Act] builds on the $100 million I secured in the bipartisan infrastructure bill for rehabilitating the Milk River Project by providing targeted funding specifically for the St. Mary’s Diversion Dam, one of the highest-priority parts of the project…In Montana, we know that water is life. And it’s a testament to how universal that is when you see the entire Montana delegation united behind this bill.” Tester authored and introduced the bill, with Senator Daines joining as an original cosponsor. Congressman Rosendale introduced the bill in the House of Representatives. Earlier this year, Tester announced $85 million for the St. Mary’s Diversion and Headworks as a part of up to $100 million he secured for the Milk River Project through his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Tester negotiated and helped pass into law last year. This funding will be allocated through the Bureau of Reclamation and used for the St. Mary’s Canal diversion and headworks replacement project, which will include a large fish bypass structure to mitigate impacts to bull trout. The first round of funding, $2.5 million, was announced in January and will be used for planning and project design in 2022. Tester directly negotiated and wrote the provision of the IIJA that will provide up to $100 million to rehabilitate the Milk River Project, and he was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to support the legislation. Tester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate his bipartisan package with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families."

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 is comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under VA for the first time in the nation’s history. “This is a big step forward in showing all Americans the Senate’s plans to deliver toxic-exposed veterans and their families the comprehensive health care and benefits they have earned for the first time in this country’s history,” said Senators Tester and Moran. “As leaders of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, we have worked tirelessly with our colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure this legislation expands VA health care eligibility for Post-9/11 combat veterans, improves VA’s claims processing, and delivers VA the necessary resources to take care of our veterans from every generation. While our work is far from over, together we’re committed to keeping up our end of the bargain to those who sacrificed on behalf of our freedoms by getting this bill across the finish line as soon as possible.” This legislation will now head to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate. After Senate passage, the legislation must be passed by the House before being signed into law by the President.

Tester made the announcement alongside Great Falls Development Authority President and CEO Brett Doney, Alluvion Health Vice President of Strategy and Innovation Casey Schreiner, and Great Falls Mayor Pro Tempore Susan Wolff. This funding will replenish the Great Falls Development Authority’s Brownsfields fund for future projects, and it is a part of $15,148,199 from Tester’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for Brownsfield grant funding for 11 projects across Montana. “Redeveloping sites like the Rocky Mountain Building is critical for the long-term economic growth of Cascade County, and Great Falls Development Authority has been leading the way, investing federal resources in projects that create jobs, lower costs, and grow our economy,” said Tester. “That’s exactly what these funds from my bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are designed to do. And local partners like the GFDA are critical to making sure that once these investments make it out the door, they make it to where the greatest needs are on the ground.” EPA’s Brownfields Program provides grants and technical assistance to communities, states, Tribes and others to assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse contaminated properties. A Brownfield is a property that the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Funding for the Great Falls Development Authority will be delivered in the form of Revolving Loan Funds. Tester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families."

The cost of living adjustment will be determined by the annual COLA adjustment to social security benefits, as determined by the Social Security Administration, and would go into effect Dec. 1, 2022.

Tester continues to lead the fight to increase investments in resources for Montana’s police and first responders who put their lives on the line to keep communities safe. “Our law enforcement officers in Montana and across the country are heroes, and we need to provide robust funding for the resources they need to do their jobs and keep our communities safe,” said Tester. “We owe these folks our gratitude, but words aren’t enough—we need to have their backs every day, the same way they have ours. The best way to honor their courage and sacrifice is to make sure they have the tools to do their jobs effectively and that they have access to the benefits they earn every day for putting their lives on the line.” Tester’s resolution honors the 576 law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2021, including nearly 400 who died from COVID-19, as well as the 92 lost to date in 2022. In the face of an ongoing pandemic and rise in violent crime, Montana law enforcement personnel continue to answer the call, serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves. Tester’s resolution designates the week of May 15 through May 21, 2022, as “National Police Week,” and expresses unwavering support for law enforcement officers in the Treasure State and across the United States in the pursuit of preserving safe and secure communities. A tireless advocate for Montana’s law enforcement and first responders, Tester was the only member of the delegation to support the FY22 omnibus, which included more than $1 billion for law enforcement agencies and he worked to ensure that the American Rescue Plan provides $1.25 billion in direct relief to Montana state, local, and county governments to plug revenue gaps and keep critical services like cops and firefighters on the beat. Tester is also pushing his bipartisan First Responders Fair Return for Employees on Their Initial Retirement Earned (RETIRE) Act, to help federal firefighters, law enforcement officers, Customs and Border Protection officials, and other federal employees with potentially dangerous jobs receive their full retirement benefits if they get hurt while on duty. Tester’s bill advanced out of the House Oversight Committee last week with bipartisan support. Additionally, Tester’s Invest to Protect Act, which would create a new dedicated Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program with a streamlined application process for local and Tribal law enforcement agencies under 200 officers, was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. Tester is also continuing to work to ensure law enforcement officers have the tools and resources they need to do their job safely. Tester reintroduced his bipartisan Assisting Narcotic and Trafficking Officers in Interdicting (ANTI) Drug Act to increase funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area taskforce, Operation Stonegarden, and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), which support Montana police officers and support local efforts to combat drug trafficking across Montana."

I’m especially proud that we’re one step closer to improving veterans’ access to high-quality breast cancer screenings and care, and I encourage the President to sign these bills into law without delay.” The House considered—and passed—the following bills championed by Tester: Strengthening Oversight for Veterans Act of 2021 – Bipartisan legislation to provide the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) the authority to subpoena testimony from former VA employees who have left federal service, former contractor personnel who performed work for the Department, or other potentially relevant individuals during the course of its inspections, reviews, and investigations. Under current law, VA OIG does not have this essential oversight tool, which can limit VA OIG and Congress’ ability to conduct complete and thorough oversight. Making Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act – Bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand veterans’ access to high-quality breast cancer screenings and lifesaving cancer care. This bill would require VA to develop a strategic plan to improve breast imaging services, create a telemammography pilot program for veterans in areas where VA does not offer in-house mammography, and expand veterans’ access to clinical trials through partnerships with the National Cancer Institute. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to transfer the name of property of the Department of Veterans Affairs designated by law to other property of the Department. – Bipartisan legislation to streamline the transfer of Congressionally-approved VA facility names.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9102,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced $6 billion in disaster relief funding through the Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) new Emergency Relief Program (ERP) for commodity and special crop producers impacted by natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. These relief payments will be distributed to offset crop yield and value losses. This first wave of payments will be calculated based on crop insurance data. USDA plans to send out the first ERP payments to eligible producers in June. For the first round of ERP payments, FSA will send pre-filled forms to producers who have crop insurance or Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) information on file. Producers can find out more about these payments by contacting their local FSA office or clicking here. Tester was the only member of Montana’s delegation to vote for the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act, which included $10 billion in assistance for agricultural producers impacted by wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, winter storms, and other natural disasters in 2020 and 2021. Senator Tester was also instrumental in securing funds specifically designated for ranchers impacted by drought and wildfire through the Emergency Livestock Relief Program. “These relief payments to our producers are long overdue,” Tester said. “It’s good to see USDA rolling out additional funding to support our farmers, who have been hit especially hard by devastating drought and wildfires these last two years, but it’s critical we keep the pressure on USDA to get this assistance out the door and to our producers as soon as possible.” Last week, Tester pressed Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) progress distributing the $10 billion in disaster relief funds to producers. “This is critically life and death money.” Tester said. “Nobody wants to get a check from the federal government, but the bottom line is, the drought has cause hay prices to go through the roof, there has been no grass resource because there has been no water. There have been no crops raised because there’s been no water.” As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, Tester has been a champion for farmers and ranchers across the country. Last June, Tester announced $1 billion in payments from USDA to producers with approved applications for the Quality Loss Adjustment Program (QLA) who suffered losses in 2018 and 2019 and for producers who already received an initial payment through the Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+). Tester was instrumental in ensuring that these programs covered Eastern Montana producers. Earlier that year, Tester pressed the FDA on further delays to QLA payments. The QLA program was created after Tester secured $1.5 billion for farmers facing crop losses due to extreme weather. It was created to supplement relief provided to farmers through WHIP+ and came in direct response to Tester’s letter to former Farm Service Administrator Richard Fordyce excoriating USDA over previous delays in rolling out quality loss payments. In 2019, Tester used the omnibus appropriations bill to expand the WHIP+ program to include quality loss, drought, and excessive moisture and increased its funding by $1.5 billion to cover the new categories. In response to his efforts, USDA issued a disaster declaration for 17 Montana counties."

Montana will receive at least $100 million over a five year period with potential for additional funding after the FCC coverage maps are finalized. “Reliable, affordable access to high speed internet is key to the success of Montana’s students and small businesses in the 21st century,” said Tester. “For years rural America has lagged behind the rest of the nation in digital infrastructure, but my bipartisan infrastructure bill is changing that. Because of my work with five Republicans and four other Democrats, we’re ensuring that Montana’s economy continues to grow, and our next generation of leaders will have the tools they need to succeed for generations to come.” As a part of Tester’s bipartisan IIJA, the Administration announced its Internet for All initiative which will build internet infrastructure, teach digital skills, and provide necessary technology to ensure that everyone in America – including rural communities, communities of color, and older Americans – have the access and skills they need to fully participate in the 21st century economy.

Tester has fought tirelessly to address the supply chain issues occurring across industries. In March, Tester testified in support of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which would increase supply chain transparency by providing the Federal Maritime Commission with greater authority to regulate harmful and discriminatory practices by international shipping companies; requiring carriers to certify that the fees they charge for delays are in compliance with federal regulations; mandating reporting on how many empty containers carriers are transporting; and prohibiting ocean carriers from unreasonably declining U.S. exports that have been stranded at the docks. He also secured $5.1 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) funding for Montana to address school supply chain disruptions and food shortages. Tester has continuously worked to improve the U.S. supply chain and lower costs for Montanans, and was one of five Democrats and five Republicans that crafted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Tester’s law will make urgently needed investments in our nation’s shipping infrastructure, including $17 billion in port and waterway infrastructure.

The conference committee is tasked with reconciling the Senate and House passed versions of the legislation in order to come to a final agreement. Tester is the only member of the Montana delegation who received an appointment to the committee. “We have an incredible opportunity in this conference committee, not to score Republican points or score Democratic points, but to score points for America,” Tester said. “We have an opportunity to create jobs, grow our economy, strengthen our supply chain, jumpstart the domestic semiconductor industry, and secure our nation’s future for our kids and our grandkids. And we can do this if we work for America, not for the parties.” Tester continued: “We need to make the crucial research and development investments necessary to bring back good-paying jobs, and the next generation of jobs, back to America. And this isn’t just to urban America, it’s to rural America too. There’s incredible potential in rural areas all across our country, and if we don’t harness that potential, we’re going to make a huge mistake.” The America COMPETES Act makes key investments that will maintain our country’s competitive edge over China for decades to come by bringing jobs to rural America, investing in the productions of semiconductor chips, strengthening supply chains, and boosting research and development. Once the conference committee completes its work negotiating the final language of the bill, both the Senate and the House will pass the legislation again and send it to the President’s desk. In the coming weeks, Senator Tester will use his position on this conference committee to push for policies that will ensure America stays the world’s leading economic power and increase investments in innovation in rural America. Combatting the rise of China as an economic and military power across the globe is one of Senator Tester’s top priorities as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee and as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense."

The vote failed 49-51. “Women must have the right to make their own health care decisions without interference from their government. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, it will be ripping away a right that women have had for nearly 50 years. That’s why I voted to codify the protections in Roe—because removing those protections will have devastating consequences for women across the country.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9096,"In his continued push to combat consolidation in the meat industry, Senator Tester questioned Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack about how the Administration plans to tackle anti-competitive practices that are putting ranchers out of business and raising prices for consumers. “We all know that rural America is declining and it’s going to continue to decline unless we do some things a little differently,” Tester said. “Four companies control over 80 percent of the marketplace. Capitalism doesn’t work in situations like that and we want capitalism to work. We want there to be competition in the marketplace so that both cow calf operators and consumers can reap the benefits of a good, competitive system.” Tester reinforced that he is not in favor of putting the big packers out of business, but rather creating a fairer cattle-pricing system, so that capitalism can work as it was designed. “I’m not for putting anyone out of business. What I’m for is adding more competition to the marketplace, and the Packers and Stockyards Act was originally set up to do that. We just haven’t had the enforcement capabilities.”  Last month, Tester testified in front of the Senate Agriculture Committee in support of his two bipartisan anti-consolidation bills – the Meat Packing Special Investigator Act and the Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act. Tester’s Meat Packing Special Investigator Act, which is co-led by Republican Senators Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rounds (R-S.D.), would create the “Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters” within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This office will have a team of investigators, with subpoena power, dedicated to preventing and addressing anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries and enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Tester’s Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act, which is co-led by Senators Fischer (R-Neb.), Grassley (R-Iowa), and Wyden (D-Ore.), sets regional mandatory minimum thresholds for negotiated purchases of fed cattle by large meatpackers. It also includes a number of transparency measures, including the creation of a cattle contract library, requirements that packers report carcass weight more quickly and that they report the number of cattle scheduled for slaughter each day for the next 14 days. As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, Tester has long been an advocate for increased market transparency and more competitive practices for Montana producers and consumers. Earlier this year, Tester introduced his Agriculture Right to Repair Act to finally guarantee farmers the right to repair their own equipment and end current restrictions on the repair market. Last year, he introduced his bipartisan American Beef Labeling Act, which would ensure that only beef raised in the United States is labeled as a product of the USA, and his bipartisan New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act, which allows meat and poultry products inspected by Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) approved state Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs to be sold across state lines."

Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is restricted from paying room and board fees at assisted living facilities—a policy that precludes veterans from utilizing this long-term care option. The Senators’ Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act would create a pilot program for eligible veterans to receive assisted living care paid for by VA—allowing aging veterans to live more independently and save taxpayer dollars. The pilot program would be conducted at six Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISNs) nationwide, including at least two program sites located in rural or highly rural areas and two State Veterans Homes. “As Montana’s veteran population ages, we’ve got to make sure these folks have access to a wide-range of long-term care options closer to home,” said Chairman Tester. “Our bipartisan bill will require VA to pay for this care—making sure veterans in rural areas maintain the independence they’ve earned all while keeping more money in taxpayers’ pockets.” “As the number of aging veterans continues to increase, the VA needs to be prepared to efficiently and sustainably care for this community,” said Ranking Member Moran. “Creating a pilot program to develop and assess the effectiveness of assisted living care will help VA proactively prepare for the rapid increase of aging veterans expected over the next two decades.” “We make a promise to our veterans that we’ll take care of them long after their service ends, and that includes making sure the VA provides them with the assisted living care and services they have earned,” said Senator Murray. “This legislation would make a tremendous difference in the lives of so many veterans in Washington state—especially those in rural areas like in Central and Eastern Washington—who have struggled to live independently or find access to veterans homes in the state. We need this bill to ensure we are fully living up to our responsibility in caring for those who have sacrificed so much to defend our country.” The Senators’ bill received strong backing from various Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) and stakeholders nationwide. “With the number of veterans eligible for long-term care expected to increase more than fivefold over the next two decades, the VA needs to be prepared to care for these veterans and ensure they can live their lives as independently as possible,” said Disabled American Veterans National Legislative Director Joy Ilem. “One way to accomplish this is by providing those veterans whose conditions do not rise to the level of requiring nursing home care with other long-term care options. The Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act would create a pilot program for veterans to receive assisted living care paid for by VA and would allow more veterans to continue living with respect and dignity. DAV is pleased to give our support, and we thank Senator Tester for introducing this important legislation.” “Senator Tester’s Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act would authorize VA to support assisted living programs for aging and disabled veterans, many of whom would otherwise require more expensive nursing home care,” said National Association of State Veterans Homes (NASVH) President Heyward Hilliard. “NASVH strongly supports this groundbreaking legislation to expand veterans’ long term care options, including at State Veterans Homes, and applauds Senator Tester for his continued leadership and commitment to America’s heroes.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on the need for more medical care and services especially for older Americans and Veterans. Senators Tester, Moran, and Murray’s bill, Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act provides a proactive and innovative approach for VA to look at other alternatives to address the growing population of aging veterans,” said Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) President and CEO Lt. Gen. Dana T. Atkins, USAF (Ret). “We look forward to working the senators and Congress to get this legislation passed into law this year.” “On behalf of IAVA, I express my appreciation to Sens. Tester, Moran, and Murray for taking steps to address this looming challenge,” said Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) Executive Vice President Tom Porter. “By expanding veterans’ long term care options as the legislation provides, we allow more independence while creating cost savings for the VA—something we should all be able to support.” “The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applaud Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), Jerry Moran (R-Kans.), and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) for their proposal to address the critical issue of long term care for rural veterans,” said National Rural Health Association Chief Executive Officer Alan Morgan. “The Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act will help veterans living in rural areas access essential support through assisted living facilities, providing an important alternative to nursing home care.” “The veteran population is aging and needs increased access to a variety of long-term care options,” said Paralyzed Veterans of America’s Associate Executive Director for Government Relations Heather Ansley. “Currently, VA can refer veterans to assisted living facilities but cannot directly pay for that care. The Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act would test the benefit of having VA pay for this care. It would help veterans and VA alike by giving greater access to assisted living and reducing costs for long-term care, allowing more veterans to receive needed assistance.” “AARP, on behalf of our 38 million members and all older Americans nationwide, is pleased to endorse the Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act,” said American Association of Retired People (AARP) Senior Vice President for Government Affairs Bob Sweeney. “We applaud your bipartisan efforts to give veterans more options for how and where they can get the long-term care they need.” Text of the Expanding Veterans’ Options for Long Term Care Act can be found HERE."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9092,"In his continued push for wildfire preparedness, U.S. Senator Jon Tester and a bipartisan group of colleagues today urged the Biden Administration to establish a special pay rate for federal wildland firefighters in order to combat staffing shortages as fire season approaches. “Years of low pay and other issues have hollowed out the federal wildland firefighting workforce.” wrote Tester in a letter to the heads of the Department of Agriculture, Interior, and Office of Personnel Management (OPM). “This is an urgent threat to natural resources, public safety, and taxpayer dollars, as the Federal Government pays a premium to contract and borrow firefighting resources from state and local authorities when federal resources are unavailable…We must stop attrition and commit to rebuilding the ranks of our firefighting service. This starts with increases in pay and benefits.  The situation is urgent, and we stand ready to work with you to ensure our federal wildland firefighters are fully supported and compensated.” Tester has led the effort to support firefighters and provide relief for communities affected by wildfires in Montana. Last month, Tester secured $19.3 million for wildfire mitigation in Kootenai National Forest through his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Tester negotiated the IIJA and helped pass it into law last year, and he was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to support the bipartisan legislation. IIJA required OPM, in conjunction with land management agencies, to create a wildland firefighter class within 180 days, included $600 million for wildland firefighter pay salaries, with a requirement to increase the base pay for wildland firefighters a minimum of $20,000, and to seek to convert 1,000 firefighters to year-long positions, along with $100 million for workforce training, including fire crews. Last year, wildfires burned nearly 940,000 acres across Montana, making it the worst wildfire season the state had seen since 2017. National Guard troops were deployed to help combat what was declared a wildfire emergency. This year, Montana is expected to suffer from another severe wildfire season. Tester, who is Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Service Caucus, is a longtime champion for federal, state, and local firefighters. Last year, he introduced his bipartisan First Responders Fair RETIRE Act to help federal firefighters, first responders, and others with dangerous jobs receive their full retirement benefits. He is also a cosponsor of the Federal Firefighter Flexibility and Fairness Act, which would make it easier for federal fire fighters to swap shifts without risking pay, and he recently supported the Federal Fire Fighters Fairness Act to create a presumption that heart disease, certain cancers, and other diseases contracted by federal firefighters are job-related in order to help them get the health or disability benefits they deserve. Tester cosponsored the Firefighter and EMS Employer-Employee Cooperation Act to ensure Montana’s state and local firefighters maintain the right to engage in collective bargaining. He continues to push for increased funding for Assistance to Firefighters (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants to ensure that fire department across the state have the resources and staffing they need to keep our communities safe.

I’ve been fighting to defend Montana from attempts to cripple Amtrak service in rural America, and I have been proud to lead the fight to return full, daily service to our state, which will grow our economy along our Northern Tier.”

 Today’s announcement reverses system-wide service reductions imposed in January due to COVID-driven workforce shortages.Tester has been Montana’s leading champion to restore full, daily service to the Empire Builder. Tester’s bill reinstating furloughed Amtrak employees and rolling back previous service reductions to the Empire Builder route was signed into law as part of the American Rescue Plan in March 2021. Tester was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to vote for the bill. Tester personally secured a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the cuts in 2020, inviting Havre’s Paul Tuss, Executive Director of Bear Paw Development Corporation, to testify about how crucial long-distance rail is to rural and frontier economies in Montana and across the country."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9089,"After a bipartisan effort, U.S. Senator Jon Tester announced today that he has successfully pushed the Biden Administration to lower prescription drug costs for Montana seniors by closing a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) loophole that allowed Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to retroactively charge excessive fees. This will benefit patients by lowering out-of-pocket costs and help rural pharmacies stay in business by increasing predictability and transparency. “Folks across Montana have seen the price of prescription drugs skyrocket over the past several decades, and bureaucrats in Washington have failed to take action,” said Tester. “Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have been preying on our pharmacies and Medicare patients for years, but after working with this Administration and my colleagues across the aisle, we’ve finally succeeded in holding PBMs accountable. With the support of Montana’s patients and providers alike, this new rule will put a stop to predatory practices in the pharmaceutical industry and save billions of dollars in out of pocket costs.” Under Medicare Part D, pharmacy middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) required additional payments from pharmacies after the drug is sold to the patient that changes the final cost of the drug. These are called DIR fees. In recent years, these middlemen have increasingly returned to pharmacies days or even months after the final sale to demand more in DIR fees. From 2010 to 2020, CMS documented a 107,400 percent increase in DIR fees paid by pharmacies. Following Tester’s bipartisan push, starting in the fall of 2021, CMS announced last week they would be finalizing a rule to stop all retroactive direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees. CMS’ finalized rule would improve price transparency and competition in the Medicare Part D program, thereby reducing out-of-pocket costs for Montanans. The rule would require Part D plans and their PBMs to apply all discounts they receive at the point of sale so that those paying for drugs at the pharmacy counter can benefit from those discounts. This policy is estimated to reduce prescription drug costs for Part D beneficiaries by $21.3 billion over the next 10 years. Tester pushed hard for CMS to take administrative action after introducing bipartisan legislation last year to combat the high cost of prescription drug prices and the predatory practices of PBM). Tester’s legislation, the Pharmacy DIR Reform to Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act, would ensure that all DIR fees are made clear at the point of sale, eliminating the retroactive nature of DIR clawback fees."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9084,"Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-Ark.) are teaming up to introduce bipartisan legislation to bolster the recruitment and retention of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) workforce. The VA Workforce Improvement, Support, and Expansion (WISE) Act of 2022 would provide increased pay and benefits for VA’s workforce, expand opportunities in rural VA facilities, support training for current and future VA clinicians, and provide additional oversight of VA Human Resource operations and their use of hiring authorities. This legislation will also better prepare VA to respond to current and future toxic exposure claims. “VA employees are the backbone of the Department, so it’s critically important that we’re doing everything we can to get more qualified folks to fill these positions,” said Chairman Tester. “Ensuring competitive pay and benefits for these hard-working men and women should be a no-brainer, which is why we’re introducing this commonsense bill that’ll open more doors to employment in rural areas like Montana—doing right by those committed to serving those who’ve served us.” “The VA’s persistent staffing shortages and retention challenges have the potential to impact the care of our veterans,” said Senator Boozman. “We must ensure there is always an adequate level of dedicated medical professionals capable of meeting the needs of our former servicemembers, no matter where they live. Our legislation creates a pipeline for the VA health workforce by incentivizing physicians and nurses to pursue and continue careers helping veterans. This is a reasonable solution to ensure we have the proper resources to fulfill the promise we made to the men and women who answered the call to serve in our nation’s uniform.” Among its many provisions the Senators’ VA WISE Act of 2022 will:Numerous Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) nationwide have applauded the Senators’ legislative efforts to increase support for VA’s workforce and fill critical Department positions nationwide. “We applaud the provisions that will strengthen HR, increase pay, improve hiring authorities and offer flexibility which will provide VA with the tools to recruit and retain its valuable workforce,” said Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs’ (NOVA) President TJ Wilcox-Olson. “The pandemic has shown us all that a strong healthcare workforce must be a priority—as nurses who take care of veterans, we believe an investment in VA’s workforce is critical to continue to meet its mission of offering timely access to world class care for all veterans.” “Filling its available positions with the right people has been an ongoing challenge for the Department of Veterans Affairs,” said Paralyzed Veterans of America’s Associate Executive Director for Government Relations. “The VA Workforce Improvement, Support, and Expansion (WISE) Act of 2022 gives VA the ability to ensure that it has the staff to meet veterans’ health care needs.” Earlier this week, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee held a hearing on ways VA can better recruit and retain key Department personnel amid a tightening labor market, where Chairman Tester announced his intent to introduce the VA WISE Act alongside Senator Boozman to help tackle chronic labor shortages across the country.

The funds will go toward water infrastructure and power projects on the Fort Peck and Flathead Indian Reservations. Tester negotiated the IIJA and helped pass it into law last year, and he was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to support the bipartisan legislation. “Water and power are the lifeblood of Montana’s economy,” said Tester. “It’s critical that we maintain top-notch irrigation systems and power plants on Tribal lands, where these projects boost agricultural production and help spur job growth in Indian Country.” A breakdown of the projects is below: Fort Peck Irrigation Project, Fort Peck Indian Reservation – $1.25 million Mission Valley Power, Flathead Indian Reservation – $1 millionTester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate his bipartisan package with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families. Tester secured significant wins for Montana in the legislation, including $2.82 billion for Montana’s roads, highways and bridges; $2.5 billion to complete all authorized Indian water rights settlements; $42.45 billion for broadband deployment to low-connectivity areas across the country; and $3.37 billion to reduce wildfire risk nationwide, among others.

Tester also worked to ensure that all iron, steel, and construction materials used for these projects must be made in America. "
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9081,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester this week grilled Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about the Department’s plans to better retain Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, secure the Northern border, and restore U.S.-Canada points of entry to pre-pandemic operating times. Tester criticized DHS’s plan to reassign CBP agents from the Northern border to the Southern border, and called for the Department to immediately increase staffing, while focusing on agent retention. “The point to be made here is there is some urgency,” said Tester. “There has been urgency for fifteen years—maybe longer—to get people to the border that are trained, qualified, and able to do the job.” Tester highlighted the potentially harmful impact that transferring Northern border agents to the Southern border may have on Northern border security. “When we’re pulling folks off the Northern border and putting them on the Southern border you know as well as I do that the bad guys know where the weakest link in the chain is and that’s where they’re going to go,” Tester continued, “The focus is on the Southern border—rightfully so—but the truth is that the Northern border could become a problem too if, in fact, these surges aren’t operated correctly.” Tester concluded by calling for DHS to fully reopen ports on the Northern border to pre-pandemic operating hours, citing the detrimental impact reduced hours have had on commerce in Montana. “Our ports in Montana are still operating at reduced hours. We’ve got supply chain issues in this country,” Tester said. “Reduced port hours and the mandate on vaccines have created a problem, and I’m not saying that people weren’t doing these things with the best intentions, but I don’t think we can have it both ways, so I’d like to get those ports opened up.” Last month, Tester wrote a letter to CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus urging him to resume pre-pandemic operations at all ports of entry in Montana. Tester first called for the northern border to fully re-open last May, urging the Biden Administration to work with Canadian officials to swiftly and safely open the border. He followed up with a letter to Secretary Mayorkas pressing the Administration to move forward with the Canadian reopening in a “safe, fair, and efficient manner.” In November 2021, the Biden Administration heeded Tester’s call and reopened the border to vaccinated travelers. Senator Tester is continuing to push for a full reopening of the northern border. He has urged DHS to allow all truck drivers and other essential travel across the northern border. He also opposed efforts to lift Title 42 and increase immigration processing without a comprehensive plan in place to maintain staffing and security along the northern border."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9079,"U.S. Senators Jon Tester and Steve Daines today marked the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls after introducing their resolution designating May 5th earlier this week. The Senators’ resolution raises awareness, honors the Native American women who are missing or murdered, and identifies solutions to end this violent epidemic. “Raising awareness about the MMIW epidemic in Montana and across the country is an important piece of the fight to combat violence against Indigenous women and girls,” said Tester, a member and former Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. “We’ve got to keep working to improve and enforce public safety measures in Native American communities and hold violent offenders accountable. I’ll keep pushing to ensure that our law enforcement officers have the resources they need to target offenders and ensure survivors have access to critical services as they work to get back on their feet.” “While we must continue to shed light on the tragic Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls crisis that is plaguing Montana, our native communities and families, we must also continue working to find solutions,” Daines said. “Let us remember the countless lives lost due to this crisis, including Hanna Harris, who would’ve been 30 years old today.” “On behalf of the MT MIP Task Force and the CSKT MMIP Work Group, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to both Senator Tester and Senator Daines for co-sponsoring a resolution recognizing May 5th as National Day of Awareness for MMIW. It is so important for all of us to continue working together to address this crisis, to support those families who are currently struggling with the loss of a missing loved one and to remember all of those who have been found murdered.” – Ellie Bundy, CSKT Tribal Council Treasurer, Presiding Officer of MT MIP Task Force & CSKT MMIP Work Group Member “The National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) provides a process for public healing and accountability. May 5 was the birthday of Hanna Harris, a 21 year-old Northern Cheyenne woman who disappeared from her home in Lame Deer, Montana in 2013. On this day, we honor Hanna and the countless American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian women and girls who have been murdered or have gone missing, as well as the families and communities who continue to seek justice. The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center (NIWRC) applauds the designation of May 5, 2022 as the National Day of Awareness for MMIWG and we thank Senator Daines and Senator Tester for their efforts to bring attention to this crisis. We call on the world to organize for systemic change at the local, Tribal, state, national, and international levels to put an end to this violence.” – Lucy R. Simpson, Executive Director, National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center (NIWRC) “May 5 is an important day for all of Indian Country and is especially so for the Tribal people of Montana.  I have always taken any opportunity I can to let others that advancements of MMIW/P were initiated in Montana.  This is because of the efforts of the Tribal Nations and the grass roots families and friends of the victims of MMIW/P to educate our lawmakers and the receptiveness of Senators Jon Tester and Steve Daines culminating legislation and changes in policy.”  – Jean BearCrane, Executive Director, Montana Native Women’s Coalition (MNWC) Native American women and girls in Montana face a murder rate that is 10 times higher than the national average.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9078,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today secured a commitment from U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Chief Randy Moore that the USFS would begin funding treatment efforts in the Basin Creek Watershed near Butte later this year during a hearing on the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior. “I want to talk to you a little bit about the Butte Basin Creek Watershed,” said Tester. “…What this area is, is the water supply for—some would argue—the greatest city in America: Butte, America. Because of climate change and beetle kill, there’s a ton of dead trees that are in this drainage that supplies this city with water, okay?…What I want from you today as the [Chief] of the Forest Service—I talked to the Chief Executive of Butte-Silverbow last week, and he said, ‘We need somebody out here from the Forest Service who can look at this, so I can explain to them what needs to be done so we can get this cleaned up.’” Tester continued, “This is going to be cleaning up a watershed that’s really, really important for this region. And if I could get somebody who is of consequence [to go out to Butte], somebody that you trust who could actually make a difference, I would be very grateful for that. That would be something that would be good.” “I know a little bit about that project, and in fact, it’s one of the projects that we’re going to be funding this year, and so you should be seeing some activity taking place this year on that particular project,” responded Chief Moore. “Well, and just so you know, and I know you know this, I had a debate in Butte in 2006 and this issue was brought up,” Tester concluded. “This is 15 years old and we need to really get on it. We do.” The Basin Creek Watershed provides drinking water to about 60 percent of Butte’s population, and while the USFS has repeatedly proposed treatment projects in the watersheds over the last two decades, it has not followed through. Butte has installed a $30 million water treatment plant to address nutrient-loading from beetle-killed trees in the watershed, but the ash and sediment in the wake of a largescale fire would easily outpace the plant’s treatment capacity. Ensuring the Forest Service completes work on the Basin Creek Watershed project has been one of Senator Tester’s top priorities for more than a decade. Last November, Tester wrote the USFS and highlighted the need for restoration work in the area. The Forest Service responded, indicating that they planned to treat about 700 acres in the watershed this summer, and that they were still in talks with Butte-Silver Bow about the need for a larger, more holistic project. Tester’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included $500 million for hazardous fuels reductions in National Forests, and $180 million for the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Program to reduce wildfire risk in municipal watersheds like Basin Creek. Forest Service has also announced its intent to use IIJA funding for hazardous treatment work on 10 other landscapes nationwide, including the Kootenai. Tester recently announced the USFS planned to treat 7200 acres over the next five years."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9076,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester, Chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, this week questioned Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III and General Mike Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, regarding the Administration’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget request for the Department of Defense (DoD). In particular, Chairman Tester emphasized the importance of continuing the DoD’s strategic focus on ensuring America maintains its position of global military leadership in the face of the rising threat of China, and ensure that the military is held accountable to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly on what servicemen and women need to succeed on the battlefield. “I am first and foremost interested in hearing how this budget builds on previously enacted appropriations to ensure America’s continued military advantage in light of near-peer competition from China,” said Chairman Tester. “Let’s be clear, China continues to be the pacing threat.  They’re watching us closely, waiting to see if we can actually walk and chew gum at the same time.  Whether it is Chinese nuclear force expansion, development of space capabilities, or cyber activities, they are working hard to catch up to us.” He continued, “We cannot afford to waste time or money to ensure that we are getting our troops what they need do to their jobs, at the right time and at the right cost.” The Department of Defense’s FY23 budget request of $733 billion is a continuation of last year’s innovation budget focused on building capabilities to deter China as the “pacing threat”, investing heavily in research and development for new military capabilities, retiring older, less capable weapons that are expensive to maintain, and increasing investments in climate resilience and industrial capabilities. Additionally, On Thursday, April 28th, the Administration submitted a $33 billion supplemental appropriations request for critical assistance to Ukraine. In addition to questioning Secretary Austin about China’s continued place as the United States’ number one strategic competitor, Chairman Tester asked General Milley about the budget’s significant investments in research and development of weapons and programs for future battlefield needs, and when those weapons and programs will be ready for operation. He also asked Secretary Austin about the effectiveness of recently passed supplemental funding for military assistance for Ukraine and how the DoD is making sure the weapons that are provided are making it into the right hands: “I want to talk about something that’s already been visited, that’s accountability, there’s been $3.7 billion spent on a supplemental so far, that’s a lot of money,” Chairman Tester said. “And there’s another $16.4 billion projected to go out. You had said with earlier questions that you’re reasonably confident that the weaponry is getting to the Ukranians…the question is that, are we making sure that: number one, none of these weapons are falling into the wrong hands, is there any way to even do that? And number two, are we making sure that the taxpayer dollars that are being spent are actually making a difference? And I’m talking a significant difference.” “I think they are making a significant difference, Chairman, just look at the battlefield today versus what we are looking at a couple of weeks ago,” said Secretary Austin. “In terms of accountability, we have to depend on the Ukrainians at this point to do the right thing, and make sure they are prudent and careful about how they issue these weapons out and account for these weapons. Again, I engaged the very senior leadership in the country on this issue, and they assured me that this is something that’s important and that they’ll continue to focus on.” Chairman Tester took the gavel of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 2021. Last year, Chairman Tester secured critical funding and priorities in the fiscal year 2022 Department of Defense Appropriations legislation to ensure America’s national security, provide essential resources to our troops, and invest in the readiness and capabilities of critical military installations like Malmstrom Air Force Base. In response to Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, Chairman Tester also secured billions in military and humanitarian resources for American allies in Europe. The Subcommittee on Defense is responsible for providing nearly $800 billion annually to the Department of Defense and related agencies. This is more than 95 percent of the military’s yearly budget, and includes matters ranging from pay and benefits for millions of service members and civilians to the development of advanced technologies and next-generation weapons. The Subcommittee also oversees funding for nearly all major U.S. intelligence agencies."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9074,"Chairman Jon Tester led a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing yesterday on ways the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can better recruit and retain key VA personnel, including health care providers, amid the tightening labor market. At the top of his questioning, Tester pressed Gina Grosso, Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration/Operations, Security and Preparedness, on recent claims of sending VA employees to the border in response to the Biden Administration’s decision to let Title 42 expire in May. “I’d like you give you the opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings about the use of VA employees at the border,” Tester said to Grosso. “Have you or any VA representatives had conversations or plan to have conversations with the Department of Homeland Security to deploy VA personnel at the border to address issues resulting from the repeal of Title 42?” “No, we have not been in any direct discussions with [the Department of Homeland Security] on sending our employees to the border,” replied Grosso. At the hearing, Tester announced his intent to introduce bipartisan legislation this week, the VA Workforce Improvement, Support, and Expansion (WISE) Act, to provide increased pay and benefits for VA’s workforce, expand opportunities in rural VA facilities, support training for current and future VA clinicians and provide additional oversight of VA Human Resource operations and use of hiring authorities. These provisions will help address chronic VA workforce shortages across the country, particularly in states like Montana, and better prepare VA to respond to the anticipated increase in claims following passage of the Honoring out Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT) Act. The Senator also questioned Network Director of VISN 19 Ralph Gigliotti, who oversees Montana VA’s health care system, on hiring wait times: “To hire a nurse, how long does it take in VISN 19 on average?” “Right now, we’re at about 88 days across the VISN,” replied Gigliotti. “The problem with that is for us, the competition in the community is less than that. So we’re very dependent on that nurse wanting to come work for VA because of the mission. We’ve done everything we can and we continue to do, to make sure the pay is equitable and that the work environment is equitable. But that speed of hire is an issue for us.” A staunch advocate of securing the border and instituting a bipartisan fix to our broken immigration system, Tester introduced bipartisan legislation last month that would postpone lifting Title 42 until the federal emergency declarations are lifted and require the DHS to submit a plan to Congress. He also sent a letter urging DHS to present Congress with a comprehensive plan to address the strain on our immigration system, including maintaining northern border staffing and security, before Title 42 expires this month. Tester’s Q&A is available HERE."

The new, 11,072 square foot clinic is nearly four times the size of the facility it is replacing, and will offer a range of services including primary care, mental health, a dedicated women’s health room, and telehealth to more than 1,700 Montana veterans in the surrounding area. A champion for improving southwest Montana veterans’ access to quality care and services, the Southwest Montana Veterans Home opened its doors in Butte last year following a decades-long push from Tester. Tester fought for years to secure the funding for the home, and worked with local stakeholders and the federal government to secure the necessary resources to get the project off the ground and completed. Tester has led the way in expanding veterans’ access to care in Montana—securing resources to build new and modernized facilities across the state. Through years of focused work with multiple Administrations of both parties, and working across the aisle in Washington and with communities across Montana, Tester’s efforts have resulted in new facilities opening in several areas including Fort Harrison in Helena, Missoula, Miles City, Bozeman, Great Falls, Billings, Havre, Cut Bank, and Butte. Additional VA projects Tester has fought for are underway in other parts of the state."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9066,"As a part of his ongoing efforts to strengthen and secure the United States’ northern and southern borders, U.S. Senator Jon Tester this week cosponsored two bipartisan bills to increase the recruitment and retention of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Tester’s Securing America’s Ports of Entry Act will require CBP to hire additional agents to meet staffing needs, and his Border Patrol Pay Security Act will increase overtime pay for Border Patrol agents. “Strong and secure borders are the foundation of our national security,” said Tester. “In order to keep our communities safe, it’s critical that CBP is fully staffed, has the necessary resources, and is able to retain top-notch border patrol agents. This legislation will hit all three marks by requiring the agency to increase staff levels while improving safety conditions, and ensuring that their agents are paid fairly for their often dangerous work keeping us safe.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently reports a significant shortage of CBP officers across the country. While the size of the staffing shortage has decreased in the last year, DHS has reported an increase in both trade and immigration during that same time. Over the last few years, CBP has relied on temporarily reassigning hundreds of agents to the southern border to address migrant surges. CBP maintains that these reassignments have not negatively affected the security of the northern border, however Senator Tester has heard firsthand from agents how the frequency of the reassignments is negatively affecting staffing levels and morale along the northern border. Tester’s Securing America’s Ports of Entry Act:Tester’s Border Patrol Pay Security Act would allow Border Patrol agents to be paid time and a half for hours worked between 80 and 100 hours during 14 consecutive days. The legislation would ensure that Border Patrol agents earn similar overtime compensation as other federal law enforcement agencies. Both the Securing America’s Ports of Entry Act and the Border Patrol Pay Security Act are supported by the National Border Patrol Council. A longtime champion for secure borders, Tester recently introduced his bipartisan Public Health and Border Security Act, which would require the federal national emergency declarations for COVID-19 to be lifted before Title 42 could be terminated, and pushed CBP to fully reopen the ports of entry in Montana to pre-pandemic hours and ensure adequate staffing along the northern border. Additionally, he secured $3.85 billion for U.S. land ports of entry to modernize and secure the northern and southern borders through his bipartisan infrastructure law."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9063,"Concluding a week of whirlwind activity building bipartisan momentum to tackle agriculture consolidation, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today took to the Senate floor to make the case to his colleagues for immediate congressional action to defend farmers, ranchers, and consumers from rigged prices as a result of anti-competitive behavior by corporate agriculture companies. Tester urged his Senate colleagues to immediately bring his bipartisan Meat Packing Special Investigator Act and Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act up for a vote. “The question is why did we lose 345,000 farms in the last 30 years, many of them generational farms?” said Tester. “It’s because folks can’t make the numbers work anymore. And the main culprit is consolidation in the corporate ag world. No competition means you don’t get fair prices.” “…I can guarantee you one thing for sure: If you look at where we have been and predict where we are going, if we do nothing [to combat consolidation in corporate agriculture], there will be very, very, very few people living in rural America,” Tester continued. “Family farm agriculture will be dead in this country. And if we lose family farm agriculture, this country will change for the worse in a major way.” Tester’s Meat Packing Special Investigator Act, which is co-led by Republican Senators Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rounds (R-S.D.), would create the “Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters” within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This office will have a team of investigators, with subpoena power, dedicated to preventing and addressing anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries and enforcing our nation’s antitrust laws. Tester’s Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act, which is co-led by Senators Fischer (R-Neb.), Grassley (R-Iowa), and Wyden (D-Ore.), sets regional mandatory minimum thresholds for negotiated purchases of fed cattle by large meatpackers. It also includes a number of transparency measures, including the creation of a cattle contract library, requirements that packers report carcass weight more quickly and that they report the number of cattle scheduled for slaughter each day for the next 14 days. “So I’m going to tell you what: folks serve in this body because they want to do right by the next generation,” Tester concluded. “They want to make sure our kids and our grandkids have the same opportunity that we had. They want to make sure this country remains the greatest country on earth…I hope you put your feet in the shoes of those people involved in agriculture, and I hope you put your feet in the shoes of the consumer. Because if we do these bills, we will be putting the country back on the right track for food security in the longterm.” As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, Tester has long been an advocate for increased market transparency and more competitive practices for Montana producers and consumers. Earlier this year, Tester introduced his Agriculture Right to Repair Act to finally guarantee farmers the right to repair their own equipment and end current restrictions on the repair market. Last year, he introduced his bipartisan American Beef Labeling Act, which would ensure that only beef raised in the United States is labeled as a product of the USA, and his bipartisan New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act, which allows meat and poultry products inspected by Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) approved state Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs to be sold across state lines."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9059,"As a part of his continued fight to defend family farmers and ranchers from rigged prices as a result of anti-competitive behavior by corporate agriculture conglomerates, U.S. Senator Jon Tester today testified in support of two of his bipartisan bills to tackle consolidation in agriculture: the Meat Packing Special Investigator Act and Cattle Price Discovery and Transparency Act. “Ag production has gotten far more consolidated than when I took over the farm 44 years ago in 1978,” Tester said. “And it’s not one party’s responsibility, the fact is that both parties’ have watched this happen and we’ve done nothing. Today, we have an opportunity to do something. Why? Because we’ve seen a mass exodus off the land. Rural America is drying up. On the other side of the equation we see consumers are being treated unfairly in the marketplace, because there’s no competition. Today we can address both of those issues with these bills.” Tester’s Meat Packing Special Investigator Act, which is co-led by Republican Senators Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rounds (R-S.D.), would create the “Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters” within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

It also includes a number of transparency measures, including the creation of a cattle contract library, requirements that packers report carcass weight more quickly and that they report the number of cattle scheduled for slaughter each day for the next 14 days. “Today’s market place is more consolidated today than it was in 1921 when this body passed the Packers and Stockyards Act. Rural America is drying up because we can’t get fair prices at the farm gate,” Tester continued. “Capitalism isn’t working in this particular instance because of concentration and consolidation in the industry. Consumers are paying higher prices because without competition, they’re set without regard to what people can afford. We need some sunlight and we need some sideboards…I can guarantee you one thing: if we walk out of here today and we don’t pass these bills, we will see the same result that we’ve seen for the last 100 years. And in the end our food security is put at risk.” He concluded: “Please do the right thing for the sake of folks like me who want to pass the farm on to the kids.” As the only working farmer in the U.S. Senate, Tester has long been an advocate for increased market transparency and more competitive practices for Montana producers and consumers.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9058,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced that the state of Montana will receive $330,000 for six irrigation projects as part of his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The funds will go toward modernizing and improving the climate resiliency of existing water infrastructure across the state. Tester negotiated the IIJA and helped pass it into law last year, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to support the bipartisan legislation. “Water infrastructure is the backbone of Montana’s ag industry” said Tester. “Modernizing our irrigation systems is a critical step forward for our farmers and ranchers, who rely on water infrastructure to produce the first-rate food that feeds the world. I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to secure funding for these critical projects, which will support our rural economies while preserving the land we all rely on for generations to come.” A list of the projects is below: Fort Peck Tribes – Wolf Point Irrigation Project IIJA Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) funding will be used to implement ag-water management methods to build towards climate resiliency. Funds are needed to modernize the Wolf Point Irrigation Project water delivery system. Helena Valley Irrigation District IIJA WFPO funding will be used to implement ag-water management methods to build towards climate resiliency. Funds are needed to modernize the Helena Valley Irrigation District water delivery system. Missoula Conservation District IIJA WFPO funding will be used to implement ag-water management methods to build towards climate resiliency. Funds are needed to modernize the Missoula Conservation District Irrigation District water delivery system. Tongue & Yellowstone River Irrigation District IIJA WFPO funding will be used to implement ag-water management methods to build towards climate resiliency. Funds are needed to modernize the Tongue & Yellowstone River Irrigation District delivery system. Wyota Irrigation Project IIJA WFPO funding will be used to implement ag-water management methods to build towards climate resiliency. Funds are needed to modernize the Wyota Irrigation Project water delivery system. Kinsey Irrigation District IIJA WFPO funds will be used to perform a feasibility study on a proposed watershed project that would rehabilitate and modernize the Kinsey Irrigation District water delivery system located in the Lower Yellowstone River watershed. Last month, Tester announced $85 million for the St. Mary’s Diversion and Headworks as a part of up to $100 million he secured for the Milk River Project through the IIJA. Tester worked across the aisle for months to negotiate his bipartisan package with a group of five Republicans, four Democrats, and the White House, and he was the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation to vote for it. Tester’s law is projected to create more than 800,000 American jobs and lower costs for businesses by making targeted investments that will strengthen our nation without raising taxes on working families. Tester secured significant wins for Montana in the legislation, including $2.82 billion for Montana’s roads, highways and bridges; $2.5 billion to complete all authorized Indian water rights settlements; $42.45 billion for broadband deployment to low-connectivity areas across the country; and $3.37 billion to reduce wildfire risk nationwide, among others. Tester also worked to ensure that all iron, steel, and construction materials used for these projects must be made in America."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9055,"As a part of his continued effort to lower prescription drug costs for Montana seniors and support community pharmacies, this month U.S. Senator Jon Tester led a bipartisan group of Senators in urging the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to swiftly review the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) proposed rule to lower out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors by bringing so-called pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees under control. “Finalizing CMS’ DIR fee reform proposal will help save Medicare Part D beneficiaries more than $20 billion in prescription drug costs, while also providing increased transparency and predictability for pharmacies and the communities they serve,” wrote the Senators. “We urge you to move forward with review of this rule so that these important reforms can be implemented as quickly as possible.” Under Medicare Part D, pharmacy middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) require additional payments from pharmacies after the drug is sold to the patient that changes the final cost of the drug. These are called DIR fees. In recent years, these middlemen have increasingly returned to pharmacies days or even months after the final sale to demand more in DIR fees. From 2010 to 2020, CMS documented a 107,400 percent increase in DIR fees paid by pharmacies. Earlier this month, Tester led a bipartisan effort along with 29 Senators in requesting that the CMS finalize its proposed rule to stop all retroactive direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees. CMS’ proposed rule would improve price transparency and competition in the Medicare Part D program, thereby reducing out-of-pocket costs for Montanans. The rule would require Part D plans and their PBMs to apply all discounts they receive at the point of sale so that those paying for drugs at the pharmacy counter can benefit from those discounts. This policy is estimated to reduce prescription drug costs for Part D beneficiaries by $21.3 billion over the next 10 years. Tester pushed hard for CMS to take administrative action after introducing bipartisan legislation last year to combat the high cost of prescription drug prices and the predatory practices of PBM). Tester’s legislation, the Pharmacy DIR Reform to Reduce Senior Drug Costs Act, would ensure that all DIR fees are made clear at the point of sale, eliminating the retroactive nature of DIR clawback fees.

https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9052,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.) today announced he secured $19.3 million from his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for wildfire mitigation on 7,200 acres in and around the Kootenai National Forest during Fiscal Years 2022-2024, including forest thinning, prescribed burns, and planting on U.S. Forest Service (USFS) land and state lands where there are agreements in place between the state and county. Tester negotiated the IIJA and helped pass it into law last year, and he was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to support the bipartisan legislation. “Wildfires pose a serious risk to Montana’s forests and the rural communities that surround them, and we’ve got to do everything we can to combat and mitigate wildfire damage across the state—particularly as our fire seasons have grown longer and more dangerous,” said Tester. “That’s why I worked to ensure the bipartisan infrastructure law gives the Forest Service the tools they need to protect our land and communities, and why I’ll hold them accountable to use it effectively as quickly as possible. Our communities whose homes and drinking water are at risk can’t afford to wait.” Senator Tester has worked tirelessly over the years to secure wildfire prevention funding for Montana. In 2017, Tester announced $576 million in funding for Montana wildfire relief and forest management through the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Relief Funding Act. Additionally, Tester pushed Chief Randy Moore in November to address high fuel and risk areas using new resources and authorities to protect communities by empowering frontline staff in the agency. The Kootenai Project will work to treat hazardous fuels across 150,000 acres deemed “high risk” surrounding Libby, Troy, Eureka, Stryker, Fortine, and Trego. The initial treatments are expected to be completed between 2029 and 2032, with 900 acres being treated by the end of FY22. In addition to protecting Lincoln County from the threat of wildfires, this project works alongside a countywide effort to increase infrastructure capacity for timber, which would expand employment opportunities for residents. The Kootenai Project would also contribute to ongoing conservation efforts in the area, improving wildlife habitat, forest health, and water quality."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9050,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.) today announced more than $1.5 million to support Montana fish passage projects funded through his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). This Fiscal Year 2022 funding will go toward improving connectivity for native Montana fish in Ravalli, Deer Lodge, Powell, Lewis and Clark, and Beaverhead Counties. Tester negotiated the IIJA and helped pass it into law last year, and he was the only member of Montana’s Congressional delegation to support the bipartisan legislation. “Clean water and wildlife conservation are two key tenants to preserving the public lands that help power our recreation economy and are at the heart of our state’s natural beauty,” Tester said. “I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues in both parties to ensure that our infrastructure bill secured funding for this critical program that will support our native fish and ensure Montana’s future economic growth.” A breakdown of the projects is below:A longtime champion for fish and wildlife preservation, Tester last September helped secure $1.3 million to help Montana, Fish, Wildlife, & Parks (FWP) acquire over 100 acres of land along the north shore of Flathead Lake for a new state park, and an additional $472,500 to help FWP clean up and renovate Westside Park in Missoula. He was also a strong supporter of President Biden’s nominee for Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Montana’s own Martha Williams, and pushed for her swift confirmation in February, citing the importance of balanced oversight and masterful management of the nation’s fish and wildlife recovery. Since 1999, the National Fish Passage Program has worked with over 2,000 local communities, Tribes, and landowners, providing financial, engineering and planning assistance in order to reopen access to 57,736 miles of upstream habitat and 193,783 acres of wetland habitat for fish and other animals. Smart investments to improve developments help restore fish while ensuring Montanans can continue making a living on the same footprint. The IIJA includes $200 million over five years for this program, and will allocate nearly $38 million for 40 fish passage projects."
https://www.tester.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=9049,"U.S. Senator Jon Tester today announced that the state of Montana will receive $127 million for the second round of competitive water and sewer grants he secured in the American Rescue Plan Act. The state’s ARPA Infrastructure Advisory Commission approved $118.2 million for 95 water and sewer projects and $8.8 million for 34 irrigation projects. Tester helped negotiate the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which provided this funding, and he was the only Montana statewide elected official that supported the legislation. Thanks to the ARPA, Montana’s unemployment rate is currently at the lowest rate in state history. A full list of projects can be found HERE. “For Montana communities to have economic certainty and job growth, water infrastructure has to keep pace,” said Tester. “I’m proud to have secured these investments through the American Rescue Plan to upgrade and rebuild water and sewer systems across the state that have been outdated and unreliable for far too long. Now that the state has determined the funding for these projects, I’ll be working to ensure that money gets to the folks on the ground without delay.” Projects were approved by the state’s ARPA Infrastructure Advisory Commission for a total of $127 million in ARPA funding specified for water and sewer infrastructure, which is a part of the $910 million Coronavirus State Fiscal Relief Fund Tester secured for the state of Montana to respond to the economic effects of the pandemic. In 2020, Tester held hundreds of meetings with Montana’s workers, small business owners, frontline health care workers, educators, Tribes, and local officials to solicit input about what Montanans need to make it through the pandemic. Tester used that input to help craft the American Rescue Plan, which provided $20 billion to get folks vaccinated and back to work, $382 million to get Montana schools reopened, legislation to restore long-distance service to the Empire Builder Amtrak route, and billions for small businesses, rural hospitals and the Department of Veterans Affairs."

Many veterans and their caregivers rely on the support this Program provides and must be able to plan for the future.” In the letter, the Senators highlighted various areas of the Caregivers Program in need of review and reform by VA. This includes improving the application and appeals processes, reforming the invasive assessment process, ensuring a warm hand-off to other VA services and support for those veterans and caregivers denied or deemed ineligible, and providing an easier pathway to advocacy for Veterans Service Organizations and other representatives assisting veterans in navigating the Program. They continued, “Finally, we urge the Administration to be transparent and clear on next steps as it begins needed reform of the Program. Some veterans and caregivers have now received conflicting information from VA—a notice of potential removal from the Program and now news of a pause on that removal. We recommend you work to mitigate any confusion affected individuals may have given the importance of this Program in their lives and offer mental health services to veterans and caregivers who are in limbo and may be dealing with greater stress than usual.” At a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing last month, the Senators pressed Department officials on a number of changes to the Caregivers Program, including immediately halting the discharge of legacy participants and starting a new process to revise eligibility requirements to ensure the Program is meeting the intent of Congress. The Committee also heard moving testimony from caregivers about their personal struggles with the Program. Read the Senators’ full letter HERE."
