https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-hassan-pappas-announce-54-million-in-lead-based-paint-and-other-home-health-hazard-reduction-grants-heading-to-manchester-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, along with U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representative Chris Pappas (NH-01) applauded an announcement by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that the agency is awarding a $5.4 million grant to the City of Manchester to help protect families with small children from the dangers of lead-based paint exposure. This funding consists of $4.7 million through the Lead Hazard Reduction Grant program intended to maximize the number of children under the age of six protected from lead poisoning by identifying and controlling lead-based paint hazards in eligible privately-owned rental or owner-occupied housing, plus an additional $700,000 in Healthy Homes Supplemental funding to help identify and address other housing hazards that affect occupant health such as mold, allergens, carbon monoxide and radon in homes where lead remediation is also required. Lead is highly toxic and can cause a variety of severe health problems in children, ranging from impaired brain development and hearing, higher risk of coma and even death. According to the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services, 42,057, or 50 percent of Granite State children, reside in housing units built before the 1978 ban on lead in residential paint, which increases their risk of exposure. “Lead poisoning is an entirely preventable tragedy that dramatically impacts a child’s health and ability to learn,” said Senator Shaheen. “This funding will help families in Manchester protect their children from lead poisoning and exposure to other hazardous contaminants in their homes. Particularly in many of our neighborhoods with older housing stock, it is critical to identify and remediate housing units with potential lead-based paint to ensure our kids can grow up healthy.” “Granite Staters and their families deserve a safe and healthy place to call home. However, in many older homes, lead-based paint can be a serious threat to the health and well-being of children,” said Senator Hassan. “The federal funds headed to Manchester will help identify homes at risk for lead exposure and other health hazards, helping build on our promise of a healthier, stronger New Hampshire.” “The health of our children is of the utmost importance, and we must be vigilant in our efforts to protect them from lead and other hazardous materials,” said Representative Pappas. “These funds will identify lead-based paint hazards so that they can be properly remediated and ensure that children in Manchester grow up healthy and safe. Moving forward I will continue to fight for funding to remediate lead and similar health hazards to protect children and families at risk of exposure.” “New Hampshire, and Manchester specifically, have a relatively old housing stock and lead paint hazards pose a risk to families with young children,” said Joyce Craig, Mayor of Manchester, NH. “This $5.3M for lead abatement will have a significant impact on increasing the health of our community and making homes safer and more livable for generations to come.” As a Senior Member of the Appropriations Committee, Shaheen helps lead an annual letter to fellow  appropriators requesting funding for the Office of Lead Control and Healthy Homes at HUD, which administers the Lead Hazard Reduction and Healthy Homes grant programs, as well as funding for the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ### "

The Senators, who are Co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, applauded the Senate’s recent overwhelming vote in support of Finland and Sweden’s accession into NATO, which will further strengthen NATO and its collective response to Putin’s aggression. Shaheen also discussed the need to ensure Ukraine’s continued success in Putin’s war, noting that his ambitions threaten the sovereignty of other nations. Working with our allies and partners will remain a critical priority and enhance the transatlantic alliance’s strategic deterrence, ensure peace in the Indo-Pacific and bolster new collaboration on security and democracy initiatives in responding to the emerging threats of the 21st century.    “Americans understand the importance of our support for Ukraine – the Ukrainian people are not only defending their land and freedom; they are fighting for the preservation of liberal democracies around the world,” said Shaheen. “What is happening in Ukraine matters not only to the Ukrainian people; it matters to Eastern Europe; it matters to the U.S. and it matters to the world. Putin is violating international norms to fulfill a delusional fantasy of re-building a Russian empire – his focus today is Ukraine, but we all know his gaze goes much farther. NATO and the United States must keep all options on the table to remind Putin that we are committed to do all we can to help Ukraine win.”  Watch the full discussion here. Senator Shaheen and Senator Tillis co-led a bipartisan delegation in June to the NATO Summit in Madrid, in addition to stops in Sweden and Finland to affirm strong bipartisan Senate support for their NATO membership aspirations. Also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence. Last month, Shaheen released a statement ahead of the anniversary of Ukraine’s independence and the six-month mark of Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine. In July, Senator Shaheen and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced legislation that would require an interagency strategy toward the Black Sea region, which includes Ukraine. In March, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation Shaheen cosponsored that would ensure the U.S. undertakes coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed by Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Shaheen and Portman led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration. Before the Shaheen-Portman congressional delegation visit to Ukraine in January, Shaheen led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, last June. ### "

The Promoting Readiness for Overseas Contingencies and Unexpected Responses to Exigencies (PROCURE) Act would establish a Critical Munitions Acquisition Fund (CMAF) to allow the Secretary of Defense to better manage industry production lines and sustain particular munitions lines that are critical to U.S. national security interests. Additionally, the authorities granted in the CMAF would help the Department of Defense better anticipate industry’s supply chain needs and improve the Department’s purchasing power, driving down costs for the government. “As Putin continues his unprovoked war in Ukraine, and China increases its coercive measures towards Taiwan, ensuring that the U.S. can capably support our democratic allies while maintaining our own military stockpiles in a crisis is essential,” said Shaheen. “As we have seen in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has played an invaluable role in providing our Ukrainian friends with significant amounts of munitions to defend themselves – most of which has come from U.S. stocks. The PROCURE Act would ensure the U.S. is prepared to help our allies and partners in times of crisis without undermining our own military readiness. It would provide a more effective way to organize our allies’ procurement of the munitions required to defend against the threats they face.” “While Putin’s illegal invasion resulted in a swift and robust response from the United States and our NATO allies to arm the Ukrainian military, it exposed the fact that we have major inadequacies with our current munition stocks,” said Senator Tillis. “Our bipartisan PROCURE Act is essential to improving America’s capacity to quickly arm our allies in potential future conflicts without drawing from our own munitions stock, which will greatly enhance our national security and military readiness.” The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Cornyn (R-TX), Senator Blumenthal (D-CT), Senator Wicker (R-MS), Senator R. Scott (R-FL), Senator Kaine (D-VA), Senator Fischer (R-NE), Senator Duckworth (D-IL) and Senator Klobuchar (D-MN).  The Senators also plan to file the bill as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act in the coming days. A member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence. With Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), Shaheen introduced the Securing American Acquisitions, Readiness, and Military Stockpiles Act, which would give the Department of Defense enhanced procurement authorities to quickly refill American defense stockpiles after the President provides aid to an ally or partner attacked by a foreign adversary, including replenishing America’s stockpiles after lethal aid was sent to Ukraine for defense against Russia. This legislation followed a previous bill by Senators Shaheen and Cornyn, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, to establish a military lend-lease program to enhance security assistance to Ukraine. That bill was signed into law by President Biden on May 9, 2022.Earlier this year, Shaheen and Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration.

This means that the manufacturing company goes through the entire development and manufacturing cycle before having to go back and reopen the technology to implement the needed export modifications. This approach not only means that delivery of exportable versions is often delayed but also drives a higher cost for the U.S. government and international buyers as the manufacturer must retroactively reengineer systems. Shaheen’s Defense EXPORTS Act would address these issues. “As the United States and its allies and partners face numerous security challenges around the world, it’s crucial for our defense industry to have the capacity and capabilities to meet the demand. We want the most innovative, cutting-edge technology to confront these threats and we must ensure that we can deliver those capabilities to our allies swiftly. That’s precisely what this legislation seeks to do,” said Shaheen. “By financing exportability and interoperability mechanisms at the front end of hardware development, we can expedite their development and production timelines and provide more opportunities for smaller companies to develop exportable variants of their technologies.” “Defense manufacturers face a number of challenges when trying to deliver weapon systems to our allies and partners in a timely fashion. This bill would shorten that timeframe by better incorporating exportability features into the design and development process of weapons systems. At a time of heightened instability, our allies and partners deserve better access to the cutting-edge technologies they need for their national defense,” said Fischer. The Defense EXPORTS Act would finance exportability and interoperability features during the development of the hardware, thereby lowering cost, accelerating the ability of that hardware to be sold to allies and partners and providing smaller programs with more accessible paths to receiving the necessary protections for export - traditionally something that is typically only assured for major programs developed by large companies.  Specifically, the Defense EXPORTS addresses these issues by: Bill text of the legislation is available here. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) are original cosponsors of the legislation. Senator Shaheen is a leader in the U.S. Senate to bolster the domestic stockpile and to address the urgent need amid Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine to address needs from the defense industry to supply U.S. and partners around the world with the military aid and technology needed to deter and defend aggression from adversaries. Earlier this month, Shaheen and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) led the introduction of the Securing American Acquisitions, Readiness, and Military Stockpiles Act, which would give the DoD enhanced procurement authorities to quickly refill American defense stockpiles after the President provides aid to an ally or partner attacked by a foreign adversary, including replenishing America’s stockpiles after lethal aid was sent to Ukraine for defense against Russia.

In it, Shaheen details systemic issues with the program and proposes policy changes to better serve Afghan allies who stood by U.S. personnel and aided the U.S. mission over the course of the twenty-year war. Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate on the Afghan SIV program for nearly a decade, initially partnering with the late Senator John McCain (R-AZ). “I’m issuing this special report to detail why the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program matters and how we can better support our Afghan partners. It’s important to detail how we got to where we are today so we can fulfill the initial commitment we made to Afghans who stood beside us on the frontlines for twenty years,” said Shaheen. “The historic evacuation of Americans and our Afghan allies amid the chaos and devastation as Kabul fell to Taliban forces last year seized the nation and the world. The images are seared into our memories: the crowded airport, people clinging to planes as they took off and U.S. service members heroically working around the clock to get people out. Throughout the course of the twenty-year war, brave Afghan men and women risked their lives and the safety of their families to assist the U.S.-led mission and stand with U.S. personnel on the battlefield. The Afghan SIV program was an important mechanism to repay these courageous individuals, but it has not lived up to the promise we made to participants when it was established over a decade ago. I worked with Senator McCain on this for years and have continued those efforts in his stead. We’ve made important strides to improve the program, but as my special report details, we have much further to go. Democrats and Republicans agree on the need to reform the program, but we need concrete steps on precisely how to do that. That is what this report addresses. I hope lawmakers will review the findings from this report, and I welcome their support and assistance to implement these changes so we can keep our collective promise to our Afghan allies.” Shaheen announced the special report this afternoon in an interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, which can be viewed in full here. Read Standing Up for Our Afghan Allies: The History, Challenges and Future of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Program in full here. Senator Shaheen historically partnered with Senator John McCain (R-AZ) on efforts to protect Afghans who’ve risked their lives to support U.S. diplomatic efforts abroad by strengthening the Afghan SIV program. She has led bipartisan efforts in Congress to reauthorize additional Afghan SIVs. In addition, Senator Shaheen supported legislation to establish a nonpartisan, independent commission to examine every aspect of the war in Afghanistan, including the political and strategic decisions that transformed a focused military mission into a vast, nation-building campaign that became the longest war in U.S. history.### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-durbin-portman-and-graham-meet-with-ukrainian-prosecutor-general,"The Senators received an update on reports of war crimes committed by Russians(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, joined a group of Senators for a meeting with Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin to receive an update on Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, and specifically on reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russians. The meeting was hosted by Senate Majority Whip and Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus Dick Durbin (D-IL) and included Rob Portman (R-OH), Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC).“There can be no equivocation: Vladimir Putin’s intentional shelling of schools, train stations, maternity hospitals and other heinous attacks targeting civilians must be met with the fiercest condemnation and action from the global community,” said Shaheen. “His war is to not only build a Russian empire, but to erase Ukrainian history, culture and identity. In our meeting today, I made clear to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin that the U.S. stands firmly by Ukraine, not only as they defend their sovereign rights, but to fully investigate and hold accountable those culpable in crimes against humanity.”“Perpetrators committing unspeakable war crimes, such as those unfolding before our very eyes in Ukraine, must be held to account,” said Durbin. “Today’s meeting was deeply upsetting when discussing the atrocities committed by Vladimir Putin, but as I mentioned to Prosecutor General Kostin, we remain steadfast in our commitment to Ukraine and the brave Ukrainian people. In Congress, we will keep pushing to pass critical legislation to ensure Putin pays the price. The world cannot tolerate this barbarity.”“The United States stands with Ukraine and its efforts to hold Russia accountable for its heinous war crimes against the Ukrainian people. I enjoyed speaking with Prosecutor General Kostin today about ways that the United States can aid Ukraine in its efforts to investigate and prosecute cases of war crimes conducted by Russian soldiers in Ukraine,” said Portman. “I strongly encourage my colleagues to approve more funding for Ukraine. This will help Ukrainian prosecutors investigate more war crimes cases and secure justice for innocent victims, and it will help Ukrainian soldiers liberate their fellow citizens from future Russian atrocities.”“We had a great meeting with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General,” said Graham. “In a bipartisan fashion, we reinforced our commitment to the Prosecutor General to provide resources and help document war crimes committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people. Accountability in this war is the best way to deter future conflicts. We stand firmly for justice in Ukraine.”Also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence.

Russia’s unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine puts its freedom in danger and poses a threat to democracies around the world. China’s gross human rights abuses against the Uyghur people and escalating aggression against Taiwan also underscore the urgent need to prioritize policy and partnerships to counter Xi Jingping’s increasing hostility in the Pacific. President Biden’s resolve to confront these challenges, and his purposeful decision to deliver that message to both Russia and China with their U.N. delegates present, reaffirms the U.S. commitment to hold bad actors to account, wherever they may be. I appreciate that President Biden has placed importance on our alliances in addressing our shared security challenges – our partnerships will be critical in pushing back the assault on democracy. As a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, I stand ready to help him deliver on those priorities,” said Shaheen.She continued, “In addition, we have other significant issues that must be addressed on a global scale: the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan amid the Taliban’s all-out assault on women and girls’ rights demands our attention and response. The global food security crisis, created by Putin, has also underscored the critical convening responsibility of the United Nations to secure the basic rights and needs of the world’s most vulnerable populations. The United Nations can and should play a role to help address these concerns. The security and humanitarian challenges we face today are great, but the strength of our partnerships and alliances are greater.” As a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Shaheen led a bipartisan delegation to the United Nations in April 2022 to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the ongoing assault on the rights of Afghan women and girls. As co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, which Shaheen re-started with Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) in 2018, Shaheen recently led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the NATO Summit in Spain, in addition to stops in Finland and Sweden in support of their NATO membership aspirations. Shaheen and Tillis also led a bipartisan coalition of 80 lawmakers in a joint statement of support and a letter to President Biden, calling for Finland and Sweden’s swift accession into NATO. The Senate overwhelmingly approved Finland and Sweden’s accession protocols in August, which were soon after signed into law. Shaheen is also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus and leads action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies. Shaheen led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Western Balkans in April to reaffirm U.S. support for democracy, security and economic prosperity in a region vulnerable to Russian influence. Legislation co-led by Shaheen to speed up military assistance to Ukraine and Eastern European nations was signed into law. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-announces-725000-for-substance-use-disorder-treatment-and-prevention-in-jaffrey-and-dover,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior appropriator on the Labor-Health and Human Services (L-HHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today with U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and U.S. Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) $725,000 in federal funds for Reality Check, Inc. in Jaffrey and the City of Dover for substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Specifically, Reality Check, Inc. in Jaffrey was awarded $300,000 to expand recovery services and mobilize resources to improve long-term recovery outcomes, educate people on addiction and reduce stigma. The City of Dover was awarded $425,000 through two awards: $375,000 for New Hampshire’s Partnership for Success Grant and $50,000 for NH’s Dover Coalition for Youth STOP Grant Act. Both awards prioritize substance misuse prevention. “New Hampshire has been on the frontlines of the substance use disorder epidemic for years, so our response to finally turn the tide must be comprehensive and consistent. These federal awards tackle both ends of the crisis – prevention and treatment – to address the full scope of the epidemic,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who specifically authored a letter of support for Jaffrey’s award. “These resources will play an important role in Jaffrey and Dover to reduce stigma, invest in education and prevention and support long-term recovery efforts. Helping those affected and keeping the next generation safe from succumbing to this public health emergency will continue to be my top concerns in the Senate.”“Tackling the opioid epidemic requires an all-hands-on-deck approach. We need to look at this crisis from all angles, from increasing mental health resources to supporting law enforcement to reducing stigma,” said Senator Maggie Hassan. “New Hampshire has dedicated professionals committed to stemming the tide of this crisis, and this federal funding will go a long way to helping provide support and resources to New Hampshire communities who are on the frontlines of this fight. I’ll continue to push for more funding so that individuals and families can have the care and support that they need as we keep combating the substance misuse epidemic.”“This federal investment in the health and well-being of Granite Staters will help expand access to treatment for those who are struggling, reduce the stigma around addiction, and bolster prevention efforts,” said Representative Annie Kuster, a founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force. “Addressing the evolving substance use disorder crisis requires a comprehensive approach, and these funds will go a long way to prevent addiction and support Granite Staters in recovery. I’m glad that these funds are headed to communities in our state, and I’ll continue working to ensure those who are struggling have the resources they need to recover and thrive.”“The addiction epidemic requires diligent and constant action from all levels of government. These funds will support coalitions that work to prevent substance abuse, promote healthy choices for our youth, help those suffering from addiction, and develop evidence-based strategies to address gaps in substance misuse prevention,” said Representative Chris Pappas. “These needed resources will support the wellbeing of our communities, and I will always keep fighting in Congress to address this epidemic.”On Monday, the New Hampshire congressional delegation announced more than $28.5 million in State Opioid Response Grant funding. Shaheen and Hassan have led efforts in Congress to combat the substance use disorder epidemic, both through Shaheen’s leadership on the L-HHS Appropriations subcommittee and Hassan’s position on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Over the last five years, New Hampshire has received more than $140 million from SOR grants that Shaheen and Hassan have secured to combat the opioid epidemic in the state, with the hardest-hit state set-aside responsible for the majority of those funds. The FY2022 funding bill that Shaheen helped write continues to provide flexibility provisions that she authored to allow for SOR grant dollars to be used to support treatment and recovery for cocaine and methamphetamine use, in addition to opioid use. Shaheen and Hassan led efforts this year to prevent a steep cliff in SOR funding, securing a commitment to protect New Hampshire funding from Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra. Shaheen and Hassan's efforts have led to a more than tenfold increase in federal treatment and prevention funding for New Hampshire. Last week, Shaheen reintroduced her legislation with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) that would improve the SOR program by providing additional investments in flexibility for states and local communities. "

Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate to extend the SBIR & STTR programs for nearly a decade.(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a three-year reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The Senate’s action today came on the heels of Shaheen’s push last week to similarly extend authorization of the federal programs, which were due to expire at the end of September. These programs assist small businesses in engaging in the research and development that helps keep the United States competitive, and many of the partnerships created through the SBIR and STRR programs involve the Department of Defense (DoD), leading innovations important to U.S. national security.“This is a major win for American companies and U.S. innovation. From NASA to the Department of Defense, New Hampshire invests millions of dollars from SBIR and STTR grant funding every year, boosting research and development opportunities at our companies and academic institutions throughout the state. These federal programs help ensure New Hampshire has a level playing field to stay at the forefront of innovation. I commend Chairman Cardin for his hard work on this initiative, and I’m glad to see the Senate get this done. The House should swiftly follow suit,” said Shaheen. “This bill extends the program for another three years, but to avoid these looming deadlines and unnecessary uncertainty for companies that rely on access to the SBIR and STTR programs – it’s time to reauthorize the programs permanently.”As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations and Armed Services Committees, Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of the SBIR and STTR programs. She has long called for a permanent reauthorization of the programs, and in 2016 successfully helped secure a five-year extension of the programs in the fiscal year (FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that was signed into law. In 2019, Shaheen led bipartisan legislation that would make permanent and strengthen the SBIR and STTR programs. Shaheen has supported and announced numerous SBIR and STTR awards for companies throughout New Hampshire. "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-rounds-lead-bipartisan-letter-pushing-for-increased-action-from-pentagon-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations,"(Washington, DC)— U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Rounds (R-SD), senior members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led a bipartisan letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House officials, urging increased funding for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) testing and remediation, and to improve PFAS-related planning to make use of the higher funding levels Congress is willing to appropriate to address the pervasive issue.  The Senators wrote, in part, “As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products.” The Senators went on to detail the findings of a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The Senators then continued to detail the robust amount of federal dollars provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure. They closed their letter by urging the administration to put greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants. The Senators wrote, “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.” Their letter can be read in full here. In addition to Shaheen and Rounds, the letter is signed by thirty-eight lawmakers, including U.S. Senators Hassan (D-NH), Braun (R-IN), King (I-ME), Brown (D-OH), Blumenthal (D-CT), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), Baldwin (D-WI), Peters (D-MI), Lujan (D-NM), Gillibrand (D-NY), Durbin (D-IL), Kaine (D-VA), Bennet (D-CO), Sinema (D-AZ), Murray (D-WA), Feinstein (D-CA), Booker (D-NJ), Warnock (D-GA), Padilla (D-CA), Casey (D-PA), Rosen (D-NV), Duckworth (D-IL), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Heinrich (D-NM), Kelly (D-AZ), Cantwell (D-WA), Cardin (D-MD), Ossoff (D-GA), Stabenow (D-MI), Schatz (D-HI), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sanders (I-VT), Leahy (D-VT), Manchin (D-WV), Wyden (D-OR), Merkley (D-OR) and Markey (D-MA).  Senator Shaheen leads efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. In the fiscal year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, Senator Shaheen was successful in including numerous PFAS provisions, including the authorization of an additional $20 million to continue the PFAS health impact study that she created in the 2018 NDAA. Because of her efforts, Pease is serving as a model site for the nationwide study. In addition, Senator Shaheen added an amendment requesting the Department of Defense to prohibit DoD from purchasing PFAS-laden firefighting turnout gear after October 1, 2026. This follows Shaheen-led efforts to expand blood testing and treatment for firefighters exposed to PFAS and a similar amendment she secured to ban the use of PFAS-laden firefighting foam in the FY 2020 NDAA. Senator Shaheen also included an amendment to clarify in statute that the National Guard can access Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) funds for PFAS cleanup at state-owned Guard facilities, which will save the Guard millions in funds they have previously been forced to divert from training and operations. Finally, Senator Shaheen successfully led on enhanced transparency by ensuring the Department of the Air Force is sharing PFAS test results with impacted communities. Just last week, Shaheen visited Pease International Tradeport – the former Air Force Base – with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Region 1, Dr. David Cash, to discuss the Biden administration’s progress toward recognizing two of the most prevalent PFAS chemicals – PFOA and PFOS – as hazardous chemicals under the law.  ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-announces-pivotal-sor-funding-for-nh-to-tackle-substance-use-disorder-crisis,"** Annual Opioid Response Funding Level for NH is Nearly $400K Higher than Last Year Thanks to Shaheen and Hassan's Efforts Amid Threats of Funding Cliffs** **Federal Funding Comes on the heels of Shaheen Reintroducing Key Legislation to Improve the Program to Provide Additional Investments and Flexibilities for Communities**(Washington, DC) — U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior appropriator on the Labor-Health and Human Services (L-HHS) Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today with U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and U.S. Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) that $28,507,046 in State Opioid Response (SOR) grants are now being made available to the State of New Hampshire, which Shaheen and Hassan fought to secure in the government funding legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2022 that was signed into law. The SOR program is pivotal in providing communities and states with the federal resources necessary to combat the substance use disorder epidemic. Shaheen and Hassan successfully pushed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to maintain SOR funding levels for New Hampshire and avoid significant cliffs in funding year-over-year.   “Especially after our successful efforts in Congress to bring flexibility to the SOR program to better adapt to the crisis as it evolved in our communities, these funds are instrumental to addressing the full scope of this epidemic,” said Senator Shaheen. “As the Appropriations Committee works to finalize government funding legislation for the next fiscal year, I’ll do everything I can to ensure the SOR program gets the attention and resources it needs to continue making these investments in New Hampshire so we can put people on the path to long-term recovery.” “The opioid epidemic is devastating Granite State communities, which is why I fought to ensure that New Hampshire continues to get significant federal resources to increase prevention, treatment, and recovery services,” said Senator Hassan. “I have heard countless heartbreaking stories from Granite Staters, including from parents who have lost two children to opioid overdoses – and I have also heard from Granite Staters in recovery about the difference that treatment and peer-to-peer support has made. We need to continue an all-hands-on deck approach to combating the opioid epidemic, and I will stay laser focused on getting New Hampshire communities and law enforcement the tools that they need to combat this crisis.” “State Opioid Response (SOR) grants provide crucial federal funding to address the evolving addiction crisis in our communities, and I’m thrilled to announce this substantial investment in the well-being of our state” said Representative Kuster, a founder and co-chair if the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force. “As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I helped to secure sustained funding for the SOR program, and I advocated for increased flexibility so that these grants extend to treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine dependency, in addition to opioids. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support prevention efforts and ensure that Granite Staters have access to the treatment and recovery services they need.” “The addiction crisis is deeply personal for New Hampshire families, and we must continue to build and invest in a multi-pronged approach,” said Representative Chris Pappas. “This grant from the Department of Health & Human Services will help those suffering from addiction and ensure they get the support they need. I remain committed to working across the aisle with my colleagues, public safety officials, and health experts to find solutions to combat this epidemic.” Shaheen and Hassan have led efforts in Congress to combat the substance use disorder epidemic, both through Shaheen’s leadership on the L-HHS Appropriations subcommittee and Hassan’s position on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Over the last five years, New Hampshire has received more than $140 million from SOR grants that Shaheen and Hassan have secured to combat the opioid epidemic in the state, with the hardest-hit state set-aside responsible for the majority of those funds. The FY2022 funding bill that Shaheen helped write continues to provide flexibility provisions that she authored to allow for SOR grant dollars to be used to support treatment and recovery for cocaine and methamphetamine use, in addition to opioid use. Shaheen and Hassan led efforts this year to prevent a steep cliff in SOR funding, securing a commitment to protect New Hampshire funding from Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra. Shaheen and Hassan's efforts have led to a more than tenfold increase in federal treatment and prevention funding for New Hampshire. Last week, Shaheen reintroduced her legislation with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) that would improve the SOR program by providing additional investments in flexibility for states and local communities. ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-smith-introduce-legislation-to-protect-thousands-of-low-income-families-in-rural-areas-from-losing-their-homes,"(Washington, DC)— U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Tina Smith (D-MN) introduced legislation in the Senate last week to ensure that thousands of low-income tenants in rural areas are able to maintain access to safe and affordable housing. The Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act of 2022 would protect access to affordable housing for families that are largely elderly, disabled and live in rural areas, who are at risk of losing rental assistance through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Housing Service (RHS).  “Affordable housing is one of the biggest issues impacting New Hampshire families, especially as we work to recover from the pandemic, which exacerbated a pre-existing, serious concern,” said Senator Shaheen. “This legislation targets our most vulnerable populations affected by housing insecurity or those who are at risk for experiencing it by enhancing the USDA’s ability to provide rental assistance. This is a commonsense bill that would make a real difference for rural Granite State communities in need.” “Without access to housing, nothing else in your life works. Not your job, your health, your education or your family,” said Senator Smith. “As Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development, I have worked with stakeholders to expand access to affordable housing, but we also need to make sure that people who already have a place they call home can keep it that way. And that’s what this bill does. Our measure would help families and elderly Minnesotans stay in their homes.” Specifically, the bill will provide the RHS tools to maintain rental assistance for residents in prepaid or maturing properties, who are at risk of losing their homes, by restructuring existing Section 515 loans and extending incentives for property owners to stay in the program. In the event a loan restructuring is not possible, the bill further protects residents by allowing rental assistance to be decoupled from the underlying loan but remain in place at the property, or by allowing the resident to transfer their rental assistance to another eligible property. Finally, the bill requires USDA to establish a plan for preserving affordable rental housing in rural areas, in consultation with an advisory committee composed of a variety of interested stakeholders, including tenants. Representative Cindy Axne (IA-03) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. “National Housing Law Project is grateful to Senators Shaheen and Smith for their continued leadership on pressing rural housing issues. Their bill, the Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act of 2022, is a necessary tool to preserve affordable rental housing in rural communities. USDA’s housing often provides the only affordable units in a community, and the preservation of its remaining portfolio is essential to the health of rural America. The bill would allow tenants to remain in affordable rural housing even after a USDA mortgage on the property has matured, and would protect the rights of these tenants,” said Shamus Roller, Executive Director of the National Housing Law Project. “The Local Initiatives Support Corporation is proud to support the Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act, since we’ve seen firsthand the hardship caused by losing affordable rental housing in rural communities. U.S. Department of Agriculture financed properties are often the only affordable rental housing in small towns and house some of our nation’s most vulnerable residents,”?said Caitlin Cain, Vice President of the Rural Local Initiative Support Corporation.?“The resources provided under this legislation will help preserve this critical housing stock while furthering tenant protections. We applaud Senators Shaheen and Smith for their commitment to Rural America and leadership in affordable housing preservation.” “We applaud the introduction of this important rural housing legislation.?We see this bill as an important first step in implementing procedures that will lead to the preservation of the existing multifamily rural portfolio. It will demonstrate Congress’s continued commitment to a vital source of housing in rural areas throughout the country.? We look forward to working with Senators Shaheen and Smith and their staff to pass this bill and then to also work with the House on similar measures,” said Coleen Fisher, Executive Director, Council for Affordable and Rural Housing. “Many low-income rural families rely on USDA multifamily housing properties to provide affordable rental opportunities in rural places, and preserving those properties is rapidly reaching a crisis point in many communities. We applaud Senators Shaheen and Smith’s leadership on this important legislation to provide USDA with tools to address this crisis,” said David Lipsetz, President & CEO of the Housing Assistance Council. “Since its inception in 1963, the Section 515 program has financed nearly 28,000 rental properties containing over 533,000 affordable apartment units, but fewer than 12,900 properties and approximately 370,000 occupied units remain in the program today. No new construction has been undertaken in a decade. Without action, USDA and the rural families they serve will continue to lose thousands of affordable Section 515 units each year to mortgage maturations. The provisions of this bill would help USDA to address the preservation needs of these critical properties.” Bill text of the legislation is available here."
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-celebrates-nearly-1-million-headed-to-plymouth-state-university-to-bolster-robotics-program-,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, celebrated nearly $1 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce headed to Plymouth State University. The funding comes through a congressional directed spending (CDS) request that Shaheen secured through the fiscal year (FY) 2022 omnibus package that passed earlier this year. The funding will be allocated through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the procurement of equipment and devices to bolster the university's robotics program. These technological improvements will enhance learning and collaboration for students and faculty through industry-standard gear and the creation of teaching and prototype stations. “I'm glad to see this federal funding head to Plymouth State University to bolster their robotics program. As technology evolves, it's important that students engage with cutting-edge equipment through their education, especially as they prepare to enter the workforce and innovate in the economy,” said Senator Shaheen. “As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Chair of the Subcommittee that funds NIST, as well as several other science and research agencies, I’ll continue to advocate for federal funding to invest in advancements in STEM education across the Granite State.” “We are so grateful to Senator Shaheen for her efforts in securing this funding for Plymouth State University,” said PSU President Donald L. Birx, Ph.D. “As the first New Hampshire institution to offer a B.S. robotics degree program, we hope to develop the next generation of robotics engineers and learning-machine manufacturers with a new, state-of-the-art robotics lab. More than that, robotics brings together and develops so many key skills (computers, sensors, networks/communications, kinematics, AI, mechanics, design, electronics) across a wide variety of critical disciplines required for the enormous workforce needs over the next century, that there are few programs like it in terms of broad impact on the state, businesses, and the students involved.  This grant will ensure our students have the most advanced training, equipment and tools at their disposal, providing experiential, project-based learning, a central component of our unique Cluster Learning Model. Access to this cutting-edge technology means access to an emerging job market in New Hampshire’s high-tech sector.” As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen helped secure $69,047,000 for projects across New Hampshire through the CDS process in FY22 legislation that was signed into law. Shaheen recently announced more than $89 million in CDS awards that she secured in Senate Democrats’ FY23 government funding proposal for 95 New Hampshire projects, including water infrastructure, health care facility investments, educational training, resources to combat homelessness and food insecurity, support for substance use disorder programs and much more. ### "

PFAS chemicals have been linked to adverse health effects and were found at elevated levels in drinking water sources at the former Air Force Base. The EPA’s new proposal would trigger increased reporting and remediation efforts to protect public health and encourage better waste management.During their visit, Shaheen and Cash visited the Airfield Interim Mitigation System (AIMS) at Pease, where they received a tour of the pump and treatment system that is installed around Haven Well to remove water from the aquifer, treat it and reinject it into the aquifer. Shaheen and Cash were joined by local officials and advocates, including Portsmouth Mayor Deaglan McEachern, Portsmouth City Manager Karen Conard, Testing for Pease co-founder Andrea Amico and other local stakeholders. “I’m glad Administrator Cash is in Portsmouth to not only see the mitigation efforts to cleanup these dangerous chemicals, but to also speak with our local officials and advocates who’ve worked hard for many years to make this a priority in our communities. Too many parents have had sleepless nights wondering about the adverse health effects on their kids from drinking water out of the tap, and have fought tooth and nail to get some accountability, transparency and most importantly – action to address PFAS. I’m glad the Biden administration is making this a real priority, and especially heartened by their proposal to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the law, which would trigger meaningful action to get these substances out of our communities,” said Shaheen. “I look forward to working with Administrator Cash and the Biden administration to advance efforts to that end.” “Under President Biden, EPA has been making good on our commitment to focus on PFAS chemicals and take meaningful action to protect public health and our shared environment from ‘forever’ chemicals. Just last week, EPA proposed to designate two of the most widely used PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – as ‘hazardous substances’ under the Superfund law that governs how we clean up contamination in our communities. This rulemaking would increase transparency around releases of these harmful chemicals and help to hold polluters accountable for cleaning up their contamination. EPA is accepting comments on this proposal, and we are eager to hear from all interested groups and individuals so we can ensure that any final rule is both fair and effective. Protecting people’s health is always EPA’s top priority,” said U.S. Environmental Protection Agency New England Regional Administrator David W. Cash. ""The EPA’s recent proposal to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances is a strong step toward holding polluters accountable for decades of contamination. For far too long, communities across the nation have been exposed to a mixture of PFAS due to no fault of their own and with limited options to hold polluters accountable. Communities have suffered in so many ways from ongoing PFAS exposure and often bear the tremendous costs associated with PFAS contamination. We need continued leadership and bold action to address PFAS as a class by stopping the exposure, making the polluters pay, and helping the people harmed by PFAS exposure,” said Andrea Amico, Co-Founder of Testing for Pease. “I applaud the EPA's efforts in designating PFOA and PFOS as a hazardous substance. And I am grateful for Senator Shaheen's unwavering leadership in Congress to help communities in New Hampshire and all across the nation address widespread PFAS contamination."" Senator Shaheen leads efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. Shaheen has fought to secure consistent federal support for the PFAS health impact study that she established four years ago. Because of her efforts, Pease is serving as a model site for the nationwide study. As a lead negotiator of water provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure law, Shaheen secured record-level funding to upgrade drinking water and wastewater infrastructure and address PFAS contamination, including $72 million in grants to New Hampshire announced by the EPA earlier today. Last week, Shaheen sent a letter asking for updates on the implementation of recommendations outlined in the recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) on PFAS chemicals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Shaheen has long worked to get clinicians guidance on testing and protocols, including introducing the?Physician Education for PFAS Health Impacts Act, bipartisan legislation that would establish a grant program within the Department of Health and Human Services to fund the creation of training materials for physicians on the health effects of PFAS and best practices for caring for patients who have been exposed to PFAS. Key provisions of Shaheen’s legislation were included in the fiscal year (FY) 2021 government funding legislation that was signed into law. Shaheen is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.### "

This funding was issued through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) and Clean Water SRF Programs and will be used towards water infrastructure updates and improvements.  The grants mark the first significant distribution of water infrastructure funds following the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Shaheen and Hassan helped negotiate. The law allocates more than $50 billion toward repairing the nation’s essential water infrastructure, in turn helping communities access clean, safe and reliable drinking water, prevent flooding, collect and treat wastewater to protect public health, and safeguard vital waterways. Shaheen specifically led negotiations around water infrastructure provisions with Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT).  Senator Hassan also secured a provision in the legislation to better ensure that New Hampshire towns would be eligible for an advanced technology grant program that could be used to remove PFAS from drinking water. Planned projects in New Hampshire that the law will fund include lead line replacement projects in Hanover and Claremont, as well as PFAS treatment projects in Londonderry and Jaffrey. A host of other projects are slated for funding in the state through this new increase in funding, which will significantly increase the ability of towns and cities to meet their infrastructure needs.  “Granite State families deserve reliable access to safe drinking water and clean rivers, lakes and streams,” said Senator Shaheen, who was the Democratic lead negotiator of water provisions on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. “That’s precisely why I fought to deliver the largest single investment in water ever made by the federal government - from updating crumbling water infrastructure to addressing harmful PFAS contamination. It’s thrilling to see what started a year ago as negotiations on how to make these investments turn into tangible results in our communities, and in this case, a historic $72 million for New Hampshire to improve water infrastructure. This funding, and the continued resources we’re seeing come back to New Hampshire from the bipartisan infrastructure bill, will have a meaningful impact for generations of Granite Staters to come.” “The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is now reaching our states and will soon be invested in important water infrastructure projects across New England,” said EPA Regional Administrator David Cash. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents a once-in-a-lifetime investment in water infrastructure ensuring clean, safe water in communities across the region.”  “Safe drinking water is essential to Granite Staters’ health and our economy, which is why my colleagues and I made unprecedented investments in our water systems when we negotiated the bipartisan infrastructure law,” said Senator Hassan. “It is exciting to see federal funding through our law come to New Hampshire, where communities will put it to use to address PFAS contamination, replace lead lines, modernize drinking water and wastewater systems, and more. Granite Staters have raised concerns for years about water safety, and this funding will go a long way towards providing clean and reliable drinking water for all.” “As I travel throughout the district I consistently hear from our communities about the challenges that aging water infrastructure poses to providing clean reliable drinking water and effective waste water treatment,” said Representative Kuster. “This funding represents a significant investment in the wellbeing of our cities and towns and will contribute to our economic competitiveness. This is critical, particularly for underinvested communities that need support to provide reliable water that its farmers, residents, and local businesses depend on.”  “Modern water infrastructure is critical to the health and strength of our communities. This funding from the EPA will upgrade our drinking water and wastewater systems, meeting the needs of our families and businesses,” said Representative Pappas. “Today’s announcement represents an important advancement for our water infrastructure, and I’ll continue working to ensure New Hampshire communities will reap the benefits.” Senator Shaheen has spearheaded efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. Senator Shaheen has successfully included continued authorization and funding for the PFAS health impact study that she created in the 2018 defense legislation, which includes a pilot study at Pease. In addition to her leadership on the bipartisan infrastructure law and through her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, as a senior member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Shaheen helped secure investments in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure for New Hampshire in fiscal year (FY) 2022 government funding legislation that was signed into law. Congress provided $1.638 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRFs) and $1.126 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund through the fiscal year 2022 government funding bill, including more than $18.6 million to the state to make additional water infrastructure updates. Shaheen built on this progress in Senate Democrats’ FY23 government funding proposal that was announced in July.### "

These programs assist small businesses in engaging in the research and development that helps keep the United States competitive, and many of the partnerships created through the SBIR and STRR programs involve the Department of Defense (DoD), leading innovations important to U.S. national security. Without action from Congress, the SBIR and STTR programs are due to expire at the end of September. “The SBIR and STTR programs give a leg up to local companies that can contribute to our nation and overall global manufacturing competitiveness in a big way. By helping small businesses punch above their weight, they not only level the playing field for companies to showcase their products and thrive, but also ensure the U.S. doesn’t overlook the expertise and precision that our small businesses bring to the table,” said Shaheen. “I’ve seen numerous companies across New Hampshire benefit from the SBIR and STTR programs, from manufacturing materials that are used by NASA to items being procured by the Department of Defense to help protect our troops. These programs are an investment in our local economy, as well as our national defense which is why permanently reauthorizing them is a no brainer. We know these programs work, and rather than continued stop gaps on reauthorization, it is time to make them permanent. This has historically been a bipartisan effort and I hope Republicans will come to the table and work with Democrats to protect and extend these important federal programs.” Also a senior member of the Senate Appropriations and Armed Services Committees, Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of the SBIR and STTR programs. She has long called for a permanent reauthorization of the programs, and in 2016 successfully helped secure a five-year extension of the programs in the fiscal year (FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that was signed into law. In 2019, Shaheen led bipartisan legislation that would make permanent and strengthen the SBIR and STTR programs. Shaheen has supported and announced numerous SBIR and STTR awards for companies throughout New Hampshire. Text of the legislation is available here. ### "

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-helps-introduce-legislation-to-reauthorize-and-improve-womens-business-center-program,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today joined Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in introducing the Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022 — legislation to reauthorize and improve the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Women’s Business Center (WBC) Program. “Women business owners and entrepreneurs are at the heart of ingenuity and economic development across the Granite State. Ensuring women have access to resources, assistance and mentorship is key to leveling the playing field and empowering women to lead,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m proud to help introduce this bill to support Women’s Business Centers, which help position women at the helm of the small business community.” The Women’s Business Center program is a national network of more than 140 centers that offer counseling, training, networking, workshops, technical assistance and mentoring to entrepreneurs. WBCs support entrepreneurs at all stages of the business development process, including assistance with writing a business plan, conducting market research, navigating the federal procurement process and other business management and operations skills. The program played a key role in the SBA’s support of small businesses during the pandemic. WBCs served more than 88,000 clients in 2021, which is a 36 percent increase from the 64,000 clients served in 2019. The Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022 will give the SBA and WBCs the tools necessary to meet the demands of a historic boom in new business formation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans registered 5.4 million new businesses in 2021—the highest total on record and a nearly 2 million increase from 2019 when there were 3.5 million new business applications. The Women’s Business Centers Improvement Act of 2022 will increase federal support to WBCs by doubling the maximum annual grant award to $300,000. The bill also empowers the SBA administrator to provide greater flexibility to smaller, more under-resourced WBCs. Under the bill, the SBA administrator may waive, in whole or in part, the nonfederal match requirement for one year based on an analysis of the economic conditions of the grant recipient, the demonstrated ability of the recipient to raise nonfederal funds, and the past performance of the recipient. The bill also sets the responsibilities of the WBCs and requires the SBA to establish an accreditation program for WBCs. Additionally, the bill clarifies the duties of the SBA’s Office of Women’s Business Ownership and codifies the office’s mission in statute among other provisions. As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and as a former small business owner, Senator Shaheen is a fierce advocate for New Hampshire’s small business community. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shaheen went to bat for small business owners who were among the most severely impacted by the public health crisis. She worked to provide small businesses with the resources they needed to weather and recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19, leading negotiations on provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and expanded the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, both of which were lifelines for businesses throughout New Hampshire and the country. ###  "

In addition, Shaheen specifically underscored the importance of the Office of Global Women’s Issues and urged committee members to support efforts to codify the office.“As we’ve seen in particular since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ensuring our State Department is fully operational with the resources, management and support necessary to engage our partners and allies is paramount. Our national security requires a robust diplomatic corps and the measures included in this legislation are critical to that end,” said Shaheen. “I’m especially encouraged by the support for my provisions that address how relevant agencies can respond to AHI cases so that injured personnel and loved ones have the care they need without delay, as well as my amendment to punish foreign individuals who are culpable in human rights violations against members of the LGBTQI community. Our policies should reflect our values, which is precisely what that provision seeks to do.”Shaheen continued, “In addition to the issues prioritized in this legislation, I raised the urgent need to fill the vacant position at the Office of Global Women’s Issues. Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta is eminently qualified for this role. It is shameful that partisan politics and falsehoods are being used to both smear her reputation and illegitimately hold up her nomination. This role has been vacant for 1,693 of the last 2,065  days – that’s unacceptable. She should be confirmed immediately, and more than that, committee members should support action to codify the Office of Global Women’s Issues to make clear how vital this office and its role are in breaking down gender barriers in the most vulnerable parts of the world. At-risk women and girls should not pay the price so Republicans can score political points.”Shaheen’s AHI amendment would ensure that the appropriate domestic agency can designate domestic AHI incidents to improve interagency coordination in addressing these attacks. Shaheen has long worked to ensure that U.S. public servants and their loved ones suffering from AHIs receive the medical attention they deserve.Shaheen’s most recent work to advance measures that address AHIs was included in the fiscal year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) in June. Shaheen successfully secured $10 million to support the work of the Anomalous Health Incidents Cross Functional Team, as well as a $20 million increase to address the threat characterization and treatment of certain uniformed members, federal civilian employees and their family members affected by AHIs, who’ve faced stigmatization and adverse experiences following their ailments. The FY22 NDAA that was signed into law contained a Shaheen provision based on her standalone legislation to require the President to designate a senior national security official – now filled by Maher Bitar – to organize a whole-of-government response and direct the heads of relevant agencies to designate senior officials to lead their agency’s response to AHIs. The FY2022 law also included a measure Shaheen supported to ensure wounded officers and their families have immediate access to specialized facilities at Walter Reed. Senator Shaheen has been a leader in supporting American public servants who have incurred brain injuries likely from directed energy attacks. Last year, President Biden signed legislation Shaheen helped lead, the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (HAVANA Act), into law. In the FY2021 NDAA that became law, Shaheen successfully included language to expand a provision in law that she previously wrote to provide long-term, emergency care benefits to all U.S. Government employees and their dependents who were mysteriously injured while working in China and Cuba. ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-joins-push-urging-biden-admin-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) joined 29 Senators in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care.  The push from the Senators comes as legislators and prosecutors across the country seek to enforce Republicans’ abortion bans by investigating women and doctors for seeking and providing abortion care.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators. In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urged HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations and ensure patients understand their rights.  “To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.” Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. This confusion fundamentally threatens women’s health, as patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them. In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care. Also joining the letter were Senators Murray (D-WA), Baldwin (D-WI), Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (D-IL), Durbin (D-IL), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Hirono (D-HI), Kaine (D-VA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Luján (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Padilla (D-CA), Reed (D-RI), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Stabenow (D-MI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warner (D-VA), Warren (D-MA) and Wyden (D-OR). The Senators’ full letter is available here.  Senator Shaheen is an unrelenting advocate for women’s reproductive rights. Shaheen has long sounded the alarm about what’s at stake for women’s freedoms and reproductive health in New Hampshire if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Shaheen previously held a press conference with the New Hampshire delegation and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England to discuss what’s at stake for women’s freedoms and reproductive health in New Hampshire if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, and she spoke on the Senate floor to urge lawmakers to vote in favor of legislation that would codify Roe. In March, Shaheen joined Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra in Manchester for a meeting with New Hampshire family planning providers amid continued attacks from State and congressional Republicans. For years, Shaheen has fought to expand coverage of women’s preventative care, including through her legislation to reduce the cost of contraception for servicewomen and dependents in military families. A senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in 2013, Shaheen included an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which expanded access to abortion care for service women to bring the Department of Defense to parity with other Federal agencies. Shaheen also penned an op-ed for the Union Leader underscoring the threats to women’s freedoms and rights if Roe is overturned. It can be read in full here. ### "

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-leads-nh-delegation-in-welcoming-over-600k-to-address-youth-delinquency-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chair of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice (DOJ), announced with U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) that the DOJ awarded $607,526 to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. Funding comes from the Office of Justice Programs’ Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.  The funding will support law enforcement training to address bias and disparities in interactions with people of color, particularly juveniles. The Bias Awareness Training will include input from community-based stakeholders, businesses and mental health and medical professionals to promote the success of young Granite Staters. Additional funding will also go towards early prevention programming in rural communities and research on mental health and delinquency.  “Young Granite Staters in need should have access to the resources necessary to build happy and successful lives. Youth often fall into patterns of delinquency because they don’t have access to the resources and services that are essential for their security and growth. This funding will make a real difference to address racial bias in treatment by law enforcement and ensure community leaders have tools for early prevention and rehabilitation – helping young Granite States stay on a path to success,” said Senator Shaheen. “As Chair of the Senate subcommittee that funds the DOJ, I’ll continue to secure investments that build brighter futures for the next generation of leaders.” “These federal dollars will help strengthen the work that New Hampshire police departments do with young people, including by focusing on mental health support and preventing delinquency in the first place,” said Senator Hassan. “I will continue working to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the tools they need to best serve Granite State communities.” “This federal funding headed to New Hampshire will help ensure local law enforcement is trained and prepared for de-escalation and crisis intervention in difficult or complex situations,” said Rep. Kuster. “This funding will help law enforcement address racial bias, prevent hate crimes, and protect young Granite Staters. I will continue working to ensure New Hampshire law enforcement officers have the tools and resources they need to keep our communities safe while also addressing racial disparities and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to thrive.” “To help our young people build a brighter future, we need to address youth delinquency, and break the patterns that lead to it. These funds will support our young people by funding law enforcement training, supporting community programming and early prevention efforts, and researching connections between delinquency and mental health,” said Rep. Pappas. “Moving forward, I’ll continue fighting to bring resources to New Hampshire that will help all Granite State youth thrive.” Senator Shaheen is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS), which funds the Department of Justice. In Senate Democrats’ proposal for the Fiscal Year 2023 government funding legislation, Senator Shaheen worked to add $240.5 million for Office of Justice Programs and COPS Office grant programs to support efforts that improve police-community relations. This is an increase of $39.5 million, or 20 percent, above the enacted FY 2022 funding level. This funding will support programs for law enforcement officer training on de-escalation, implicit bias and crisis intervention, as well as hate crime prevention and community violence intervention programs.  ### "

This project is funded under EDA’s $240 million competitive American Rescue Plan Travel, Tourism, and Outdoor Recreation program.This project will boost tourism by extending an existing path from the Cranmore Mountain Resort north to the Intervale Scenic Vista. The EDA investment will be matched with $989,985 in local funds and is expected to create 30 jobs, retain 15 jobs and generate $70 million in private investment, according to grantee estimates.“This latest grant from the Economic Development Administration reaffirms how critical the agency is to communities like North Conway, providing important federal investments to kick-start or enhance local projects,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen. “This funding will do just that by constructing a recreational path for Granite Staters and visitors from all over to explore and admire the beauty of New Hampshire’s White Mountains. This is a win for our tourism economy and the region. I’ll continue to fight for funding to support the EDA’s efforts, which so often benefit exciting Granite State projects like this.”“Outdoor recreation is a critical part of New Hampshire’s way of life and helps power our economy. I’m excited to see these federal dollars that I helped secure head to the Mount Washington Valley to expand our trails,” said Senator Maggie Hassan. “This project will attract visitors, create jobs, support small businesses, and bolster the area’s tourism and economy. I look forward to seeing it come to fruition.”“Outdoor recreation brings billions of dollars into New Hampshire’s economy every year, boosting our local small businesses and creating jobs. These funds for trail infrastructure will make the Mount Washington Valley an even more attractive place to visit, recreate, and do business,” said Representative Chris Pappas. “I will always support our communities in seeking out new opportunities that will drive economic development and improve quality of life.”""The outdoor recreation and tourism industries are critical to the economic vitality of communities throughout New Hampshire,"" said Representative Kuster. ""Investing in Granite State trails will help to bring more visitors to our state, create jobs, and grow our economy.""“President Biden recognizes the vital contribution the travel and tourism industry makes to the American economy,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This EDA investment underscores the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to helping this critical sector not only recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic but build back stronger and more equitably for the future.”“The Economic Development Administration is pleased to partner with Mount Washington Valley Trails Association in its locally drive efforts to leverage its tourism industry to boost coronavirus recovery and response efforts,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “This project will enhance the visitor experience in North Conway, while also paving the way for job creation and more tourism-based economic development.”As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen oversees funding for the EDA. In the fiscal year (FY) 2023 government funding legislation that her Subcommittee released earlier this year, Senator Shaheen included $450 million for the EDA. This level is an increase of $76.5 million above the prior year.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-baldwin-introduce-legislation-to-give-local-communities-tools-to-combat-the-substance-use-disorder-epidemic,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act to give local communities resources to better combat the opioid and substance use disorder epidemic. The legislation will improve State Opioid Response (SOR) grants – an important tool for communities’ comprehensive response to this public health crisis epidemic – by providing additional investments in and flexibility for states and local communities.   “For years, the State Opioid Response Grant Program has been an essential tool for states like New Hampshire that are on the frontlines of this crisis. That’s precisely why I’ve worked to create flexibility within the program to adapt to how this epidemic evolved over the years. And that’s why I’m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Baldwin to authorize the lifesaving SOR grant program to continue providing resources and flexibility to fight this scourge,” said Senator Shaheen. “We cannot take our eyes off the substance misuse crisis, and I’ll keep fighting to ensure New Hampshire gets its fair share of resources to protect future generations from succumbing to addiction.” “As the opioid and substance use disorder crisis continues to plague American families, I am working to ensure local and Tribal communities have the resources and flexibility they need to support prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts,” said Senator Baldwin. “Washington needs to step up and better address the opioid and use disorder crisis, and this legislation helps strengthen the partnership with state and local communities and helps them effectively respond to this epidemic.” “The SAMHSA State Opioid Response grant program has proven to be a vital tool in our nation’s ongoing struggle to address opioid and substance use disorders, providing critical support for evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery support services,” said American Psychiatric Association CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A.. “In providing this essential program with enhanced funding and flexibility, the State Opioid Response Authorization Act would help to immediately reduce unmet treatment needs across the country, and critically, reduce overdose-related deaths. The American Psychiatric Association enthusiastically supports this important legislation and urges Congress to swiftly take it up for consideration.” Specifically, the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act would: The State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act is supported by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry and American Psychiatric Association.   Full text of the legislation is available here. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen has fought to deliver resources to combat the substance use disorder crisis in New Hampshire. The fiscal year (FY) 2022 funding legislation that was signed into law provided $1.5 billion in State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding, as well as the continuation of a 15 percent set-aside that Shaheen fought to secure in 2018 for hard-hit states like New Hampshire. Shaheen also included a key provision from the 2019 version of her legislation - the Turn the Tide Act - to provide flexibility for treatment providers to use State Opioid Response (SOR) grant dollars to help patients suffering from meth and cocaine dependency, in addition to opioid use disorders. Shaheen wrote the provision in response to discussions with New Hampshire treatment providers. Over the past four years, New Hampshire has received approximately $92 million from these grants to combat the opioid epidemic in the state. In FY 2022 government funding legislation, Shaheen secured $572.5 million to help communities and first responders respond to substance use crises, including opioid addiction and drug trafficking. This also includes $415 million for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) grants, which support programs like drug, mental health and veteran treatment courts and substance use disorder treatment programs administered by state and local correctional facilities. Last year, Senator Shaheen helped introduce the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery (CARA) Act 3.0 to help combat the opioid epidemic by increasing the funding authorization levels for these programs. Shaheen also secured funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) anti-heroin task force and anti-methamphetamine task force programs.     ###  "

Mike Braun (R-IN).  The bill will help eliminate the current backlog of veterans’ record requests at the National Personnel Records Center. The bipartisan legislation will help more veterans and their families obtain their military records, which are often required to access critical care and benefits veterans earn through their service to the nation.  “Administrative challenges should never prevent veterans from accessing the critical care and benefits they deserve. Congress must take action – that’s why I’m helping introduce this bill to address the backlog of personnel records to ensure veterans can swiftly process their claims and access the benefits they have earned. By creating systems and infrastructure to streamline veterans’ ability to access records, we can better deliver on their benefits and needs, from health care and housing to jobs training and education,” said Shaheen. “I’ll keep fighting to ensure veterans can access the full range of benefits they’ve earned through their service to our nation.” Full text of the bill is available here.  Senator Shaheen has spearheaded efforts in the Senate in support of veterans and military families. Shaheen worked to include provisions and helped pass the historic PACT Act, which expands health care for post-9/11 combat veterans. In the fiscal year (FY) 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that was signed into law, Shaheen successfully included a provision based on her bipartisan legislation with Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) that improves the transferability of military spouses’ occupational licenses, and also helps alleviate the burden spouses endure if they’re small business owners from having to constantly re-register their businesses as they move from state to state with their families. In government funding legislation for FY2022 unveiled by the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this year, Shaheen successfully secured $3 million to implement the legislation. Additionally, the funding legislation includes $22 million for the Beyond Yellow Ribbon (BYR) program, which funds the New Hampshire National Guard’s Care Coordination Program. BYR programs provide outreach services to troops returning from deployment, including health care, marriage and financial counseling, substance misuse treatment and mental health services. The FY2020 NDAA also included a provision Shaheen fought for that eliminates the military “widow’s tax” that prevents as many as 65,000 surviving military spouses nationwide from receiving their full Department of Defense (DOD) and VA survivor benefits. ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-cornyn-lead-bill-to-quickly-replenish-us-defense-stockpiles-after-providing-aid-to-allies-like-ukraine-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) led the introduction of the Securing American Acquisitions, Readiness, and Military Stockpiles Act, which would give the Department of Defense (DoD) enhanced procurement authorities to quickly refill American defense stockpiles after the President provides aid to an ally or partner attacked by a foreign adversary, including replenishing America’s stockpiles after lethal aid was sent to Ukraine for defense against Russia.This legislation follows a previous bill by Senators Shaheen and Cornyn, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, to establish a military lend-lease program to enhance security assistance to Ukraine. That bill was signed into law by President Biden on May 9, 2022.  “As the United States continues to lead the global military aid response to Ukraine amid Putin’s unprovoked war, it has become increasingly critical that we simultaneously ensure the sustainment of our defensive weapons stockpile while also providing the materials our allies and partners need to defend themselves,” said Shaheen. “This bipartisan legislation would enhance our ability to both maintain our own defenses while also helping our friends. I’m glad to partner with Sen. Cornyn on this legislation, which specifically addresses the current security challenges facing the United States and our allies.” “When providing aid to allies under attack, we must ensure we can quickly replenish our own stockpiles in the process,” said Cornyn. “This legislation would authorize faster procurement of weapons and combat articles so helping our allies and partners doesn’t diminish our ability to protect ourselves.”   The Securing American Acquisitions, Readiness, and Military Stockpiles Act would amend the DoD’s emergency acquisition authorities to allow them to use non-competitive procedures to quickly award a contract in order to replenish defense article stocks sent to an ally or partner after an attack by a foreign adversary of the U.S.  While the DoD can use expedited procedures to speed up defense procurement in certain situations, backfilling depleted stockpiles is not one of them. This legislation lays out an exemption to permit the DoD to expedite the acquisitions process and decrease the time it takes to send aid in case of such an attack, subject to the following conditions:  This authority can only be used when the U.S. is not a party to hostilities;  The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Angus King (I-ME), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Rick Scott (R-FL), Gary Peters (D-MI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence. Last month, Shaheen released a statement ahead of the anniversary of Ukraine’s independence and the six-month mark of Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine. In July, Senator Shaheen and Senator Romney introduced legislation that would require an interagency strategy toward the Black Sea region, which includes Ukraine. In March, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Shaheen that would ensure the U.S. undertakes coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed by Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Shaheen and Portman led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration. Before the Shaheen-Portman congressional delegation visit to Ukraine in January, Shaheen led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, last June.   ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-hassan-urge-senate-to-protect-rural-networks-from-chinese-threats,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) joined a bipartisan group of Senators calling on Senate leadership to close the $3 billion funding shortfall impacting the Secure & Trusted Communications Networks Act’s Reimbursement Program. The shortfall leaves wireless networks—often in rural areas—vulnerable to espionage or disruption. Due to security concerns, in 2020 the FCC prohibited the purchase of equipment manufactured by Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE and also prohibited the use of FCC-administered funds to expand or maintain networks with Huawei or ZTE equipment already present. The reimbursement program helps small telecommunications providers remove and replace suspect Chinese network equipment manufactured by Huawei and ZTE. If the funding shortfall for the program is not closed, the FCC will not be able to fully cover the costs of removing, disposing and replacing suspect network equipment, which will leave U.S. wireless networks vulnerable to espionage and disruption. “The highest priority class of telecommunications providers in the Reimbursement Program serve the most rural areas of the United States where wireless connectivity is a vital lifeline to accessing telehealth services, receiving emergency notifications, and participating in the 21st century economy,” wrote the Senators.  As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, Shaheen has long advocated for serious investments in scientific and technology innovation to protect the U.S.’s global leadership and national security against China. In the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act, she successfully secured inclusion of language based on her bipartisan Supporting STEM Learning Opportunities Act to allow funds to support research and development of innovative STEM educational programming, including afterschool and other outside of the classroom activities. This language seeks to improve federal investments in experiential learning opportunities to strengthen the pipeline of students entering the STEM workforce, especially from traditionally underrepresented groups like women and communities of color. Shaheen is also the co-author of the Transatlantic Telecommunication Security Act (TTSA), which would strengthen European telecommunications infrastructure and counter China’s influence by helping key allies in the region build 5G networks.  Text of the letter is available here and below. Dear Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell, We write to express our support for the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) Reimbursement Program under the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act (Secure Networks Act). The program’s success is critical to maintaining network resiliency in Rural America and our national security. Since the Secure Networks Act was signed into law in 2020, Congress has appropriated $1.9 billion to support the FCC’s ongoing implementation of the Secure Networks Act and the establishment of the Reimbursement Program to reimburse eligible small and rural telecommunications providers for costs associated with removing, destroying, and replacing “threats to the security of our nation’s communications networks posed by certain communications equipment providers.” On February 4, 2022, the FCC announced providers, using guidance provided by the FCC, had requested close to $5.6 billion to remove and replace equipment in their networks—nearly three times more than a previous projection for the Reimbursement Program and creating a significant financial shortfall of $3.7 billion. On July 15, 2022, the FCC informed Congress that following an extensive review of applications submitted under the Reimbursement Program, the amount of supplemental funding needed to fully fund approved cost estimates is $3.08 billion. Pursuant to the Secure Networks Act, a funding shortfall requires the FCC issue a pro-rated reimbursement to eligible telecommunications providers—resulting in only 39.5% of funding for approved costs allocated for reimbursement. The highest priority class of telecommunications providers in the Reimbursement Program serve the most rural areas of the United States where wireless connectivity is a vital lifeline to accessing telehealth services, receiving emergency notifications, and participating in the 21st century economy. Due to significant national security risks to U.S. communications infrastructure, the FCC has already prohibited monies from the Universal Service Fund (USF) from supporting the maintenance or expansion of any wireless network that has covered equipment from Huawei and ZTE present. While these actions are necessary, small rural wireless telecommunications providers rely upon USF funds, and rural America faces a perilous situation. Currently, rural wireless carriers may not maintain, service, or upgrade networks with USF with Huawei and ZTE equipment still present. We are jeopardizing vital communications networks nationwide and our national security. Recognizing the importance of a well-resourced Reimbursement Program to maintaining critical telecommunications service in rural communities, we are committed to working with you on legislative solutions to promptly provide the financial resources necessary to mitigate national security vulnerabilities emanating from network equipment manufactured by untrusted companies such as Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corporation. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We look forward to working with you to find a swift solution.   ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/to-address-flight-cancellations-and-delays-shaheen-calls-on-faa-to-address-staffing-shortages_improve-transparency-measures-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) sent a letter to Billy Nolen, acting Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in light of recent flight cancellations and delays that have impacted millions of travelers across New England. In her letter, Shaheen urged the implementation of transparency measures to address staffing shortages of fully certified controllers (CPCs) to strengthen America’s air traffic control (ATC) workforce and bolster resiliency in the National Airspace System (NAS). Among other recommendations, she urged for data on attrition, as well as transparency around staffing and trainee targets, to be included in the FAA’s Controller Workforce Plan, which is submitted to Congress annually. Senator Shaheen wrote, in part, “Addressing staffing challenges across the National Airspace System requires a fully transparent assessment of facility staffing levels, including data on attrition and anticipated attrition. In addition, FAA should work collaboratively with representatives of the controller workforce to regularly update CPC operational staffing targets for each ATC facility to ensure safe and efficient operation. FAA and the workforce representatives should collaborate to set trainee targets in order to achieve and maintain the CPC targets in light of anticipated attrition. I believe FAA should report these data as part of its annual report to Congress on ATC staffing.” Shaheen continued, “Including these details in the FAA’s annual Controller Workforce Plan would better inform Congress by providing greater transparency and it would assist us in addressing the staffing shortages at various ATC facilities across the country.” Read the Senator’s full letter here or below: Dear Acting Administrator Nolen,  I write to urge you to implement key transparency measures in order to strengthen America’s air traffic control (ATC) workforce and bolster resiliency in the National Airspace System (NAS).  As you know, air travel this summer has been significantly disrupted by flight cancellations and delays. According to data from flight tracking site FlightAware, 48,000 US flights were canceled between May 27, the Friday before Memorial Day, and August 14. That figure represents 2.3 percent of the flights scheduled. During that same period, nearly 483,000 US flights were delayed, or roughly 24 percent of flights. I recognize that these operational challenges have multifaceted causes, including airline staffing shortages largely resulting from the pandemic and particularly severe weather events this summer. However, understaffing at critical ATC facilities has also played a role in many flight delays and cancellations.  According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data, in 2011, there were over 11,750 fully certified controllers (CPCs) and additional trainees yielding over 15,000 total controllers onboard. FAA staffing of ATC facilities has since failed to keep up with attrition, resulting in a reduction of over 1,000 certified controllers tasked with monitoring and ensuring the safe and efficient movement of aircraft in the NAS. As you know, staffing shortages at certain facilities can lead to stress on the frontline workforce and negatively affect operations. In particular, I am concerned that FAA’s Controller Workforce Plan (CWP) appears to rely on overall “headcount” for facility staffing ranges, which includes CPCs and trainees. In some cases, this gives the appearance that a facility is appropriately staffed when in fact the facility is below the staffing range when you exclude trainees. I understand that these shortfalls can be even more pronounced when you compare the CPCs at a facility to CPC operational staffing targets that were jointly developed by FAA’s Air Traffic Organization and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.  Addressing staffing challenges across the National Airspace System requires a fully transparent assessment of facility staffing levels, including data on attrition and anticipated attrition. In addition, FAA should work collaboratively with representatives of the controller workforce to regularly update CPC operational staffing targets for each ATC facility to ensure safe and efficient operation. FAA and the workforce representatives should collaborate to set trainee targets in order to achieve and maintain the CPC targets in light of anticipated attrition. I believe FAA should report these data as part of its annual report to Congress on ATC staffing.  Including these details in the FAA’s annual Controller Workforce Plan would better inform Congress by providing greater transparency and it would assist us in addressing the staffing shortages at various ATC facilities across the country.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I stand ready to work with you to support our controller workforce and mitigate travel disruptions for millions of Americans. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-welcomes-more-than-15m-in-federal-funding-to-support-nh-firefighters-,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, alongside U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) welcomed $1,591,818 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support Granite State firefighters in Barnstead, Surry and New Boston, as well as the New Hampshire Department of Safety’s Division of Fire Standards and Training and Emergency Medical Services, through the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program. The AFG program provides direct financial assistance to eligible fire departments in order to enhance the safety of firefighters and the public. “This $1.5 million investment in local fire departments will bolster public safety in Barnstead, Surry, New Boston and communities across New Hampshire. Firefighters and first responders need resources to update their equipment and infrastructure so they can respond to crises with timeliness and precision – that’s exactly what these awards do,” said Senator Shaheen. “As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee that helps secure this funding, I’ll continue to prioritize delivering resources that support the essential work of our Granite State first responders.”  “Fire fighters need state-of-the-art equipment to help keep them safe and to help them save lives. That’s why I’ve worked to secure critical federal grants for New Hampshire fire departments, and I look forward to seeing how communities use these new funds to improve public safety. I will keep working to support New Hampshire’s brave first responders,” said Senator Hassan.“New Hampshire’s firefighters and first responders confront dangerous situations to protect our communities every day, and we must ensure they have the equipment and resources they need to do their jobs safely,” said Rep. Kuster. “These investments in local fire departments will help to keep firefighters safe and bolster public safety – I’m thrilled to see this funding headed to our state and I will continue working to support Granite State firefighters and first responders.”“New Hampshire’s firefighters put themselves in harm’s way every day, and I’ll always support our departments as they work to keep Granite Staters safe,” said Rep. Pappas. “These grants will ensure our departments have the equipment they need to serve our communities, and can do so safely. I remain committed to working in a bipartisan manner to support our firefighters and first responders and secure the resources they need.”A full breakdown of the awards is available below: Organization Program Area Federal Share Town of Barnstead Vehicle Acquisition $857,142.85 Town of Surry Operations and Safety $185,760.95 Town of New Boston Operations and Safety $118,371.90 New Hampshire Department of Safety Operations and Safety $430,543.08 As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has consistently fought to support New Hampshire firefighters. In funding legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2022 that was passed by Congress and signed into law earlier this year, Shaheen secured $360 million for the AFG program, and helped include $360 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response Grants (SAFER) program, which provides grants directly to fire departments and volunteer firefighter interest organizations to help them increase or maintain the number of trained, ""front line"" firefighters available in their communities. Senator Hassan and Shaheen successfully worked to increase funding for the AFG program in the American Rescue Plan that was passed into law. Shaheen also worked to include $370 million for the program in the FY 23 government funding proposal through her role on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. ### "

They were joined by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Angus King (D-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME).“Every September 11th, we grieve the 2,977 lives taken too soon and we remember the sacrifice and bravery of American heroes who sprang into action that day. We also honor the selfless service and sacrifice of the thousands of U.S. service members, diplomats, and intelligence professionals who have worked tirelessly to keep our country safe in the years since that fateful day. I’m joining this bipartisan resolution to honor our first responders and brave civilians who heeded the call to action to save lives and keep our country strong,” said Senator Shaheen. “They represent the best of the American spirit, and this resolution is a testament to their courage and to our shared commitment to never forget what happened on September 11, 2001.”Text of the resolution is available here."

Shaheen’s resolution would designate Sunday, November 13th as National Warrior Call Day, which follows Veterans Day in an effort to bolster action from community members in support of veterans.“The alarming rate of suicide among our veteran community demands an all-hands-on deck approach to provide support and resources to veterans so no one in crisis slips through the cracks. Everyone can play a supporting role in that effort, including members of our community, which is why I’m leading this resolution to encourage friends, family and neighbors to reach out to veterans around them. It is on all of us to remind our hometown heroes that not only are we grateful for their service and sacrifice, but to make clear that they are not alone and have people around them to seek help from and rely on,” said Senator Shaheen. “As the anniversary of 9/11 draws near and in the aftermath of U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan one year ago, it can be a particularly difficult time of year for many veterans. I appreciate the bipartisan support for this resolution and will work to advance this effort through the Senate.”“Support for our troops shouldn't end when they return home — but it doesn't always take a new federal program. Sometimes all you need is a call from a friend, family member, or battle buddy,” said Senator Cotton. “Our resolution will remind Americans that they are the greatest support system for our vets, and that a simple call can make all the difference.""The resolution is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), John Hoeven (R-ND), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Angus King (I-ME), Edward J.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-collins-to-introduce-resolution-posthumously-honoring-queen-elizabeth-ii,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, and U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) announced a resolution today honoring Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The resolution pays tribute to the Queen’s historic legacy and her 70 year reign, expresses condolences to her family and citizens of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and reaffirms U.S. commitment to its close alliance with the United Kingdom.“I remember watching Queen Elizabeth’s coronation as a child as the world bore witness to a 25-year old woman inheriting the colossal responsibility of providing strength and fortitude to her country in the shadow of World War II. She shouldered that responsibility with a unique balance of tenacity and grace for more than seventy years,” said Senator Shaheen. “As we look back at her historic reign, the U.S. Senate offers this resolution to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her legacy that is etched into our collective global history. She was a steadfast leader to the people of the United Kingdom during the most tumultuous of times, from wars to humanitarian crises, economic turmoil and much more. She advised fifteen Prime Ministers and participated in diplomatic activities with countless representatives around the world. And throughout her reign, she furthered the close and important U.S.-U.K. relationship, which continues to be pivotal today as we face down global security challenges together, as partners. Our resolution pays homage to her service to the U.K. and the global community that she helped shape for seven decades. My thoughts are with her family, citizens of the U.K. and all those mourning her passing.”“For 70 years, Queen Elizabeth II has been a source of strength and stability for one of America’s greatest allies,” said Senator Collins. “Her historic reign was defined by her dignity, character, and devotion to duty. She will be deeply missed, but her faithful service and leadership will be long remembered.”The resolution can be read in full here.The resolution is currently cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Schumer (D-NY), Senate Minority Leader McConnell (R-KY) and U.S. Senators Durbin (D-IL), Warner (D-VA), Van Hollen (D-MD), Cornyn (R-TX), Murray (D-WA), Coons (D-DE), Hagerty (R-TN), Leahy (D-VT), Padilla (D-CA), Feinstein (D-CA), Warnock (D-GA), Menendez (D-NJ), Risch (R-ID), Stabenow (D-MI), Lujan (D-NM), Rubio (R-FL), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Cardin (D-MD), Baldwin (D-WI), Cortez Masto (D-NV), Hassan (D-NH), Capito (R-WV), Fischer (R-NE), Heinrich (D-NM), Booker (D-NJ), Murphy (D-CT), Kaine (D-VA), Klobuchar (D-MN), Blumenthal (D-CT), Smith (D-MN), Bennet (D-CO), Moran (R-KS), Reed (D-RI), Merkley (D-OR), Cassidy (R-LA), Marshall (R-KS), Graham (R-SC), Shelby (R-AL), Blunt (R-MO), Crapo (R-ID), Portman (R-OH), Hawley (R-MO), Wicker (R-MS) Blackburn (R-TN), Johnson (R-WI) and Cramer (R-ND)."
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/new-england-delegation-calls-for-president-biden-to-lower-energy-costs-by-releasing-oil-from-northeast-home-heating-oil-reserve,"Senators’ Bipartisan Call Comes as New England Braces for Winter Amid High Energy Prices (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) joined Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and all New England Senators in a bipartisan call for the Biden Administration to take action to lower energy costs for New Englanders as the winter season approaches and Americans continue to face high energy costs.  In the letter, the Senators write, “As winter approaches, we are calling for federal action to help bring down heating costs for households in our region, including releasing stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.”  They continue, “With lower inventories of crude oil, propane, and natural gas and the continued global disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs, we urge the administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast and release stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.” In addition to Senators Shaheen and Hassan, the letter is also signed by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), Angus King (I-ME), Pat Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ed Markey (D-MA). As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has prioritized ensuring Granite State families and seniors have access to heating and energy assistance. Senator Shaheen championed increases in funding for key programs to assist Granite State families with home heating bills, efficiency upgrades and emergency situations in the fiscal year (FY) 2023 Senate government funding proposal released earlier this month. The FY 2023 proposal includes $4 billion for LIHEAP, an increase of $200 million over FY 2022. Senator Shaheen also used her role as a lead negotiator for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to push to increase LIHEAP funding for Granite State families, leading to the highest total of LIHEAP funding ever received in a 12-month period in New Hampshire history. In addition to the $900 million in LIHEAP funds allocated through the CARES Act in 2020, Shaheen and Hassan worked to secure $4.5 billion for LIHEAP in the American Rescue Plan that was signed into law in March 2021 and provided $35,498,757 to New Hampshire. Last year, Shaheen and Hassan sent a bipartisan letter that successfully pushed the Biden administration to swiftly release LIHEAP funding, including $25,192,436 for New Hampshire, under the temporary government funding measure ahead of the winter season. Following the June announcement of energy rate increases approved by New Hampshire’s Public Utilities Commission, the New Hampshire Delegation urged the state to use the remaining funding secured in the American Rescue Plan to provide financial assistance to help Granite Staters afford their home energy bills. Senator Hassan is working across the aisle to bring down energy costs for Granite Staters. Senator Hassan successfully included in the Inflation Reduction Act her measure with Susan Collins (R-ME) to help lower energy costs for families and reduce carbon emissions by expanding and extending a tax credit for energy efficient home upgrades. The text of the letter is available here and below.  Dear President Biden: As winter approaches, we are calling for federal action to help bring down heating costs for households in our region, including releasing stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Given the current state of energy markets, particularly in New England, we urge you to consider additional targeted actions in preparation for the cold weather season. To help combat the increased cost of heating oil, we believe that now is an appropriate time to release inventory from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve, similar to the action you took earlier this year with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at our urging. Doing so can help address constrained regional energy supplies and recent residential energy price increases. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in its August Short-Term Energy Outlook, forecasts a significant increase in energy prices, particularly in the Northeast. These increased costs will have an outsized impact on households that heat with natural gas, propane, and heating oil – which includes many of our constituents. These costs can have a very real effect on the ability of many New England families to keep their homes at a safe temperature this winter. No family should have to make the decision between paying their bill to keep their children warm, putting food on the table, and keeping the lights on. As New Englanders purchase heating oil and propane for the winter season, it is vital that the administration use all tools available to bring down fuel prices and ensure that there is adequate supply to meet demand. With lower inventories of crude oil, propane, and natural gas and the continued global disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs, we urge the administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast and release stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. This action is consistent with the discretion granted to the President under 42 U.S.C. § 6250b, in order to directly and significantly reduce the adverse impact of a significant regional shortage of home heating oil. This is a critical economic issue facing millions of Americans, and we appreciate your attention to this important matter. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-pushes-postmaster-dejoy-to-increase-security-and-verification-tools-to-combat-fraudulent-requests-to-change-addresses,"**Letter comes on heels of instances of constituents whose addresses were changed & mail redirected without their knowledge** (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) sent a letter to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy regarding instances of change of address requests filed without Granite Staters’ knowledge. Despite increasing rates of change of address fraud and concerns around procedures to verify individuals who request address changes, reports found the U.S. Postal Service has not implemented effective verification controls for such procedures. “My office has received troubling reports from two constituents whose personal information has been used to file change of address requests with the Postal Service, which subsequently rerouted their mail to unknown recipients without the constituents’ knowledge. These incidents raise concerns around the security of the Postal Service’s change of address procedure and the agency’s ability to confirm the identity of individuals making such requests,” Shaheen wrote. Shaheen also asked Postmaster DeJoy how the Postal Service ensures that online change of address procedures are secure and what additional steps can be taken to prevent change of address fraud. She continued: “I would appreciate answers to the following questions: How does the Postal Service ensure that the online change of address procedure is secure? What additional measures may need to be implemented in order to secure this process for customers? What action is the Postal Service taking to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future?” Full text of the letter is available here and below: Dear Postmaster General DeJoy, I write with concerns regarding fraudulent activity relative to change of address requests made to the U.S. Postal Service. My office has received troubling reports from two constituents whose personal information has been used to file change of address requests with the Postal Service, which subsequently rerouted their mail to unknown recipients without the constituents’ knowledge. These incidents raise concerns around the security of the Postal Service’s change of address procedure and the agency’s ability to confirm the identity of individuals making such requests. The Office of the Inspector General has found that the Postal Service did not implement effective identity verification controls for the online change of address procedure and has recommended that such controls be developed and implemented. In a report dated April 12, 2022, the Office of the Inspector General writes, “Based on our analysis, online [change of address] COA fraud and attempted identity theft by individuals and organized groups increased from 8,857 to 23,606 (167 percent) from 2020 to 2021.” Specifically, the report recommends the Postal Service “develop controls to verify that online change of address requests are authorized by the resident of the address.” However, the Postal Service has declined to take recommended action to mitigate this issue. In response to the Inspector General’s recommendation the Postal Service responded that the agency “thoroughly assessed the risk, cost, and failure rate of options and continue to assess these [current] controls as sufficient.” Protecting our citizens’ identities is paramount. Therefore, I would appreciate answers to the following questions: Thank you for your attention to this important matter and I look forward to your response. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-welcomes-250k-from-us-small-business-association-to-help-nh-small-businesses-compete-on-global-stage-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, applauded $250,000 awarded from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) through a competitive application process to the SBA’s State Trade Expansion Program grant program. The Division of Economic Development’s Office of International Commerce will use this funding to provide small businesses with the information and tools they need to succeed in export-related activities.  Senator Shaheen helped create the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) as a pilot program in 2010 to help small businesses enter new markets, access export financing and attend trade missions. The program was fully authorized by Senator Shaheen’s small business trade amendment, which was signed into law in 2016. “I’m thrilled to welcome $250,000 through the STEP program to empower Granite State small businesses with the tools needed to compete on the global stage. I helped create STEP as a pilot program in 2010 to help small businesses enter new markets. From teaching small businesses how to export and participate in international markets to supporting e-commerce capabilities, this program is key to leveling the playing field and boosting the competitiveness of our small business community,” said Senator Shaheen. “Small businesses are the bedrock of New Hampshire’s economy and communities, and I’m excited to see these important tools further strengthen the Granite State.” “With nearly 96 percent of consumers living outside the U.S. and two-thirds of the world’s purchasing power in foreign countries, it's critical we level the playing field of opportunity for small businesses to access these potential customers and clients,” said SBA New England Regional Administrator Mike Vlacich. “Thanks to this federal funding, the Office of International Commerce will be able to support new and existing small business exporters increase sales and expand markets through SBA’s State Trade Expansion Program.  We thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership in the creation of the STEP program.” Exporting activities supported through the STEP program include participating in foreign trade missions, market sales trips, designing international marketing campaigns, participating in export trade show exhibits and attending training workshops, as well as other important means of engagement. Senator Shaheen has long supported trade agreements and programs that increase opportunities and growth for New Hampshire businesses. Shaheen was the first New Hampshire Governor to lead trade missions outside of North America and has prioritized efforts in Congress to help small businesses boost their exports. Senator Shaheen also strongly opposed the Trump Administration’s Section 232 tariffs on allies in Canada and Europe, and was instrumental in securing an exclusion process for businesses to apply for relief from the Section 301 tariffs. Last month, Shaheen joined United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai and the Granite State District Export Council for a roundtable discussion to hear from New Hampshire businesses engaged in the export market on how they use trade agreements and programs to help their businesses succeed.    ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-requests-updates-on-implementation-of-pfas-testing-and-health-guidance-regulations-following-nasem-report-,"The report issued by NASEM informs clinical guidance Shaheen has long worked toward; Shaheen’s letter urges updates from CDC & ATSDR (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) sent a letter asking for updates on the implementation of recommendations outlined in the recent report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals – which are linked to adverse health outcomes. The letter was sent to the Director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rochelle Walensky, and the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Patrick Breysse.  Specifically, Shaheen asked what progress has been made around establishing training courses for health professionals related to the health impacts of PFAS exposure and what resources are needed to ensure all recommendations are implemented. NASEM released a report on the need for PFAS public health guidance in July, on which Shaheen released a statement. “As you are aware, establishing clinician guidance on PFAS, including testing protocols and physician education, has been a longstanding priority of mine. Due to their use in a variety of residential, commercial and industrial products PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread pollutants in the drinking water sources for communities across New Hampshire,” Shaheen wrote. “I urge ATSDR to swiftly review and update your physician health guidance so individuals, communities and physicians can make thoughtful decisions on how to appropriately respond to the harmful effects PFAS has on human health.” She continued, “I respectfully ask for a response to the following questions: What is your progress in developing health monitoring protocols and voluntary training courses for health professionals to understand the potential health impact of PFAS exposure, as directed by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021? What resources does the CDC and ATSDR need in order to successfully and swiftly review and implement the recommendations in NASEM’s report? What plans does ATSDR have to continue physician outreach in light of this new report from NASEM?” Shaheen has long worked to get clinicians guidance on testing and protocols, including introducing the Physician Education for PFAS Health Impacts Act, bipartisan legislation that would establish a grant program within the Department of Health and Human Services to fund the creation of training materials for physicians on the health effects of PFAS and best practices for caring for patients who have been exposed to PFAS. Key provisions of Shaheen’s legislation were included in the fiscal year (FY) 2021 government funding legislation that was signed into law. Shaheen is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Specifically, Shaheen’s measure provided $1,000,000 for grants for the development of voluntary training courses for health professionals to understand the potential health impact of PFAS exposure and best practices for treatment. The provision also directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award multiple grants to medical society organizations, medical institutions with expertise in PFAS, and other organizations as determined appropriate by the Director to develop these training courses. Full text of the letter is available here. Senator Shaheen leads efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. Shaheen has fought to secure consistent federal support for the PFAS health impact study that she established four years ago. Because of her efforts, Pease is serving as a model site for the nationwide study. As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she successfully secured the authorization of an additional $20 million for the PFAS health impact study in the fiscal year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) approved by the Committee. She has also fought for additional public disclosures of results of drinking and ground water testing, as well as improved guidance for spill prevention and mitigation of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). In the FY2020 NDAA, Shaheen worked to include the bipartisan Safe Drinking Water Assistance Act, which expedites analysis of water contaminants like PFAS, provides support and resources to states dealing with the health challenges posed by these potentially harmful materials and establishes a national strategy to coordinate the federal response to emerging contaminants. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-statement-on-portsmouth-naval-shipyard-economic-impact-report-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement in response to the release of the Seacoast Shipyard Association’s Annual Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Economic Impact Report for 2021: “The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is a staple in the Seacoast region and a point of pride for our state. The economic impact report released today underscores the Shipyard’s contributions to New Hampshire’s economy at both the local and state level. Its success is a credit to the caliber of its workforce,” said Shaheen. “The Shipyard not only boosts the Seacoast’s economic vitality, but it plays a significant role in support of our military readiness and overall national defense. I’ll continue to advocate for the Shipyard and its workers as the Senate works toward finalizing annual defense and government funding legislation for the upcoming fiscal year. Ensuring continued resources to complete the Multi-Mission Dry Dock project and to address urgent issues impacting working families, such as access to affordable child care, will continue to be top of mind. I’ll always go to bat for the Shipyard and the hardworking men and women who work day and night so that it can complete its missions.” Shaheen is a fierce advocate for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and its workers. Shaheen?has historically secured?annual authorization and federal funding for the Multi-Mission Dry Dock modernization project. In the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, Shaheen again secured these investments, which included $475 million in funding for the Multi-Mission Dry Dock project. In June, with advocacy from Senator Shaheen, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which included $503 million for the construction project. In addition to her leadership through the Senate Armed Services Committee on annual defense legislation, Shaheen also prioritizes other legislation in the Senate in support of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. This includes the?Supplying Help to Infrastructure in Ports, Yards, and America’s Repair Docks (SHIPYARD) Act of 2021, which she introduced earlier this year with Senator Wicker (R-MS), and would provide $25 billion to make investments needed to optimize, improve and rebuild shipyard facilities, electrical infrastructure, environmental systems, and the equipment of public and private shipyards in the U.S. that support the U.S. Navy fleet. Shaheen and Wicker are co-chairs of the Senate Navy Caucus. Shaheen also secured more than $700 million in funding to support the U.S. submarine work force and submarine industrial base. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-announces-66-million-to-bring-high-speed-internet-to-nh-communities-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) alongside Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) today announced $66 million of a total of $122 million in federal funds to help bring high-speed internet access to New Hampshire households and businesses. The funding comes through the Capital Projects Fund. New Hampshire’s awards from the Capitol Projects Fund are estimated to serve approximately 24,000 locations total – representing approximately 80 percent of locations in New Hampshire that are still lacking high-speed internet. “Rural Granite State communities deserve every resource possible to address gaps in access to reliable broadband. Broadband is critical for families, small businesses, schools and hospitals to perform their everyday tasks – it’s unacceptable that such alarming disparities persist. That’s why I’m pleased to welcome $66 million to expand high-speed internet infrastructure across New Hampshire,” said Senator Shaheen. “This funding from the American Rescue Plan will complement the broadband investments made through the bipartisan infrastructure package I helped negotiate, and I’ll continue advocating for these resources until reliable internet is within reach for every zip code.” “The pandemic exposed longstanding challenges that workers and families face when they don’t have adequate access to the internet, especially those living in rural areas and other unconnected communities. That is why these broadband investments across the country are so critical,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “This funding through the American Rescue Plan will help provide affordable, high-speed internet service to communities across New Hampshire, including the most rural parts of the state. Treasury commends New Hampshire for targeting this funding to places where it is most urgently needed across the state.” “Today’s announcement marks a major investment in New Hampshire that will support families, small businesses, and our entire economy,” said Senator Hassan. “Expanding access to strong, affordable internet access will help Granite State communities thrive, which is why I led the efforts to secure this funding as part of the American Rescue Plan. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to boost New Hampshire’s economy.”   “Access to reliable, high-speed internet is essential for all Granite Staters, which is why I’m thrilled to announce this federal funding headed to New Hampshire to get us even closer to closing the digital divide and ensuring every family and small business in our state has access to the broadband services they need to thrive,” said Rep. Kuster, a member of the House Rural Broadband Task Force. “This funding, made possible by the American Rescue Plan, represents a significant investment in our state’s economy and all Granite Staters. I’ll continue working to ensure all Granite State students, employees, and businesses have the connections they need.” “These funds will help more communities make vital investments in broadband: boosting our local economies, improving education, and ensuring quality of life remains high,” said Rep. Pappas. “Access to high-speed internet is essential to compete and thrive in the 21st century, and I was proud to help pass the American Rescue Plan to secure these funds for New Hampshire. I’ll keep working to deliver additional resources to New Hampshire until all of our communities can access the funding they need to make sure high-speed broadband is available to all.”  The funding is from the Capital Projects Fund, which was created through the American Rescue Plan to support increased broadband adoption and access. In total, New Hampshire is set to receive over $222 million through the Capital Projects Fund and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to connect Granite State communities to the internet and help close the digital divide. New Hampshire is using the Capital Projects Fund to provide internet service to some of the most rural parts of the state lacking internet service. All service providers will participate in the Federal Communications Commission’s new Affordable Connectivity Program, established and funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which helps ensure that households can afford the broadband they need for work, school, healthcare, and more by providing a discount of up to $30 per month. Earlier this year, the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation announced $50 million in federal funds to bring high-speed internet access to the most rural parts of the state, also through the Capital Projects Fund. In addition, the delegation previously announced $2.2 and $2.4 million in funding to New Hampshire to help connect students to high-speed internet at home through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program. As a lead negotiator of the historic bipartisan infrastructure deal, Shaheen led bipartisan broadband negotiations with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and successfully secured $65 billion to support broadband affordability and deployment across the nation. ###"

Queen Elizabeth’s historic reign included some of the most pivotal moments in world history, of which she provided the British people steadfast leadership and consolation,” said Shaheen. “She took the throne at an age when most people are beginning their adult lives and was tasked with the immense responsibility of leading her nation in the aftermath of World War II. In her 70 years on the throne, she bore witness to the most consequential events that our world has ever seen and helped foster the close and important relationship that the United States shares with the United Kingdom. My thoughts are with her children, grandchildren and extended family at this difficult time. I hope they can take consolation in the monumental legacy she has left on the world.” ### "

EDA is awarding approximately $44 million in grants to the BioFabrication Cluster, led by the City of Manchester, to establish a biofabrication cluster in Southern New Hampshire. Shaheen, Hassan, Kuster and Pappas all advocated on behalf of this grant.With $44 million in funding from EDA, the BioFabrication Cluster will establish Southern New Hampshire as the global epicenter for the production and distribution of regenerative tissues and organs. Coalition projects include developing a facility suitable for scaled production of cells, tissues and organs, creating a business accelerator, establishing a cluster work-and-learn program and building pilot stations for a logistics network to be used for future organ distribution.“I’m excited to see this $44 million heading to Southern New Hampshire to position our state as a leader in cutting-edge science and innovation – not just across the nation, but also on the global stage. This substantial investment will revitalize our communities in meaningful, lasting ways, from creating good-paying jobs to preparing our workforce to propel emerging industries. Manchester and its coalition partners were awarded this competitive grant in recognition of their transformative vision around local biotechnology,” said Senator Shaheen, who is chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Economic Development Administration, which is the awarding agency of this grant. “I’m thrilled to welcome this grant from the innovative Build Back Better Regional Challenge, and I stand ready to support the region’s economic growth and revitalization in the years to come.”“New Hampshire can lead our country’s emerging biotechnology industry, which is why I was proud to advocate for Manchester to receive this transformative grant,” said Senator Hassan. “New Hampshire is a beacon for innovation, and we know that this project will produce life-saving research and technology for the entire world – all while bringing good-paying jobs to New Hampshire and bolstering our economy.”“It’s welcome news for our city that the BioFabrication Cluster in Manchester has been announced as a winner of this game-changing funding from the Economic Development Administration,” said Representative Pappas. “I’m grateful for the leadership of Mayor Joyce Craig and her office in seeking out opportunities that will support our businesses and manufacturers as they grow, and I was proud to advocate for this proposal. In recent years, Manchester has transformed itself into a leader in the technology space, and these funds will cement its position as a leader in the development and production of regenerative tissues as well. From improvements to our transportation network to the creation of new jobs and opportunities for workforce development, our community will see countless economic benefits from this funding.”“This federal funding from the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) is a meaningful investment in our state and will help push New Hampshire to the forefront of new cutting-edge medical advancements,” said Representative Kuster. “This EDA grant will ensure our state has a major role in the 21st Century economy and will create good-paying jobs for Granite Staters.”“This is an historic day for the City of Manchester. Through the $44,000,000 awarded to our regional coalition, we’ll not only revolutionize healthcare, but we’ll create thousands of high-paying jobs, and pathways to employment for our residents, regardless of their current level of education or training. Manchester was once the world leader in textile manufacturing, and now, thanks to this investment by the Economic Development Administration, we’ll be the world leader in biofabrication manufacturing as well,” said Mayor Joyce Craig.“The Build Back Better Regional Challenge provides bold investments in local economies to create good-paying jobs, catalyze emerging industries, and prepare our workforce for the future,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “The BioFabrication Cluster will enhance U.S. competitiveness, placing Southern New Hampshire as a global leader in the industry, and ensuring a strong, regional economy for the future.”“The Economic Development Administration is proud to support the vision of the city of Manchester and its coalition members,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “This EDA investment will drive innovation in the local biotechnology industry, support business development, and create jobs while diversifying the regional economy.” The BioFabrication Cluster is one of 21 winners – each a regional coalition of partnering entities – that will receive awards between $25 million and $65 million to implement an average of six projects that together will enable each region's economic transformation and competitiveness. The Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) is an unprecedented competitive federal grant program that provides each regional coalition with significant investments to tackle a wide variety of projects – including entrepreneurial support, workforce development, infrastructure, and innovation – to drive inclusive economic growth. Each coalition’s collection of projects aims to develop and strengthen regional industry clusters – all while embracing economic equity, creating good-paying jobs, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness globally. Projects span 24 states and include $94 million to two primarily Tribal coalitions and over $200 million for projects serving communities impacted by the declining use of coal. As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen oversees funding for the EDA. In the fiscal year (FY) 2023 government funding legislation that her Subcommittee released earlier this year, Senator Shaheen included $450 million for the EDA. This level is an increase of $76.5 million above the prior year. Shaheen previously opposed efforts by the Trump administration to reduce or eliminate funding for the EDA, which recently awarded grants to Granite State communities for a wide variety of projects.###"

The representatives also discussed how the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act support New Hampshire’s workers and small businesses. “Small businesses are the heart of New Hampshire, and trade is integral to the success of many of them. I was pleased to welcome United States Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai to the Granite State this afternoon to meet with New Hampshire exporters and discuss how trade policy impacts our business community,” said Senator Shaheen.  “As Chair of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, I’ll continue to work closely with Ambassador Tai to make sure that USTR has the resources and tools it needs to support U.S. trade priorities and help small- and medium-sized businesses across New Hampshire.”  “I was glad to welcome United States Trade Representative Ambassador Tai to New Hampshire today to hear from our businesses about the agreements and programs that help them reach new markets and succeed, because supporting New Hampshire’s exporters boosts our economy,” said Representative Pappas. “I’ll always fight to support our small businesses, and especially our rural small businesses that are looking to sell their products abroad.” “I am thrilled to be in New Hampshire to talk about how we’re working with our partners in Congress like Congressman Pappas and Senator Shaheen to deliver concrete results for workers and businesses in New Hampshire,” said United States Trade Representative Ambassador Tai. “From the Inflation Reduction Act to the CHIPS and Science Act to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are lowering costs for New Hampshire consumers, investing in our workers and businesses, and ensuring the United States maintains its global competitive edge for years to come.” Senator Shaheen has long supported trade agreements and programs that increase opportunities and growth for New Hampshire businesses. Shaheen was the first New Hampshire Governor to lead trade missions outside of North America and has prioritized efforts in Congress to help small businesses boost their exports. Senator Shaheen helped create the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) as a pilot program in 2010 to help small businesses enter new markets, access export financing, and attend trade missions. The program was fully authorized by Senator Shaheen’s small business trade amendment, which was signed into law in 2016. Senator Shaheen also strongly opposed the Trump Administration’s Section 232 tariffs on allies in Canada and Europe, and was instrumental in securing an exclusion process for businesses to apply for relief from the Section 301 tariffs. Senator Shaheen is Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds USTR.   ### "

This historic law includes measures that will cap prescription costs, reduce health insurance premiums, tackle surging insulin costs and expand access to health care for thousands of Granite Staters.“It was great to be in Manchester today with Mayor Craig to discuss some of the key provisions I fought to secure in the Inflation Reduction Act and what this historic law means in terms of lowering health care costs and extending coverage to thousands of Granite Staters.” said Shaheen. “This law is a game-changer for our state and takes much needed action to improve access and affordability of health care services for Granite State families.”In the afternoon, Shaheen had lunch at Meals on Wheels partner restaurant, The Village Eatery, in Merrimack to learn about the new Restaurant Voucher Program (RVP) that allows older adults to use their congregate meal at a local restaurant. The Village Eatery partnered with Meals on Wheels nutrition specialists to create this RVP.“I enjoyed hearing from program participants and representatives about the impact of Meals on Wheels’ new Restaurant Voucher Program. This program supports local restaurants while also giving older adults the opportunity to get out of the house, connect with friends and enjoy a nutritious, delicious meal,” said Shaheen. “I’ll keep working to ensure Meals on Wheels have the resources they need to continue their important work.”Later, Shaheen – a senior member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship –visited PT United in Nashua alongside Small Business Administration (SBA) Regional Administrator Mike Vlacich to highlight the importance of cybersecurity to small businesses. Senator Shaheen has worked tirelessly to provide Granite State small businesses with the resources they need to weather and recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.“New Hampshire’s small businesses are at the heart of our economy. It was great to be in Nashua today at PT United alongside SBA officials to discuss the important role cybersecurity plays in protecting small businesses from online criminals. As bad actors become increasingly adept at targeting small businesses, it is imperative that we provide local owners and employees with the tools they need to keep businesses and their customers’ personal information safe,” said Shaheen.Shaheen is currently working to get her bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Cyber Training Act, to the President’s desk and signed into law. This legislation would help better protect America’s small businesses from the threats of cyber-crimes.###"

Smith, who served in the Merchant Marines. The medal was presented to Captain Dwight A. Smith’s son, Dwight A. Smith Jr., at the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton. Shaheen and her staff worked closely with the Smith family to obtain this medal.“I was honored to take part in today’s ceremony honoring the life and service of Captain Dwight A. Smith, who served in the Merchant Marines during World War II. American Merchant Marines were instrumental to the war effort, serving as the supply line for U.S. troops and our Allies. Without their integral role and contributions, victory would not have been possible,” said Senator Shaheen. “I was honored to help the Smith family obtain this medal for Captain Smith and grateful to present it to his son Dwight, who carried on his father’s legacy of service to our nation.”In 2019, Shaheen supported legislation – which is now law – to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Merchant Mariners of World War II. The Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act recognized the dedicated and vital service of the 290,000 men – including Captain Dwight A. Smith – who served in the Merchant Marine and risked their lives transporting American soldiers, supplies and equipment over the seas in support of the Allied war effort.In the afternoon, Shaheen toured the Wright Museum of World War II in Wolfeboro where she discussed her successful push in Congress to pass the bipartisan Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act, which was signed into law earlier this month. The new law will help preserve a public space to honor and remember veterans who bravely fought in WWII. The law authorizes the U.S. Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the service and sacrifice of the Greatest Generation during World War II, and proceeds from the coin sales will go toward much-needed repairs and maintenance to the National World War II Memorial at no cost to taxpayers. Shaheen and Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) led the legislation in the U.S. Senate.“It was wonderful to be in Wolfeboro to pay tribute to the heroic men and women of the Greatest Generation,” said Senator Shaheen. “I am so proud to have partnered with Senator Rounds to secure passage of the bipartisan Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act, which President Biden recently signed into law. Our bill is an investment on behalf of veterans and military families to have a public space at the National World War II Memorial to pay tribute to those who risked or gave their lives for our nation and the values we hold dear. I appreciated the opportunity to share the good news about our bill and to tour the Wright Museum with advocates and staff as we remember our fallen heroes. I’ll continue to pursue efforts in the Senate that will ensure our military members and families always have the support of their communities.”Senator Shaheen has worked across the aisle to honor and pay tribute to American fallen heroes and veterans. Shaheen successfully led bipartisan efforts in Congress to establish a memorial for the men lost aboard the USS Thresher at Arlington National Cemetery. Senator Shaheen delivered the keynote address at the dedication for the memorial. Shaheen also fought to include her bipartisan legislation to ensure all members of the Reserve Component and the National Guard are eligible to be buried in state veterans cemeteries in the fiscal year 2022 government funding bill that is now law.###"

New Hampshire nonprofits, including houses of worship, will also receive $927,608 under the Nonprofit Security Grant Program.  “I’m glad to see this funding from the Department of Homeland Security headed to New Hampshire nonprofits and houses of worship to better protect Granite State communities from senseless violence. These federal dollars will help implement security measures for communities throughout the state to ensure families practicing their faith can do so in peace and free from threats,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’ll keep working to provide additional federal assistance that invests in security measures to keep all Granite Staters safe.” “Houses of worship are meant to be peaceful spaces where religious communities can come together, which makes violent threats and attacks on these spaces all the more upsetting,” said Senator Hassan. “After hearing directly from Granite State nonprofit and religious leaders about the importance of these grants, I have worked to increase funding for this program – and I am glad that now even more New Hampshire nonprofits and houses of worship will benefit from this program. I will continue to work across the aisle to protect our homeland security.”  “This federal funding for New Hampshire non-profits and houses of worship to improve and upgrade their security measures is an important investment in public safety,” said Representative Kuster. “Granite Staters have the right to worship wherever and however they choose without facing threats of violence, and I’m glad to see this federal funding headed to our state to make our communities safer.”  “Everyone in New Hampshire should be able to freely worship as they choose without fearing for their own safety,” said Representative Pappas. “These funds will protect non-profits and houses of worship in New Hampshire and ensure people are safe when they come together and practice their faith.” The following New Hampshire nonprofits and houses of worship will receive federal grant funding to help combat foreign and domestic terrorist threats: Brookside Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, Manchester -- $60,300  Main Street United Methodist Church, Nashua -- $20,645  Saint Joseph Cathedral, Manchester -- $150,000  Temple Adath Yeshurun, Manchester -- $150,000  Temple Beth Abraham of Nashua -- $117,350  Temple Beth Jacob, Concord -- $50,050  Temple Israel, Manchester -- $150,000  Temple of Israel Portsmouth -- $79,263  The Crossing Life Church, Windham -- $150,000 ""Temple Adath Yeshurun is greatly appreciative to FEMA, for a Nonprofit Security Grant, and to the State of New Hampshire for disbursing these funds.  Feeling safer in our synagogue is a blessing.

This program helps American families access information and support to find quality health care plans at affordable prices. The funding will be allocated through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and will be disbursed between two New Hampshire Navigator organizations. Health Market Connect will receive $875,000, and First Choice Services will receive $654,745. These federal funds will be used to expand health care accessibility to individuals and families across New Hampshire.  ACA open enrollment starts on November 1st, with coverage beginning on January 1, 2023. For more information visit healthcare.gov.“Affordable Care Act Navigators are essential to simplifying the health insurance process for families and individuals in need. Navigators like Health Market Connect and First Choice Services support Granite Staters in shopping for insurance and enrolling for the plan that’s best for them. This service is completely free to individuals,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m glad to see this federal funding headed to New Hampshire’s Navigator programs, which will complement the continued lower premiums that I fought for in the Inflation Reduction Act. I’ll always work to ensure Granite Staters can access the affordable, quality care they deserve.”“Affordable Care Act Navigators can help people throughout New Hampshire find the best health care plan for them and their families,” said Senator Hassan. “This grant funding will support the Navigators program in our state and ensure that Granite Staters are aware of the coverage options that are available to them – and this is especially important this year because the Inflation Reduction Act extended tax cuts that Granite State families are using to get less expensive health insurance. I’ll continue working with my colleagues to reduce health care costs and expand access to high-quality, affordable health care.”“This federal funding will help ensure Granite Staters are able to choose the right health plan to fit their needs and the needs of their families,” said Representative Kuster, a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. “Affordable Care Act Navigators provide vital, cost-free guidance for families while they are selecting a health insurance plan. I’m also thrilled that thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act which extended ACA subsidies for hard-working families, health plan premiums will remain low for many folks in New Hampshire. I’ll continue working to reduce health costs for Granite Staters and make health care affordable and accessible.”“As we approach the annual open enrollment period this fall, these funds will ensure Granite Staters understand their health care options and are able to access enrollment assistance,” said Representative Pappas. “The outreach and education provided by New Hampshire’s health care navigators will help residents sign up for a plan that meets their needs and take advantage of provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that lower health care premiums. I’ll continue working to bring affordable health care within reach of all Granite Staters.”In the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, Shaheen championed the extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) Premium Tax Credits. Shaheen also worked to include premium tax credit enhancement provisions from her legislation in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which was signed into law last year. Shaheen and Hassan worked with a group of Senators to introduce the Expand Navigators’ Resources for Outreach, Learning, and Longevity (ENROLL) Act to restore funding for the Navigator program. Shaheen previously introduced legislation to counteract the Trump administration’s sabotage efforts that blocked Americans from having the help or information they need to find the best health care plans. Shaheen’s Marketing and Outreach Restoration to Empower (MORE) Health Education Act would have ensured funds for outreach, marketing and education efforts to promote health insurance coverage offered on the federal health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.    ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-statement-on-one-year-anniversary-of-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, released the following statement commemorating the one-year anniversary of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. “Today is an emotional day for many Americans as we mark the one-year anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan – including the hundreds of thousands of Americans who were deployed and bravely served for 20 years alongside Afghans fighting for a brighter future for their country. The challenges of what became the longest U.S. war in history played out over four presidential administrations. From the start of negotiations with the Taliban, I made clear my opposition to an unconditioned withdrawal from Afghanistan because of the reprisal facing vulnerable Afghans under Taliban rule. Though our military mission has concluded, the humanitarian mission must continue. From Afghan women and girls who are experiencing an unacceptable revocation of fundamental freedoms and rights to our Afghan allies who put their lives on the line to serve the U.S. mission and now face persecution from the Taliban – the U.S. and global community must not take our eyes away from the protection of Afghans in danger,” said Shaheen. She continued: “I’m pleased the Biden administration has taken steps to streamline the Special Immigrant Visa program – which I’ve long championed – as well as extend Temporary Protected Status to Afghans living in America to ensure they aren’t deported to dangerous conditions. The U.S. must continue to work with the global community to pressure the Taliban on fundamental human rights and freedoms while we continue to advocate for vulnerable Afghans. I’ve also supported legislation to create a commission to investigate the political and strategic decisions that led to the longest U.S. war in history. With each day that passes, we must ensure lessons learned from this war are carried forth and that Afghanistan and its people remain a foreign policy priority.”   Shaheen has long championed the rights of Afghan women and girls and has led Senate efforts to bolster Congressional support for human rights around the world. Shaheen repeatedly fought to make the inclusion of Afghan women in negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan government a U.S. foreign policy priority. Shaheen is the author of the Women, Peace and Security Act, which was signed into law in 2017 and ensures women’s leadership roles in conflict resolution and peace negotiations. She has also led bipartisan efforts to address the unique barriers young girls in developing countries face in accessing a full education. Shaheen previously led a group of Senators in condemning the Taliban’s decision to renege on its promise to open schools to Afghan girls above the sixth grade, and led a bipartisan letter to President Biden urging his administration to take action. In April, she led a bipartisan delegation visit with Senator Ernst and Senator Susan Collins to the UN to discuss how the U.S. and international community can best support women and girls in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Shaheen and Ernst sent a letter with Senators Bob Menendez and Jim Risch to the United Nations, urging it to take measures to hold the Taliban to account for its continued abuses of Afghan women and girls’ human rights. Earlier this month, Shaheen was part of a bipartisan group, including U.S. Senators Joni Ernst, Dianne Feinstein and Tammy Baldwin, who were briefed by representatives from the U.S. State Department and USAID on the status of Afghan women and girls nearly one year since the United States withdrew from Afghanistan.  Senator Shaheen historically partnered with Senator John McCain (R-AZ) on efforts to protect Afghans who’ve risked their lives to support U.S. diplomatic efforts abroad by strengthening the Afghan SIV program. She has led bipartisan efforts in Congress to reauthorize additional Afghan SIVs. In addition, Senator Shaheen supported legislation to establish a nonpartisan, independent commission to examine every aspect of the war in Afghanistan, including the political and strategic decisions that transformed a focused military mission into a vast, nation-building campaign that became the longest war in U.S. history.   ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-applauds-1-million-headed-to-campus-compact-for-new-hampshire-to-better-support-students,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) welcomed a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) headed to Campus Compact for New Hampshire (CCNH).  This award is allocated through the DOE’s Statewide Family Engagement Centers Program and will support CCNH’s efforts to engage family networks and support students’ academic success across Carroll, Coos, Grafton and Hillsborough counties – with a particular focus on the North Country and Manchester. Senators Shaheen and Hassan have previously worked to secure robust funding of the program.“I’m thrilled to see these federal funds headed to Campus Compact for New Hampshire to support students through innovative programs that bolster students’ success in the classroom by engaging their families and communities,” said Senator Shaheen. “This investment in Granite State students so early-on – and the partnership of teachers and families each step of the way – will advance critical life skills for students of all ages. I’ll continue to advocate for federal funding to make sure Granite State students have the resources necessary to learn and lead fulfilling lives.” “Robust family engagement programs help our students succeed in the classroom and in every facet of their lives,” said Senator Hassan. “I am glad to announce federal funding to Campus Compact for NH’s program that will use evidence-based practices to support our students in each step of their academic career. I will continue to work to make sure that Granite State students can succeed.”“These federal funds for Campus Compact for New Hampshire will help support students and their families, setting them up for success – whether they are just beginning their education, or pursing education opportunities beyond K-12,” said Representative Kuster. “This is an important investment in Granite State families and the future of our children and young adults, and I look forward to seeing the positive benefits of this program, especially throughout the North Country.”“It’s critical that all Granite State students receive a quality education,” said Representative Pappas. “These federal funds will support students, parents, teachers, and our entire education community to create new, innovative opportunities for future generations. I remain committed to doing all that I can to support educational programs like this one so everyone in New Hampshire has the opportunity to get ahead.”“The New Hampshire Statewide Family Engagement Center is designed to produce results statewide while focusing intensively on moving outcomes in two areas of the state – the North Country and Manchester. This project will create a system of family engagement supports for parents, communities, and stakeholders by proving support to children as they grow, develop, and move through the cradle-to-career continuum,” said Stephanie Lesperance, Chief Strategy Officer at Campus Compact for New Hampshire. “Campus Compact for New Hampshire is looking forward to expanding and deepening our work in the North Country and Manchester while sharing lessons learned across the state.” Senators Shaheen and Hassan have been fierce advocates for students, investing in quality education to prepare them for the 21st century economy and working to ensure they don’t fall behind during the pandemic. Shaheen helps lead the Community College to Career Fund in Higher Education Act (CC2C), which would support innovative partnerships between technical colleges, community colleges and businesses that train students for careers in high-demand fields. The bill would also help businesses fill vacant, good paying positions with qualified candidates. Through her leadership on the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen secured inclusion of language based on her bipartisan Supporting STEM Learning Opportunities Act in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which would invest in experiential learning opportunities to strengthen the pipeline of students entering the STEM workforce, especially from traditionally underrepresented groups like women and communities of color.In addition, Hassan and Shaheen joined colleagues in reintroducing the Jumpstart Our Businesses By Supporting Students (JOBS) Act, bipartisan legislation that would help expand access to more job training programs for students and workers who need additional training, or a leg up in their career, by making high-quality, shorter-term education and training programs eligible for federal Pell Grants. Senator Hassan has successfully worked to increase funding for Parent Information Centers to support families with children with disabilities. Following calls from Senator Hassan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also announced that it is expanding Head Start Program eligibility to help more families in New Hampshire and across the country access affordable, high-quality early education services.### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-welcomes-over-35m-for-nh-clean-energy-programs-through-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-,"** Shaheen and Hassan were part of the bipartisan group of Senators to negotiate the bipartisan infrastructure law. Shaheen pushed the Department of Energy to expand & release funding for the State Energy Program** (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) today welcomed $3,581,770 heading to New Hampshire to expand clean energy programs. The announcement was made by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and will be delivered through the State Energy Program (SEP), with nearly ten times the amount of recent funding levels now available thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law that Senators Shaheen and Hassan helped negotiate. This funding will help New Hampshire develop and implement clean energy projects that create jobs and economic growth while reducing energy costs and carbon emissions.  This announcement follows a letter Shaheen sent in December calling on the Department of Energy to quickly release funding to expand the State Energy Program. “I’m thrilled to see the bipartisan infrastructure law deliver transformative funding to support clean energy projects across New Hampshire. This funding will create good-paying jobs, support local businesses and spur economic growth – all with an eye towards combating the climate crisis. From helping buildings become energy efficient to investing in solar energy and promoting clean energy infrastructure, this $3.5 million investment is critical to our clean energy future,” said Shaheen. “I helped lead negotiations around the bipartisan infrastructure law to deliver a once-in-a-generation investment in clean energy – I’m excited to see this funding making a real difference for communities across the state.” “A clean energy economy is essential to helping lower costs and fight climate change, while also ensuring that we are not dependent on Big Oil or foreign countries,” said Senator Hassan.  “This funding was made possible through the bipartisan infrastructure law, which I was proud to negotiate, and it is an exciting investment in New Hampshire’s economy and clean energy future. I’ll continue working on a bipartisan basis to expand clean energy in the Granite State, lower costs, and protect our environment.”“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law continues to deliver results for our communities – this federal funding to expand clean energy initiatives throughout the Granite State will create jobs and represents an important investment in our economy and efforts to combat climate change,” said Rep. Kuster, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee. “Creating a clean energy future is crucial to addressing the climate crisis, increasing our economic competitiveness, and bolstering our national security by reducing our reliance on foreign energy sources. I was proud to help pass the Inflation Reduction Act earlier this month, which includes historic provisions to address climate change, and I will continue working to support the clean energy economy of the future.”“Investing in clean energy will spur economic growth, create job opportunities, and protect our environment and way of life here in New Hampshire,” said Rep. Pappas. “I fought to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law to fund smart investments like this that will improve our infrastructure while cutting energy costs for Granite State families. I’ll keep fighting to improve our sustainability, support our economy, and invest in our future.”Read more about the Department of Energy’s investment to expand State Clean Energy Programs here.  As a lead negotiator of the bipartisan infrastructure plan, Shaheen helped bolster funding for the State Energy Program. Senator Shaheen led a bipartisan letter to Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm, urging DOE to prioritize the release of funds allocated through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for the State Energy Program and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). That law included a total of $3.5 billion for weatherization. Shaheen has long-championed the WAP program to lower energy costs for low-income families in New Hampshire, as well as the State Energy Program, which assists states with the development of energy efficiency renewable projects.  In the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was signed into law last year, Shaheen successfully included key provisions of her energy efficiency bill – the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (ESIC) – with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH). She also included the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act, the Promoting American Energy Jobs Act and the Heat Efficiency through Applied Technology (HEAT) Act. A targeted version of the ESIC legislation was signed into law by President Obama in 2015, and a number of provisions relating to energy efficiency in schools, industry and the federal government were signed into law as part of the Energy Act of 2020. Senator Hassan has worked to lower energy costs by investing in clean energy in the bipartisan infrastructure law and the recently-passed Inflation Reduction Act. Senator Hassan was one of the negotiators for the bipartisan infrastructure law,  supports domestic battery energy storage development and deployment, technology needed to increase the use of renewable energy sources and eliminate reliability gaps throughout the day. These provisions build on Senator Hassan’s bipartisan Battery Storage Innovation Act – which was signed into law as part of the December government funding package. The Inflation Reduction Act provides a tax cut to help families lower their energy bills by making energy-efficient home upgrades such as updating an HVAC system or even windows or doors. This provision is based on the tax cut in Senators Hassan and Collins’ previously introduced bipartisan bill, the Home Energy Savings Act.### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-applauds-epas-new-designation-of-two-widely-used-pfas-chemicals-as-hazardous-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) today applauded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for taking significant action to protect families and communities from the health risks posed by certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals.”  Specifically, the EPA unveiled its proposal to designate two of the most widely used PFAS substances as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as “Superfund.” If finalized, the rulemaking would trigger reporting of PFOA and PFOS releases, providing the EPA with improved data and the option to require cleanups and recover cleanup costs to protect public health and encourage better waste management.  “Granite Staters know all too well the harmful impacts of PFAS chemicals, which are tied to adverse health effects and environmental pollution. The administration took an important step today toward classifying two of the most widely used and dangerous PFAS chemicals – PFOS and PFOA – as hazardous substances under the Superfund law,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’ve long pushed for this designation to increase transparency and hold polluters accountable, and I’ll keep working to improve our public health response and support Granite Staters affected by PFAS contamination.” This proposal is consistent with the EPA’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap. More details about today’s announcement are available here. Senator Shaheen leads efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites. Shaheen has fought to secure consistent federal support for the PFAS health impact study that she established four years ago. Because of her efforts, Pease is serving as a model site for the nationwide study. As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she successfully secured the authorization of an additional $20 million for the PFAS health impact study in the fiscal year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) approved by the Committee. Shaheen also co-led negotiations around the water infrastructure funding in the bipartisan infrastructure law and helped secure a total of $10 billion to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants, including $5 billion through the small and disadvantaged communities program. Availability of the first year of funding through this program was announced in June. Shaheen has also fought for additional public disclosures of results of drinking and ground water testing, as well as improved guidance for spill prevention and mitigation of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). In the FY2020 NDAA, Shaheen worked to include the bipartisan Safe Drinking Water Assistance Act, which expedites analysis of water contaminants like PFAS, provides support and resources to states dealing with the health challenges posed by these potentially harmful materials and establishes a national strategy to coordinate the federal response to emerging contaminants.  ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-statement-marking-anniversary-of-deadly-attack-on-kabuls-airport-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, released the following statement today marking the one-year anniversary of the Islamic State’s deadly attacks on U.S. troops and Afghan civilians at HKIA airport in Kabul amid U.S. evacuation efforts: “Today, we remember the 13 U.S. troops and 73 Afghans who were brutally murdered, as well as the hundreds injured, when terrorist suicide bombers and gunmen attacked innocent civilians at Kabul’s airport. My heart goes out to all the families and loved ones of those we lost – including eleven U.S. Marines, one Army soldier and one Navy medic,” said Shaheen. “The mass atrocities committed that day did not deter the U.S.’ historic evacuation efforts to help our Afghan allies and families in danger find safety – more than 76,000 Afghans were ultimately evacuated as the U.S. mission in Afghanistan came to a close. Those efforts were made possible by the bravery of the American troops that stood guard in protecting HKIA from terrorists. We also still owe a debt of gratitude to the brave Afghans who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. troops on the battlefield who now face imminent danger under Taliban rule – we cannot abandon them, and I’ll keep fighting to secure a pathway to safety for them.” Senator Shaheen historically partnered with Senator John McCain (R-AZ) on efforts to protect Afghans who’ve risked their lives to support U.S. diplomatic efforts abroad by strengthening the Afghan SIV program. She has led bipartisan efforts in Congress to reauthorize additional Afghan SIVs. In addition, Senator Shaheen supported legislation to establish a nonpartisan, independent commission to examine every aspect of the war in Afghanistan, including the political and strategic decisions that transformed a focused military mission into a vast, nation-building campaign that became the longest war in U.S. history.   ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-announces-5-million-in-federal-funds-headed-to-new-hampshire-to-support-in-home-caregiving-for-seniors-and-individuals-who-experience-disabilities_,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) announced $5 million in federal funds to support seniors and individuals who experience disabilities and their caregivers. The grant was awarded to New Hampshire Health and Human Services’ Money Follows the Person demonstration, which helps transition seniors and individuals who experience disabilities from institutions into home- and community-based settings. “I’m thrilled that New Hampshire was selected as one of five states across the nation to be awarded this critical $5 million award. This funding will help connect Granite Staters with disabilities and seniors with quality care in the comfort of their own home or community,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m committed to ensuring quality, affordable health care is within reach for families across New Hampshire, and I’m eager to see this funding in action.” “As Americans age or experience disabilities, most want to be able to do so surrounded by loved ones, whether at home or in their own community. My family has been fortunate to benefit from home- and community-based care, as my husband and I are caregivers for our adult son who has cerebral palsy,” said Senator Hassan. “These federal dollars headed to New Hampshire will help more seniors and people with disabilities live and age where they choose with dignity. I will continue pushing to invest in caregiving as a profession, which will help the many families who are on waitlists or unable to access the care best suited for their unique situations.” “This funding headed to New Hampshire will provide much-needed resources to expand home and community-based services for Granite State seniors and individuals with disabilities,” said Rep. Kuster, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. “Earlier this week, I saw first-hand the positive impact and importance of these services when I visited Visions for Creative Housing Solutions’ Lebanon location and met with staff and residents. I have been a consistent voice advocating for New Hampshire seniors and vulnerable Granite Staters to have the care they need, and I will continue working to ensure high-quality care is available to those who need it most.” “Every Granite Stater deserves access to quality care in their community but far too often seniors and those living with disabilities struggle to get the long-term care they need,” said Rep. Pappas. “These funds will expand home and community-based services to help our most vulnerable neighbors. I remain committed to expanding access to quality health care so everyone in New Hampshire can get the care they deserve.” Senator Shaheen and Hassan are committed to supporting individuals with disabilities in New Hampshire and across the country. Senator Hassan led efforts to include $12.6 billion in dedicated emergency funding for State Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) in the American Rescue Plan to better assist older Americans and people with disabilities who receive critical health care and support services in their homes. Senators Shaheen and Hassan also recently helped introduce legislation to make a historic investment in home- and community-based services by expanding access to quality home care services and lifting up the caregiving workforce that provides them. Additionally, the Senators previously cosponsored legislation to fully fund the IDEA, and Senator Hassan has reintroduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) to address the critical need for more Direct Support Professionals in the workforce, who provide vital support to individuals who experience disabilities. ### "

This funding for New Hampshire’s Department of Justice is from the Sexual Assault Formula Grant Program (SASP), an OVW grant program that supports rape crisis centers and organizations that provide services, intervention and additional assistance to victims of sexual violence.“Survivors of sexual violence deserve every support possible to find safety, heal from their trauma and lead healthy lives. As chair of the subcommittee that oversees OVW, I’ve long pushed to boost funding and resources to ensure survivors of sexual violence have the support they need – from access to medical care, to crisis intervention, counseling and more. This funding is more vital than ever as the pandemic exacerbated the scourge of sexual assault across the country,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m thrilled to see these federal dollars headed to New Hampshire to help support survivors, and I’ll continue fighting to deliver for Granite Staters.”“Survivors of sexual assault can face immense challenges after their trauma and for years to come, and it is necessary that we provide them with the resources that they need to move forward,” said Senator Hassan. “This funding will help Granite State survivors of sexual assault receive support from trained medical professionals, from counseling to crisis intervention. I will continue to advocate for this type of critical support for survivors of sexual assault.”“This federal funding for direct support and assistance to survivors of sexual violence will help to ensure Granite Staters have crucial resources necessary to heal and move forward,” said Representative Kuster, founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence. “I have been proud to work across the aisle with my Task Force colleagues to identify and implement solutions to prevent sexual violence and assault, as well as support survivors through access to medical care, housing, mental health services, and more.

I remain committed to standing with survivors and working together to end sexual violence.”As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to boost services and programs for survivors of domestic and sexual violence – especially through the pandemic. As a senior appropriator, Shaheen has secured the highest funding level ever for VAWA programs for five consecutive years, and this year’s proposed government funding legislation for fiscal year (FY) 23 includes a 27 percent increase from last year’s funding level that will support training officials, rape prevention programs, processing rape kits, domestic violence hotlines, women’s shelters and transitional housing support services. Shaheen recently celebrated the Senate’s unanimous passage of her bipartisan bill to remove the sunset date for the Pro Bono Work to Empower and Represent (POWER) Act, which was set to expire later this year after being signed into law in 2018. The FY 22 government funding legislation, passed earlier this year, also included a bipartisan bill to modernize and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act by aiding domestic violence prevention and support organizations, protecting survivors and promoting safer communities for women and families.###"

This is $2.2 million more for New Hampshire compared to last year’s funding from the NBRC. Earlier this month, Shaheen announced that she helped secure $40 million for the NBRC in Senate Democrats’ proposal for government funding legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2023 that was recently released by the committee and will next be considered by the full Senate. This marks a $5 million increase above the FY 2022 funding level and the highest the program has ever been funded.  The NBRC provides federal support throughout northern and western New Hampshire through grants that spur economic and community development in rural communities. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress that support and invest in the NBRC, and included her bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and expand the NBRC’s reach in the Farm Bill that was signed into law in 2018. With support from Rep. Annie Kuster (NH-02), the legislation expanded the NBRC to include Cheshire County and communities in Belknap County. Shaheen has also worked to include language to ensure portions of NBRC funds be directed to assist rural communities affected by past mill closures, as well as support new markets and the infrastructure needs of the forest products industry. Shaheen previously led a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers, including the NH Congressional Delegation, calling for the inclusion of dedicated funding for the NBRC in COVID-19 relief legislation. Language Shaheen secured in the FY2022 funding bill provided $4 million for the NBRC to address the needs of rural communities impacted by forest product plant closures. The bipartisan infrastructure bill that Shaheen and Hassan helped negotiate and that was signed into law last year also provided a direct appropriation of $150 million to the NBRC to remain available until expended. Shaheen and Hassan have also introduced legislation to reauthorize the NBRC for 10 years and expand its programs to allow for investments in childcare, health care and affordable housing. “The Northern Border Regional Commission is a vital engine of economic growth in rural communities across New Hampshire. That’s why I’m thrilled to announce record funding for the NBRC this year, which will further empower the North Country with the tools to thrive. From supporting local businesses to boosting local tourism opportunities and expanding access to high-speed internet, these projects will make a real difference in the livelihoods of Granite Staters,” said Senator Shaheen. “Ensuring resources are delivered for the NBRC to continue its important work has always been a top priority for me, and this year was no exception – I’m excited to see these projects soon take off.” “New Hampshire’s border and rural communities are vital to our state’s economic success and way of life,” said Senator Hassan. “I’m proud to have helped secure funds from the Northern Border Regional Commission to address the unique needs of rural New Hampshire. These funds will help develop new trails and outdoor recreation opportunities, secure high-speed internet access for families and small businesses, update our water infrastructure, and bolster economic and workforce opportunities. I will keep working to secure federal resources that help rural New Hampshire communities grow and thrive.”“The Northern Border Regional Commission creates opportunities for robust investments in our communities and has been instrumental in spurring economic development in the North Country and throughout rural regions of our state,” said Rep. Kuster. “I’m thrilled that the NBRC grants we are announcing today include the most funding New Hampshire has ever received through this vital program. This ground-breaking funding heading to our region will fund more than a dozen projects to bolster our local economies through workforce development, increasing tourism opportunities, and more. I will continue supporting the NBRC and working to ensure our rural New Hampshire communities have the resources they need to thrive.”“These critical funds will have far-reaching effects across so many communities in New Hampshire,” said Rep. Pappas. “From supporting our small businesses to investing in water infrastructure, these awards will spur economic growth and improve quality of life for Granite Staters.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-applauds-bidens-announcement-of-3-billion-aid-package-for-ukraine-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation and a senior member on the Senate Armed Serves Committee, released the following statement applauding the Biden administration for announcing a $3 billion security package from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s further invasion: “This $3 billion announcement marks the single largest U.S. security aid package to Ukraine since Russia’s unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine, which began exactly six months ago. This aid is particularly important amid Russia’s escalating strikes on civilian populations and infrastructure across Ukraine – especially this week as we celebrate Ukraine’s independence. Russian forces must be held accountable for their war crimes, and Ukraine deserves every resource necessary to defend its territory and protect its citizens,” said Shaheen. “This new assistance package demonstrates U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s long-term security by investing in capabilities to bolster Ukraine’s defense posture for years to come. The equipment included in this package, and the associated training of Ukrainian forces, will facilitate the continued strengthening of the Ukrainian military as they defend themselves from Putin’s aggression. The administration made clear today that the U.S.’ continued support for Ukraine is unwavering, and we’ll continue to stand firm against Putin’s tyranny.” Also a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence. She released a statement ahead of today’s anniversary of Ukraine’s independence and the six-month mark of Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine. In July, Senator Shaheen and Senator Romney introduced legislation that would require an interagency strategy toward the Black Sea region, which includes Ukraine. In March, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Shaheen that would ensure the U.S. undertakes coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed by Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Recently, legislation co-led by Shaheen to speed up military assistance to Ukraine and Eastern European nations was signed into law. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Shaheen and Portman led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration. Before the Shaheen-Portman congressional delegation visit to Ukraine in January, Shaheen led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, last June.  ### "

The unshakable resolve of Ukrainians to safeguard their independence and preserve their democratic future is admirable – this Independence Day should be a day of pride for Ukrainians around the world,” said Shaheen. “The Ukrainian people have inspired countless Americans with their resilient and determined spirit, and the U.S. proudly supports Ukrainians in the fight for their freedom amid Putin’s campaign of terror. Russia continues to escalate indiscriminate attacks on civilian towns and populations, exacerbating the humanitarian crises they have wrought – crimes for which Russian forces must be held accountable. Ukraine is on the frontlines of protecting not just their own sovereignty, but all liberal democracies around the world. The U.S. must continue to lead the international response to assist Ukraine’s fierce opposition to Putin’s tyranny. Today and always, Slava Ukraini.” Senator Shaheen has led action in the Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Putin’s belligerence.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-joins-over-100-senate-and-house-lawmakers-in-calling-on-biden-administration-to-extend-pslf-waiver-deadline-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen joined a group of lawmakers from the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in urging U.S. Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to extend the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, when the Department’s proposed rules to improve and expand federal student debt relief programs, including PSLF, are currently on track to take effect. Extending the waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the historic waiver that has already resulted in over $9 billion in forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its proposed PSLF rule. The letter was led by U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).“The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’ the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan,’” wrote the lawmakers to Secretary Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.” The lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF. “For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs,” added the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.” The lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.  “[W]e also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers. The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). Shaheen has been a strong advocate to provide public servants with the federal support that they deserve. Last year, Shaheen joined a bicameral push in calling on the Biden administration to strengthen the PSLF program and to ensure that America’s teachers, social workers, public defenders, service members and community health care workers, along with many other public servants, receive the student loan forgiveness that they have earned. Shaheen was also a supporter of the What You Can Do for Your Country Act of 2019, which would have overhauled the PSLF program in order to better ensure that public servants will qualify for loan forgiveness.  Find a copy of the letter HERE. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-kuster-pappas-join-members-of-congress-in-amicus-brief-to-oppose-weakening-of-nondiscrimination-laws-303-creative-llc-v-elenis,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) alongside Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01), Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus and New Hampshire’s first openly gay member of Congress, filed an amicus brief to defend nondiscrimination laws in the upcoming Supreme Court case, 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis.The brief was joined by 123 Representatives and 14 Senators. Although this case is a challenge to a Colorado nondiscrimination law, it potentially could be used to weaken federal nondiscrimination laws covering public accommodations – including race, religion, color, national origin and disability – more generally by providing a constitutional right to discriminate in certain instances against LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized groups.“Nondiscrimination laws are at the heart of our ability to live freely and enjoy fundamental civil liberties. We’ve seen a devastating wave of attacks on civil liberties as of late, and this case poses the latest threat by opening the door to enabling discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals as a constitutional right. This case runs counter to our core values of freedom and equality, which is why I’m joining my colleagues in this amicus brief to protect nondiscrimination laws under assault. I’ll continue to stand with LGBTQ+ individuals as we work to build a more just society,” said Senator Shaheen.“Hate and discrimination have no place in our communities, but it’s a reality far too many marginalized groups including LGBTQ+ people face,” said Representative Kuster. “Businesses that are open to the public should not be permitted to discriminate against people, no matter who they are or who they love. I was proud to help pass the Equality Act in the House and I will continue working to protect the rights of all Americans.”“I know as a small business owner that when you open your doors to the public you must treat everyone fairly and equally,” said Representative Pappas, Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. “This case threatens the freedom and dignity that all Americans deserve, including LGBTQ+ individuals who still can face discrimination today in far too many aspects of their lives. I urge the Court to reject this argument, uphold this nondiscrimination law, and ensure everyone is equal before the law.” 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis was filed by a Colorado-based graphic designer who wants to make wedding websites in the future but does not want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples. Colorado law currently prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations. The Colorado law does not dictate what services a business provides but rather requires that a service offered to the general public be offered to all prospective customers without discriminating based on protected characteristics such as race, religion, or sexual orientation. The graphic designer is arguing that this law violates her First Amendment rights and that she should be able to discriminate. A broad ruling for the graphic designer could not only provide a constitutional basis for discriminating against same-sex couples, but also for discriminating against all marginalized people currently protected by public accommodations nondiscrimination laws.Shaheen has long supported protections for LGBTQ+ couples and their families. Shaheen supports the Equality Act, which is the landmark bill banning discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans. In July, Shaheen joined a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough urging answers and speedy action to ensure same-sex veteran couples have access to the full and complete spousal benefits they are owed. Shaheen also introduced a bill - the Jury Access for Capable Citizens and Equality in Service Selection (ACCESS) Act – to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ citizens during the federal jury selection process. Shaheen also led bipartisan legislation to impose sanctions on foreign individuals responsible for human rights violations against LGBTQ+ individuals abroad.Pappas serves as Co-Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Co-Chair of the House Small Business Caucus, and is New Hampshire’s first openly gay member of Congress. In his role as Co-Chair of the Equality Caucus, he has helped introduce and pass the Equality Act and the Respect for Marriage Act in the House of Representatives. Pappas also leads the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act, which would ban the use of so-called  “gay panic” and “trans panic” defenses in federal court, and the SERVE Act, which would guarantee and protect VA benefits for LGBTQ+ veterans. In the 116th Congress, Pappas introduced the Put Patients First Act, which would have blocked a since-reversed Trump-Pence Administration rule that permitted discrimination in health care by allowing personal beliefs to dictate treatment and care. ###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-touts-key-health-care-investments-from-the-inflation-reduction-act-coming-to-nh,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) today highlighted important ways the Inflation Reduction Act lowers health care costs for Granite Staters. These measures will cap prescription costs, reduce health insurance premiums, tackle surging insulin costs and expand access to health care for thousands of Granite Staters.   “Our health care system has long needed reform, with surging costs putting quality health care out of reach for Granite Staters. This new law is one of the most important pieces of legislation in modern history to tackle sky-high prescription costs and help working families afford health care. From empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices to capping the cost of insulin for Medicare patients and expanding assistance for low-income patients, this law will make a real difference and save Americans billions of dollars,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m particularly proud that provisions I led to make ACA premiums more affordable are now law, which will help keep costs low and extend coverage to thousands more Granite Staters. This law is a game-changer and takes historic action to improve access and affordability of health care services for Granite State families. While this is an important achievement, the insulin provisions included in this bill don’t go far enough to cover the full scope of pricing challenges, which is why I’ll continue to push Congress to pass my bipartisan legislation, the INSULIN Act.” “Skyrocketing prescription drug costs have devastated families’ budgets and jeopardized their health for too long,” said Senator Hassan. “I am proud to have worked with my colleagues to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which takes on Big Pharma to lower health care costs for Granite Staters. Most important, it finally allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which I have been pushing for because we know that it will bring down drug costs significantly across the board and save taxpayer dollars. I look forward to seeing all the ways that the Inflation Reduction Act will address long-standing challenges and lead to lower costs for Granite Staters.”“As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am focused on expanding access to high-quality health care services for Granite Staters and lowering prescription costs,” said Rep. Kuster. “I was proud to help get the Inflation Reduction Act over the finish line and deliver real results for New Hampshire. This legislation takes historic steps to improve our health care system and lower costs, helps ensure seniors can afford their prescriptions, and cracks down on price gouging at the pharmacy counter. I will continue working to build on this progress and ensure no Granite Stater has to choose between the health care they need and other essentials.”“Granite Staters need relief from the skyrocketing costs of everyday necessities, including prescription drugs and health insurance,” said Rep. Pappas. “The Inflation Reduction Act will help New Hampshire families by finally negotiating cheaper drug prices and capping costs for seniors on Medicare. Thousands of Granite Staters will also see lower premiums as they shop for coverage, and I’ll keep fighting to ensure everyone can access affordable care.”Big health care wins from the Inflation Reduction Act heading to New Hampshire include:  Reduced Prescription Drug Costs: Capped Insulin Co-Pays at $35/Month on Medicare: Expanded Health Care Coverage & Lowered Costs for Thousands More Granite Staters:  You can read more on the health care cost benefits coming to the Granite State through the Inflation Reduction Act here.   ###  "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/senate-passes-shaheen-sullivan-bill-to-support-victims-of-violence-by-making-the-power-act-permanent-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) celebrated the Senate’s unanimous passage of their bipartisan bill to remove the sunset date for the Pro Bono Work to Empower and Represent (POWER) Act, which was set to expire later this year after being signed into law in 2018.  The POWER Act helps combat domestic violence and sexual assault across the country by holding summits that encourage lawyers to offer pro bono legal services to survivors of these crimes. In 2021, the POWER Act resulted in 73 pro bono legal summits across the nation, reaching more than 11,000 attorneys.  “I’m thrilled the Senate advanced this critical legislation, which is a victory for survivors bravely seeking justice. This bill extends authorization of a pivotal program that incentivizes lawyers to provide pro bono legal services to survivors of domestic and sexual violence. As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees funding for the Office on Violence Against Women, I’ve long prioritized measures like this that support those who’ve endured sexual violence and trauma,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m glad to work with Senator Sullivan and this bipartisan group of lawmakers to deliver this legislation through the Senate, and I urge the House to move swiftly so we can ensure there is no gap in access to services for those who need it.” “Studies have shown, without legal representation, survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault have less of a chance of securing a protective order and escaping the cycle of violence,” said Senator Sullivan. “Many lawyers are more than willing to donate some of their time and knowledge to help vulnerable survivors navigate the complex legal system. The key is letting attorneys know about the significant need that exists and how they can get involved. This was the motivation behind my 2018 POWER Act—a continuation at the national level of our efforts in Alaska with the Choose Respect initiative. In the years since the POWER Act became law, we’ve amassed an army of thousands of lawyers who are lifting women and children out of horrible situations. But the epidemic of domestic violence and sexual assault has not stopped—and neither will we. Thanks to my colleagues’ support in the Senate, we’re going to continue to grow this army of lawyers, and bring hope and healing to many more victims and survivors across the country and in our great state.” The POWER Act requires the administrative office of the federal judiciary to submit a compilation and summary of reports received from the chief district judges detailing each public event conducted in the previous fiscal year.  Background on the POWER Act: As Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee which funds programs in the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to boost services and programs for survivors of domestic and sexual violence – especially through the pandemic. As a senior appropriator, Shaheen has secured the highest funding level ever for VAWA programs for five consecutive years. The FY 2022 government funding legislation also included a bipartisan bill to modernize and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act by aiding domestic violence prevention and support organizations, protecting survivors and promoting safer communities for women and families. Last year, she reintroduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Grassley (R-IA) to build on her legislation that is now law, the Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act, by incentivizing states to pass legislation that guarantees the survivors rights included in the federal legislation. She also introduced bill to reauthorize legislation to expand pro bono legal resources for victims and survivors.  ###  "

The funding comes through a congressionally directed spending (CDS) request that Shaheen secured through the fiscal year (FY) 2022 omnibus package that passed earlier this year. This funding will support renovations to the second floor of ACHS’ Whitefield location. The renovated space will expand patient access to substance use disorder, behavioral health, nutrition, and patient navigational services. “It’s great to see these federal funds headed to Ammonoosuc Community Health Services to support expansion efforts at their facility. Improving access to patient services is an essential step to ensure Granite Staters throughout the North Country can receive the mental and physical health care they need,” said Shaheen. “I’ll continue to advocate for federal funds to expand access to primary health care and critical treatments for Granite Staters.”“We’re thrilled to see this funding heading to ACHS to renovate our space and improve access to essential services for patients. This investment will further integrate primary care and public health activities while improving energy efficiency in our facility. We’re grateful to Senator Shaheen for helping secure this funding for this local initiative to ensure quality conditions that are vital to patients’ health, including access to food, housing and economic security,” said Edward D. Shanshala II, Chief Executive Officer of Ammonoosuc Community Health Services.As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen secured $69,047,000 for projects across New Hampshire through the CDS process in FY22 legislation that was signed into law. Shaheen recently announced more than $89 million in CDS awards that she secured in Senate Democrats’ FY23 government funding proposal for 95 New Hampshire projects, including water infrastructure, health care facility investments, educational training, resources to combat homelessness and food insecurity, support for substance use disorder programs and much more.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-statement-after-senate-republicans-block-vote-to-codify-roe-into-federal-law-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) released the following statement after Senate Republicans blocked a vote to begin consideration of the Women’s Health Protection Act, landmark legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. Earlier today, Shaheen delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging her fellow Senators to vote in favor of codifying Roe.“Every Senate Republican just made clear they don’t trust women to make decisions about their own health and bodies. With the Supreme Court poised to strike down Roe, Senate Republicans are helping lay the groundwork to move our country backwards and condemn the futures of millions of women. Let’s be clear: this decision won’t end abortions, it will only make them dangerous and difficult for vulnerable women,” said Senator Shaheen. “Roe v. Wade is one of the most important decisions of our lifetime, and codifying it is essential to protect women’s reproductive freedom and autonomy. Like women across the nation, I was outraged by the draft opinion leaked from the Supreme Court indicating that my granddaughters and millions of women in the United States may soon live in a world without Roe. Now is the time for us to stand up and make clear that politicians have no place interfering in the most intimate, private decisions a woman can make. The eyes of history are watching as fundamental rights hang in the balance for generations of women to come.”Shaheen is an unrelenting advocate for women’s reproductive rights. On Monday, she and the delegation held a press conference with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England to discuss what’s at stake for women’s reproductive health in New Hampshire if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. For years, Shaheen has fought to expand coverage of women’s preventative care, including through her legislation to reduce the cost of contraception for servicewomen and dependents in military families. In March, she joined HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in Manchester for a meeting with New Hampshire family planning providers amid continued attacks from State and congressional Republicans, including the abortion ban and costly, unnecessary ultrasound mandate signed into law. She’s also led the delegation in pushing for Title X funding, and in January, she applauded a $500,000 Title X Dire Need Grant award through HHS for PPNNE.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/nh-delegation-discusses-protection-of-reproduction-rights-with-planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-england-during-press-conference,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and U.S. Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) today held a press conference with Executive Councilor Cinde Warmington and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE) in Concord to discuss what’s at stake for women’s reproductive health in New Hampshire if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. The delegation responded to last week’s draft opinion from the Supreme Court and discussed the need to preserve women’s access to essential health care and family planning services. “I remember what it was like before Roe – I knew women who sought back-alley abortions and put their lives in danger. It’s chilling that we are now on the cusp of seeing these hard-fought rights rolled back and losing what generations of women worked to secure. We may soon see women across the country – particularly low-income women and women of color – bear the brunt of the devastating consequences if Roe is overturned,” said Senator Shaheen. “Today and every day, I’m incredibly proud to stand with Planned Parenthood and abortion providers across the state to defend reproductive freedom for Granite Staters. New Hampshire Republicans are attacking women’s health and reproductive rights by imposing an abortion ban and costly, unnecessary ultrasounds, with doctors even facing jail-time for helping women access abortion. These grave violations of women’s privacy and health have no place in the Granite State. In New Hampshire, we support women. We trust women. And we will fight for them – both at the ballot box this November and beyond.”""For the last 50 years, Roe has protected a woman’s right to access a safe and legal abortion -- giving her the ability to decide if and when to start a family, and protecting a woman’s health, safety, and economic freedom. At the same time, partisan politicians have, for 50 years, chipped away at the rights protected by Roe -- marginalizing women, interfering with their privacy, and putting government in the way of the most incredibly personal decision that a woman can make. The Supreme Court ruling – if it moves forward – would be the culmination of those attacks,” said Senator Hassan. “We can’t go backward and we must continue raising our voices and laying out the facts of what exactly is at stake.”“Decisions about when and how to start a family should be between patients and their doctors, not the government,” said Rep. Kuster. “Sadly, the draft opinion from the Supreme Court makes clear the conservative majority's intention to take personal medical decisions out of the hands of women even in the most extreme and sensitive cases like rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. As an adoption attorney for 25 years, I worked with hundreds of birth mothers, helping them make the most personal and private decisions of their lives — not one of them turned to the government to make that choice for them. Granite Staters overwhelmingly oppose overturning Roe v. Wade and they believe its near 50-year precedent securing the constitutional right to abortion should be protected. New Hampshire is a pro-choice state, and I stand resolute in my commitment to protecting the right to abortion and defending the rights of women to make their own reproductive choices.”“Overturning Roe has been a stated goal of Republicans in Washington for decades. And as the Court considers this decision we know Republican lawmakers are strategizing around how to enact a national abortion ban and state laws that would go as far as to ban contraception and criminalize all abortion, even in cases of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, moving us toward a situation where there would be government mandated pregnancy in America. We will not allow this to happen,” said Rep. Pappas. “If the Supreme Court won’t defend reproductive freedom, then we must answer the call of the vast majority of Americans who support the right to choose and pass legislation in Congress to codify Roe v. Wade.” ""We talk about freedom, but freedom for women starts with being able to make our own health care decisions. The ability to plan, prevent, and space our pregnancies is critical to making healthy moms, healthy babies, and healthy families. Those freedoms are in jeopardy – and we need courageous leaders who will put our communities first,” said Executive Councilor Cinde Warmington. “We all need to find our voice. We all need to speak. We must fight to protect our fundamental rights here in New Hampshire. No matter what happens nationally, we will fight to make sure our freedom to make reproductive health“We are at a crisis moment for abortion access and we don’t have a moment to spare. At Planned Parenthood, we know that banning abortion does not take away people’s need to access abortion care. Patients who need abortion should not face the shame and overwhelming hurdles that will ultimately come from this decision. From the ballot box to the halls of the State House to our health centers, we will do everything we can to help those patients get abortion care safely - no matter what,” said Sara Persechino, Campaigns and Communications Director of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.The New Hampshire Congressional delegation members are unrelenting advocates for women’s reproductive rights. In March, Shaheen, Hassan and Pappas joined U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra in Manchester for a meeting with New Hampshire family planning providers amid continued attacks from State and Congressional Republicans, including the abortion ban and costly, unnecessary ultrasound mandate signed into law.

As a lead negotiator, Senator Shaheen worked with Senator Collins (R-ME) to create the ACP, which builds on the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program by investing $14.2 billion to help working and low-income families access affordable high-speed internet.Under the ACP, an eligible household that signs up for the program will receive a discount of up to $30/month on any internet service plan a participating provider offers. Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced commitments from 20 internet providers to cut prices and increase speeds for millions of households enrolled in ACP. The companies include some of the largest providers – like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast – as well as smaller providers serving specific regions and rural communities. Together, these companies cover 80% of the U.S. population across urban, suburban and rural areas.“The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare longstanding issues rural New Hampshire communities and low-income families have faced in obtaining affordable, reliable and high-speed internet access. From school to work to medical appointments, Granite Staters rely on high speed internet to go about their daily lives. Unfortunately, those who can’t afford internet access have been left behind. I was proud to lead negotiations on broadband provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and take what I’ve heard from impacted Granite Staters to get to the source of the problem,” said Shaheen. “This announcement is a big deal and will ensure all households, no matter the income, can afford access to reliable internet. I’m excited for our residents who at long last will gain access to affordable broadband in their homes to ensure they can stay connected, whether that’s with family across the country or their doctor on the other side of town.”As a lead negotiator of the historic bipartisan infrastructure deal, Shaheen led bipartisan broadband negotiations with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and successfully secured $65 billion to support broadband affordability and deployment across the nation. In February, as chair of the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations subcommittee, Shaheen welcomed Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to testify on the broadband provisions included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, and to address other priorities related to the Department of Commerce’s jurisdiction. During the hearing, Shaheen questioned Secretary Raimondo about anticipated timing for the rollout of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maps that will determine how much funding states are allocated for broadband investments.  Shaheen recently joined fellow lawmakers in encouraging the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to quickly implement the bipartisan infrastructure law. ###"

This landmark conservation legislation provides funding to state wildlife agencies, ramping up to $1.3 billion per year, to fully implement their State Wildlife Action Plans to address critical fish and wildlife conservation needs.“New Hampshire’s landscapes and wildlife are integral to local ecosystems and draw outdoors enthusiasts from around the world. Conserving these national treasures must be a top priority – particularly amid rapidly evolving climate change that’s upending ecosystems. State fish and wildlife agencies need robust resources to carry out that mission and protect priority species, which is exactly what this bipartisan bill provides,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m proud to join this landmark conservation legislation to proactively conserve habitats and support healthy fish and wildlife populations. I hope the bipartisan momentum behind this bill continues so we can get this across the finish line.”Specifically, the bill includes provisions intended to:Since introduction, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act has gained significant momentum with 34 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and is backed by over 60 Tribes and 1,500 organizations representing state fish and wildlife agencies, sportsmen and women, conservation groups, and industry associations and businesses. The bill was passed out of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works last month.Shaheen has led efforts to safeguard our natural environment. She urged the Biden administration to repeal an order and policy changes made in the final hours of the Trump presidency that would have hurt conservation efforts in New Hampshire. She also fought to secure full funding and permanent authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which has helped protect more than 2.5 million acres of land and supported tens of thousands of state and local outdoor recreation projects throughout the nation.###"

Ambassador Bridget Brink is extremely qualified to fill this urgently needed role to ensure that U.S. support from the State Department is coordinated as part of a whole-of-government response to Russia’s campaign of violence,” said Shaheen. “With her extensive experience from serving in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs at the State Department, to her current position as U.S. Ambassador to the Slovak Republic as part of more than twenty years in the Foreign Service, Bridget is the right person for the job. In too many cases, the Senate has been encumbered with political grandstanding that’s held up qualified nominees from being confirmed in pivotal locations around the world – we cannot let that happen now. I urge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate leadership to move swiftly on Ambassador Brink’s nomination, and for lawmakers to act in good faith without political games that delay the confirmation process. There is no time to waste.”Shaheen, a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, leads action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies. Shaheen recently led a bipartisan congressional delegation with Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) to the Balkans to convey continued U.S. support for its allies amid Russian aggression against Ukraine and the implications for European security in the region. In addition, legislation co-led by Shaheen to speed up military assistance to Ukraine and Eastern European nations cleared Congress and will soon be signed into law. In April, Shaheen and members of the Senate Ukraine Caucus met with Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, and members of the Ukrainian Parliament.

https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-leads-nh-delegation-in-welcoming-600k-to-compensate-nh-fishermen-impacted-by-atlantic-herring-fishery-disaster-,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and U.S. Representatives Annie Kuster (NH-02) and Chris Pappas (NH-01) welcomed $603,820 to support New Hampshire fishermen impacted by the 2019 Atlantic herring fishery disaster. Shaheen led the delegation in a letter to former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in 2020 requesting a disaster declaration for the Atlantic herring fishery, to help combat serious economic hardship experienced by the fishing industry due to declining Atlantic herring stock and lower quotas. The funding comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). “I’m glad to see over $600,000 in disaster funding available to support our fishermen who’ve been hard hit by the alarming decline in Atlantic herring. This crisis has devastated our fishing industry, particularly since Atlantic herring are used as bait for lobster and tuna fishing industries. This disaster assistance will help our fishing industry stay afloat,” said Senator Shaheen. “New Hampshire’s fishermen are critical to the Seacoast’s economy, and I’ll continue to work with NOAA and local officials to ensure our fishermen have the economic tools they need to stay in business.”“New Hampshire’s fisheries are an integral part of our economy and our way of life, particularly on our Seacoast,” said Senator Hassan. “Unfortunately, fishery disasters, including the 2019 Atlantic herring fishing disaster, have impacted supply and caused economic losses in our fishing industry. The funding announced today will provide vital support to New Hampshire’s fishermen and give them important relief.”“New Hampshire fisheries play a major role in our local food chains and state economy, but climate change poses a continued threat to the industry,” said Rep. Kuster. “It’s critically important that we support our Granite State fishermen and fisheries from the impact and turbulence of global warming. I am pleased to see this much-needed funding heading to New Hampshire to compensate our fishing industry for the 2019 Atlantic herring fishery disaster, and I will continue working to bolster our state’s resiliency against climate change.” “New Hampshire’s seacoast is a vital part of our community and regional economy,” said Rep. Pappas. “The drastic reduction of herring supply that we have seen has had far-reaching effects, impacting our local fisheries, lobstermen, and restaurant industries. I fought hard to declare this a federal disaster so that our fishermen could access the critical funds needed to bounce back from these disruptions, and I’m pleased to see additional grants coming to our state to do just that.”Shaheen has been a strong advocate for New Hampshire fishermen. As the Chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, Shaheen has repeatedly prevented the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from imposing the costly at-sea monitoring fee on Granite State fishermen and once again secured necessary funding to prevent the burden from being imposed on fishermen. Shaheen has also repeatedly secured funding for Northeast groundfish research and lobster research. Two years ago, Shaheen announced nearly $6 million in COVID-19 financial relief for New Hampshire fisheries that she helped secure as part of the CARES Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Shaheen also secured $6 million for Coast Guard fishing safety training and research grants.###"

This legislation would ensure the U.S. undertakes coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“A month and a half into Russia’s bloody invasion in Ukraine, alarming reports of war crimes and grave human rights violations continue to mount. Putin must be held to account for these gross atrocities – to do so, the U.S. must contribute to efforts to collect and review evidence to properly assess the human toll of this war,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’m proud to help introduce bipartisan legislation to ensure our government collects evidence of Russian war crimes that will be needed to prosecute these crimes. Meticulously documenting Russia’s hateful violence now will help deter Russian troops from committing future war crimes. This legislation sends an unwavering bipartisan message from the Senate that the U.S. will demand accountability for growing human rights violations committed across Ukraine’s communities.”The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act would issue a statement of policy and require a report to Congress within 90 days to ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect, analyze and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine as defined in the U.S. Code, and to deter further criminal acts by making Russian commanders, troops and leaders aware of efforts to collect evidence and identify those committing these atrocities. The bill focuses on the collection and maintenance of evidence and does not specify any specific prosecution venue in which such evidence may be used.The bill is also cosponsored by U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rick Scott (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Angus King (I-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Gary Peters (D-MI), John Boozman (R-AR) and Tim Kaine (D-VA).The House version of this legislation passed the House Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously and was adopted by the full House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 418-7 on April 6, 2022.Senator Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies.

During National Small Business Week, I’m thrilled to help draw attention to the important role that these businesses play throughout the Granite State,” said Shaheen. “Especially as our small businesses focus on recovery efforts from the effects of the pandemic, coupled with financial strains exacerbated by supply chain delays and workforce challenges, showing our support is more important than ever. I’ll continue to advocate on behalf of our small business community and keep working across the aisle to advance legislation to help them succeed and grow.”On Friday, Shaheen hosted Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman at Uni-Cast, a Londonderry aluminum investment casting manufacturer, to discuss the role of Granite State manufacturing, supply chain challenges amid the pandemic, workforce needs and federal assistance for small businesses.Senator Shaheen worked to provide small businesses with the resources they need to weather and recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shaheen helped lead negotiations on provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to assist small businesses, which established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and expanded the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, both of which were lifelines for businesses throughout New Hampshire and the country. More than 41,000 New Hampshire small businesses and non-profits, including Uni-Cast, received over $3.7 billion in PPP assistance, following Shaheen’s successful push to extend the deadline to apply for federal funding through PPP.  In the COVID-19 relief signed into law in December 2020, Shaheen helped secure $20 billion for the EIDL emergency grant program and $3.5 billion to extend the Debt Relief Program established under the CARES Act, which covers payment of principal, interest and fees on all pre-existing and new SBA-backed loans.A list of the SBA’s 2022 New Hampshire Small Business Week Award winners is available here.###"

There are drop off locations across New Hampshire for Drug Take Back Day on Saturday, April 30, where the public can drop off old and unused prescription drugs to safely dispose them. Individuals can find the nearest drop off location on the DEA’s website.   “Turning the tide on the substance use disorder epidemic demands an all-hands-on-deck approach. On Drug Take Back Day, we’re reminded of the role we can all play in that effort,” said Shaheen. “The COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly devastating impact on those struggling with addiction, as we witnessed one public health crisis exacerbate another. Emptying our medicine cabinets and responsibly and safely disposing of old or expired medication is a critical way that we can prevent potentially harmful medication from falling into the wrong hands, which can either spur or continue substance misuse. I encourage Granite Staters to find disposal sites in their cities and towns, and to urge friends and neighbors to join them. Together, we can help prevent misuse, support those on the road to recovery and fight to end this scourge once and for all.”"

Seeing this terrorist – and the other terrorists culpable in the kidnapping and murder of Americans, including New Hampshire’s James Foley – face the full weight of the U.S. justice system sends a message to those who target or threaten Americans at home or abroad that they will pay for their crimes. Most importantly, it responds to the wishes of family members, who for years advocated on behalf of their loved ones. Today, my thoughts are with them – the Foleys, Kassigs, Sotloffs and Muellers,” said Shaheen. “I’ve long worked with the Foley family, especially James’ mother Diane, to seek justice for him. I’m in awe of her strength to see this process  through to the very end. I’ll continue to stand beside her in that effort, and I’ll keep working with all of the impacted families as the other terrorists are similarly held accountable. I will continue to raise the cases of other Americans detained abroad, and fight day and night to bring them home.”Shaheen has worked closely with the family of James Foley, an American journalist and Granite Stater who was viciously murdered by ISIS jihadists. Shaheen has fought to ensure that ISIS terrorists culpable in Foley’s murder, as well as other U.S. citizens, are brought to trial in the United States. Shaheen has led calls for this on behalf of the family members of James Foley, Peter Kassig, Steven Sotloff and Kayla Mueller, four Americans killed at the hands of ISIS jihadists.Shaheen successfully included language in the fiscal year (FY) 2020 defense authorization legislation to establish a senior coordinator position within the Executive Branch for all ISIS detainee issues. This position will lead all diplomatic engagements and planning regarding the future of ISIS detainees. In 2018, Senator Shaheen visited northeast Syria to view the detention facilities housing ISIS terrorists. The creation of this role was originally a recommendation of the Syria Study Group’s (SSG) interim report. The final report was released in 2019. Shaheen established the Syria Study Group in the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that was signed into law in 2018.

During the visit, Shaheen and Guzman toured the facility and met with personnel. “Uni-Cast is a family-owned and operated New Hampshire small business, and a key example of how Granite State manufacturing plays a crucial role in our local economy, while helping to advance our national priorities. Its aluminum castings are sought after by aerospace and defense firms, which strengthens New Hampshire’s prized manufacturing reputation in support of our national defense. I’m glad Administrator Guzman was in New Hampshire to learn about the important work that Uni-Cast does, how it generates jobs right here in our community, but also so she could hear first-hand about the challenges we’re experiencing from supply chain issues, workforce obstacles and continued recovery needs as a result of the pandemic,” said Senator Shaheen. “As Americans face difficult financial obstacles due to Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine, and from the economic fallout spurred by the pandemic, every effort must be made to assist manufacturers like Uni-Cast. As a negotiator of the small business provisions in the CARES Act, as well as significant portions of the infrastructure bill, I know there is common ground in Congress to be found on the most pressing economic concerns facing our nation. I look forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and with Administrator Guzman, to that end.”“Small manufacturing businesses are on the rise, making products in local communities that are purchased and put to use across the nation and the world. It was a pleasure to join Senator Shaheen today and visit Uni-Cast, a small manufacturer making a big impact on their local economy. And thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law - which Senator Shaheen helped negotiate and get across the finish line - there are more opportunities on the horizon for manufacturers and other small businesses in New Hampshire and across the country.

It will now be sent to the President’s desk to be signed into law.“Every lever must be pulled to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s campaign of terror, which is slaughtering innocent civilians and reaping destruction across Ukraine. I’m encouraged to see the number of bipartisan bills clearing Congress to that end, which now includes my legislation with Senator Cornyn to expedite the process of moving military equipment to the frontlines,” said Senator Shaheen. “I’ll continue to work across the aisle in support of our Ukrainian partners and to hold the Kremlin accountable for its crimes against Ukraine. The U.S. must continue to lead the global response to assist Ukraine and in fierce opposition to Putin’s tyranny, which is targeting Ukraine today and continues to pose a threat to liberal democracies around the world.”“Ukrainian forces have demonstrated unbelievable strength and bravery, and we must again serve as the arsenal of democracy and ensure they have the full range of resources necessary to defend their sovereignty,” said Senator Cornyn. “This legislation will be a game-changer for Ukraine, and I’m grateful to my House colleagues for recognizing its importance and quickly sending it to the President’s desk.”“Democracy and the sovereignty of an independent nation are at risk as Ukraine does all it can to fend off the unprovoked and deadly assault from Russia,” said Senator Cardin. “As the United States continues to support Ukrainian defenses, I’m proud of the bipartisan, bicameral support our bill received to streamline the president’s ability to further bolster Ukraine’s defenses, defend innocent civilians and protect our frontline NATO allies who may be Putin’s next targets. Ukraine must prevail against this horrific Russian aggression.”“We should be doing everything possible to assist our courageous friends in Ukraine, especially as Russia launches a new phase of attacks,” said Senator Wicker. “Enhancing our ability to loan and lease military equipment to Ukraine is essential to helping Ukraine fight back. I am glad to see the House recognize how important this measure is. Congress has done its job, and I urge President Biden to sign this bill immediately.”As part of the Arms Export Control Act authority, the President can currently lend and lease defense articles to U.S. partners and allies when it is in the United States’ national security interest. However, bureaucratic barriers and other limitations make these authorities impractical for the current crisis facing Ukraine. This enhanced lend-lease authority would be specific to Ukraine and Eastern European countries to help remove obstacles to lending arms. It would not create a new program, but would streamline the President’s current authority to lend the defense articles needed by Ukraine and Eastern European countries and expedite the delivery of defense articles to Ukraine. This enhanced authority would remain in effect through fiscal year 2023.Senator Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies.

We are proud this tree from the oldest native species of our great state has a home here in Washington.”Commemorative trees on the Capitol grounds, including state trees, honor various aspects of American history. Because the climate in Washington, D.C. is not suitable to the longevity of the White Birch, New Hampshire’s official state tree, a Black Gum tree was chosen to dedicate as New Hampshire’s commemorative tree on the Capitol grounds.

She also thanked the Department for holding accountable the ISIS ‘Beatle’ terrorists, including El Shafee Elsheikh, who murdered four Americans – Granite Stater James Foley, as well Kayla Mueller, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig.Shaheen began her questioning by asking AG Garland about interagency efforts and international cooperation to counter Russian kleptocracy, which is financing Russia’s war on Ukraine. Shaheen asked for details around progress made by Task Force KleptoCapture, which launched last month to enforce sanctions and countermeasures imposed by the U.S. and our allies in response to Russia’s sweeping war. Garland discussed the close coordination with international partners to prosecute violations of sanctions and seize assets belonging to sanctioned individuals.Shaheen also asked the Attorney General to detail the ramifications of delays in approving nominees for U.S. Attorneys and Marshalls, particularly in regards to combating local crime. Shaheen noted that the confirmation of the nominee for U.S. Attorney of New Hampshire, Jane Young, has been held for over a year, and asked if additional resources are needed to speed the confirmation process. Since U.S. Attorneys and Marshalls are at the tip of the sphere in combating crime and convening local task forces to identify drivers of crime and solutions, our ability to fight violent crime and cybercrime is deeply limited with these lingering vacancies.During her second line of questioning, Shaheen asked Garland about delays at the Bureau of Justice Statistics in compiling data on police suicides at federal, state and local levels. She pointed to high profile police suicides in New Hampshire and noted she hopes to see resources and directives previously provided to the Bureau implemented. In addition, Shaheen pressed for insights around the Department’s strategy to combat fentanyl overdoses, particularly in light of the National Drug Control Strategy released by the Biden administration last week.Shaheen’s first round of questioning on Russian kleptocracy and confirming key officials to combat local crime is available here. Shaheen’s second round of questioning on law enforcement suicides and fentanyl overdoses is available here.As Chair of the CJS Subcommittee, Shaheen helped write the government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2022 that was recently signed into law. She included and supported numerous measures that invest in important New Hampshire and national priorities, and delivered urgently needed military assistance to Ukraine as Russia continues its unprovoked, premediated war. Senator Shaheen led action on items to address the substance use disorder crisis, provide record-level funding for Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) programs – as well as successfully pushing for reauthorization of VAWA, ending three years of Republican obstruction – and significant federal resources for scientific research opportunities, which are championed by Granite State academic institutions.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-scott-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-increase-transparency-around-us-investments-in-china,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committees, and U.S. Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) introduced the Protecting American Capital Act, a bipartisan bill to require the Treasury to annually report to Congress on the United States’ financial exposure to China. Companies based in China often benefit from American capital, while providing little to no financial reporting to foreign countries to validate their domestic economic claims. This lack of reliable data around investments limits the U.S.’ ability to assess the larger financial and national security risks imposed by China. This bipartisan bill responds to a bipartisan and unanimous recommendation by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.“As China intensifies aggression and economic manipulation of markets, tracking how U.S. dollars flow into China is critical to our national security. It’s alarming how little financial data and reporting requirements are currently in place to validate domestic economic claims made by China,” said Senator Shaheen. “That’s why I’m introducing this bipartisan bill to improve transparency measures and address significant investment risks posed by unchecked American capital in China. Ensuring accountability around U.S. investments that benefit China is critical to bolster U.S. economic and national security.”“Communist China cares about one thing: exploiting Americans to drive up profits and further its mission of world domination. I continue to strongly advocate for all American investors and business leaders to cut ties with Communist China, and forcing transparency to expose both financial and national security risks is absolutely necessary to achieve this. We cannot allow Communist China to lie, cheat and steal any longer. I thank Senator Jeanne Shaheen for cosponsoring this legislation and urge our colleagues to join us in advancing this critical bill,” said Senator ScottFull text of the bill is available here.Shaheen is a leader in the Senate in the push against an increasingly competitive and aggressive China. In June, the Senate passed the watershed bill, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and will soon conference with the House on final bill text. This legislation would bolster U.S. competitiveness over China by investing in innovative education, good-paying jobs and cutting-edge industries to increase American competitiveness and safeguard our national security against China. Shaheen has worked to include provisions that would increase U.S. exports to support developing nations, add defense attachés in the Indo-Pacific region to enhance U.S. diplomatic capabilities and reaffirm the urgency for the U.S. to confirm qualified ambassadors to key parts of the world to counter Chinese influence.Shaheen also introduced the Transatlantic Telecommunication Security Act (TTSA), which would strengthen European telecommunications infrastructure and counter China’s influence by helping key allies in the region build 5G networks. As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, Shaheen has also long advocated for serious investments in scientific and technology innovation to protect the U.S.’s global leadership and national security against China.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-murphy-and-tillis-conclude-bipartisan-codel-to-serbia-bosnia-herzegovina-kosovo_belgium,"   (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrapped up a bipartisan congressional delegation trip with Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) to the Western Balkans and Brussels. During their visit, the Senators met with members of the respective countries’ governments, members of civil society and members of the press to address numerous issues, including support for the region amid Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, anti-corruption efforts, democratic reforms, youth engagement, safeguarding freedom of the press and more. “Reaffirming U.S. support for the Western Balkans has never been more important than amid Russia’s indiscriminate war on Ukraine, which carries significant implications for the security and prosperity of Europe. I’m pleased our delegation sent an unwavering, bipartisan message to our partners that we stand with Western Balkan nations during this pivotal moment in history, and we support their continued path towards democracy and stronger Euro-Atlantic ties,” said Senator Shaheen. “During each stop, we met with government and civil society leaders to reiterate the importance of strengthening institutions and rooting out corruption, particularly amid Putin’s belligerence that threatens the stability of the broader region. I was also pleased to meet with youth leaders in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are recipients of critical U.S. funding to build a brighter, more democratic and prosperous future for their countries. Closing the trip with a visit to Brussels, we reiterated our commitment to bolstering U.S. coordination with our European partners to ensure the security and prosperity of democracies across the globe. I appreciate Senators Murphy and Tillis for their partnership this trip, and I will continue to support democratic reforms and prosperity for the Western Balkans.”“Our bipartisan delegation to the Balkans sent a strong, simple message: the time is now for the world’s democracies to stand united against Putin’s war in Ukraine. If Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are serious about European integration, joining the United States and Europe in our sanctions against Russia and advancing democratic reforms are important steps toward that goal. We also emphasized the importance of advancing the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue through the EU-facilitated talks. The world may not be focused on the Balkans right now, but as Putin gets backed into a corner in Ukraine, he will look to other countries to score a victory. That’s why maintaining peace in the Balkans is so critical to European security and why I was glad to return to the region to reconnect with leaders and strengthen the long-standing ties between our countries. During this precarious moment, NATO has never been more vital, and we concluded our trip in Brussels to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to our transatlantic allies,” said Senator Murphy. “Last week, I was proud to visit Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Belgium with Senators Shaheen and Murphy and deepen existing cooperation with our partners as Russia continues its illegal war against Ukraine and threatens our NATO allies,” said Senator Tillis. “The Balkans region is critical to Europe’s security, and as co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, we made it clear that the United States is committed to Europe’s sovereignty during these uncertain times. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from leaders of these countries and relay to our colleagues in Congress the importance of supporting our partners.”The Senators kicked off their trip in Serbia, where they encouraged Serbia to continue its transatlantic journey toward E.U. membership amid Russian aggression against Ukraine. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Senators met with government officials and leaders to discuss the deteriorating political situation and press for election reform ahead of their October elections. They also attended a Youth Engagement Reception with young leaders eager to build a better future for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Kosovo, the Senators discussed securing peace, prosperity and independence for the nation, and visited Camp Liya, which houses Afghan refugees. The delegation concluded their trip with a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels to encourage NATO allies to prioritize peace and stability in the Western Balkans and reaffirm support for a strong and robust NATO amid Russia’s aggression.Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Europe and NATO allies. She has led two bipartisan delegations to Ukraine in the last year, and in February participated in a congressional delegation to Poland. Shaheen and Tillis are co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, which they re-established in 2018.###"

LIHEAP is an important program that helps lower heating and cooling costs so families aren’t forced to face an impossible decision between paying for these expenses or paying for food or medicine,” said Senator Shaheen. “As a senior appropriator who helped write the funding bill and led negotiations around the infrastructure law and the COVID relief bills, delivering LIHEAP assistance to lower energy expenses was a top priority. I’m proud to deliver historic funding around home energy assistance for the Granite State, and I’m glad to see these funds out the door.” “As Granite Staters continue to face high energy prices, we must keep working to lower costs in any way that we can,” Senator Hassan said. “This federal funding will help Granite Staters reduce their home energy expenses, including by helping households invest in renewable energy. This funding builds on my bipartisan work to help homeowners lower their monthly energy bill by making energy efficient upgrades, and I will keep working across the aisle on commonsense solutions to bring down energy costs.”“This additional Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding will go a long way to ensure Granite State families can afford their energy costs without having to sacrifice other essentials,” said Representative Kuster. “I was proud to help expand LIHEAP resources in Congress and I will continue working to support those most in need across New Hampshire.”“No one should have to choose between paying their heating and cooling bills or putting food on the table,” said Representative Chris Pappas. “I fought hard to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law to deliver resources like this and am pleased to see additional funding being delivered to New Hampshire. I remain committed to do all that we can to lower energy costs for families.”  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has prioritized ensuring Granite State families and seniors have access to heating and energy assistance. Senator Shaheen worked to secure over $3.2 billion for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) in the FY22 government funding legislation that was signed into law in March. New Hampshire has already received record LIHEAP funding this winter to assist Granite State families with home heating bills, efficiency upgrades and emergency situations. In addition to the $900 million in LIHEAP funds allocated through the CARES Act in 2020, Shaheen and Hassan worked to secure $4.5 billion for LIHEAP in the American Rescue Plan that was signed into law in March 2021 and provided $35,498,757 to New Hampshire. In October, Shaheen and Hassan sent a bipartisan letter that successfully pushed the Biden administration to swiftly release LIHEAP funding, including $25,192,436 for New Hampshire, under the temporary government funding measure ahead of the winter season.   Senator Hassan is working to lower energy costs for Granite Staters, including by pushing for a suspension of the federal gas tax for the rest of the year and successfully calling on the Biden administration to release more barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Senator Hassan also successfully worked to strengthen energy efficiency programs in the bipartisan infrastructure law. The bipartisan package supports domestic battery energy storage development and deployment, technology needed to increase the use of renewable energy sources and eliminate reliability gaps throughout the day. These provisions build on Senator Hassan’s bipartisan Battery Storage Innovation Act – which was signed into law as part of the December government funding package. Senator Hassan also introduced bipartisan legislation to lower energy costs for families by expanding and extending tax credits for energy efficient home upgrades. Senator Hassan has also continued to advocate for strong weatherization program funding for New Hampshire."

Particularly as Russian forces bear down in communities across Ukraine with horrifying violence, having an Ambassador placed is essential to coordinate key military and humanitarian assistance and help our partners defend themselves. I’ve continuously raised the need for this post to be filled with State Department officials – I’m pleased to see my calls answered today,” said Shaheen. “Brink will play a critical role in this pivotal moment to hold Russia accountable and empower Ukraine to defend itself as we coordinate a united response with our European allies. I look forward to her nomination being swiftly considered and confirmed by this Senate. I would like to also express my appreciation to the Chargé D’Affaires, Kristina Kvien, who has admirably served in this role since May 2019 during an extraordinary time in U.S.-Ukraine relations.”Shaheen, a member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies. Last week, Shaheen led a bipartisan congressional delegation with Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) to the Balkans to convey continued U.S. support for its allies amid Russian aggression against Ukraine and the implications for European security in the region.

Earlier this month, the Senators sent a letter to the President, encouraging him to appoint a Ukraine Security Assistance Coordinator to help synchronize efforts within the U.S. government and to improve response time in sending aid to Europe amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.“Streamlined logistics and swift delivery of weapons are critical in war, which is why appointing a Ukraine Security Assistance Coordinator is fundamental to our ongoing effort to supply Ukraine with the military assistance it needs to hold off Putin’s forces. Every moment matters for the Ukrainian armed forces, so I appreciate the President’s attention to my bipartisan call with Senators Portman, Durbin and Wicker to designate this urgently needed position. Furthermore, I am encouraged by the message this designation sends regarding U.S. leadership to organize security assistance efforts with respect to our NATO allies, who continue to provide vast amounts of security assistance to Ukraine. Supplying military assistance to Ukraine has been and must remain a national security priority, so ensuring clear communication and swift delivery is fundamental to that mission,” said Shaheen.“I’m pleased that the White House has listened to bipartisan calls and is appointing a Ukraine Security Assistance Coordinator to help us expedite military assistance to Ukraine. While Ukraine has taken important steps to regain control of their country, the fight is not over – Russia’s renewed offensive continues to represent an existential threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence, and it is essential the U.S. is able to move quickly to cut the red tape, synchronize our efforts across the interagency, and provide Ukraine with the tools necessary to win this war,” said Portman. “Together with Senators Shaheen, Wicker, and Durbin, I called on the Biden administration to bring on a Coordinator to do just this and I am glad that the administration has headed that call. As the U.S. continues to send a historic amount of assistance to our ally Ukraine, we’ve seen the importance of doing so in a swift and decisive manner and this move today with allow us to do just that.”Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies.

This generational investment for the state will create hundreds of new jobs and ensure the Granite State remains at the forefront of our national security for decades.

In September, Shaheen welcomed news that $25.5 billion through the PRF and American Rescue Plan (ARP) rural distribution would open after she and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) discovered 25% of allocated PRF funding was unspent and led the push to quickly rectify it. Shaheen also fought to secure a set-aside for rural providers during ARP negotiations. Earlier this year, Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation to support overwhelmed providers by delaying complex PRF reporting requirements until after the end of the public health emergency, and extending the use of PRF dollars to enhance workplace safety.“After working across bipartisan lines to bolster the PRF to deliver much-needed resources to overwhelmed health care providers, I’m thrilled to see this funding continue to reach providers across New Hampshire. The PRF has been a lifeline for hospitals and providers during the pandemic who’ve struggled to hire additional help and ramp up operations to meet the unprecedented demand for their services,” said Senator Shaheen. “This $12.4 million award is one of the most substantial rounds of PRF funding New Hampshire has received to date and will alleviate the pressure facing a dozen Granite State providers. I’ll keep working to ensure our health care providers have what they need as we work our way out of this pandemic.”“Granite Staters rely on their local providers for high-quality medical care, which is why it’s important that we continue to provide support to these centers and ensure that they can continue to deliver care,” said Senator Hassan. “This federal funding will help providers in our state deliver vital health services to Granite Staters, and I will continue to work to secure federal funding that will help shore up our medical system.”“The Provider Relief Fund (PRF) continues to be a lifeline to Granite State health care providers who experienced revenue losses due to COVID-19 and are still working to overcome pandemic-related expenses and challenges,” said Rep. Kuster.  “I am thrilled to see these resources be distributed to our providers to ensure they can serve their communities and deliver life-saving care to patients throughout New Hampshire. As our state and our country rebound from this crisis, I am proud to advocate for our doctors, nurses, and health care workers.”“These federal funds will fill critical gaps in providers' budgets caused by lost revenue and increased costs associated with the pandemic, which is essential so they can continue to keep our communities safe and healthy,” said Rep. Chris Pappas. “I’ll keep fighting for New Hampshire’s health providers to receive the resources they need to continue providing life-saving care to all our communities as we recover.”“Dartmouth Health has been at the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic for more than two years. Funding from the Provider Relief Fund, which takes into account lost revenue and increased costs directly related to COVID has been critical to ensure we can continue to provide high-quality care in our communities. We thank Senator Shaheen for her ongoing support of the healthcare delivery system in New Hampshire,” said Joanne M. Conroy, MD, CEO and President of Dartmouth Health.In December, the delegation welcomed more than $41 million through the PRF to support 262 health care providers that have experienced revenue losses and expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February, they also welcomed an additional $11 million to 25 New Hampshire providers through the PRF as part of a $2 billion distribution nationwide. Last month, an additional $3,208,705 was ushered in through the PRF to support 24 New Hampshire health care providers.During negotiations with the Senate and White House on the American Rescue Plan, Shaheen helped steer efforts to increase funding for the Provider Relief Fund to ensure hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers on the frontlines have the support they need to keep their doors open and continue to care patients. Shaheen also defended the Provider Relief Fund from being considered as a pay-for amid negotiations on the historic bipartisan infrastructure legislation that recently was signed into law. She also wrote an op-ed on her efforts to bolster the Provider Relief Fund as a lifeline for providers in the Concord Monitor."
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-portman-wicker-durbin-urge-president-biden-to-appoint-a-ukraine-security-assistance-coordinator,"(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) – a senior member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees – sent a letter with U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Roger Wicker (R-MS) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) to President Joe Biden, urging him to appoint a Ukraine Security Assistance Coordinator. In light of the ongoing fighting in Ukraine as the United States continues to send an historic amount of aid to assist Ukraine in their defense, the Senators believe a coordinator would help synchronize efforts within our government and improve our response time in sending aid to Europe.“Even after their initial defeat, Russia’s ongoing military operations are an urgent call to re-assess how the United States can quickly and creatively provide Ukraine with the defense articles it needs to defend itself. The Ukraine Security Assistance Coordinator’s primary mission would be to lead the interagency effort in assessing Ukraine’s defense needs while de-conflicting overlapping areas of jurisdiction between the Department of State and the Department of Defense. This person would also serve as the chief liaison between the United States Government and our allies and partners abroad in matters relating to the transfer of existing stocks and assessment of partner capabilities, such as aircraft, heavy tanks, and sophisticated weapons that could be made available to Ukraine,” wrote the Senators.The full letter can be read here Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies. Last week, legislation co-led by Shaheen to speed up military assistance to Ukraine and Eastern European nations cleared the Senate. Last month, Shaheen and members of the Senate Ukraine Caucus met with Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, and members of the Ukrainian Parliament. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Portman to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Shaheen and Portman led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, she supported the inclusion of $13.6 billion in security assistance that was part of government funding legislation signed into law by President Biden.Senator Shaheen has long led efforts in the Senate to hold Russia accountable for its malign activity against the U.S. and its allies. Because of her role as a negotiator on Russia sanctions legislation known as “CAATSA” and her successful efforts to ban Kaspersky Lab software from operating on U.S. systems, Shaheen was sanctioned by the Kremlin in 2017. Before the Shaheen-Portman congressional delegation visit to Ukraine in January, Shaheen led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, last June."
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-visits-keene-state-college-following-successful-push-to-secure-1m-to-expand-child-care-availability-in-the-monadnock-region,"**Shaheen & Kuster Meet with Families Flourish Northeast to Discuss $500K Project Made Possible Through CDS Request**(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) visited Keene State College (KSC) today following her successful effort to secure $1 million through the government funding package for KSC to bolster training for child care workers, including training and professional development for current workers. The Monadnock United Way will partner with KSC on this project to improve retention of employees in the field and expand child care availability in the region.“Shortages in the child care industry reached a crisis level during the pandemic, straining parents who needed to return to work, hurting child care workers overwhelmed by the demand and impacting businesses whose employees relied on child care to remain in the workforce. It’s clear we must invest in training and professional development to grow our child care workforce and strengthen our state’s child care industry,” said Shaheen. “That’s why I fought to secure $1 million for Keene State College through the government funding bill to retain current child care workers and train new students for the industry. This money will make a real difference in supporting this essential field while expanding access to quality child care across the region.”As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen helped secure $68,797,000 for projects across New Hampshire through Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) requests. Shaheen also worked to include more than $17 billion for key federal child care and early learning programs. The bill includes $6.2 billion for Child Care and Development Block Grants to states, an increase of $254 million over last year’s funding levels, as well as a nearly $289 million increase to Head Start, funding the program at $11 billion for FY 2022. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress to assist the child care sector, which has been among the hardest hit during the pandemic. In the emergency COVID-19 relief legislation that was signed into law in December 2020 and the American Rescue Plan, Shaheen successfully included language that provided $50 billion in urgently needed relief for child care providers. Specifically, New Hampshire has received more than $77 million in supplemental child care funding through the American Rescue Plan. This afternoon, Senator Shaheen and Representative Annie Kuster (NH-02) met with board members of Families Flourish Northeast and hospital administrators at the Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital to discuss $500,000 the lawmakers secured through the government funding package. This award will help Families Flourish Northeast establish a residential substance use treatment program for pregnant and parenting women and their children. This funding will help combat the substance use disorder crisis in the Upper Valley and beyond.“The substance use disorder crisis has created trauma and heartache for families across New Hampshire, particularly during the pandemic as rates of substance misuse skyrocketed. Expanding access to substance use treatment programs for parenting women and their children helps keep families together on the path to recovery,” said Shaheen. “As a senior appropriator who helped write the funding bill, I fought to deliver resources to Granite State organizations who are on the frontlines delivering treatments for addiction. I appreciate Congresswoman Kuster’s partnership to secure this $500,000 award for Families Flourish, and I hope this program helps mothers and families find the support they need to heal.”“No mother should have to choose between recovering from addiction or being an active parent for their child – Families Flourish is working to ensure no Granite Stater faces that choice,” said Rep. Annie Kuster, founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force. “I was proud to work with Senator Shaheen to secure $500,000 in federal funding for this program to equip New Hampshire mothers and families struggling with substance use disorder with the support they need to recover and thrive. I will continue working in Congress and with local partners to address the addiction epidemic and expand access to treatment.”“Congresswoman Kuster and Senator Shaheen both included Families Flourish in their requests for congressionally directed spending for community projects. As a result of their advocacy, Families Flourish will receive $500,000 to establish a residential treatment program for pregnant and parenting women experiencing substance use disorders in the Upper Valley,” said Courtney Tanner, Families Flourish Board Chair. “While we have quite a bit of work ahead of us, this funding secured by Rep. Kuster and Sen. Shaheen brings us one step closer to operationalizing a residential treatment program for women who are desperate for an opportunity to get help, all while also trying to be a present and loving mom.”As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Shaheen has fought to deliver resources to combat the substance use disorder crisis in New Hampshire. For example, the FY 2021 funding legislation provided $1.5 billion in State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding, as well as the continuation of a 15 percent set-aside that Shaheen fought to secure in 2018 for hard-hit states like New Hampshire. Shaheen also included a key provision from the 2019 version of her legislation - the Turn the Tide Act - to provide flexibility for treatment providers to use State Opioid Response (SOR) grant dollars to help patients suffering from meth and cocaine dependency, in addition to opioid use disorders. Shaheen wrote the provision in response to discussions with New Hampshire treatment providers. Over the past four years, New Hampshire has received approximately $92 million from these grants to combat the opioid epidemic in the state. In FY 2022 government funding legislation, Shaheen secured $572.5 million to help communities and first responders respond to substance use crises, including opioid addiction and drug trafficking. This also includes $415 million for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) grants, which support programs like drug, mental health and veteran treatment courts and substance use disorder treatment programs administered by state and local correctional facilities. Last year, Senator Shaheen helped introduce the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery (CARA) Act 3.0 to help combat the opioid epidemic by increasing the funding authorization levels for these programs. Shaheen also secured funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) anti-heroin task force and anti-methamphetamine task force programs.   Rep. Annie Kuster is a leading voice in Congress to address the addiction and mental health crisis. A senior member of the influential Energy and Commerce Committee and co-founder of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force, Kuster has championed legislation to bolster our national response to the substance use and mental health epidemic. Earlier this month, she helped advance five pieces of legislation included in the Task Force’s 2021 Legislative Agenda to reduce demand, hold illicit distributors accountable, and turn the tide on this crisis.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/key-provisions-of-shaheen-portman-energy-efficiency-legislation-move-ahead-with-implementation-of-bipartisan-infrastructure-law,"Over the years, Shaheen and Portman worked together to pursue different legislative avenues to secure key components of their energy efficiency legislation, which have since become law.(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rob Portman (R-OH) issued the following statements in response to the Department of Energy’s announcement that the administration is seeking a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit feedback from stakeholders and to inform implementation of a Shaheen-Portman provision included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which will provide $225 million to help states and localities implement updated building codes. Shaheen and Portman’s building codes provision will spur robust energy savings for years to come and help develop the next generation workforce in communities throughout the nation. Shaheen and Portman helped negotiate the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which was signed into law in November.This Shaheen-Portman provision is a key component of the Senators’ legislation, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (ESIC), which is hallmark energy efficiency legislation that the Senators have championed for years. A targeted version of their bill was signed into law by President Obama in 2015, and a number of provisions relating to energy efficiency in schools, industry and the federal government were signed into law as part of the Energy Act of 2020.“It’s exciting to see these important provisions to achieve our energy efficiency aspirations being implemented, and that we’ll soon see the results in our communities from New Hampshire to Ohio and around the nation,” said Shaheen. “Energy efficiency improvements can lower utility bills, create jobs and help to stabilize energy price volatility, which is especially critical today. The Department of Energy’s announcement is a great opportunity for stakeholders to play a role in designing this program to update our building codes to be more energy efficient, and is a signal that the program is quickly getting off the ground. I appreciate Senator Portman’s partnership over the years to get this legislation over the finish line. It’s wonderful to see major components of our bill come to fruition, supporting our workforce and environment, and benefiting our communities tremendously in energy savings.”“I am proud that the common-sense energy efficiency measures I crafted with Senator Shaheen are finally going into effect thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law. This funding will help implement updated building codes all over the country to help lower energy costs for families and businesses while creating jobs for our economy,” said Senator Portman. “Senator Shaheen has been a valuable partner over the years in working to enact important energy efficiency policies and it has been great to see our hard work pay off. I’ve always believed we need a balanced approach to protecting our environment and reducing emissions, while also safeguarding our economy and jobs, and I’m proud that we are now putting these policies into action.”The ESIC Act will improve energy efficiency in three key sectors – buildings, industrial and the federal government. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), residential and commercial buildings accounted for about 40 percent of total U.S. energy consumption in 2018. In addition, reports from the U.S. Department of Energy have found that the federal government is the largest single energy consumer in the country. By improving energy efficiency in these three key sectors, policy experts at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) found that when fully enacted, the ESIC Act through 2050 would save consumers more than $51 billion on their energy bills and reduce carbon emissions by 1.3 billion tons, which is the equivalent of taking nearly 280 million cars off the road for one year. A previous study from ACEEE also estimated that their legislation would add more than 100,000 jobs to the economy.   In addition to provisions from ESIC, the bipartisan infrastructure law also includes the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act, legislation introduced by Shaheen and Portman that will help manufacturers improve energy efficiency, create jobs and secure a more competitive position in the marketplace. By 2040, an estimate from ACEEE determined the legislation would save consumers $5 billion in energy costs and reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 116 million cars off the road. The bipartisan infrastructure law also included Shaheen and Portman’s Promoting American Energy Jobs Act as well as Shaheen’s Heat Efficiency through Applied Technology (HEAT) Act. Together, these bills will promote innovation, energy efficiency and economic competitiveness of American manufacturers and support the energy workforce. Shaheen added these provisions when the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources voted to advance the Energy Infrastructure Act in July 2021. "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-joins-call-on-biden-administration-to-make-urgent-investments-in-child-care,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) joined Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tina Smith (D-MN) in a bicameral letter to President Joe Biden urging his administration to address the ongoing child care crisis and realize his vision for a better America by investing in the child care sector. The lawmakers called for urgent passage of President Biden’s plan to reduce child care costs for families, expand pre-K opportunities for 3 and 4-year-olds and invest in the early childhood workforce and its infrastructure.“Addressing our nation’s child care crisis remains essential to boosting labor force participation among mothers, helping lower everyday expenses for families and child care providers who are facing higher costs due to inflation, and ensuring all children access the benefits of quality child care that support positive physical and brain development,” wrote the lawmakers. “As you know, the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care are challenges facing too many families across the country.”The lawmakers continued: “Now is the time to make additional comprehensive, long-term investments in affordable, high-quality child care to build on the critical but largely short-term investments made through the American Rescue Plan. It is clear that child care and early learning investments are an integral part of our nation’s strategy for supporting a robust economy, lowering costs for families, and ensuring the long-term success of our children. With your leadership and support, we are ready to make these investments a reality.”Through her leadership on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has been a champion for funding to support child care and early education in the Senate. In the funding legislation for fiscal year (FY) 2022 signed into law last month, Shaheen worked to include more than $17 billion for key federal child care and early learning programs. The bill includes $6.2 billion for Child Care and Development Block Grants to states, an increase of $254 million over last year’s funding levels, as well as a nearly $289 million increase to Head Start, funding the program at $11 billion for FY 2022. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress to assist the child care sector, which has been among the hardest hit the pandemic.

Senators Shaheen and Hassan worked with their colleagues to establish the 9-8-8 hotline and subsequently pushed to secure funding for it in the latest government funding legislation.“Far too many Granite Staters have experienced mental health challenges during the pandemic, which have been exacerbated by the crisis and put lives in danger. That’s why it’s critical that we ensure life-saving support is within reach for every household – establishing 9-8-8 as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is key to meeting that goal and to improving our public health response,” said Senator Shaheen. “This $338,000 award will make a difference in expanding the capacity and quality of these hotline services. I’m proud to have worked on the legislation that made this hotline possible, and I’ll continue to prioritize policies that strengthen this lifeline and our mental health support system.”“It’s clear that we need more mental health support in the state, which is something that young people often bring up with me,” Senator Hassan said. “I worked with my colleagues to establish this hotline to help people who are struggling more easily connect with a professional who can help. Switching New Hampshire from a 10-digit suicide hotline to a three-digit hotline, which also includes text and chat services, will help ensure that more people can use this critical resource in their time of need. I will continue working to secure additional resources to help bring down youth suicide rates and expand access to important mental health services for Granite Staters.”“Granite Staters and Americans across the country — especially children and young adults — are facing mental health challenges at an alarming rate, and we must do more to expand prevention efforts and access to treatment,” said Representative Annie Kuster, founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force. “Once it is launched with the help of this federal funding, New Hampshire’s new three-digit suicide hotline will make it easier for Granite Staters who are struggling to connect with someone who can help. The 9-8-8 hotline will also provide crucial chat and text services, making it far more accessible to those in need. I will continue working to ensure our state has the funding and resources necessary to provide mental health support and save lives.”“After the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health is something we are all thinking more about, especially as it concerns our kids. It’s been two years of loss, isolation, and pain and that doesn't just go away,” said Representative Chris Pappas. “These federal funds will strengthen New Hampshire’s mental health hotline, and I’ll keep fighting for investments like these that will improve our communities’ ability to provide care and support to all.”New Hampshire’s 9-8-8 Suicide Prevention Hotline is set to launch this July through the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, and will include both text and chat services. The state is also expected to set up mobile crisis units at community mental health centers that can be deployed to respond to 9-8-8 calls that require an immediate response.This funding through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation announced today will go toward hiring a Crisis Center Coordinator to help ensure that the state has a unified and uniform response to calls. The federal funding will also help New Hampshire expand staffing and infrastructure to ensure that the text and chat functionality is successfully implemented, as well help ensure that the 9-8-8 hotline is accessible to diverse populations, including non-English speakers and deaf and hard of hearing individuals.###"

Noyes Building in Lancaster to Tour Renovations & Downtown Revitalization Efforts**(Berlin, NH) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) today visited the Coos County Family Health Services (CCFHS) dental clinic on the heels of her successful effort to secure $1.5 million through the government funding package to renovate a building in downtown Berlin to expand their safety net dental clinic. Shaheen toured the current clinic and participated in a roundtable discussion with health care stakeholders on dental needs of the region.“Eliminating health care disparities in rural areas continues to be a top priority for me, and this $1.5 million award I helped secure for Coos County Family Health Services will make important progress on that front. Expanding its dental clinic in Berlin will ensure quality dental services are more accessible for local residents,” said Shaheen. “I enjoyed meeting with local health care stakeholders today to discuss how this funding will be used, and I’ll continue to use my role as a senior appropriator to ensure the North Country has the resources it needs to keep our communities healthy.”As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen secured funding for a range of local projects in New Hampshire through the Congressionally Directed Spending process, which allows the federal government to invest in policies and programs that provide assistance to Granite State communities and help move our nation forward. In total, Shaheen helped secure $68,797,000 for projects across New Hampshire through congressionally directed spending allocations. Later in the afternoon, Shaheen also toured recent renovations of the historic Parker J. Noyes building in Lancaster, which were partially funded through the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC). The 100-year upgrade will create spaces for apartments and Taproot Farm & Environmental Education Center, a nonprofit that helps increase food security and sustainability.“I’m thoroughly impressed by the newly renovated space at the Parker J. Noyes building, which was made possible in part by funds I worked to secure for the NBRC. The preservation of this historic building will help revitalize Lancaster’s Main Street and bring new economic development,” said Shaheen. “I’m excited to see much needed housing and new businesses centered on food security move to the area thanks to these renovations. The NBRC has long driven economic development across the Northern Forest region, and I’ll keep supporting their work to help our northern rural communities thrive.”The NBRC helps address community and economic development needs throughout the Northern Forest region. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress to support and invest in the NBRC, including her successful push to secure $35 million – the highest the program has ever been funded – for the NBRC in the FY 22 spending legislation. The bipartisan infrastructure bill that Shaheen helped negotiate and that was signed into law last year provided a direct appropriation of $150 million to the NBRC to remain available until expended. Earlier this year, Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation to extend the authorization of the NBRC and broaden the Commission’s ability to award grants to projects that expand rural access to child care, health care and affordable housing needs.###"

As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen fought to secure $2 million for CMC and Saint Anselm College to renovate a 13,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art health care simulation lab in the fiscal year (FY) 2022 funding legislation that was signed into law in March. Shaheen successfully secured an additional $500,000 to improve emergency services in the CMC Emergency Department Behavioral Health Annex. During her visit, Shaheen toured the current simulation lab and learned more about CMC’s plans to upgrade the facility with their new funds.  “I enjoyed meeting with CMC and St. A’s today to discuss the innovative health care training that will soon be available to Granite Staters through this $2 million award I secured. This expanded training space will equip CMC Staff and nursing students in New Hampshire with the best education possible through hands-on learning and cutting-edge equipment,” said Shaheen. “As a senior member of the Senate committee that drafted the funding package, I prioritized securing funding to expand access to quality health care and invest in the next generation of health care leaders.” Earlier this morning, Shaheen participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions (CAES) Inc. in Exeter to celebrate the opening of their new 3-D lab. This lab will support CAES’ partnership with SWISSto12, a provider of 3-D printed technology for radio frequency applications in the aerospace and defense industry by helping to address next-generation design challenges for aerospace and defense platforms.  “I was thrilled to join the ribbon cutting ceremony at CAES to celebrate their new 3-D additive manufacturing lab. This cutting-edge technology will help this Exeter facility produce advanced electronics for space systems – which not only strengthen our national security but also help track weather systems to improve agriculture and commerce,” said Shaheen. “I’m excited to see CAES grow its capacity so it can continue to be a hub of innovation and science. I’ll continue supporting CAES’ work to develop and manufacture advanced systems for New Hampshire and the nation.” As a senior appropriator, Shaheen secured funding for a range of local projects in New Hampshire through the CDS process, which allows the federal government to invest in policies and programs that provide assistance to Granite State communities and help move our nation forward. In total, Shaheen helped secure $69,047,000 for projects across New Hampshire through congressionally directed spending allocations. ### "
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/senator-shaheen-hassan-join-push-to-make-naloxone-available-over-the-counter,"**Letters to Seven Major Manufacturers of Naloxone Come as the U.S. Experienced More than 100,000 Overdose Deaths in a Single Year**(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) joined U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Senator Angus King (I-ME), and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) along with a bicameral, bipartisan group of colleagues in urging seven major manufacturers of naloxone – the opioid overdose reversal medication – to apply for over-the-counter (OTC) status for their products to help increase access and save lives. Despite the effectiveness of naloxone to reverse active opioid overdoses and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) public support for making the product available over the counter, the medication is not currently available over the counter because drug manufacturers have resisted applying. This step is expected to lower the cost of the medication and increase access both at the pharmacy counter and for community organizations working to distribute this life-saving tool.“One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay,” wrote the members of Congress. “Further, a formal switch to OTC status will help reduce stigma and encourage the widespread use of this critical medication.”The members continued, “Now the responsibility lies with manufacturers to submit the paperwork needed to make this switch. By doing so, [the drug manufacturer] will be taking an important step in the ongoing effort to prevent deadly opioid overdoses.”The series of letters comes as the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder crisis in this country, with the United States experiencing more than 100,000 overdose deaths in a 12-month period for the first-time ever last year. A study found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent.The letters were sent to the CEOs of Pfizer, Emergent Biosolutions, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Hikma, Akorn, Adamis Pharmaceuticals, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.Shaheen has led efforts in Congress to combat rising drug prices, prevent drug manufacturers from abusing the drug approval process to limit market competition and increase access to medication that those struggling with substance use disorder need for their recovery. She previously introduced the End Taxpayer Subsidies for Drug Ads Act, a bill that would prohibit pharmaceutical drug manufacturers from claiming tax deductions for expenses on advertising directly to consumers. Last year, Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation that would increase the amount of time a physician can hold long-acting injectable (LAI) buprenorphine – a form of medication for opioid use disorders – from a specialty pharmacy. And following reports that the manufacturer of buprenorphine was attempting to use the orphan drug approval process to secure an additional seven years of exclusivity and block potentially cheaper generic versions of the medication from appearing on the market, Shaheen sent a letter to the FDA calling on the agency to prevent the manufacturer from abusing the system. As a result of Shaheen’s actions, the FDA revoked buprenorphine’s orphan drug status.Full text of the letters can be found here or below:Dear [CEO],Given our nation’s alarming opioid overdose rates, we write to urge [company name] to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter (OTC) status for your naloxone product, a desperately needed step to ensure widespread and affordable access to this critical overdose reversal medication. We ask that you act quickly given the scale of need at this moment. Lives are at stake.The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exacerbated the opioid and substance use disorder epidemic in this country, with reported overdoses and deaths spiking to historic levels. In fact, alarming data show that last year, the United States experienced a record 100,306 overdose deaths. These trends show no signs of abating as overdose deaths continue to rise.Given the scale of need at this moment, it has never been more important to adopt opioid overdose prevention and reversal strategies on a wide scale. This includes steps to increase access to affordable naloxone, which is a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses, and deaths. A study conducted in Massachusetts found that substantially increased access to naloxone reduced opioid overdose mortality rates by 46 percent. With the support of naloxone manufacturers, we can significantly increase access to the medication and help mitigate the worsening crisis of drug overdose deaths.One of the most important actions that can be taken right now is for manufacturers to submit applications to make naloxone available over the counter without delay. While many states have standing orders and workarounds that allow individuals to acquire naloxone without a prescription, regulatory hurdles continue to create unnecessary barriers. Further, a formal switch to OTC status will help reduce stigma and encourage the widespread use of this critical medication during emergencies. Additionally, market prices for naloxone remain prohibitively high, putting additional financial strain on community organizations working to reduce overdoses. Creating additional OTC naloxone options will help to reduce prices for those who need it, as well as for first responders and other good Samaritans, and increase the supply in at-risk communities.The FDA strongly supports this change and has proactively created, tested, and validated the key labeling information and data needed to approve an OTC version of naloxone. As part of this effort to expedite the application process, the FDA has provided model OTC labels and usage instructions for the nasal spray and auto-injector versions of naloxone. Now the responsibility lies with manufacturers to submit the paperwork needed to make this switch. By doing so, [company name] will be taking an important step in the ongoing effort to prevent deadly opioid overdoses.We strongly urge you to support the widespread access to naloxone, and request that you quickly apply to the FDA for OTC status.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-collins-issue-bipartisan-call-to-epa-to-diversify-fuel-supply-to-ease-rising-energy-costs,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Susan Collins (R-ME) sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan urging the agency to prioritize diversifying the United States’ fuel supply by using tools like the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which would improve the nation’s energy security and ease the burden of rising energy prices facing Granite Staters, Mainers and Americans across the country.In their letter, Shaheen and Collins underscored the impact of Putin’s war in Ukraine in driving up energy costs and the urgent need to utilize the RFS to promote home-grown fuels. They wrote, “Increased integration of advanced biofuels into the fuel stream can boost fuel supply and reduce reliance on foreign oil and fossil fuels more broadly. Accordingly, we request that you increase final volume requirements for advanced biofuels in 2022 and propose robust volume obligations for 2023 and subsequent years in a timely manner. Ambitious targets would provide the stability and certainty needed to drive investments in the types of advanced biofuels that will further our energy independence while lowering greenhouse gas emissions, supporting rural economies and benefiting consumers.”Shaheen and Collins went on to urge the EPA to approve applications and pathways for electricity produced from biomass, waste-to-energy and other renewable feedstocks to bolster the RFS. They pointed out that the RFS plays an important role in bringing advanced biofuels to the market that can have benefits beyond the transportation sector. The production of affordable and sustainable low- carbon fuels would also benefit consumers in the Northeast in particular, where nearly 20 percent of households continue to rely on heating oil to heat their homes. The cost of heating oil in New England began the winter season higher than recent years and has spiked to nearly $5 per gallon in recent weeks, placing a significant burden on consumers. Biodiesel and other renewable fuels play an increasingly important role in offering families in New England affordable alternatives to heating oil that can be used without costly modifications to their home heating systems.The Senators’ letter can be read in full here.Shaheen and Collins also previously urged the Environmental Protection Agency to level the playing field among fuel sources and address languishing applications under the renewable fuel standard program, including moving forward with allowing renewable electricity made from biomass to qualify if it is used to power electric vehicles. Shaheen has also co-led bipartisan legislation to that end. Shaheen and Collins’ legislation – the Community Wood Energy Innovation Act – was included in the Farm bill signed into law in 2018. Their bipartisan bill expanded eligibility for Community Wood Energy Program (CWEP), incentivizes investments in energy-efficient wood energy systems and supports facilities that repurpose low-grade, low-value wood that would otherwise be sent to landfills."

Senator Shaheen and Senator Collins also invited their Senate colleagues to provide input as the members finalize their legislation. Shaheen and Collins previously spearheaded the Insulin Price Reduction Act, which would hold those throughout the insulin supply chain – like big pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefit managers and insurers – accountable for surging insulin costs by incentivizing reductions in list prices. The priorities unveiled by the Senate and House Diabetes Caucus Co-Chairs today builds on Shaheen and Collins’ previous effort, increasing measures to encourage insulin manufacturers to reduce list prices, while extending beneficiary protections that will foster competition and broader access to desperately needed insulin products. More than 37 million Americans live with diabetes, including an estimated one in every three seniors. Untreated, diabetes can lead to vision problems, nerve damage, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and ultimately death. It is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, claiming over 100,000 lives in 2021. Diabetes is also the most expensive chronic condition in the nation, costing a total of $327 billion per year. Medical costs for Americans with diabetes are more than double those incurred by individuals without diabetes, and one out of every three Medicare dollars go to treating people with diabetes.Insulin is one of the most expensive categories of drugs purchased by private and government health care payers. The rising cost of insulin presents a barrier to care for a growing number of Americans with diabetes. Out-of-pocket costs increase with list prices, and for people without insurance, the costs are untenable. Between 2012 and 2016, the average list price of insulin nearly doubled. According to the Health Care Cost Institute, the price of an average 40-day supply of insulin rose from $344 in 2012 to $666 in 2016. “Access to insulin is a life-or-death concern for many of the millions of Americans living with diabetes. Lowering skyrocketing costs to ensure this critical medicine is never out of reach is an urgent need and a crucial bipartisan priority in Congress. We’ve been working for years to find common ground to get this done and we now have an opportunity to get bipartisan legislation over the finish line and ensure that patients with diabetes and their families are no longer burdened with insurmountable costs for this critical, life-saving medication,” said Shaheen and Collins. “Our proposal holds all parties accountable by encouraging them to reduce list prices, and critically, it limits out-of-pocket costs for patients with diabetes. We have made great progress, and soliciting feedback is the next step in our process. With strong bipartisan leadership, we look forward to continuing to work together to deliver on this issue for Americans with diabetes and their families – we must seize the moment and uphold our commitment to finally combat the decades-long surging prices of insulin.”  Shaheen, Collins, DeGette and Reed are specifically prioritizing the following policies in their proposal:A Dear Colleague from Shaheen and Collins inviting Senators to provide input on final legislation is available here. Senators Shaheen and Collins also solicit input from all interested stakeholders as they refine the policy. Stakeholders should submit feedback to insulin@shaheen.senate.gov by April 20, 2022. As Co-Chairs of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, Shaheen and Collins have worked to increase awareness of the threats posed by diabetes, invest in research and improve access to treatment options. They have consistently held insulin manufacturers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers accountable for the skyrocketing cost of life-saving insulin. Last year, Shaheen and Collins led a bipartisan group of Senators to reintroduce the Expanding Access to Diabetes Self-Management Training Act, which would expand Medicare coverage for diabetes self-management training (DSMT) sessions, where diabetes educators help train Medicare patients on how to manage their glucose, maintain a healthy weight, eat healthy foods, manage their insulin levels and improve general care for their diabetes.###"
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-statement-on-new-bipartisan-laws-revoking-free-trade-privileges-for-russia-banning-russian-energy-imports,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, issued the following statement after President Joe Biden signed into law two bipartisan bills to revoke free trade privileges from Russia and other countries that invade sovereign nations, and to ban Russian energy imports. The Senate and House of Representatives cleared both pieces of legislation yesterday. While both bills originated in the House of Representatives, Shaheen was a cosponsor of comparable legislation supporting these efforts in the Senate.“Today, Americans woke up to news that Vladimir Putin bombed a train station filled with civilians trying to flee the violence of the Russian invasion. Earlier this week, we awoke to the horrors of Bucha. Weeks ago, we turned on our televisions to see the destruction of a maternity hospital. Putin is committing war crimes in Ukraine and the global community must not look away. These two pieces of legislation are additional tools for the United States to use against Russia to not only hit back at Putin, but to inflict further financial consequences for Russia and hinder Putin’s ability to continue this unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” said Shaheen. “The United States will not balk in our support for our democratic partners in Ukraine as they fight for their lives and freedom, nor will we shy away from imposing as much economic damage on Putin and his regime as possible. The U.S. and its allies will not let up – Putin will reap what he’s sown.”Shaheen has led action in the U.S. Senate in support of Ukraine in response to Vladimir Putin’s belligerence, which also threatens the stability and security of Eastern Europe and NATO allies. On Wednesday night, legislation co-led by Shaheen to speed up military assistance to Ukraine and Eastern European nations cleared the Senate. Last month, Shaheen and members of the Senate Ukraine Caucus met with Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, and members of the Ukrainian Parliament. In February, Shaheen led a successful bipartisan effort with Portman to pass a resolution that conveys a renewed and overwhelmingly bipartisan message from the U.S. Senate in fierce support of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Shaheen and Portman led a bipartisan delegation to Ukraine, where they met with President Zelenskyy and members of his administration. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, she supported the inclusion of $13.6 billion in security assistance that was part of government funding legislation signed into law by President Biden.Senator Shaheen has long led efforts in the Senate to hold Russia accountable for its malign activity against the U.S. and its allies. Because of her role as a negotiator on Russia sanctions legislation known as “CAATSA” and her successful efforts to ban Kaspersky Lab software from operating on U.S. systems, Shaheen was sanctioned by the Kremlin in 2017. Before the Shaheen-Portman congressional delegation visit to Ukraine in January, Shaheen led a bipartisan group of lawmakers to Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, last June."
https://www.shaheen.senate.gov//news/press/shaheen-celebrates-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation-to-serve-on-us-supreme-court,"(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) released the following statement after the Senate’s bipartisan confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the next U.S. Supreme Court justice.“Today is a historic day for America. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson brings a wealth of experience, integrity and expertise, as well as background as a public defender, all of which will make her an exceptional Supreme Court justice. Not only is Judge Jackson undeniably qualified, but she makes history as the first Black woman to serve on the highest court in our land. Our courts should look like and reflect the people they serve, and this is a historic milestone to make our institutions more democratic,” said Shaheen. “When I met Judge Jackson, I was struck by her unshakable values and commitment to the law. Judge Jackson is the very best of America, and it’s an honor to confirm her to the highest court in the land – securing her place in America’s history books.”Shaheen submitted remarks for the record in support of the historic nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, which can be viewed here.###"
