It’s time to update that law, and I call on those negotiating the FDA user fee bill to include provisions to accomplish that in the final bill,"" Senator Feinstein said. “The FDA currently lacks authority to recall products, there are no strict rules for ingredient transparency and manufacturing processes are unregulated. Language was included in the committee-passed FDA user fee bill to fix those problems, and those provisions should be in the final legislation.“We’ve seen increased reports of cancer, hair loss, skin burns and more, all related to unregulated personal care products. Now is the time to act – we can’t wait any longer. We must give FDA the authority to regulate and recall these products, and the FDA user fee reauthorization bill is the place to do it.”Provisions that should be included in the FDA user fee bill:More information on the underlying bill that includes these reforms, the Personal Care Products Safety Act, is available here. That bill is supported by a number of industry and consumer groups:###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=879A6DBE-7AD4-476C-9EB8-B383FE0F1D88,"Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senators Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) to applaud the House passage of the Preventing a Patronage System Act, legislation led by Feinstein and Kaine to prevent any position in the federal civil service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. The bill would secure the civil service system and safeguard tens of thousands of federal employees from losing job protections and due process rights.  “From protecting our national security to administering Social Security benefits, our civil servants are invaluable to keeping our government running and providing critical services to Americans,” said the senators. “We’re glad to see the House of Representatives pass our bill to protect the merit-based hiring system for our federal workforce, and we’ll be pushing to follow suit in the Senate.”Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA-11). It passed out of the House Committee on Rules on September 13 and passed the full House by a 225-204 vote.The federal workforce is comprised of roughly 2 million federal employees hired on the basis of their acumen. They work each day for the American people — serving in a myriad of capacities to improve this nation and America’s posture abroad, including researching vaccines, helping families in the wake of hurricanes and deadly fires, and inspecting our food to ensure it is safe to eat. On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted government service. The excepted government service is any federal or civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service. This executive order, had it not been repealed by President Biden in January 2021, would have allowed agency heads to reclassify “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that would remove their due process rights and civil service protections. This would have undermined the merit system principles of our federal workforce, by making it easier for any administration to hire political loyalists and fire qualified nonpartisan experts. According to press reports, the Office of Management and Budget under Trump planned to reclassify 88% of its workforce under Schedule F. Trump reportedly plans to reinstate Schedule F immediately if reelected to the presidency, which would allow him to fire up to 50,000 federal workers and replace them with political hires. Currently, new presidents can make about 4,000 political appointments, approximately 1,200 of which must be confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s move could increase the number of political appointments from 4,000 to approximately 50,000. The Preventing a Patronage System Act would prevent any position in the competitive service from being reclassified to Schedule F pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order signed on October 21, 2020. This would prevent future administrations from creating new employee classifications in order to hire more political loyalists and fire nonpartisan experts. ###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=F3B3F764-991C-4EE1-94ED-DA28949CB513,"Washington-Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to introduce the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022 to reauthorize a nationwide law enforcement program focusing on the reduction of violent crime. “Crime and gun violence is a nationwide problem that must be met with a whole-of-government response,” said Sen. Feinstein. “Project Safe Neighborhoods has proven to be one of the most effective ways to bring communities and every level of government together to prevent crime. I want to thank Senator Cornyn for leading this bipartisan effort to renew this important program through 2026.” “The Project Safe Neighborhoods program has been proven to reduce violent crime in cities that participate by focusing law enforcement efforts on organized crime networks and repeat offenders,” said Sen. Cornyn. “By fostering partnerships between federal, state, and local law enforcement to address these criminal threats, we can take a more proactive approach to protecting our communities from violent criminals.” “Violent crime has skyrocketed in cities and communities across the country, and Project Safe Neighborhoods has given law enforcement important resources to fight back,” said Sen. Cruz. “I’m proud to work with my Texas colleague John Cornyn to help state and local police officers, prosecutors, and communities work together to combat violence and bring criminals to justice.”“For the past two decades, Project Safe Neighborhoods has successfully enabled law enforcement officers to fight crime through local, state and federal collaboration,” said Sen. Grassley. “Reauthorizing this critical grant program will ensure communities receive the resources needed to reduce dangerous crime in our communities, and these resources are especially important as we face a national violent crime wave.” “Far too many families have experienced the devastating toll that gun violence and drug crimes can have on a community,” said Sen. Peters. “Using proven, data-driven strategies, Project Safe Neighborhood has effectively improved collaboration between law enforcement and community partners for over two decades – and has successfully reduced drug, gun violence and other violent offenses in communities in Michigan and throughout the country. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan legislation with Senator Cornyn to continue support for this vital program – and help ensure we continue working together to make our neighborhoods safer places to work, live, and raise a family.” “Arizona communities should be safe – free of violence and crime,” said Sen. Sinema. “Our bipartisan legislation supporting the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will reduce violence, protect communities, and help ensure Arizona families are safe and secure.”  “We are seeing an increase in crime across our country, and now is the time for Congress to act,” said Sen. Tillis. “This legislation provides much-needed support to local law enforcement to combat crime and map overdose patterns in our communities. I am proud to work on this commonsense legislation to create safer neighborhoods for future generations.”Background:Project Safe Neighborhoods is a nationwide partnership between federal, state and local law enforcement and prosecutors that uses evidence-based and data-driven approaches to reduce violent crime. Under Project Safe Neighborhoods, multiple law enforcement agencies cooperate and focus their enforcement efforts on organized criminal networks and repeat offenders that are driving the crime rates in a particular region. Project Safe Neighborhoods also works to build trust and partnerships between law enforcement and the communities they serve through coordinated outreach, public awareness, innovative tactics, and collaborative interventions. Since its inception in 2001, Project Safe Neighborhoods has been successfully deployed by both Democratic and Republican administrations to reduce violent crime in large cities and smaller communities across the country. According to a Michigan State University study funded by the Department of Justice in 2013, Project Safe Neighborhoods was associated with a 13.1% decrease in violent crime in cities with a high rate of program participation—including double-digit reductions in total firearms crime and homicides in every city examined by the study. The 2018 authorization of the program passed the Senate unanimously. Specifically, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022:The following organizations support Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of 2022: Fraternal Order of Police, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, National Association of Police Organizations, Major County Sheriffs of America, National District Attorneys Association, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies and National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition.###"

An estimated 20 percent of all mature giant sequoias have been destroyed since 2020, and scientists predict that without significant action, another 20 percent could be lost in the next three years. This would be a staggering loss, and it’s imperative that we act now to save one of the world’s most majestic and treasured species.”“For millennia, Sequoia trees have been a hallmark of California’s rich natural heritage. But increasingly long, dry, and catastrophic wildfire seasons are putting them at serious risk,” said Senator Alex Padilla. “We must work collaboratively to protect these California icons from the threat of climate change and make sure they are preserved for generations to come.”The Save Our Sequoias Act would:"

Our nation depends on the timely transfer of goods by rail and on the men and women who keep the trains running on time. We simply can’t afford to place further strain on our economy and our supply chain, which has been steadily recovering from its pandemic woes.“A freight rail work stoppage now could set back our strong economic recovery at a precarious time. We must do all we can to avoid such a result.” Background:"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=D829FE8C-9618-4BF3-82E1-FE4D87CC8B1A,"Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.) today introduced the Community Wildfire Protection Act, a bill that would allow more communities to access federal grants to reduce their wildfire risk.Current law limits eligibility for federal grants to communities adjacent to federal lands or those listed in an outdated notice in the Federal Register from 2001. This bill would amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act’s definition of an “at-risk community” to include any community at high risk for wildfire that would significantly threaten human life and property.“Climate change is putting more and more communities in the path of deadly wildfires,” said Senator Feinstein. “Unfortunately, a more than two-decade-old list – which was flawed when it was created – determines which California communities may receive federal funds to reduce the threat of deadly wildfires. Our bill fixes that by ensuring that any community threatened by dangerous wildfires would be eligible for federal grants to improve their wildfire resiliency and by expediting the implementation of those projects.”This legislation would expand access to federal wildfire mitigation grants, including to develop and implement Community Wildfire Protection Plans that allow state, local and tribal governments to work with the federal government to reduce hazardous fuels in surrounding forests. It would also make more communities eligible for the $1.8 billion in wildfire funding included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The list also determines where wildfire resiliency projects qualify for expedited approval processes.The threat of wildfire has changed significantly since the 2001 list, which is now woefully inadequate: 19 states and territories have no communities listed and many more communities at significant risk of wildfire were left out. As a result, many vulnerable communities are ineligible for federal fire hazard mitigation funding that could save lives, homes and businesses.The bill is supported by the National Association of Counties, Rural County Representatives of California, National Association of State Foresters, Pacific Forest Trust and California Fire Safe Council."

It touches us all. I’ve lost two husbands and many friends to this terrible disease, which is why I so strongly support President Biden’s devotion to finding a cure. “The United States has long been at the forefront of medical innovation and scientific discovery. President Biden’s cancer moonshot is another opportunity to show the world our strength and resolve by finally eradicating the 100-plus illnesses we call cancer.“President Biden took several key actions today. He announced the first director of ARPA-H, a new federal agency driving biomedical innovation. He signed an executive order launching a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative to support cutting-edge biotechnologies. And he outlined the Cancer Cabinet’s work to support research and development initiatives across the country.“Just as President Kennedy inspired the nation 60 years ago with his vision to reach the moon, I’m heartened by President Biden’s vision to eradicate cancer. We all dream of the day, hopefully soon, when no one will have to suffer from this horrible disease or the pain of losing a loved one to it.”###"

Of those who have reported being scammed out of cryptocurrency on a social media website, 32% identified the scam as having originated on Instagram, 26% on Facebook and 9% on WhatsApp. “Meta has previously acknowledged the potential for crypto scammers to operate on its platforms.

When FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell appeared before Congress in June, she testified that the agency was considering revising the rule that governs the Individual Assistance program.“Despite the Caldor Fire destroying more homes than nine other disasters in 2021 combined, California’s requests for FEMA Individual Assistance have been repeatedly denied,” the senators wrote in a letter to FEMA Administrator Criswell.“It is our understanding that this denial can be traced back to a rule FEMA established in 2019 to consider a state’s total resources when determining whether to provide disaster assistance for individuals.”Full text of the letter follows and is available here:September 6, 2022 The Honorable Deanne CriswellAdministratorFederal Emergency Management Agency500 C Street, SWWashington, DC 20472Dear Administrator Criswell,We write to inquire about FEMA’s Individual Assistance approval process and to request any updates you can provide on changing the 2019 rule. When you appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 22, 2022, you testified that FEMA was reevaluating the criteria for FEMA Individual Assistance, and you offered to provide an update on the status of this analysis.As you know, FEMA issued a Major Disaster Declaration for the Caldor Fire, which devastated the town of Grizzly Flats, California. Nearly 222,000 acres were burned in 69 days, and more than 1,000 structures, including 782 homes, were destroyed. However, despite the Caldor Fire destroying more homes than nine other disasters in 2021 combined, California’s requests for FEMA Individual Assistance have been repeatedly denied.It is our understanding that this denial can be traced back to a rule FEMA established in 2019 to consider a state’s total resources when determining whether to provide disaster assistance for individuals. California’s Office of Emergency Services expressed its concerns with this rule during the comment period, including that it would leave survivors without much-needed aid and discriminate against large states, like California, that may need to provide state resources for numerous disasters simultaneously.As you know, California and other Western states continue to face increasingly dangerous and extreme fire seasons. We appreciate your commitment to improving the FEMA Individual Assistance process, and we look forward to hearing the status of your review and working with you to provide more equitable federal disaster assistance for all survivors.Sincerely,Alex PadillaUnited States SenatorDianne FeinsteinUnited States Senator"

Establishing a federal laboratory presence on the West Coast will be a significant improvement to CDC’s current capability.”Full text of the letter is available here and below:September 6, 2022Dr. Rochelle P. WalenskyDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention1600 Clifton RoadAtlanta, GA 30329Dear Dr. Walensky:We applaud your efforts to review the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the COVID-19 pandemic and institute reforms to better prepare it for future public health threats. As part of this effort, we recommend building federal laboratory capabilities on the West Coast in order to improve the agency’s readiness to diagnose rare or novel diseases and more swiftly respond to public health threats. We saw early in the COVID-19 pandemic that CDC’s reliance on one reference laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, limited the agency’s capacity and agility. For example, after the first CDC COVID-19 test kits were found to be faulty, all patient samples had to be sent to Atlanta for testing. The substantial delays in getting test results back to states could have been mitigated if the agency had additional capabilities on the West Coast, providing more time for health measures to be put in place to slow COVID-19’s spread.As you know, research published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences estimates that the likelihood of another global pandemic during our children’s lifetime is high and the risk of occurrence is likely to increase three-fold in the next few decades. Climate change is also increasing the risk of emerging infectious diseases that threaten human health and livelihood. We strongly support your efforts to strengthen the agency’s capacity to detect and respond to rare and emerging diseases before new pandemics emerge. Establishing a federal laboratory presence on the West Coast will be a significant improvement to CDC’s current capability. Thank you for your consideration of this priority, and we look forward to continue working with you on this pressing issue.Sincerely,Dianne FeinsteinUnited States Senator Alex PadillaUnited States Senator ###"

That lost production would almost certainly be replaced by much dirtier sources, jeopardizing the state’s clean energy goals and increasing the likelihood of blackouts. This threat is especially pertinent as California enters a prolonged heat wave this week that has already threatened the delivery of electricity.“I continue to have concerns about the lack of long-term storage for spent nuclear fuel and I strongly believe we must continue our transition to green energy sources. However, I believe a short-term extension to allow California time to deploy more green energy sources that can responsibly replace nuclear energy is the right choice.“As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I look forward to working with the Department of Energy to ensure that federal grant funds are available to help Diablo Canyon’s continued operations.”###"

He was also right to point out that we have a lot more work to do to save lives and end the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our communities. “The bill enacted in June will help reduce gun violence, but it left out critical provisions. It failed to ban military-style assault weapons that are so often used in mass shootings. It failed to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines that allow shooters to kill so many people so quickly. It even failed to include a small, commonsense provision I introduced to raise the age to buy an assault rifle to 21. It is unfathomable that you can’t buy a handgun, or a beer, under the age of 21 but you can buy an AR-15.“The bottom line is that we still have work to do. Passing any gun legislation in the face of the gun lobby is an accomplishment, but we can’t stop there. We must press on and enact commonsense laws that will help save lives. I thank the president for continuing to push on this critical need.”"

At this time, the alternative to the closure of the reactors at Diablo Canyon will most likely be additional natural gas generation, which would reverse progress on emissions reductions and worsen air quality. The state would be better served by a temporary extension of an existing carbon-free resource.”Full text of the letter is available here and follows:August 30, 2022The Honorable Anthony RendonSpeaker, State AssemblyState Capitol, Room 219Sacramento, CA 95814The Honorable Toni AtkinsPresident pro Tempore, State Senate1021 O Street, Suite 8518Sacramento, CA 95814Dear Speaker Rendon and President pro Tempore Atkins:I am writing in support of SB 846, “Diablo Canyon powerplant: extension of operations,” introduced by Senator Dodd and Assemblymember Cunningham. Diablo Canyon, the last remaining nuclear power plant in the state, generates over 8 percent of California’s electricity, including 17 percent of the state’s carbon-free electricity, and is critical to the grid’s reliability. I urge the legislature to pass this bill to keep this Diablo Canyon operational while the state develops other renewable energy sources.Since the 2016 agreement to decommission Diablo Canyon, the effects of climate change have both increased California’s need for energy and reduced the availability of hydropower due to record drought. In August 2020, extreme heat led to electricity shortages and the first rolling blackouts in the state since the 2001 energy crisis. The consequences would have been even more severe without the electricity from Diablo Canyon. State regulators have projected similar shortfalls and outages during periods of peak demand in the coming years, and retiring a major electricity generation source without adequate preparation will only leave the grid more vulnerable.California has some of the most ambitious clean energy mandates in the world. However, despite massive investments and commitment, development of non-emitting renewable energy resources like wind, solar, and geothermal are not projected to be installed in time to meet California’s energy demand without power from Diablo Canyon. At this time, the alternative to the closure of the reactors at Diablo Canyon will most likely be additional natural gas generation, which would reverse progress on emissions reductions and worsen air quality. The state would be better served by a temporary extension of an existing carbon-free resource.As you know, Congress provided $6 billion through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Civilian Nuclear Credit to preserve existing nuclear plants at risk of closure. Diablo Canyon’s operator, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), is a good candidate for this program, and a successful application will offset costs associated with the relicensing application and necessary capital improvements. In addition, the pending bill, SB 846, contains multiple provisions to ensure that ratepayers are protected and energy prices do not rise significantly.As this process moves forward, I will continue to advocate for PG&E and state and federal regulators to take every step necessary to avoid accidents and ensure safe operation of the power plant. Ultimately, relicensing Diablo Canyon will depend on approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which will conduct a thorough and rigorous safety and seismic review of the power plant, and confirm it is fit for extended operations. My staff has confirmed with the NRC that they are prepared to conduct this review in the necessary timeframe.I applaud the work completed by the legislature this session, and reiterate my support for passage of SB 846 before you adjourn on August 31. The ability of California’s energy system to meet state electricity needs in an environmentally responsible way depends on the extended operation of Diablo Canyon, and I urge you to take the necessary steps to ensure this occurs.Sincerely,Dianne FeinsteinUnited States Senator###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=3B07AB45-5ED1-42EB-82DF-07BF3ACC032D,"Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (both D-Calif.) announced the Department of the Interior will provide nearly $26 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for Klamath Basin restoration projects, including nearly $16 million for ecosystem restoration projects in the Basin and $10 million to expand the Klamath Falls National Fish Hatchery. Feinstein and Padilla both voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which President Biden signed last year. Additionally, the Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, will fund 10 grants totaling $2.2 million to improve fish and wildlife habitat as part of two programs: the Klamath River Coho Restoration Grant Program and the Trinity River Restoration Program. The grants will generate $777,000 in matching contributions for a total conservation impact of almost $3 million. “Severe drought has threatened the unique ecosystems and economy of the Klamath Basin,” said Senator Feinstein. “Thanks to this funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we can invest in restoring the basin’s natural habitat and make the region more resilient against future droughts and climate change.” “Drought has reached almost every corner of California, wreaking havoc on the ecological balance of our state and threatening jobs and our way of life,” said Senator Padilla. “That’s why I proudly supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, so we could invest in resiliency across California. Restoring the Klamath Basin is critical for both the regional ecosystem and local economy. This is just the first investment in the Klamath Basin from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, part of $162 million coming for regional ecological restoration over the next five years. This funding will be a game changer for water supply and fishery health in the years ahead.”Over the past 20 years, the Klamath Basin has met unprecedented challenges due to ongoing drought conditions, limited water supply and diverse needs. As drought conditions persist throughout the region, the Klamath Basin’s fragile ecosystem will depend on collaborative partnerships among a wide variety of stakeholders and the development of holistic solutions.  The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a $1.4 billion down payment in the conservation and stewardship of America’s public lands that will lead to better outdoor spaces and habitats for people and wildlife for generations to come, with the Klamath Basin set to receive $162 million over the next five years to restore the regional ecosystem and repair local economies. The funding announced today represents an historic effort dedicated to restoring the Basin.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Investments in Ecosystem Restoration The Fish and Wildlife Service began soliciting project proposals for fiscal year 2022 funds from Tribes, local and state agencies, non-governmental organizations, and other conservation partners in March. The nearly $16 million will be allocated to projects that focus on water quality and habitat restoration, supporting Endangered Species Act listed fish, sustain critically important wetlands for migrating waterfowl and related natural resources issues.   The $10 million investment in the Klamath Falls National Fish Hatchery’s expansion will increase rearing capacity for two federally listed fish -- the Lost River and shortnose suckers (C’waam and Koptu) -- found only in the Klamath Basin, and support restored and resilient ecosystems in the face of climate change. When completed, the expansion of the hatchery facility will increase the annual rearing capacity to 60,000 fish, which can support and stabilize the imperiled, declining wild populations of both sucker species in Upper Klamath Lake.  These investments represent the initial phase of enhanced restoration work in the Klamath Basin. Planning for 2023 and future years will include continued close coordination with Tribes, localities and stakeholders, beginning with a workshop this fall to refine the draft Klamath Basin Integrated Fisheries Restoration and Monitoring Plan. This science-based, collaborative effort will help build consensus on prioritization of restoration and monitoring projects and provide additional assurance that available funding is spent wisely.   More information about the Klamath Bipartisan Infrastructure Law projects can be found on the Fish and Wildlife Service’s website.  Bureau of Reclamation and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Grantmaking  The 10 grants, funded through the Klamath River Coho Restoration Grant Program and the Trinity River Restoration Program, prioritized projects that remove fish passage barriers, improve access to coldwater refugia, enhance instream habitat, conserve water and reduce fine sediment. All projects will work to enhance the survival and recovery of the Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast coho salmon, as well as support long-term conservation goals for watershed connectivity and resilience in the Klamath River Basin, from its headwaters in Oregon to the Pacific Coast in California.  More information about the Klamath and Trinity River Programs can be found on NFWF’s website.   ###"

On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the U.S. Constitution. Since the decision was released, there has been widespread confusion regarding the legal status of abortion in the U.S. Given the uncertainty domestically, the influence that this decision has in countries receiving U.S. foreign assistance, and past issues communicating the impact of U.S. policy changes abroad, we urge the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to convey clearly to in-country organizations and partners that the Dobbs decision does not impact the ability to provide a full range of legally authorized family planning and reproductive health services allowed prior to the decision.USAID plays a key role in increasing access to family planning and reproductive health care around the world. Currently, the U.S. is the largest donor of bilateral family planning and reproductive health assistance to increase opportunities for voluntary healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies. Ensuring everyone has access to these services is an essential component of a number of USAID’s policy priorities, including improving maternal and child health, reducing HIV transmission, advancing LGBTQI+ inclusive development, and promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment. These policy priorities are critical to advancing overall global health, political stability, economic development, and environmental sustainability, and are in line with the Biden-Harris administration’s National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. In addressing USAID’s family planning and reproductive health priorities, a significant challenge USAID faces is ensuring in-country organizations and partners receive timely, accurate information regarding U.S. policy that impacts the services that partner organizations can provide. This challenge has become especially apparent in the context of the implementation and revocation of the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR). For example, an April 2022 report based on organizations in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe on the revocation of the Mexico City Policy, found that “the consensus among implementing partners and advocates… was that the [U.S. government]’s communications related to the revocation of GGR were insufficient, and that guidance for implementing the policy change was wholly lacking.” Further, according to a May 2022 GAO report, implementing partners that declined U.S. funding due to the Mexico City Policy highlighted that, despite USAID actions to inform staff and implementing partners, “lingering confusion about the policy continued to reduce collaboration even after its rescission.”Further, the combination of the Mexico City Policy and Helms Amendment has had a chilling effect on USAID grantees, leading to their reluctance to offer abortion services where legally permissible and even to provide information and counseling about all pregnancy options consistent with local law. Current U.S. law, through the Leahy Amendment, specifically allows for the provision of information and counseling about all pregnancy options in programs funded by U.S. foreign assistance. Nevertheless, in 2021, organizers of a USAID-sponsored conference, citing the Helms Amendment language in their contract, canceled a presentation on telemedicine abortion research from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Considering USAID’s challenges communicating the revocation of the Mexico City Policy and appropriately implementing of the Helms Amendment, it is imperative that the agency proactively and clearly communicate with in-country partners about the impact of Dobbs on programs funded by U.S. global health assistance. This is to ensure that USAID-funded organizations do not mistakenly believe they must cease providing family planning and reproductive health services due to the Dobbs decision. Given the evidence of poor implementation of U.S. policy related to the Mexico City Policy and reports of overbroad interpretation of the Helms Amendment, USAID must be vigilant to prevent further misinterpretations by organizations and programs funded by U.S. global health assistance from occurring in the future.To that end, we request that you respond in writing to the following questions:In addition to a written response, we request a staff briefing on this matter. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this request.Sincerely, ###"

This funding comes from DOT’s Buses and Bus Facilities Program and Low or No Emission Vehicle (Low-No) Program, helping transit agencies purchase and lease new, cleaner vehicles and renovate and construct the infrastructure needed for zero-emission transit vehicles. Feinstein and Padilla have made supporting the transition to zero-emission buses a priority. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the senators voted to pass last year provided $5.6 billion in new Low-No Program emission funding and $5.1 billion in new funding for Buses and Bus Facilities formula and competitive grants over five years. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act would also provide $1 billion for clean heavy-duty vehicles, including transit and school buses, and a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial vehicles, for which transit agencies and school districts are eligible. “To successfully confront climate change, we must make significant investments in low- and no-emission vehicles. I’m pleased that California has received more than $230 million in grants from the Department of Transportation to help build out our state’s fleet of low- and no- emission public transit vehicles. This funding will go a long way toward helping our state reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector,” said Senator Feinstein.“Transitioning to zero-emission buses is a major step we can and should be taking to combat climate change and improve the air quality in our communities,” said Senator Padilla. “Many cities and transit agencies across California are already developing and implementing projects to move to zero-emission buses—this funding will help those efforts charge forward. It is important we continue to invest not only in cleaner vehicles, but also in the infrastructure needed to support them. That’s why I will continue to advocate for more funding to transition to buses that are better for our environment and public health.” Some of the grants coming to California transit agencies include: A full list of California transit agencies receiving grants is available here. Under the California Air Resources Board’s Innovative Clean Transit Regulation, all new bus purchases by California transit agencies and local governments must be zero-emission buses beginning in 2029, with a goal for full transition by 2040. The federal Buses and Bus Facilities Program assists in the financing of buses and bus facilities capital projects, including replacing, rehabilitating, purchasing, or leasing buses, bus-related facilities, or related equipment. The federal Low-No Program supports the transition of the nation’s transit fleet to the lowest polluting and most energy efficient transit vehicles. The Low-No Program provides funding to state and local governmental authorities for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses, including the acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities.###"

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that the senators voted to pass last year increased the funding available for the RAISE program, which will help communities modernize transportation infrastructure. “The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that President Biden signed last year continues to deliver big wins for California,” said Senator Feinstein. “The announcement of nearly $120 million to bolster transportation infrastructure is great news. This funding will help California continue to lead the way to cleaner, greener forms of transportation.” “As the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law continues to deliver for California, I’m proud to see significant investments from this historic legislation for local and regional transportation infrastructure projects,” Senator Padilla said. “This funding for projects across the state, from San Francisco to the Central Valley and Los Angeles, will improve transportation safety, better connect our communities, and help keep our economy moving.” The California projects awarded RAISE Grants this year are: RAISE projects are rigorously reviewed and selected by DOT based on merit. Projects are evaluated on statutory criteria of safety, environmental sustainability, quality of life, economic competitiveness and opportunity, state of good repair, partnership and innovation. New this year, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 2022 RAISE applications were also evaluated on the criteria of mobility and community connectivity. DOT assesses projects for universal design and accessibility for travelers, and considers how proposals increase mobility for freight and supply chain efficiency.###"

Strengthening these rules will ensure Americans are consuming safe, legally caught and honestly labeled seafood.   In addition to Feinstein and Merkley the letter was also signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “Seafood is a valuable source of protein and nutrients in our diet, and seafood fisheries and businesses support U.S. coastal communities. However, according to NOAA Fisheries, the United States imports 70% to 85% of our seafood,” wrote the senators. “These imports pass through complex global supply chains, in which illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is widespread—depleting fish and other marine species, destroying ocean habitat, and enabling forced labor and human rights abuses around the world.”   The senators’ letter also highlights the issues caused by lack of transparency and inaccurate labeling of seafood products. Mislabeled products or products that are being passed off as one type of fish, but are something completely different, allow unsafe or illegally caught seafood to make its way into our supply chains.  “[…] this practice of seafood mislabeling can cover up a broad array of potential contaminants, pathogens, and allergens,” they continued. “In the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), Congress directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify a list of high-risk foods and establish recordkeeping requirements for these foods to protect public health.”  The senators cited the rule as proposed as a significant improvement over the status quo, but advocated for further changes that would strengthen the traceability of seafood. For example, the FDA should include all seafood products, not just some. In order to simplify compliance for businesses and ensure information can be shared across U.S. agencies for effective enforcement, the senators suggested that the FDA could be more closely aligned with NOAA’s Seafood Import Monitoring Program. Additionally, the senators said the proposed rule should implement more rigorous, electronic record keeping that can be easily reported to regulators.  Lastly, the senators called for the rule to ensure that consumers are provided with basic information about seafood, including the specific species, where it was caught, how it was caught, and whether it was farmed or caught wild.  Full text of the letter can be found here and follows below:  Dear Commissioner Califf:  Seafood is a valuable source of protein and nutrients in our diet, and seafood fisheries and businesses support U.S. coastal communities.

These imports pass through complex global supply chains, in which illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is widespread—depleting fish and other marine species, destroying ocean habitat, and enabling forced labor and human rights abuses around the world.   Complex supply chains and a lack of transparency also enable seafood fraud—when one type of seafood is mislabeled as another—thus providing unsafe or illegally caught seafood with a new legal identity.

It will promote domestic clean energy manufacturing to create jobs at home while significantly reducing greenhouse gas pollution, both of which have long been priorities for me.“The bill includes two Feinstein provisions: It includes $4 billion to respond to historic drought conditions in the West, a boon for California’s cities, businesses and farmers. And it includes a provision making it easier for low- and middle-income Americans to buy electric cars, reducing the demand for gas and lowering carbon emissions.“This bill will also help reduce health care costs. Most notably, it will extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that help families afford coverage and it will allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices that will benefit millions, two actions I have supported for years.“Finally, the bill reforms our tax code, ensuring the largest companies pay a minimum 15 percent tax rate. It also boosts IRS funding so the agency can collect billions in unpaid taxes from huge corporations and wealthy tax dodgers, an action for which I have been a strong advocate.“This bill is a huge win for American families and I’m proud to support it.”Climate change provisions:Health care provisions:Tax fairness and deficit provisions:###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=944F9533-CE9B-415E-9554-814EC1F7D9D7,"Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today applauded the inclusion of $4 billion for drought relief in the Inflation Reduction Act. The senator’s office worked closely with the offices of several Western senators to draft language that will help drought-stricken communities in the Colorado River Basin.This funding will help preserve water deliveries from the Colorado River, which supplies water for 700,000 acres of farmland and more than 19 million residents in the region. To maintain this water resource in the face of climate change, the state must proactively reduce water usage to keep Lake Mead above critical elevations.In order to achieve the goal of reducing Colorado River withdrawals, the bill provides temporary financial assistance to farmers who voluntarily fallow their lands as they adjust to reduced levels of river flow. It also funds water conservation and efficiency projects to keep more water in the river.These efforts will help California reach an agreement with all seven Colorado River states on reducing water use while preserving long-term access to Colorado River water supplies. This will help all water users as they adjust to drier conditions within the Colorado River Basin by transitioning to more sustainable water uses like water recycling; stormwater capture and reuse; desalination; more efficient use of water by farmers; infrastructure improvements; and increased water conservation and urban water efficiency.“As climate change continues to stress our water resources, we must do more to ensure we have enough water to meet our state’s needs,” Senator Feinstein said. “The inclusion of $4 billion in the reconciliation bill to address the historic drought in the West is critical for communities throughout the region, particularly in California.Senator Feinstein continued: “This language, which my staff negotiated with Senators Kelly, Sinema and others, will help ensure that critical water deliveries from the Colorado River continue as the state expands sustainable water practices like water recycling and conservation. The bill will also fund water infrastructure modernization projects as well as projects to reduce harmful effects of drought on rivers and inland water bodies like the Salton Sea. This is just one step to help fight this dangerous drought, but it’s an important one.”California Governor Gavin Newsom said: “This funding is critical to stabilize the Colorado River system and accelerate projects at the Salton Sea to protect public health and the environment. Thanks to our California senators for working with us on this priority and helping to lead the charge on this essential investment.”The drought portion of the reconciliation bill includes three key components:1. Compensate water users, including those in the agriculture sector, for voluntary reductions they make in water deliveries.This provision will be particularly beneficial to agricultural water users within the Colorado River basin (as well as potentially to others in areas such as the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley and the Klamath) who are suffering from long-term drought and can reduce water use in ways that have conservation, environmental and other broader public benefits.California currently receives 4.4 million-acre feet of water each year from the Colorado River. If water levels in Lake Mead fall below critical levels, significant reductions to the state’s allocation will have to occur. By compensating water users, including farmers, for reducing their water usage, this bill will help maintain the level of Lake Mead, ensuring needed Colorado River deliveries continue.In the Colorado River Basin and elsewhere in the West, this provision could benefit farmers or groups of farmers who volunteer to fallow a portion of their land for multiple years as part of a comprehensive plan for restoring blocks or corridors of wildlife habitat or providing other environmental benefits. The compensation might assist California farmers in planning for drought or compliance with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. This potential application of the provision would complement a similar California program in the San Joaquin Valley.2. Fund conservation projects to increase water levels in the Colorado River system.This bill includes investments in urban and agricultural water use efficiency projects. Urban projects include substitutes for turf and lawn replacement and installation of drought-resilient landscaping. Agricultural projects include water-saving measures like canal lining and leveling of drainage ditches.3. Mitigate the harmful effects of drought by funding environmental restoration projects.These restoration projects will focus on river systems and inland water bodies suffering from the effects of drought.One example is Southern California’s Salton Sea. Funding restoration projects will help remediate effects of wind-blown dust. This effort is critical to help lower asthma rates that are in places twice that of the national average. Another potential example is habitat projects that would benefit winter-run chinook salmon, an endangered species that has been severely imperiled by recent droughts.###"

I appreciate the focus that the Biden administration is putting on this issue and I support doing everything we can to help Afghanistan’s most vulnerable and oppressed, including women and girls,” said Senator Feinstein. “Over the last year, we’ve tragically seen a reversal in women’s rights that many of us predicted would happen under Taliban rule. While our military mission in Afghanistan ended, our humanitarian mission continues, and that must have a focus on Afghan women and girls who are among the most vulnerable,” said Senator Shaheen. “I appreciated the Biden administration’s briefing, which was held at our request, to ensure Congress is continuously apprised of the latest information on conditions on the ground and U.S. efforts to address women’s rights and safety in order to best inform our policies and coordinated work with our partners and international coalitions. Nearly a year since U.S. withdrawal, it’s critical to continue to raise the plight of Afghan women and girls to remind the world of these courageous women and ensure they are not forgotten. I’ll continue to do everything in my power in the U.S. Senate to elevate their voices and prioritize policies that support Afghan women.” “The update provided by the State Department and USAID was informative, but painted a grim picture of the way forward for Afghan women in the near and medium term. I fear Afghan women and girls are suffering without significant reprisal from the United States or international community,” said Senator Ernst. “I will continue working to ensure Afghan women and girls are not forgotten, and the Taliban’s abusive practices are not normalized, here or abroad.” “Over the past two decades, Afghan women fought hard to secure fundamental rights and freedoms, and now the Taliban are sadly stripping them away,” said Senator Baldwin. “I am thankful for the Biden administration’s briefing and commitment to humanitarian support for women in Afghanistan. We must continue to elevate the strife of Afghan women, stand united against the assault on women’s rights, and work with our international partners to support a future rooted in equality for the Afghan people.”###"

Warner (D-Va.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) to introduce the Preventing a Patronage System Act, a bill that would prevent any position in the federal civil service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. The bill would secure the civil service and protect tens of thousands of federal employees from losing job protections and due process rights.“Workplace protections for federal workers exist for a reason: so any one administration cannot fire career employees and install their own political appointees,” said Senator Feinstein. “Career federal workers are committed to public service and serving the greater good, and they fulfill a range of critical roles from protecting national security to bolstering our nation’s pandemic response to safeguarding our communities. These career federal employees must be protected from politics so they can do their jobs, and that’s what our bill would accomplish.”“Our civil service plays an invaluable role in everything from our national security to the administration of Social Security benefits, and it’s in Americans’ best interest that those positions be filled with the most qualified applicants,” said Senator Kaine. “This legislation would put commonsense safeguards in place to protect the merit-based hiring system for our federal workforce, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting it.”“Our career, non-partisan public sector workforce is one of our nation’s greatest assets. The last thing we need is for a president to fire dedicated and experienced public servants and replace them with sycophants and grifters without the skills to carry out the functions of government within the rule of law,” said Senator Cardin. “From health care to national security, education to public safety, nearly every sector of American society will suffer greatly if a future president is given the latitude to blindly wipe away the professional expertise of our nation’s civil servants.”“Our federal civilian workforce provides Americans with crucial services every day,” said Senator Van Hollen. “And keeping partisan politics out of our civil service is crucial to upholding its integrity and maintaining an efficient and effective federal government. This common-sense legislation will ensure the integrity of our merit-based civil service system and safeguard it from being used as a political punching bag.” BackgroundThe federal workforce is comprised of roughly 2 million federal employees hired on the basis of their acumen who work in a range of capacities from researching vaccines to rebuilding communities after disasters to ensuring our food supply is free of disease.On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 that would have allowed agency heads to reclassify a broad swath of positions to a newly created Schedule F category, stripping many career federal employees of their due process rights and civil service protections. This would have undermined the merit system principles of our federal workforce, as it would have made it easier for any administration to hire political loyalists and fire qualified experts. The Executive Order was repealed by President Biden in January 2021 and never took effect.According to press reports, the Office of Management and Budget under Trump planned to reclassify 88 percent of its workforce under Schedule F. Trump reportedly plans to reinstate Schedule F immediately if reelected to the presidency, which would allow him to fire up to 50,000 federal workers and replace them with political hires.Currently, new presidents can make about 4,000 political appointments, approximately 1,200 of which must be confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s move could increase the number of political appointments from 4,000 to approximately 50,000.The Preventing a Patronage System Act would prevent any position in the competitive service from being reclassified to Schedule F pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order signed on October 21, 2020. This would prevent future administrations from creating new employee classifications in order to hire more political loyalists and fire experts.The legislation is endorsed by American Federation of Government Employees, National Treasury Employees Union, National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, Senior Executives Association, National Federation of Federal Employees, Professional Managers Association, American Society for Public Administration, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, National Weather Service Employees Organization, Patent Office Professional Association, United Power Trades Organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, International Marine Mammal Project of Earth Island Institute, Civic Leadership Education and Research Initiative, Project Blueprint, FAA Managers Association, National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys and the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration.Full text of the legislation is available here."

It’s imperative that the federal government expedite approval of these projects to stop the pollution and protect the health of San Diegans and other Southern California residents.”“Robust action to clean up polluted water flowing north from the Tijuana River is long overdue,” said Senator Padilla. “That is why I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, as well as with the Biden administration, to improve water quality throughout the border region and particularly within the Tijuana River estuary.” “I’m proud to lead my colleagues in the fight to address the cross-border pollution impacting my constituents and our binational region,” said Rep. Vargas. “Our California delegation has been working diligently to take meaningful action against harmful pollutants and ensure the health and safety of communities on both sides of the border. I strongly urge the EPA and IBWC to fully consider projects that would significantly improve and address transboundary water pollution in our region.” “Pollution from Tijuana River Valley has plagued our region for generations, and it is critical that the $300 million in federal funding we secured to stop the flow of this pollution is put to use effectively and efficiently,” said Rep. Levin. “I appreciate the Biden Administration’s attention to this important issue and urge them to advance appropriate projects as soon as possible.” “The sewage and pollution flowing through the Tijuana River Valley have been a decades-long crisis for both sides of the border,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs. “This toxic exposure continues to pose a direct threat to our marine ecosystems, our economy, and our quality of life. Our delegation has worked tirelessly to address this crisis, and we’re hopeful the federal agencies will continue to acknowledge the severity of this problem for San Diegans and fully consider projects that will provide rapid, long-overdue relief for our impacted communities.”“This long-overdue cleanup of the Tijuana River Valley stands to transform the quality of life throughout the region – especially San Diego County,” said Rep. Darrell Issa. “I am proud to have worked alongside my colleagues in our San Diego Congressional delegation as well as local, state, and federal leaders to advance key new funding and make this project a reality.”The full text of the letter can be found below:Dear Administrator Regan and Commissioner Giner,The binational Tijuana River Watershed covers approximately 1,750 square miles that spans across the California -Mexico border. Within the Tijuana River Valley (TRV) there are some of the most ecologically significant marine ecosystems on the Pacific Coast: the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve, Tijuana River Valley Regional Park Reserve, Tijuana River Mouth State Marine Conservation Area, San Diego Bay, and the National Wildlife Refuge.Over the past 30 years, Tijuana, Mexico has experienced tremendous population and industrial growth with rapid urbanization which has put a strain on the aging sewage infrastructure in the region. As a result of the sewage infrastructure inadequacies, the Tijuana River carries untreated wastewater, trash, and sediment from Mexico across California’s Southern border into the United States.Untreated wastewater, sediment, and trash flowing through the Tijuana River contain harmful bacteria that pose risks to both wildlife and human health. To minimize human contact with the untreated wastewater the San Diego County beaches have been closed numerous times. In 2018, South San Diego County beaches affected by the Tijuana River pollution were closed 101 days out of the year. In 2019, that increased to 243 days, and in 2020 the beaches were closed 295 days out of the year.Transboundary water flow crossing into the United States from Mexico have raised environmental, water quality, and public health concerns for decades. That’s why we were proud to fight for and secure $300 million as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to address transboundary pollution in the watershed. We are grateful to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Administrator Regan for coming out to see the Tijuana River Valley pollution firsthand in August 2021 as they work towards taking the necessary steps to solve this decades - long problem that has disproportionately impacted working-class minority communities on the California – Mexico border and across San Diego County.We have been told that the projects considered in the EPA and U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission’s (USIBWC) Comprehensive Infrastructure Solution for mitigating transborder water pollution might significantly improve the quality of water in the Tijuana River and on the beaches of both Mexico and the United States. To ensure rapid relief for affected communities, we encourage the Biden administration to provide these projects full and fair consideration on the merits that are consistent with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure that these projects proceed as expeditiously as possible.We look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues, the EPA and the USIBWC on these issues moving forward.###"

Johnson regarding ICE’s overuse of solitary confinement in detention facilities. Today’s letter follows Acting Director Johnson’s response to the senators’ February letter that sought answers on ICE’s use of solitary confinement, its failure to conduct adequate oversight, and the consequences for the health and safety of detainees.“[In February] We asked several questions related to a 2021 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that identified widespread deficiencies in ICE’s oversight of the use of solitary confinement in its detention facilities.  Your response raises additional questions about ICE’s adherence to internal policies and apparent overuse of solitary confinement,” the senators wrote.Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report on ICE’s use of solitary confinement. The OIG investigation exposed serious deficiencies in ICE’s oversight and adherence to internal policies and revealed information suggesting that facilities excessively rely on the dangerous detention practice, which involves placing detainees in isolated holding cells for as long as 22 to 24 hours a day with limited human contact.In today’s letter, the senators note that Acting Director Johnson’s response to their first letter failed to allay their concerns. They then continue to press Acting Director Johnson about the decision-making behind placing a detainee in solitary confinement and request additional information about ICE’s views on alternatives to solitary confinement. “Your letter described how ICE uses a record-keeping system to track the usage of solitary confinement for a subset of detainees once they are placed in solitary confinement but does not explain what, if anything, ICE does to consider alternatives ahead of time. You also promised a policy update that will better ensure that ICE’s record-keeping system tracks all detainees placed in solitary confinement, but you have not explained how ICE plans to ensure that alternatives to solitary confinement are in fact considered or what those alternatives are,” the senators wrote. The senators continued, “In response to our questions, your answers largely restate ICE’s pre-existing processes and reference the forthcoming policy update, which, to our knowledge, has still not been issued. Nor have you provided an adequate explanation of what steps ICE has taken or plans to take in order to address OIG’s findings.”The senators ended their letter by requesting answers to questions on alternatives to solitary confinement, the impact solitary confinement has on detainees’ health, and what standards will be instituted to prevent the continued overuse of solitary confinement.Full text of the letter is available here and below: August 1, 2022Dear Acting Director Johnson:We write regarding your March 21 response to our February 11 letter expressing concerns with the use of solitary confinement at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.

It’s time for Congress to start listening,” said Senator Feinstein. “I believe that assault weapons have no place in our streets, but they certainly don’t belong in the hands of teenagers. I’m proud to have the Major Cities Chiefs Association’s support in passing our bill to require anyone purchasing an assault weapon to be 21 years old.”“Assault weapons are known for three things, the number of rounds they allow an individual to fire, how quickly those rounds can be fired and the carnage those rounds leave in their wake,” wrote Jeri Williams, chief of the Phoenix Police Department and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. “These weapons also have no reasonable hunting or sporting purpose. Given these realities, it’s unconscionable that an individual can purchase an assault weapon once they turn 18, especially given that the minimum age to buy a handgun is 21.”Senator Feinstein has received similar letters of support from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of School Psychologists, the American School Counselor Association and the American Federation of Teachers.Full text of the letter is available here and follows:July 29, 2022The Honorable Dianne FeinsteinUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Senator Feinstein,I write on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) to express our support for S. 4278, the Age 21 Act. The MCCA is a professional organization of law enforcement executives representing the largest cities in the United States and Canada.The Age 21 Act would raise the minimum age to purchase an assault weapon to 21. Assault weapons are known for three things, the number of rounds they allow an individual to fire, how quickly those rounds can be fired, and the carnage those rounds leave in their wake. These weapons also have no reasonable hunting or sporting purpose. Given these realities, it’s unconscionable that an individual can purchase an assault weapon once they turn 18, especially given that the minimum age to buy a handgun is 21.The MCCA will continue to advocate for the sensible reforms in its 2018 Firearms Violence Policy, which includes banning assault weapons. However, the Association understands it’s unlikely an assault weapons ban can advance through Congress at this time. Therefore, the Age 21 Act is another step Congress can take to help save lives. Both the perpetrators of the Tops Supermarket shooting in Buffalo, New York and the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, were 18 years old. They also both legally purchased the assault weapons they used to commit these horrific attacks.Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue and your continued support of local law enforcement. Please do not hesitate to contact me if the MCCA can further assist.Sincerely,Jeri WilliamsChief, Phoenix Police DepartmentPresident, Major Cities Chiefs Association###"

Unfortunately, the freedom to marry is in jeopardy after a recent Supreme Court decision. Our bill would ensure that regardless of what the court does, same-sex and interracial marriages remain protected.”“Our businesses strongly embrace diversity and inclusion because we want everyone who works for us or does business with us to feel included and welcomed as their true, authentic selves,” the companies wrote. “Inclusive business practices improve our bottom lines and lead to more productive and engaged employees, increased customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, improved competitiveness and financial performance.“Our employees are the foundation of our companies - they drive our ability to successfully do business, invest in communities around the country, and create the products and services we proudly offer. As business leaders committed to inclusion and equality for our employees, their families, and the communities we serve, we call on the Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.”Full text of the letter is available here, including a list of companies that signed the letter, and follows:July 28, 2022Dear Senators:Together we, the signatories of this letter, write in support of the Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404/S. 4556) representing a diversity of industries and brands that do business, serve customers and create jobs in nearly every community in the United States. Fairness, equal treatment, and opportunity are central to our corporate values because we care about our employees and the customers we serve. Americans from all walks of life, across demographics, geographies, and party lines agree that loving, committed couples have the right to be respected and protected under the law. Support for marriage equality for same-sex couples and interracial couples is at an all-time high -- with vast majorities of the public supporting these policies. As many of us highlighted in our support for Marriage Equality in 2015, a patchwork of inconsistent and discriminatory state marriage laws goes against our company values and makes it harder for us to do business and to recruit and retain top talent.This is why we support the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act. Codifying a consistent and inclusive federal standard conferred by the Loving, Windsor, and Obergefell rulings will help to ensure marriage equality, eliminate confusion for employers and enable us to retain and attract talent. No person, including same-sex couples and interracial couples protected by this bill, should fear their marriage will not be recognized by the federal government or their employment benefits threatened.Our businesses strongly embrace diversity and inclusion because we want everyone who works for us or does business with us to feel included and welcomed as their true, authentic selves. Inclusive business practices improve our bottom lines and lead to more productive and engaged employees, increased customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, improved competitiveness and financial performance.Our employees are the foundation of our companies - they drive our ability to successfully do business, invest in communities around the country, and create the products and services we proudly offer.

http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=CD2EF180-9CF4-4592-8C5F-68AB78826BBF,"Washington–Ahead of the federal student loan payment pause set to expire at the end of next month, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Representatives Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) as well as a large bicameral group of their colleagues to urge the Biden administration to extend the student loan payment pause beyond August 31, 2022. This effort comes on the heels of several news reports that the Biden administration has not made a final decision about whether to extend the student loan payment pause – a decision that will affect millions of student loan borrowers. “For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.,” wrote more than 100 lawmakers to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.” The lawmakers emphasized how resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide. “Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs. Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine. We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels,” the lawmakers added. “Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.” The lawmakers concluded by pointing out how resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway at the Department of Education. All federal student loan borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department of Education or their federal student loan servicer. In addition to Feinstein, Menendez, Booker, Warren and Schumer in the Senate, the letter was also signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Find a copy of the letter here and below. Dear President Biden and Secretary Cardona, In roughly 35 days, on September 1, 2022, tens of millions of federal student loan borrowers are scheduled to resume payments. Despite repeated reports and surveys concerning whether borrowers will be able to pay,1 we understand the Administration is considering restarting student loan payments at the end of August.2 We write today to urge you to extend the pause on student loan payments, given the numerous economic issues facing borrowers across the nation, as well as administrative actions in process by the Department of Education. For over two years, the Department has provided critical flexibility to millions of federal student loan borrowers by pausing payments, as many have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. This much needed pause has helped many borrowers to keep a roof over their heads, secure childcare, and purchase food, health care, and medicine during the course of a pandemic responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million people in the U.S.3 For the first time, many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt, open a savings account, purchase a home, and save for retirement—none of which would have been possible without the payment pause.4 Resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their federal student loans or putting a roof over their heads, food on the table, or paying for childcare and health care—while costs continue to rise and while yet another COVID-19 variant increases hospitalizations nationwide. Despite significant decreases over the last month, gas prices are still high, and many borrowers still have to pay exorbitant amounts each week in order to commute to their jobs.5 Food prices remain high, as suppliers contend with ongoing supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.6 We still have a significant childcare crisis throughout the country, which has caused already-high costs to spike to 40% of their pre-pandemic levels.7 Low-income borrowers, Black and Brown borrowers, and women borrowers still face severe financial hardships as COVID-19 continues to infect individuals throughout the country and exacerbate existing inequities.8 Moreover, resuming student loan payments at this moment would further complicate administrative actions already underway or contemplated by the Department—which could contribute to unnecessary confusion for borrowers in the upcoming months. Currently, many borrowers are in limbo as they await upcoming actions from the Department or their federal student loan servicer—either through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) waiver or through the one-time account adjustments announced by Ed on April 19, 2022 that would count past periods of forbearance or deferment.9Accordingly, we ask that the Administration continue to keep federal student loan payments paused. Sincerely,###"

The resolution highlights the “incredible contributions” Muslim Americans have made across multiple sectors of society—from medical professionals to entrepreneurs, to faith leaders, athletes and public servants—to help build a better nation. The resolution further notes the religious discrimination experienced by Muslim Americans and stresses the “need for public education, awareness, and policies that are culturally competent when describing, discussing, or addressing the impacts of being Muslim American in all aspects of the society of the United States.” “California is fortunate to have a diverse community with roots all over the world. Our culture and economy attract people from all walks of life, which is why it’s no surprise that the Muslim American community has played a role in helping California grow into one of the largest economies in the world,” said Sen. Feinstein. “I’m proud to join Senator Booker on this resolution to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Muslim Americans to our country, while also recognizing the need to end anti-Muslim hate across the United States.” “Muslim Americans have contributed to our nation since its very inception,” said Sen. Booker. “Those contributions have enriched the cultural tapestry of America even as Muslims continue to experience religious prejudice and discrimination. This resolution recognizes the incredible contributions made by Muslims living in the United States and also highlights the urgent need to work together to address anti-Muslim bias and hate that has tragically become too commonplace.”“Our nation is stronger because of the diverse communities that call this country home, including Muslim Americans. Each and every day, and especially during this month, we should acknowledge the contributions and achievements of Muslim Americans,” said Sen. Durbin. “But we cannot celebrate the Muslim American community without also recognizing the continued religious discrimination and threats they face in this country. I hope today’s resolution will serve as both a tribute to this community and as a recommitment to stand with Muslim Americans in the work to build a more tolerant and equitable nation.”   “It is time we honor the rich and invaluable contributions Muslims have made to our country’s history and spirit by designating this and every July as Muslim-American Heritage Month,” said Sen. Markey. “In honoring their contributions, we can continue to challenge the bias and bigotry that far too many of our Muslim-American neighbors, friends, and loved ones have experienced in this country. We must not accept the discrimination Muslims face, and continue to honor the value they bring to our nation.” “Muslim-Americans have enriched communities in Virginia and across the country, and we’re stronger because of them,” said Sen. Kaine. “This resolution both celebrates their many contributions and recognizes the work ahead to build a more tolerant, inclusive society.” “This resolution celebrates the incredible accomplishments and contributions of the Muslim-American community. Enriching our nation in countless ways, the Muslim-American community in Connecticut and across the country embodies the ideals of faith, peace and love,” said Sen. Blumenthal. “I’m proud to join this resolution that not only acknowledges their importance, but reaffirms our commitment to combating targeted acts of prejudice and hate.”           The resolution is also cosponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.).Full text of the resolution can be found here. "

We must do all we can to prepare for and combat wildfires and improve our water infrastructure to better cope with ongoing drought conditions. “As climate change gets worse and temperatures rise, we know that droughts will become more destructive and wildfires more deadly. That’s why these two issues are my top priorities, and I’m pleased that several provisions I have authored this year are included in the bill that passed today.

Military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines serve only one purpose: to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. That is why they are the weapon of choice in so many mass shootings. It’s long past time to remove them from our streets.”“There are more guns than people in this country – more mass shootings than days in the year. This is a uniquely American problem,” said Congressman Cicilline. “In 2022 alone, more than 160 people have been killed by an assault weapon and more than 245 have been injured. This bill will not stop all gun violence, but it will effectively decrease it. Researchers estimate that if we still had a federal assault weapons ban, we would see 70 percent fewer mass shooting deaths. And while nothing we do can bring back 70 percent of these victims to their family and friends, we can honor their memories with action and prevent more carnage moving forward.

The state currently has the second highest positivity rate in the country and is home to the first major city, San Francisco, to declare a state of emergency in response to the outbreak. Their letter follows an announcement by HHS yesterday that the agency plans to make an additional 780,000 doses available to states. The senators are urging that California receives a proportionate amount of doses to match the severity of the outbreak in the state.“Due to limited supplies, only Californians with suspected or confirmed monkeypox exposure are currently eligible for vaccination, and testing has been limited to individuals with a rash. As we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, a sustained period of limited testing and vaccine availability early in a public health crisis is a recipe for disaster. In the case of monkeypox, it is also largely avoidable, given the availability of an approved vaccine,” wrote the senators. “Therefore, we urge you to fulfill California’s request to surge 600,000 – 800,000 vaccine doses to California as quickly as possible in order to halt the transmission of monkeypox, particularly in those communities that have already been disproportionately impacted.” Recently, Feinstein and Padilla signed a letter to HHS Assistant Secretary Dawn O’Connell and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky urging the agencies to address the inequities in access to vaccines and immediately increase access to the JYNNEOS monkeypox and smallpox vaccine to all communities in the United States.Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Becerra,We write to express our increasing concern about the monkeypox outbreak in California, and we urge you to fulfill California’s request for additional vaccines to be surged to the state as quickly as possible, as expressed in the attached letter from California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly and Dr. Tomás Aragón of the California Department of Public Health.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California has documented 799 probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox, making the outbreak in California the second largest in the United States after New York. Additionally, the outbreak has been concentrated in Los Angeles and San Francisco and has disproportionately affected members of the LGBTQ+ community. California conservatively estimates that between 250,000 to 350,000 individuals in California are considered to be at high-risk of contracting the virus.Due to limited supplies, only Californians with suspected or confirmed monkeypox exposure are currently eligible for vaccination, and testing has been limited to individuals with a rash.

The bill is cosponsored by Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and companion legislation was introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) in the House in March.After being found legally liable for wildfires in 2015, 2017 and 2018, PG&E established a $13 billion trust to provide payments to wildfire survivors. However, thousands of Californians who receive these payments owe income or other taxes on both the settlements they receive as well as money that goes directly to attorney fees.The bill has two provisions:“Tens of thousands of Californians have been harmed by wildfires that were found to be caused by PG&E, but the payouts they receive from PG&E’s wildfire victim fund are often insufficient to cover damages because so much goes to attorney fees, court costs and taxes,” Senator Feinstein said. “These payments are not income – they are restitution for damage from fires that PG&E caused. This bill, which will exempt wildfire payouts from income taxes and allow attorney fees and court costs to be deducted from taxes, means that families that have suffered because of these wildfires will receive proper compensation to help rebuild their lives.”"

We must also prioritize green, open spaces and recreational areas for the health and safety of our communities. This bill accomplishes that by creating a federal wildlife refuge as part of the collaborative land management plan created by Riverside County.”“California’s abundant biodiversity and endangered species are constantly threatened by loss of natural habitat and the ongoing climate crisis,” said Senator Padilla. “The establishment of the Western Riverside County National Wildlife Refuge is essential to protecting California’s diverse wildlife and natural beauty while allowing for growth and infrastructure development in Riverside County. Importantly, the bill would also expand outdoor access and education opportunities for underserved communities. This legislation will ensure that California’s communities can continue to grow while simultaneously protecting California’s rich biodiversity for generations to come.”“We are thrilled to see legislation introduced in the Senate to protect vulnerable habitat and imperiled species while providing greater access for neighboring communities,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife. “We thank Sen. Feinstein and other members of the California delegation for their efforts to make the Refuge a reality and applaud the bipartisan support for establishing the refuge. We urge Congress and the Biden administration to move quickly to enact this widely-supported legislation.” “Western Riverside National Wildlife Refuge can?protect California’s stunning natural landscapes near underserved communities of color,” said Brenda Gallegos, program associate for Hispanic Access Foundation. “The refuge will?bring the myriad benefits of nearby nature to urban Latino communities – from creating jobs to enriching our children’s education to improving public health, protecting us from climate emergency, to safeguarding clean air, water, and a healthy environment for all.

Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and a group of their colleagues to call on the Department of Veterans Affairs to take immediate administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to veterans and eligible dependents. Following the far-right Supreme Court’s disastrous Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, more than 800,000—or half of women veterans in this country—live in states that are certain or likely to ban abortions.Under current VA regulations, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is prohibited from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. In a letter sent to VA Secretary Denis McDonough, the members highlight that because the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions, they therefore must immediately begin a rulemaking process to change the current regulations and update the VHA’s medical benefit package to provide abortion and abortion-related services. The letter highlights that Secretary McDonough also recently expressed that the VA has the statutory authority to provide abortions. “Last month’s disastrous Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant,” write the lawmakers. “This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.”  “We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources,” the lawmakers continue. “The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary ‘shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed’ to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992.”In addition to Feinstein, Hirono and Warren, the letter was also signed by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Edward J.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the nearly fifty-year precedent established by Roe v. Wade and removed constitutional protection for abortion access from millions of individuals in this country, including an ever-growing number of veterans and dependents who are able to become pregnant. This decision makes it even more critical that veterans receive access to the reproductive care to which they are entitled. Thus, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must urgently begin rulemaking to allow veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortions and all abortion-related services.  Current regulations of the VA prohibit the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from providing abortions and abortion counseling as part of the medical benefits package. Additionally, CHAMPVA, the VA’s insurance program for certain dependents and survivors of veterans, does not cover abortion services, unless the life of the mother is endangered. We contend that the VA has the statutory authority and discretion to provide abortions and abortion-related services and resources. The VA’s authority to provide care to veterans is established in the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996. That statute provides that the VA Secretary “shall furnish hospital care and medical services which the Secretary determines to be needed” to certain veterans. Importantly, the VA has used its authority under the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 to provide reproductive care such as pregnancy care and infertility services, even though such care was initially excluded from the health care packages allowed under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Moreover, we agree with your testimony to the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee stating that the VA has the power to offer abortion services and abortion counseling “as a regulatory matter.” As you explained last week, “[i]t is a long-held view of the VA general counsel that [the Department is] not statutorily prohibited from providing abortion counseling or abortion services.” Finally, the VA has the authority to “provide medical care” to the dependents and survivors of veterans through CHAMPVA “in the same or similar manner” to dependents and survivors of service members. In FY 2020, approximately 550,000 women veterans used VA health care, and over 400,000 dependents and survivors accessed care through the CHAMPVA program. The VA must do everything in its power to provide critical reproductive care to veterans and their dependents across the country.We call on you to take swift and decisive action to ensure all of our veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries can access abortions and all abortion-related services.  ###"

And by fostering chip manufacturing here at home, we will help prevent future shortages like we saw during the pandemic.“The science funding in the bill includes additional important investments in the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and our 17 national labs, four of which are in California. This includes billions of dollars to create technology hubs across the country and help develop new, cutting-edge technologies in renewable energy, bioengineering, cybersecurity and quantum computing.“In addition to boosting our competitiveness and safeguarding our supply of advanced computer chips, this bill will add thousands of good-paying jobs for American workers, especially those in historically underserved communities, which will further broaden the economic benefits of the bill. I hope to see many of those jobs land in California.“I’m particularly pleased that this bill will be a boon for California’s tech industry, and I’m hopeful that manufacturing funds will end up in the state that continues to lead the world in innovation. California’s highly-skilled workforce and cutting-edge industry makes it uniquely positioned to establish manufacturing operations, building on the state’s strong record in driving the global high-tech economy.”###"

The coronavirus pandemic hit this industry particularly hard, and I encourage everyone to look for the Certified American Grown logo when purchasing flowers.” “Alaska’s beautiful blooms are some of the most sought-after in the world for weddings and events, thanks in part to being available well after the traditional growing season has ended in other parts of the country,” said Senator Sullivan. “My Senate colleagues had the chance to see some of our massive, world-class peonies from Alaska at our Senate lunch two weeks ago in the Capitol. I’m glad to join Senator Feinstein in putting forward a Senate resolution to designate July as ‘American Grown Flower Month,’ recognizing all of the hard-working Americans who bring these flowers to us—including the hundreds of local, family-owned growers in Alaska!” “California proudly produces approximately 80 percent of the country’s fresh cut flowers, the most of any state,” said Senator Padilla. “Flower crops are important to the economic vitality of our state, yet less than 25 percent of flowers used in the U.S. are domestically produced. I am proud to support this resolution to support the use of American-grown flowers across the federal government.” Full text of the resolution is available here and below: Title: Expressing support for the designation of July 2022 as ``American Grown Flower and Foliage Month''. Whereas cut flower and foliage growers in the United States are hard-working, dedicated individuals who bring beauty, economic stimulus, and pride to their communities and the United States;Whereas the people of the United States have a long history of using flowers and foliage grown in the United States to bring beauty to important events and express affection for loved ones;Whereas consumers spend over $38,300,000,000 each year on floral products, including cut flowers, garden plants, bedding, and indoor plants;Whereas, each year, an increasing number of households in the United States purchase fresh cut flowers and foliage from more than 12,000 florists and floral establishments;Whereas the annual per capita spending on floral products by consumers in the United States is more than $170;Whereas the people of the United States increasingly want to support domestically produced foods and agricultural products and would prefer to buy locally grown flowers and foliage whenever possible, yet a majority of domestic consumers do not know where the flowers and foliage they purchase are grown;Whereas, in response to increased demand, the “Certified American Grown” logo was created in July 2014 in order to educate and empower consumers to purchase flowers and foliage from domestic producers;Whereas millions of stems of domestically grown flowers and foliage are now “Certified American Grown”;Whereas domestic flower and foliage farmers produce thousands of varieties of flowers and foliage across the United States, such as peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in California, lupines in Maine, tulips in Washington, lilies in Oregon, larkspur in Texas, and leatherleaf in Florida;Whereas the flower and foliage varieties with the highest production in the United States are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, gladiolas, roses, and leatherleaf;Whereas people in every State have access to domestically grown flowers and foliage, yet only 22 percent of flowers and foliage sold in the United States are domestically grown;Whereas the domestic cut flower and foliage industry—            (1) creates a substantial economic impact daily; and            (2) supports hundreds of growers, thousands of small businesses, and tens of thousands of jobs in the United States;Whereas most domestic cut flowers and foliage are sold in the United States within 24 to 48 hours after harvest and last longer than flowers shipped longer distances;Whereas flowers and foliage grown domestically enhance the ability of the people of the United States to festively celebrate weddings and births and honor those who have passed;Whereas flower and foliage giving has been a holiday tradition in the United States for generations;Whereas flowers and foliage speak to the beauty of motherhood on Mother’s Day and to the spirit of love on Valentine’s Day;Whereas flowers and foliage are an essential part of other holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa;Whereas flowers and foliage help commemorate the service and sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces on Memorial Day and Veterans Day; andWhereas the Senate encourages the cultivation of flowers and foliage in the United States by domestic flower and foliage farmers: Now, therefore, be itResolved, That the Senate—            (1) supports the designation of July 2022 as “American Grown Flower and Foliage Month”;            (2) recognizes that purchasing flowers and foliage grown in the United States supports the farmers, small businesses, jobs, and economy of the United States;            (3) recognizes that growing flowers and foliage in the United States is a vital part of the agricultural industry of the United States;            (4) recognizes that cultivating flowers and foliage domestically enhances the ability of the people of the United States to festively celebrate holidays and special occasions; and            (5) urges all people of the United States to proactively showcase flowers and foliage grown in the United States in order to show support for—                        (A) the flower and foliage farmers, processors, and distributors in the United States; and                        (B) the agricultural industry of the United States overall.###"

The legislation will encourage research on marijuana and its potential benefits by streamlining the application process for researchers and removing FDA barriers. The members released the following statements praising the bill’s passage in the House:“After years of effort, the House took a major step today in passing our legislation to make it easier for researchers to study how marijuana-derived medications can best treat various conditions. The bill will help get safe, FDA-approved, marijuana-derived medications safely to patients in need. I am confident that the Senate will quickly pass this amended version of the bill and send it to President Biden for his signature,” Senator Feinstein said.“Research is a foundational element for cannabis policy,” said Congressman Blumenauer, Founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. “At a time when there are four million registered medical marijuana patients and many more likely to self-medicate, it is crucial that researchers are able to fully study the health benefits of cannabis. For too long, the federal government has stood in the way of science and progress, creating barriers for researchers obtaining resources and approval to study cannabis. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation is an important first step to changing that.” “As a physician who has conducted NIH-sponsored research, I am pleased that this bill has finally passed and that scientists will be able to research what medical marijuana can and cannot do. While there is evidence to suggest that medical marijuana may be beneficial in the treatment of some diseases like glaucoma and epilepsy, only scientific research will prove the veracity of the many claims regarding efficacy for other diseases. Despite lacking much scientific research, over three dozen states have already legalized medical marijuana, and the American public deserves to know the effect modern marijuana has on the human body. While I support additional research for the use of medical marijuana, my position on recreational marijuana remains the same – I categorically oppose it,” Congressman Harris said. “This bipartisan bill is critical to better understanding the marijuana plant and its potential benefits and hazards. It will empower the FDA to analyze CBD and medical marijuana products in a safe and responsible way so that the American public can decide whether to utilize them in the future based on sound scientific data. Researching marijuana is widely supported on both sides of the aisle, and it’s a smart step forward,” Senator Grassley said. “The medical community agrees that we need more research to learn about marijuana’s potential health benefits, but our federal laws today are standing in the way of us finding those answers,” said Senator Schatz. “We are now one step closer to removing excessive barriers that make it difficult for researchers to study the effectiveness and safety of marijuana, and hopefully, give patients more treatment options.” ###"

Each year, $200 million in grants will be available through the program. Communities will be able to receive grants up to $250,000 for wildfire protection plans and education efforts, and grants of up to $10 million will be awarded for infrastructure and resilience projects.“These grants will be critical for California communities to prepare for dangerous wildfire conditions as climate change continues to worsen and temperatures rise,” Senator Feinstein said. “We know that rising temperatures will lead to hotter, deadlier and more destructive wildfires. One of our best tools to combat this danger is to plan ahead and implement resiliency projects to mitigate the risk of future wildfires.”Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said: “These investments are crucial to tackling the wildfire crisis, climate change and public safety. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is giving us new resources and tools to invest in communities in the areas where they live and the forests they value.”U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said: “Insight and guidance from the communities most at risk for catastrophic wildfires helps us mitigate those risks more effectively.

Whales who are held for display often exhibit signs of suffering and distress – and die significantly younger than whales who live in the wild. Currently, there are roughly 50 whales being held in captivity in the United States.“I’m proud to partner with Congressman Schiff on a bill to end the capture, breeding, importation and exportation of orca, beluga, pilot and false killer whales,” said Senator Feinstein. “The conditions these whales live in contribute to far shorter lifespans – captive orcas typically live just 12 years compared to 40 years in the wild – and there is significant evidence that captivity is excruciating for these mammals. SeaWorld announced in 2016 that its current orcas in captivity will be its last; the federal government should expand on this example and prohibit all new captive whales for purposes of entertainment.” “Whales are among the most intelligent, fascinating, and beautiful creatures in the world,” said Rep. Schiff. “And they deserve to live freely in their natural habitats – not in captivity where their lives are defined by the four walls of a concrete tank. The SWIMS Act would protect these magnificent creatures, and I want to thank Senator Feinstein and Representatives Huffman and DelBene for their partnership on this important legislation.” “The science and tragic real-life experiences have shown us time and again that marine mammals suffer from being in captivity - often being exploited and abused. But our laws and practices don’t reflect that,” said Rep. Huffman. “We need to finally make the humane changes that have been needed for decades. With our bill, these extraordinary mammals can thrive and be appreciated where they belong — in the wild.” “Orcas are icons of the Pacific Northwest and they should stay free in the wild. The science is clear – when these marine mammals and other large whales are kept in captivity, they are often exploited, treated poorly, or abused,” said Rep. DelBene. “The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen our animal welfare laws by ending future capture and breeding of these creatures for public display. These majestic marine mammals should be observed and cherished in their natural habitat where they belong, not in captivity.” Specifically, the SWIMS Act would:The SWIMS Act is cosponsored by Representatives Carolyn B.

Unfortunately these birds and other threatened species are being put at risk by pesticide use in the Refuges that were designed to protect them.” The senators highlighted recent determinations made by the Environmental Protection Agency “that some of the most commonly used agricultural chemicals are likely to adversely affect endangered species.” For example, the most commonly used herbicide in the United States, glyphosate (popularly known as Roundup), is likely to adversely affect 93% of all species listed as Endangered or Threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Of the neonicotinoids -- the most commonly used class of insecticides in the United States -- studies show that imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam were likely to harm 80%, 82%, and 81% of all listed species, respectively. Agricultural pesticides used in refuges also “leach into the surrounding groundwater and soil and are picked up by native flowering plants and pollinators,” continued the senators. “This directly threatens non-target organisms, the 53 million annual visitors to the Refuges, and the surrounding waters and ecosystems.” The lawmakers urged the Fish and Wildlife Service to “expeditiously begin a rulemaking process to phase out the use of agricultural pesticides on National Wildlife Refuges.” This includes phasing out all chemical or biological pesticides registered under Section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, authorizing the use of pesticides for the control of invasive or non-native species only a limited basis when necessary and reinstating a 2014 memorandum phasing out the prophylactic use of neonicotinoid pesticides on refuges. In addition to Feinstein and Booker, the letter was also signed by Senators Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). Full text of the letter can be found here.###"

We’ve already seen multiple giant sequoia groves burned in the last several years. We need to take action now to protect the remaining groves before we lose these majestic parts of our heritage.”The Forest Service announced that the emergency fuel treatments will remove existing wildfire fuels through “hand cutting of small trees, mechanical removal of trees, application of borate on green stumps, pulling duff away from the base of large giant sequoias and prescribed burning.”Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said: “Without urgent action, wildfires could eliminate countless more iconic giant sequoias.

http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=ECE5B608-549B-4F00-AF14-59F32E1246D4,"Washington— Amid reports that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering partially or fully denying California’s waiver requests under the Clean Air Act for the state’s ambitious heavy-duty truck regulations, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (both D-Calif.), along with Representatives Mark DeSaulnier and Nanette Diaz Barragán (both D-Calif.) today led a group of their colleagues from the California congressional delegation in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan, urging the EPA to expeditiously grant the unconditional approval of California’s waiver requests. Denial of the waivers would be unprecedented under a Democratic administration and would allow heavy-duty trucks, which contribute approximately one third of total statewide nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, to continue polluting California’s air. In the letter, the California delegation outlines how California’s truck regulations are designed to significantly reduce emissions from heavy-duty vehicles while highlighting that any delay in implementing these regulations would devastate access to clean air for communities of color across the state. The letter also outlines the steps manufacturers have already taken to bring California-compliant engines and vehicles to market and how a denial of the full waiver would disrupt these manufacturers’ plans and investments to date.“As Californians continue to face the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, toxic air pollution, severe wildfire events, and an exacerbating drought, we write to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) follows section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act and expeditiously grants California full and unconditional waivers for California's Heavy-Duty Omnibus Low NOx Regulation, Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Emission Warranty and Maintenance Provisions, and Heavy-Duty vehicle Zero-Emission rules,” the lawmakers wrote. “Heavy-duty trucks are a significant source of California's air pollution challenges, contributing approximately one third of total statewide nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and approximately one quarter of diesel particulate matter emissions. These impacts fall disproportionately on low-income communities and people of color due to their proximity to heavy vehicle traffic and trucking corridors. In fact, recent studies show that diesel traffic is the largest source of NOx disparity by race in the United States.” Senators Feinstein and Padilla are taking action to address the existential threat of the climate crisis. They have continuously advocated to strengthen transportation emissions standards, including successfully pushing the Biden administration to set national clean car standards modeled on the “California Framework Agreement” and to revise the NOx emission standards for on-highway heavy-duty trucks, which the EPA has proposed to do. Full text of the letter available here and below: Dear Administrator Regan: As Californians continue to face the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, toxic air pollution, severe wildfire events, and an exacerbating drought, we write to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) follows section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act and expeditiously grants California full and unconditional waivers for California's Heavy-Duty Omnibus Low NOx Regulation, Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Emission Warranty and Maintenance Provisions, and Heavy-Duty vehicle Zero-Emission rules. Heavy-duty trucks are a significant source of California's air pollution challenges, contributing approximately one third of total statewide nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and approximately one quarter of diesel particulate matter emissions. These impacts fall disproportionately on low-income communities and people of color due to their proximity to heavy vehicle traffic and trucking corridors. In fact, recent studies show that diesel traffic is the largest source of NOx disparity by race in the United States. California's truck regulations under consideration by EPA for waivers are designed to significantly reduce emissions from heavy-duty vehicles both in the near- and the long-term. EPA' s unconditional approval of the waivers represent one of the Biden-Harris Administration's greatest opportunities to address both the climate crisis and environmental injustice. Delaying the implementation of these regulations - even by 2 years as some industry representatives have advocated for- would result in NOx emission increases of 39,000 tons relative to full implementation, resulting in an estimated 480 more premature deaths and 390 more hospitalizations in California. Manufacturers have already committed to bringing California-compliant engines and vehicles to market in 2024. Both traditional truck manufacturers and dedicated zero-emission-only truck manufacturers are offering over 100 models of zero-emission vehicles - from heavy pickups and vans to Class 8 tractors - with more models and types of powertrains announced for introduction between now and 2024. The technical feasibility of the regulations is not in question, and California's proposed truck rules would provide manufacturers with sufficient lead time to develop and apply the technology needed to meet the new standards. A denial of the full waiver or revocation of standards would disrupt these manufacturers' plans and would also have negative impacts on manufacturers that have invested significant resources to comply with California's standards. Congress established the Clean Air Act waiver provision to provide the State of California with the authority to develop and implement its own motor vehicle emissions control program to respond to the compelling and extraordinary air quality conditions affecting California's residents. This is particularly true for those residents living and working in disadvantaged communities that are disproportionally impacted by truck emissions. The waiver provision also allows California to innovate advanced solutions to addressing vehicular sources of air pollution. EPA has previously issued California waivers impacting the heavy-duty sector without delaying implementation on numerous occasions: California's 1995 Amendments to its Urban Bus and the 1998 NOx standard for heavy-duty engines (waiver issued -Duty October On-Board 6, 2004), the Diagnostics Heavy-Duty regulations Clean (waivers Idle issued regulation on (waiver issued December on 10, February 2012, 16, and 2012), November and the 7, Heavy2016). Therefore, we expect that EPA will continue to follow federal that law and support California’s efforts to protect the public health of our communities and the five other states that have adopted California heavy-duty standards, as well as other states that are considering such adoption. Sincerely,###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=53AA38ED-8CB5-4D69-887C-1487588CFF46,"Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (both D-Calif.) applauded the Energy and Natural Resources committee for advancing their Salton Sea Projects Improvements Act, which would increase federal investment in ecological improvement projects at the Salton Sea and significantly expand federal partnerships with state, local and Tribal governments to address the public health and environmental crises at the Salton Sea. “For years the Salton Sea has been receding, threatening the local ecosystem and creating toxic dust clouds that are harming the surrounding communities,” said Senator Feinstein. “The Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced our bill that will make it easier for every level of government to work together to address the problem and provide the resources necessary to protect public health and restore vital habitat.”“The environmental and public health crises at the Salton Sea have been neglected for too long, and it’s wreaking havoc on the environment and surrounding communities,” said Senator Padilla. “As the climate crisis continues to exacerbate the worst megadrought in over 1,200 years, and as the Bureau of Reclamation is asking states to conserve more Colorado River water supplies, now is the time to ensure that the federal government has the strongest tools to mitigate devastating impacts from the increasingly exposed Salton Sea lakebed. Importantly, my bill with Senator Feinstein and Representative Ruiz will better enable the federal government to advance environmental justice and protect the public health of the disadvantaged communities surrounding the lake. I’m glad to see this bill advance out of committee and I look forward to continuing to build momentum to pass this in the Senate.” “We need more action to address the pressing environmental and public health crisis at the Salton Sea,” said Dr. Ruiz. “My bill with Senators Padilla and Feinstein, the Salton Sea Projects Improvements Act, urgently opens up more resources and adds more flexibility to add more shovels to the ground on projects that protect the public’s health. I am impatient with our progress and will never stop working to strengthen our all-hands-on-deck approach to the environmental hazard at the Salton Sea.”“We are excited to see this bill move forward to enable critical federal investment in improving conditions at the Salton Sea,” said California Secretary for Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot. “This adds to a growing sense of momentum as the state’s Salton Sea Management Program works with local, Tribal and federal partners to break ground on projects around the sea to deliver on our commitments and advance environmental justice and equity for the region in the face of climate change.” “I applaud Senators Padilla and Feinstein for moving this key legislation forward in the Senate to increase Bureau of Reclamation funding for the Salton Sea,” commented Salton Sea Authority Executive Director G. Patrick O’Dowd. “Last month, the Commissioner testified that she seeks major cuts to California’s Colorado River water supplies which would significantly impact the disadvantaged and tribal communities surrounding the Salton Sea,” O’Dowd continued. “The senators’ legislation is an important tool in the toolbox to help Reclamation meet its obligation to assess, fund and implement its own Salton Sea mitigation projects to address those federally-imposed impacts.” “The Salton Sea Improvements Act is a huge step forward for the Sea and we thank Senator Padilla and Senator Feinstein for their efforts to move this legislation forward,” said Frank Ruiz, Audubon’s Salton Sea Program Director. “For decades, Audubon has dedicated time and resources to drive conservation efforts at the Sea and protect the birds and people who rely on this fragile ecosystem. We support this additional federal attention to bring solutions to the Sea and we urge swift passage of this bill.” The committee also advanced the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act, the Rosie the Riveter National Historic Site Expansion Act and the Rim of the Valley Corridor Protection Act. The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act would add an adjacent 3,925 acres to the current Monument, support tribal co-management and change the name of the additional wildlands from “Walker Ridge” to Molok Luyuk—Patwin for “Condor Ridge”—a name the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation provided. The Rosie the Riveter National Historic Site Expansion Act would add Nystrom Elementary School to the existing Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond, CA and authorize the National Park Service to add other historically relevant sites to the park’s boundaries. The Rim of the Valley Corridor Protection Act would add more than 191,000 acres of the Rim of the Valley Corridor to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. “I am so proud to represent the Richmond community and to work in Congress to ensure its contributions during WWII are recognized,” Congressman DeSaulnier said. “By preserving Nystrom Elementary School as part of the historic park, we honor the sacrifices made by the Rosies in Contra Costa County who worked on the home front and we help preserve their legacy for future generations.” “Conserving California’s special places has been a lifelong passion throughout my tenure in the state legislature, as Deputy Secretary of the Interior to President Clinton, and now as a member of Congress representing Lake County. I introduced the ‘Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act’ in the U.S. House of Representatives to protect and expand the national monument, and I applaud Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein for championing this legislation in the United States Senate,” said Congressman John Garamendi. “Back in 2016, I worked to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Monument,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “Earlier this year, I was proud to join Rep. Garamendi to expand this designation and protect more of our pristine public lands. The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is crucial for protecting the biodiversity of the land and boosting our economy through recreational opportunities. I am glad the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act is being taken up in the Senate, led by Senators Feinstein and Padilla, and I look forward to seeing it signed into law by President Biden.” “Molok Luyuk – or Condor Ridge – is a special part of Northern California and deserves special protections. We appreciate Senator Padilla and Feinstein’s leadership on this and their insistence that Native American voices be part of the conversation,” said Chairman Anthony Roberts of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. “Our ancestors traveled and traded there for centuries. With these protections, the unique resources on Molok Luyuk will endure, and Californians will be able to enjoy its natural beauty for generations to come.” “We are thrilled to see this legislation pass through the senate and grateful to the leadership of Senators Padilla and Feinstein in the work to expand Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument,” said Sandra Schubert, Executive Director of Tuleyome. “Molok Luyuk is a treasure. As neighbors we have long appreciated its natural beauty, diverse wildlife, rare plants, and indigenous cultural value. This is exciting progress in the effort to protect Molok Luyuk from current and future threats while respecting Tribal stewardship over the lands.” ### "

Thanks to the committee’s vote today, we’re one step closer to fixing that. Our bill would protect portions of the Rim of the Valley Corridor, connecting more people with the natural beauty of the foothills of the surrounding mountains, linking critical wildlife corridors and protecting sensitive habitat.” “Meaningfully addressing the climate crisis includes protecting our natural spaces at all costs,” said Senator Padilla. “Preserving the Rim of the Valley Corridor is critical to helping California and the nation meet our goal of conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030, and I’m glad to see that our bill to protect this area’s natural resources and diverse wildlife is advancing in the Senate. I will continue to fight for additional conservation measures to advance in the Senate, like my PUBLIC Lands Act, which would expand protections for over one million acres more of California’s public lands.”“The Rim of the Valley Corridor is an area of breathtaking natural beauty, cherished by millions of residents in the Los Angeles Basin and the millions more who visit each year. Home to beloved trails and outdoor recreation areas, diverse ecosystems, and famous wildlife, it has been my mission for nearly 20 years to protect and preserve this Southern California jewel,” said Representative Schiff. “I am thrilled by the encouraging progress the Senate has made today, and look forward to a vote by the full chamber soon so we ensure future generations can continue to enjoy all this special place has to offer.”The proposed expansion is based on a six-year study of the region completed by the National Park Service in 2015. It would allow NPS and the local community to work together to better protect natural resources and habitat in the corridor and improve access for recreational and educational purposes.The legislation gives NPS the authority to:The proposed expansion respects existing private property rights and local land-use authorities. It would not require a landowner to participate in any conservation or recreation activities or place additional restrictions on property owners. The legislation does not allow for land acquisition through eminent domain.Click on image for a larger map."

This $3.4 million is the first tranche of a total of $17 million over five years that we secured in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Stopping the spread of invasive species requires a long-term approach, including habitat restoration, conservation, and species control. Lake Tahoe is not only one of the most special places in the world, it is sacred ancestral land to the Washoe Tribe. Protecting Tahoe’s deep blue water and unique ecosystem needs to be a collaborative effort, and we are glad to see the administration engaging Tribal Nations as part of this work.” The agreements will support efforts to remove the Eurasian watermilfoil— a pernicious aquatic invasive plant— as well as funding for public outreach and education about aquatic invasive species, and investments in permanent inspection stations. A total of $17 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds will be made available for such work over the next five years.  "

As opposed to a type of round that was designed not to just kill, but to maim and disable and disarm – and if you injure someone, have a far greater extent for injury, which is something that is good for combat, but we’re seeing it happen here.” Video of the exchange is available here and a transcript follows: Senator Feinstein said: “For me, this is a very emotional hearing. On May 14, an 18-year-old killed 10 people in a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, using an assault weapon. A week later, an 18-year-old killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, using an assault weapon. “On the Fourth of July, a 21-year-old killed seven people and injured dozens more at a community parade in Highland Park, Ill., using an assault weapon. And just this past weekend, a 20-year-old killed three people and injured two others at a shopping mall in Greenwood, Ind., using an assault weapon. “The 41 people killed in these four shootings in just the past two months – think about that, they would all still be with us today if it were not for the easy access that people, and particularly young people, have to assault weapons. “I also believe it’s Congress’s job to make sure people feel safe going to the grocery store, to school, to parades and to shopping malls. And that safety is not happening. “I believe the solution is simple: we must ban assault weapons. Assault weapons are basically weapons of war.  They have no place in our communities. “The federal Assault Weapons Ban was in place from 1994 to 2004. A 2016 study showed that during that time, the number of gun massacres fell by 37 percent, and the number of people dying from gun massacres fell by 43 percent. In the 10 years after the ban lapsed, there was a 183 percent increase in massacres and a 239 percent increase in massacre deaths. “So it’s clear that the Assault Weapons Ban helped make our communities safer. I strongly believe we must pass it again. “Dr. Hunter, how do assault weapons differ from other types of firearms, and do you believe a ban on assault weapons would be effective?” Dr. Kyleanne Hunter: “When we talk about these weapons, there’s a lot of discussion around semi-automatic versus automatic versus three-round burst. And that refers to a firing mechanism. Each time you pull the trigger one bullet comes out. “But there are far different characteristics between different types weapons. Shotguns, you pull the trigger one time, one bullet comes out, very different type of round, very different muzzle velocity. So if we start… there is quite a bit of medical research that shows the combination of the .223 or .556 round – because a lot of this does comes from the military medical community as well – in combination with the muzzle velocity on these weapons, do an incredible amount of damage to the human body and that’s what they were designed to do. “And that is substantially different than a 9mm round that was designed for a clean entry, kill-type wound. As opposed to a type of round that was designed not to just kill, but to maim and disable and disarm – and if you injure someone, have a far greater extent for injury, which is something that is good for combat, but we’re seeing it happen here. “There’s also some substantial differences of just the size and creation of this rifle. It was designed to be lighter. If we look at the M16 as opposed to the M1, which was the previous service weapon, there’s a three-pound differential, so this is a lighter, more maneuverable weapon than several of the other hunting rifles that you might commonly see. “So I think it’s important that when we talk about weapons, we talk about more than just if they’re semi-automatic or fully automatic because the caliber, the muzzle velocity, the weight, the maneuverability, all of these are characteristics of the weapons that are important as well.”###"

The bill was passed by the Senate last year so it now heads to the White House for the president’s signature.The facility is one of only two Indian Health Services Youth Regional Treatment Centers currently operating in California and provides treatment for American Indian and Alaskan Native children ages 12 to 17 years who suffer from substance abuse disorders. However, the 20-acre facility is only accessible via a dilapidated dirt road on private land. The bill would authorize Indian Health Services to acquire land and build a paved road to the treatment center.“I’m grateful that Congress passed our bill to ensure Desert Sage patients will have access to the care they need,” said Senator Feinstein. “Desert Sage is one of only two Indian Health Services Youth Regional Treatment Centers in California. Unfortunately, heavy rains can wash out the old dirt road leading to the facility, making it difficult or even impossible for patients to reach. Our bill fixes the problem by allowing the Indian Health Service to buy land and pave a road, allowing patients to travel safely to the treatment center. I want to thank my colleagues for passing our bill and I look forward to President Biden signing it into law.”The bill was cosponsored by Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and cosponsored by Representatives Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.), Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.).What the bill does:BackgroundThe Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center has provided treatment for American Indian and Alaskan Native youth since 2016. Previously, indigenous youth had to use out-of-state facilities, which removed them from their support systems during a crucial time of recovery. It is one of 12 centers nationwide and can serve up to 32 patients at a time."

I’m pleased the House Judiciary Committee is voting on this lifesaving legislation, and I hope the Senate will follow suit.“Military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines have only one purpose: to kill as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. That’s why they’ve become the weapon of choice for mass shootings. “When the original Assault Weapons Ban was in place from 1994-2004, gun massacres declined by 37 percent compared with the decade before. After the ban expired, the number of massacres rose by 183 percent.“We were once again reminded of the deadly nature of these weapons with the recent shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde and Highland Park, three shootings that left more than three dozen dead at the hands of young men with assault weapons.“Unfortunately, these mass shootings will continue unless Congress acts. It’s long overdue for Congress to pass commonsense gun reform and remove these weapons of war from our streets.”Background:"

Wade, the conservative Supreme Court majority indicated it is willing to attack other constitutional rights, including same-sex and interracial marriage,” said Senator Feinstein. “In fact, one justice specifically noted that the court’s Obergefell decision confirming same-sex marriage should be revisited. Our bill would repeal the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act and ensure that marriage equality remains the law of the land.”“Marriage equality is a constitutional right that has been well established by the Supreme Court as precedent and this freedom should be protected,” said Senator Baldwin. “The bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act will enshrine and protect marriage equality and make sure legal, same-sex and interracial marriages are recognized. I take great pride in being a part of this bipartisan effort to protect the progress we have made on marriage equality, because we cannot allow this freedom and right to be denied.”“Maine voters legalized same-sex marriages in our state nearly a decade ago, and since Obergefell, all Americans have had the right to marry the person whom they love,” said Senator Collins. “During my time in the Senate, I have been proud to support legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, from strengthening hate crime prevention laws, to repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ to ensuring workplace equality. This bill is another step to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the rights of all Americans.”“Three weeks ago, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court not only repealed Roe v. Wade and walked back 50 years of precedent, it signaled that other rights, like the right to same-sex marriage, are next on the chopping block,” said Representative Nadler. “As this court may take aim at other fundamental rights, we cannot sit idly by as the hard-earned gains of the equality movement are systematically eroded. If Justice Thomas’s concurrence teaches anything it’s that we cannot let your guard down or the rights and freedoms that we have come to cherish will vanish into a cloud of radical ideology and dubious legal reasoning. Today, we take an important step towards protecting the many families and children who rely on the rights and privileges underpinned by the constitutional guarantee of marriage equality. The Respect for Marriage Act will further add stability and certainty for these children and families.”“The Respect for Marriage Act will protect same-sex and interracial marriages from any radical or bigoted decision that may come from the current extreme Supreme Court majority,” said Representative Cicilline. “As chairman of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I want the LGBTQ+ community to know that this caucus is fighting for them and their right to live freely. This legislation will protect their marriages and ensure they continue to be recognized, even if a future Supreme Court overturns landmark marriage equality decisions. I am proud of this bill, and I urge Congress to promptly pass this legislation.”The Respect for Marriage Act would:The Respect for Marriage Act is strongly supported by leading national organizations including ACLU, Center for American Progress, Equality Federation, Family Equality, Freedom for All Americans, GLAD, Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, National Black Justice Coalition, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Women’s Law Center and PFLAG."

Today’s letter follows recent calls for the administration to swiftly implement provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law pertaining to wildfire and a new occupational series for federal wildland firefighters.“Congress recently provided $600 million to your agencies to increase firefighter salaries, and we are pleased that federal firefighters are now starting to receive these pay raises. We urge your agencies to take advantage of this pay supplement to recruit additional firefighters and reach your staffing targets before this year’s California fire season begins in earnest,” the senators wrote.They continued, “We understand that the U.S. Forest Service has a shortage of approximately 1,200 firefighters, 500 of which are in California, and the Interior Department has a shortage of roughly 450 firefighters, 150 of which are in California. Federal firefighter shortages in past fire seasons required the diversion of other resources to combat these fires, putting at risk not only federally owned forests, but also state and private lands.”Full text of the letter is available here and below:July 19, 2022The Honorable Tom VilsackSecretaryU.S. Department of Agriculture1400 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C. 20250 The Honorable Deb HaalandSecretaryU.S. Department of the Interior1849 C Street, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20528 Dear Secretaries Vilsack and Haaland,We write to express our ongoing concerns regarding the shortage of wildland firefighters at the U.S. Forest Service and Department of the Interior.  For years, these staffing shortages have been attributed to the low salary and high risk associated with these positions.  Congress recently provided $600 million to your agencies to increase firefighter salaries, and we are pleased that federal firefighters are now starting to receive these pay raises.  We urge your agencies to take advantage of this pay supplement to recruit additional firefighters and reach your staffing targets before this year’s California fire season begins in earnest. As you well know, wildfires are one of the most critical challenges currently facing the West; the eight largest wildfires in California history have occurred since 2017.  During that span, more than 10 million acres have burned, killing nearly 200 people and destroying more than 32,000 homes.  Because 58 percent of the forestland is federally-owned, the federal government has an obligation to provide the resources necessary to combat these fires.  Nevertheless, we understand that the U.S. Forest Service has a shortage of approximately 1,200 firefighters, 500 of which are in California, and the Interior Department has a shortage of roughly 450 firefighters, 150 of which are in California.  Federal firefighter shortages in past fire seasons required the diversion of other resources to combat these fires, putting at risk not only federally owned forests, but also state and private lands. With the funds Congress provided through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, your agencies have the responsibility to demonstrate the efficacy of higher salaries and the need for a permanent pay increase for wildland firefighters.  We therefore urge you to fill the outstanding vacancies without further delay, with additional hiring events if necessary, and request that you update us regularly on your progress. Sincerely,Dianne FeinsteinUnited States Senator Alex PadillaUnited States Senator"

The COVID EIDL program has provided loans to nearly four million small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic—serving as an essential source of capital for small businesses, especially those that could not obtain credit to survive the pandemic from other lenders. “While we recognize the agency has assisted an unprecedented number of small businesses throughout the pandemic, our offices continue to hear from thousands of prospective borrowers awaiting consideration,” the senators wrote. “We also continue to hear from EIDL applicants with disputed rejections who have received no communication from the administration in months. EIDL was a lifeline for businesses throughout this pandemic, but many of them continue to struggle. The program is too important to shut down prematurely. While funds remain, we expect SBA to process all eligible applications and appeals that have been submitted by the request deadline.”On Thursday, April 28, the SBA announced a May 6, 2022 submission deadline for COVID EIDL loan modifications, increase requests, and denial reconsiderations. Many applicants who submitted their applications prior to the deadline remain in limbo due to the SBA’s decision to stop processing certain applications. Instead, the SBA has issued a vague commitment to process “workable” applications, which has led to many deserving borrowers not receiving the funds they need.The senators continued, “Given that many applicants have not received final consideration, we find it difficult to understand SBA’s decision to stop processing requests that were submitted by the May 6th submission deadline…‘Workability’ is not an acceptable standard to justify rejecting a borrower who is eligible and in need. The bar for denial is eligibility, not SBA’s willingness to continue processing applications. We find it particularly troubling that your agency continues to tell our offices that loans cannot be completed due to the exhaustion of funds when $800 million in loan subsidy remains – enough to support more than $7 billion in lending.”Full text of the letter is available here.###"

Kuster said. “Dam owners and developers in New Hampshire and across the country are ready and willing to transform our nation’s water infrastructure to jump-start hydropower energy production. But, this progress is being stifled by a lengthy and inconsistent permitting review process. That’s why I am proud to support this bill to ensure that permits for hydropower dams receive a transparent and timely review so clean energy projects can get online and begin powering our nation’s grid.”Statements of support: “Adding hydropower generation to existing non-powered Army Corps dams has the potential to power more than 2 million homes with clean, renewable energy. Despite this immense potential, red tape and inconsistencies within the permitting process poses a major barrier to getting these projects over the finish line. Developing non-powered dams at federally-owned facilities will play a role in decarbonizing our nation’s grid, and this legislation will give hydropower developers the certainty they need to finance and construct these facilities. I commend Senator Daines, Senator Feinstein and Representative Kuster for their bipartisan leadership and for recognizing the critical need for hydropower.” – Malcolm Woolf, CEO and President of the National Hydropower Association “America holds the technical potential to expand the size of our hydropower fleet by 50%, but we must first improve our permitting process. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers is the largest owner of hydropower in the country, accounting for about 25 percent of the hydropower in America, and this bill makes permitting at their facilities more manageable so we can move towards increasing capacity.” – Rich Powell, ClearPath Action CEO “New, clean electricity is needed in every corner of the country right now, and even more will be needed in the near future. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns the dams that present the best opportunities to add new hydropower, enhancing infrastructure that is already paid for. Efficient, consistent, and coordinated development will speed the path to bringing reliable, round-the-clock clean energy – and economic development opportunities that rely on clean electricity – to river communities throughout the nation.” – Paul Jacob, CEO of Rye Development The bill will help the Army Corps of Engineers expedite the retrofitting of existing non-power dams for clean, renewable hydropower. It will also encourage the Army Corps of Engineers to increase power at existing hydropower dams. The bill text is available here.###"

During that span, wildfire has burned 10 million acres throughout the state, killed nearly 200 people and destroyed more than 32,000 homes. The group discussed potential executive and legislative action to better support and streamline National Guard firefighting capabilities and the continued partnership between state first responders and the National Guard. The governor and senators raised the need for increased access to aircraft for fire ignition detection and fire perimeter tracking. They also highlighted the need to remove the arbitrary cap on the number of excess military aircraft that DoD may transfer at no cost to FEMA or the Forest Service for firefighting efforts.The governor and senators underscored the need to take urgent action to mitigate the intensifying climate impacts exacerbating wildfires in California and across the Western United States.

http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/op-eds?ContentRecord_id=2B3DBD51-E758-4645-A301-B03EDD6A1D23,"Originally published in Defense News By Dianne Feinstein and Marco RubioAt a time when China and Russia are seeking to overtake the United States in space — having grown their combined space assets by 70% from 2019 to 2021 — we cannot afford any setbacks in our own space program.That’s why we created the Space Force in 2019 — to maintain our edge in space. Active duty Air Force units with space missions were transferred to the new service to intensify focus on this critical domain. But there was a key exception: Space units in the National Guard were left under the Air Force because a corresponding “Space National Guard” was never formed.We have proposed establishing a National Guard component for the Space Force to eliminate that needless division. On June 22, the House Armed Services Committee voted to include this provision in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, and the Senate should follow suit.Our space units should operate as a seamless team, but they can’t do that while divided between two services. Instead, they’re dependent on added bureaucracy to conduct basic functions — training troops, acquiring resources, setting standards, inspecting units and mobilizing personnel. The division also makes it impossible to build a strong organizational culture.Moreover, unless the Air National Guard’s space units are transformed into a Space National Guard, those units may lose their space mission. That would come at great cost. We would likely lose the wealth of expertise that exists in 14 Air National Guard space units in seven states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York and Ohio) as well as Guam.There would also be a financial cost. A 2021 Air Force report found that decommissioning the Air Guard’s space units would create “an immediate gap in capability” and incur “a cost to rebuild the mission capability within the US Space Force.” The report concluded that shifting those units into a Space National Guard would be the most cost-effective path forward.In contrast, the Office of Management and Budget cited an annual price tag of “up to $500 million annually” as its reason for opposing a Space National Guard in last year’s defense bill. But that was a Congressional Budget Office estimate to create a Space Guard vastly larger than anyone is proposing.Similarly, the CBO estimates it would cost $100 million annually and $20 million in construction to shift existing Air Guard space units into a Space Guard. But that is just as exaggerated. It’s based on assumed liabilities, including a new $20 million headquarters building and 260 additional full-time employees, which the Air Force, Space Force and National Guard Bureau say are unnecessary — and which are not part of our legislation.As a nation, we can’t let distorted budget estimates distract us from the urgent task at hand: maintaining our edge in space. Retired Air Force Gen. Dave Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, said it well: “It is time to take action to do what should have been done at the stand-up of the Space Force — transfer the space forces in the Air National Guard into a Space National Guard.”This issue’s importance transcends partisan boundaries. Legislation to create a Space National Guard was introduced last year in the House by a Democrat and a Republican, and last month in the Senate by a Democrat and a Republican.It comes down to this: A brain drain in the space arena will have detrimental effects on our national security and our states’ readiness, and creating a Space National Guard is the best, most cost-efficient way to prevent that from happening.Congress can’t afford to look the other way on this. America’s future depends on it.Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is a member of the Appropriations Committee and its defense panel. She also serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Sen.

Wade.Funding for the program will be especially critical now that 19 states have imposed or will imminently impose bans or severe restrictions on access to abortion care in response to the Supreme Court’s decision, with several more states expected to follow.“As states move to ban abortion services outright or severely restrict these services, funding for contraception and family planning services offered by trusted providers is more crucial than ever,” the senators wrote. “While no level of funding for contraception will ever obviate the need for abortion services, we know that people across the country will turn to family planning providers for more accessible contraceptive options in the wake of this decision.”In addition to Senators Feinstein, Murray and Warren, the letter was signed by Senators Edward J.

On June 24th, the Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent by overturning Roe v. Wade, removing a fundamental constitutional right from half of all Americans. As states move to ban abortion services outright or severely restrict these services, funding for contraception and family planning services offered by trusted providers is more crucial than ever. While no level of funding for contraception will ever obviate the need for abortion services, we know that people across the country will turn to family planning providers for more accessible contraceptive options in the wake of this decision.Title X is the only federal program dedicated to providing family planning services for people with low incomes. In 2018, prior to the implementation of the Trump administration’s devastating new program rules, nearly 4,000 health centers in the network served close to 4 million patients. Title X-funded health centers are lifelines in their communities, providing high-quality family planning and sexual health care, including cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing, and other essential health care services. These centers offer care to populations that often face severe structural barriers to accessing quality health care, such as people with low incomes, individuals with no or insufficient insurance, people of color, rural communities, and LGBTQ people. These are precisely the populations who are most likely to be denied access to abortion care in a post-Roe America.Following the passage of a SB 8, a 2021 Texas law prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat, HHS provided emergency funding to Every Body Texas, the statewide Title X grantee, recognizing that family planning resources would be strained as access to abortion was restricted. The agency also awarded $10 million in grants to expand access to emergency contraception to any Title X applicant that could demonstrate an influx in demand as a result of the Texas law. Additionally, in January of this year, HHS awarded more than $6 million through this program to address increased needs for family planning services in places where restrictive laws have impacted access to reproductive health services.Unfortunately, Title X lacks sufficient funds to meet the growing need for family planning care in light of the nationwide emergency we currently face, particularly since Republicans prevented any increase for the program in the final FY 2022 appropriations package. For eight years, the Title X appropriations allocations have been flat-funded at $286 million, well below the $737 million that researchers determined was necessary to meet family planning care needs in 2016. Moving emergency Title X funding in an upcoming legislative package offers Congress the opportunity to deliver additional funding directly to these Title X providers immediately, just as demand is increasing, while the FY23 appropriations cycle is a critical way to set a new floor for Title X funding. This support will be needed in states across the country, regardless of their abortion laws; states with no or severely restricted access to care are seeing increased demand for contraception, while reproductive and sexual health centers in haven states are already strained under a surge of patients traveling from other regions, many of whom may also wish to access contraceptive care.Democrats previously recognized the importance of supporting Title X providers in the American Rescue Plan, which provided $50 million in emergency funding to help health centers recover from the impacts of the pandemic. Including emergency funding in any must-pass legislative package will demonstrate to the American public that Democrats in the House and Senate stand for reproductive rights and freedom at every level, in every state in the Union.We once again urge you to include the maximum possible funding for the Title X program.Sincerely,"

VilsackSecretaryU.S. Department of Agriculture1400 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, D.C. 20250Dear Secretary Vilsack,As you work to implement $1.5 billion in food distribution and market access programs, we urge you to prioritize investments in agricultural producers who have experienced substantial losses due to shipping delays. Specifically, we urge you to support commodity purchases for specialty crops, quality loss assistance, and cold storage at food banks and distribution hubs. These investments would make a real difference in mitigating agricultural producers’ financial losses and preventing similar disasters in the future.As you know, our nation’s food distribution system has been strained since the onset of the pandemic. For example, the cost to ship containers has increased dramatically, in some cases by nearly 1,000 percent. These challenges have had disastrous consequences for many producers, especially those growing perishable crops. The California agricultural industry lost $2.1 billion in exports between May and September 2021 alone, and experimental solutions like “pop-up” terminals have not yet alleviated the congestion. As a result, billions of pounds of healthy food are now sitting in storage and rapidly losing commercial and nutritional value. As farmers prepare for the next planting season, these financial losses on top of increased input costs will further exacerbate difficulties for producers.USDA investments in agricultural producers who have experienced substantial losses due to shipping delays would help deliver products to market at home and abroad, thereby providing consumers with healthier food options, stimulating the economies of rural communities, and ensuring our nation does its part to support global food security.

This puts millions of jobs, families, and communities who depend on the cleanliness of coastal waters at risk, which could further create uncertainty in our economic recovery.In the letter to Secretary Haaland, the senators also highlighted how expanding offshore drilling would not only fail to alleviate the strain on current gas prices, but also make it more difficult to address the worsening climate crisis. According to a recent study, a five year plan that included no new leasing would have no impact on domestic oil production through 2027 and only negligible impacts through 2035.“President Biden recognized the threat that offshore drilling poses to our coasts, economy, and climate, and he campaigned on a promise of ending offshore drilling [...] We urge you to uphold the President’s promise, and include no new lease sales in the next five-year OCS oil and gas leasing program,” the senators concluded.  In addition to Feinstein and Menendez, the letter was also signed by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.).  Full text of the letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Haaland:We write to you today regarding the recent announcement that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) within the Department of the Interior (DOI) is developing a new five-year outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing program, with a proposed program expected by June 30, 2022.  We urge you to protect our coastal communities, economies, ecosystems, and climate by including no new leasing across all planning areas in any proposed or final five-year OCS oil and gas leasing program.As Senators representing coastal states, we know that offshore drilling is inherently a risk-reward proposition, with our coastal communities shouldering the risk and oil companies reaping the rewards.  History shows us that it is not a question of if an oil spill occurs, but when.  Coastal economies that rely on our pristine waters support 3.3 million jobs and $257 billion in GDP,  and offshore drilling puts these jobs and the families and communities who depend on them at risk. We recognize that families across the country are struggling as Russia’s unjust and brutal war in Ukraine has led to increased gasoline prices and rising inflation.  As the U.S. and our partners around the world appropriately work to limit Russia’s ability to bring oil to market in order to finances its aggression, we need to do everything we can to minimize impacts here at home.  Yet, oil companies are taking advantage of the crisis to rake in record profits while gouging consumers at the pump.   To help alleviate costs, Democrats support and have offered numerous proposals to directly help American families afford gasoline and food.Increasing offshore leases will do nothing to lower current gas prices, as the average offshore lease takes about five years to develop.  One recent analysis found that a five year plan that included no new leasing would have no impact on domestic oil production through 2027 and only negligible impacts through 2035, and similarly that such a scenario would have no impact on oil and gasoline prices through 2030 and only negligible impacts through 2035.   Additionally, a report issued in November 2021 by the Department of the Interior under your leadership found that 55 percent of existing offshore leases were not currently producing, “indicating a sufficient inventory of leased acreage to sustain development for years to come.”In addition to failing to alleviate the strain on current gas prices, new offshore oil and gas leasing will make it more difficult to meet our climate goals and worsen the climate crisis.  A recent study found that protecting our coasts from new fossil fuel development would avoid over 19 billion tons of greenhouse

the Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 before declining precipitously and achieving net-zero emissions by the early 2050s.   Rather than locking in additional emissions for years to come,

down our coasts, joined by a diverse coalition of residents, stakeholders, municipalities, organizations, and elected officials from all levels of government, have come together to declare that our shores are not for sale to Big Oil.  President Biden recognized the threat that offshore drilling poses to our coasts, economy, and climate, and he campaigned on a promise of ending offshore

Bruen, which will overturn state efforts to protect Americans from gun violence – such as California’s robust requirements for obtaining a concealed carry permit. We know that you share our frustration with the decision. We commend your efforts to ensure that California is quickly and appropriately responding to the Supreme Court’s decision and we fully support the swift passage of SB 918 to replace the state law called into question by Bruen.As you know, California has the toughest gun laws in the nation. These laws help protect Californians from the epidemic of gun violence. Invalidating these laws, as the Bruen decision will do, will hamper California’s ability to reduce gun violence.California’s rigorous process for acquiring a concealed carry permit has helped save lives. Given the U.S. Supreme Court’s action, it is essential for the legislature to respond swiftly and forcefully to replace California’s concealed carry permitting regime.To that end, we are pleased to see that the legislature, the Attorney General, and the Governor have diligently prepared for this moment and are ready to advance meaningful legislation as soon as this week. Time is of the essence, and revising California’s concealed carry permitting regime is critical in ensuring protections for Californians from gun violence. We thank you for your work and ask you to move forward with this replacement legislation without delay.Sincerely,Dianne FeinsteinUnited States SenatorAlex PadillaUnited States Senator"

The letter also notes how DOT has denied states’ previous applications for extensions due to delays caused by environmental evaluation, litigation, or complex right-of-way acquisition. In 2019, the Federal Highway Administration denied 66 out of Caltrans’ 73 requests for one-year extensions to carry out projects using a total of more than $25 million in federal funding from its Emergency Relief program. The letter requests that DOT update emergency relief program regulations to extend the construction start deadline to the end of the fourth fiscal year following the year in which a disaster occurred for permanent repair projects. In the Senate, the letter is also signed by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). In the House of Representatives, the letter is also signed by Representatives Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), Karen Bass (D-Calif.), Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Mike Levin (D-Calif.), Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), Scott Peters (D-Calif.), Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). Full text of the letter can be found here and below:  Dear Secretary Buttigieg: We urge you to review and update regulations that jeopardize the availability of Emergency Relief funds in the aftermath of natural disasters and catastrophic events. Specifically, we ask that you extend the initial deadline for construction obligation to ensure our states and communities that are impacted by natural disasters have adequate time to utilize such funds to repair transportation infrastructure. Under current regulations, the Department is allowed to begin to claw back Emergency Relief funding for highway and public transit projects if those projects do not initiate construction by the end of the second fiscal year following the year in which the disaster occurred. While states can apply for extensions provided in one-year increments for delays “caused by the need for extensive environmental evaluation, litigation, or complex right-of-way acquisition,” the Department has previously denied such requests for a number of projects to repair disaster damage. As Americans grapple with severe natural disasters and extreme weather, we believe that states and communities also need practical requirements to ensure that they have a reasonable period of time to carry out significant and often complex projects necessary to repair or reconstruct transportation assets after a disaster occurs. As such, we ask that you update Emergency Relief program regulations to extend the construction start deadline to the end of the fourth fiscal year following the year in which the disaster occurred for permanent repair projects. Thank you for your consideration of our request. We look forward to continuing to work with you to build more resilient infrastructure and help communities recover from disasters.Sincerely, ###"

Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and a group of their colleagues to call on the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to address inconsistent implementation of the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy for breastmilk and formula at airport security checkpoints, and ensure lactating individuals and their infants can travel safely without fear of harassment. Under the TSA’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption, travelers are permitted to bring formula and breastmilk in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces in carry-on baggage on board an aircraft, as well as ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to prevent formula and breastmilk from spoiling. However, the overly vague policy has been inconsistently interpreted and enforced, resulting in numerous reports of TSA officials harassing lactating individuals and destructing breastmilk and expensive breastfeeding equipment.“In several reported cases, individuals were forced to dispose of breast milk, cooling accessories, or both in order to board their flights, others were harassed and humiliated, had expensive breast pumps destroyed, and even forced to undress,” wrote the lawmakers. “We need to understand why TSA’s policies are not being implemented properly, ensure that policies are clear and women can travel safely without fear of harassment, and provide parents access to remedies for mistreatment.”In a letter sent today, the senators asked for clarification on the 3-1-1 exemption policy and requested an outline of the TSA’s efforts to increase awareness about the agency’s established screening processes and procedures, investigate reports of mishandled screening processes and provide training and resources to help ensure that agents will consistently enforce these policies. The lawmakers also highlighted the potential dangers of delayed pumping for individuals who are breastfeeding, and the dangers to infants if freshly pumped breastmilk is not stored properly.“Delayed pumping leads to painful swelling of the breasts that can become engorged, which can lead to plugged milk ducts,” the lawmakers continue. “This can lead to mastitis, a bacterial breast infection and even a breast abscess, which often requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.”The letter requests that the TSA provides a response to their questions by July 6, 2022.In addition to Senators Feinstein, Hirono and Duckworth, the letter was also been signed by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.).Full text of the letter is available here and below.The Honorable David PekoskeAdministratorTransportation Security Administration6595 Springfield Center DriveSpringfield, VA 20598-6005 Dear Administrator Pekoske:We write in response to multiple reports of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials improperly implementing the agency’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy for lactating individuals, putting infants and their mothers at risk. In several reported cases, individuals were forced to dispose of breast milk, cooling accessories, or both in order to board their flights, others were harassed and humiliated, had expensive breast pumps destroyed, and even forced to undress. Under TSA’s 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travelers are explicitly permitted to bring formula and breast milk in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces in carry-on baggage on board an aircraft. Under this exemption, travelers may also carry on ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to prevent formula and breast milk from spoiling. However, the policy has been interpreted and enforced inconsistently by TSA officials.Numerous media reports have detailed this inconsistent and improper implementation and highlighted the challenges and harassment many women and parents are subject to. For example, one woman was traveling with a cooler of pumped breast milk in her carry-on and TSA called the bomb squad to inspect her milk. After 45 minutes, a full-pat down inspection, and complete disassembly of her breast pump she missed her flight and discovered that the pump was totally inoperable. In another case, TSA agents confiscated a mother’s freezer packs, refused to discuss the policy, and instructed her to repeatedly collect ice from a coffee shop for hours to keep her breast milk cool while waiting to board her flight.3 Another passenger was informed—contrary to TSA’s stated policy—that she could not travel with the ice packs unless it was accompanied by breast milk and directed her to a public restroom to pump into the bottles before she was allowed through. It is clear there are serious and persistent issues around the implementation of the 3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption travel policy among TSA security officials. Depending on the age of their child, typically a breastfeeding parent needs to express milk every two to four hours to protect against health concerns and maintain milk supply. Given the total duration of air travel—from going to the airport, getting through security, and actually flying—a breastfeeding parent will most likely need to pump at least once. Delayed pumping leads to painful swelling of the breasts that can become engorged, which can lead to plugged milk ducts. This can lead to mastitis, a bacterial breast infection and even a breast abscess, which often requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.7 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours before the milk is considered dangerous to an infant and can lead to vomiting, fever, and diarrhea—meaning access to ice packs is a necessary and critical part of the process. We need to understand why TSA’s policies are not being implemented properly, ensure that policies are clear and women can travel safely without fear of harassment, and provide parents access to remedies for mistreatment. In light of these concerns, [we] ask that you please provide responses to the following:We respectfully request TSA respond no later than July 6, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this important issue. "

Former Vice President Mike Pence even said yesterday that Republicans “must not rest and must not relent” until abortion rights are gone in “every state in the land.” “There is no time to waste: nearly half of the states already had laws in place to ban abortion or severely restrict access as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down.

I remember those dark days, passing a plate in college to collect money for a classmate to go to Mexico for an abortion. This court has returned us to that shameful past.“Roe has been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. Three generations of women have known this right, which has now been overturned by a handful of conservative judges. The next generation of women will have fewer rights than their parents. It’s a major backward move for this nation.“The only option is for Congress to pass a law to restore women’s reproduction rights and ensure control over their own health care.

And a provision closing the ‘boyfriend loophole,’ which has let too many domestic abusers continue to possess firearms.”Senator Feinstein continued: “I applaud the sponsors of the legislation now before the Senate. But I have to ask: What will it take for us to hear the wakeup call and pass stronger gun legislation?”Senator Feinstein added: “It’s simple logic: If you can’t buy a beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an assault weapon. If you can’t buy a handgun, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15.”Full remarks follow:“Our country is still mourning the tragic shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde in which a total of 31 innocent people were gunned down by teenagers using weapons of war.While these terrible events get our attention – and have in this case galvanized the Senate to act – they are only two of the 279 mass shootings that have taken place this year.So it is good that the Senate is now considering legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which we are now considering, is a good, albeit modest, bill.I’m particularly pleased to see two issues I have prioritized are addressed in this bill:The first is grants for state ‘red-flag’ laws, like the law in my home-state of California, which has proven effective at removing guns from people who have been found by a court to pose a threat.And a provision closing the ‘boyfriend loophole,’ which has let too many domestic abusers continue to possess firearms.However, while this bill is a step in the right direction, it’s far from the bold action that we need to address mass shootings that occur on a daily basis.It remains too easy for private citizens to obtain weapons of war in this country. And sadly, this bill does very little to address that tragic reality.Almost 30 years ago – in 1993 – I stood on this floor and offered the amendment to ban the sale and possession of assault weapons.That goal was simple: limit access to weapons of war that have no place on our streets.And guess what? It worked.In the 10 years the Assault Weapons Ban was law, gun massacres dropped 37 percent. After the ban lapsed in 2004, gun massacres rose by 183 percent. That’s a big difference.Back then, a different shooting was on the mind of Americans: the 101 California Street shooting in my hometown of San Francisco, where a disturbed man entered a law firm and killed eight people.For many, this tragedy was a wakeup call that required action, and we did act.Now, 30 years later, teenagers are able to purchase AR-15s, multiple high-capacity magazines, and shoot up a grocery store or elementary school. And we’re left mourning the deaths of innocent people and asking, ‘What is the solution?’I applaud the sponsors of the legislation now before the Senate. But I have to ask: What will it take for us to hear the wakeup call and pass stronger gun legislation?Our nation, our children, are under constant attack. Nowhere is safe. There are mass shootings at schools, at churches, in synagogues, newspaper offices, stores, movie theaters – on and on.It’s simply too easy to get a weapon designed to kill as many people as possible. Today’s legislation will help, but there is so much more we could and should be doing.Our gun laws are lax and they make it too simple for anyone, even those we know are prone to violence, to obtain a weapon.This is especially true of teenagers. Even though they can’t buy a beer or a pack of cigarettes, they can buy an AR-15 assault rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition once they turn 18 years old.And the results are heartbreaking. In Uvalde, 19 children and two teachers were massacred last month because an 18-year-old was able to buy an assault weapon.Just 10 days earlier in Buffalo, 10 people were shot to death in a grocery store because an 18-year-old was able to buy an assault weapon.The common denominator in so many mass shootings today are assault weapons.I understand the senators who negotiated the bill couldn’t reach agreement on this issue. Consequently, the bill fails to prevent teenagers – teenagers – from buying assault weapons.Under current law, a federal firearms licensee may not sell or deliver a handgun to a buyer younger than 21. However, this commonsense protection does not apply to purchases of assault weapons. This disparity actually costs lives.It’s simple logic: If you can’t buy a beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an assault weapon. If you can’t buy a handgun, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15.That’s why I introduced, along with 13 of my colleagues, the Age 21 Act. I have also filed it as an amendment on the bill before us.The bill would raise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines from 18 to 21. So before you have a powerful weapon, before you buy big [magazines], you have to be at least 21 years old. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.This commonsense reform has public support among both Democrats and Republicans.A recent Politico poll showed that 88 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans support requiring people to be 21 or older to purchase a firearm.I believe that failing now to act and address the ease with which teenagers can buy assault weapons is really a grave mistake.And make no mistake about it, it will cost lives.So now is the time to act. I urge my colleagues to support the Age 21 Act and pass it before the next massacre.I hope these words are heard. I hope people understand. And I hope there are no more killings of young people in this way.”###"

Bruen that overturns New York’s “proper cause” requirement to receive a permit to carry a concealed weapon:“By striking down a century-old New York law requiring ‘proper cause’ to carry a concealed weapon, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has weakened gun safety laws in eight states covering a quarter of the U.S. population. This decision could put lives at risk, and that should be of deep concern to everyone.“The court’s decision expands the interpretation of the Second Amendment far beyond precedent, and its effect will be to prevent states from implementing commonsense licensing procedures to prevent gun violence.“In addition to overturning New York’s concealed carry law, this decision also puts in jeopardy similar concealed carry laws in California and six other states. It means more people will carry guns in bars, in shopping malls, in churches, hospitals, movie theaters, even schools. This isn’t the way to save lives.“In the decision, Justice Thomas writes that our gun laws must be ‘consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’ If New York’s 100-year-old concealed carry law isn’t sufficiently grounded in historical tradition, how old must a law be to meet that standard?“Most importantly, studies have concluded that when states weaken the permitting process for buying guns, violent crime increases, including homicides. In the wake of two massacres last month in Buffalo and Uvalde, we must do more to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, not less. This decision is a step in the wrong direction.”###"

Last week at our 90th Annual Meeting in Reno we adopted a policy resolution, Enough is Enough, Congress Must Act Now, which specifically calls for raising the age at which an individual can possess or purchase an assault weapon or a handgun from 18 to 21.Your bill would raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from 18 to 21 and raise the minimum age for a private individual to transfer military-style assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and handguns to another individual from 18 to 21. If these provisions had been law, the shooters in both the recent Buffalo and Uvalde massacres would not have been able to purchase their weapons legally.America’s mayors thank you for authoring this important legislation and for all of your efforts over the years to advance commonsense gun safety legislation. The Conference of Mayors stands ready to work with you and provide whatever support is needed to see the Age 21 Act enacted into law.Sincerely,Tom CochranCEO and Executive Director###"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=BD73D01B-C580-49D8-988D-B33C4517EE6A,"Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement in support of the actions announced today by the Biden administration to help raise federal wildland firefighter pay and increase the benefits and support for this critical workforce:“Wildfires are one of the most critical challenges facing the West, particularly California. Although 58 percent of the forestland in California is under federal control, the federal agencies have faced chronic wildland firefighter staffing shortages.  That’s one reason wildfire issues have been my top priority for years, with none more important than supporting federal wildland firefighters. “Federal wildland firefighters have consistently cited low pay as the primary barrier to recruiting more firefighters. So I’m pleased the Biden administration has announced it will begin using the $600 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to process pay increases for wildland firefighters in the coming weeks. I have long advocated for increased pay in order to better recruit and retain wildland firefighters, and this will help toward that goal. “The administration also announced it has established a new occupational series for federal wildland firefighters, an action I have advocated for years. By taking this action, OPM will finally align the work done by federal wildland firefighters with the compensation they deserve. Properly defining the job of a wildland firefighter will boost recruitment and retention, provide a clearer career path for these individuals and allow the agency to be more responsive to the particular needs of these employees. “Interior Secretary Haaland’s announcement that the administration will create a new interagency wildland firefighter health and wellbeing program is another step in the right direction. The job of a wildland firefighter is incredibly difficult and dangerous, and we must do all we can to support the wellbeing of these individuals. Combined with recent progress we’ve made on improving the health care for firefighters, this is an important step forward. “Federal wildland firefighters are a critical line of defense in the West, particularly as drought conditions worsen. We must recruit and retain these skilled workers, and that means providing them with the pay and benefits commensurate with their importance. I will continue to work toward this goal and am grateful to have the Biden administration as a partner.”"
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=7B813F7E-9754-4B2D-A4A5-CF6C6CBB032C,"Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (both D-Calif.), along with Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), introduced bipartisan legislation to allow Tribal governments to participate in an existing program that allows the Bureau of Land Management to sell and lease certain public lands below market value if those lands will be used for recreational or public purposes. This program currently allows for state and local governments to participate, but Tribal governments have been unfairly excluded from the program. The bill would correct this inequity and ensure Tribal governments enjoy the same opportunities for land acquisition as state and local governments—a much needed effort to address longstanding barriers for Tribal governments. “Tribal governments shouldn’t have been excluded from purchasing or leasing Bureau of Land Management land,” said Senator Feinstein. “Our bill provides a long-overdue fix to this mistake. It provides parity between Tribal governments and state and local governments when it comes to accessing these public lands.” “As our nation works to strengthen Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, we must ensure parity in how our laws treat Tribal governments,” said Senator Padilla. “It’s long past time we fix this omission and allow Tribal governments to have the same opportunities to access and purchase public lands as state and local governments. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this commonsense bill as quickly as possible.” “The Recreation and Public Purposes Act was codified into law nearly a century ago. At the time, Congress did not consider whether Tribal governments would be interested in developing land for recreation or for public services, similar to the way that State and local governments do. By fixing this oversight, this bill can help reduce the Federal government’s oversized land ownership footprint and develop land for a beneficial purpose,” said Congressman LaMalfa. “Susanville Indian Rancheria applauds Senator Padilla for introducing this common-sense fix to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act.  Tribal Nations have been inadvertently left out of this program for almost a century and we are glad to finally see legislation establishing parity.  Since the original passage of the R&PP, Congress has continually acknowledged and strengthened tribal sovereignty and self-determination.  Tribes should be afforded the same opportunity to buy and lease public lands for public and recreational purposes as state and local governments and non-profit organizations,” said Arian Hart, Tribal Chairman, Susanville Indian Rancheria.Background: This bill is supported by The National Congress of American Indians and the Northern California Tribal Chairmen’s Association (which includes Bear River Band of the Rohnerville Rancheria, Big Lagoon Rancheria, Blue Lake Rancheria, Elk Valley Rancheria, Hoopa Valley Tribe, Karuk Tribe, Pitt River Tribe, Quartz Valley Indian Reservation, Redding Rancheria, Resighini Rancheria, Susanville Rancheria, Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation, Trinidad Rancheria and the Wiyot Tribe). Full text of the bill is available here.###"

OMB, responsible for federal personnel actions, has missed its target of May for completing this process.“We write to urge you to swiftly implement the requirement for federal agencies to create a distinct ‘wildland firefighter’ occupational series and to expedite the delivery of the $600 million in supplemental pay for wildland firefighters as provided in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA),” the senators wrote.“The implementation of these provisions will increase federal wildland firefighter recruitment and retention and improve their morale.”Joining Senator Feinstein on the letter are Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Angus King (I-Maine), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).Full text of the letter follows and is available here:June 17, 2022 The Honorable Kiran AhujaDirectorOffice of Personnel Management1900 E Street, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20415 Dear Director Ahuja,We write to urge you to swiftly implement the requirement for federal agencies to create a distinct “wildland firefighter” occupational series and to expedite the delivery of the $600 million in supplemental pay for wildland firefighters as provided in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The implementation of these provisions will increase federal wildland firefighter recruitment and retention and improve their morale.As you know, your office set a target date of May 2022 for releasing the new occupational series guidelines, consistent with the 180-day timeline established in the IIJA. Now that the 2022 fire season has begun in earnest, with nearly 2 million acres burned nationwide, the implementation of the new occupational series is necessary and urgent. Any further delay will only further burden our land management agencies, which are faced with chronic staffing shortages.The IIJA also included $600 million to raise federal wildland firefighter salaries by up to $20,000 per year and to convert 1,000 seasonal firefighter positions to permanent. We understand that the Forest Service and Department of the Interior have provided their pay supplement proposal to OPM. In testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on June 9th, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore committed to providing higher pay for wildland firefighters by the end of June. We urge you to work with those agencies to meet that timeline.We appreciate your attention to these issues as the West enters another potentially catastrophic fire season, and look forward to working together to support our nation’s wildland firefighters. Sincerely, Dianne FeinsteinU.S. SenatorAlex PadillaU.S. SenatorAngus KingU.S. SenatorCatherine Cortez-MastoU.S. SenatorJacky RosenU.S. Senator Jeff MerkleyU.S. Senator "
http://www.feinstein.senate.gov//public/index.cfm/press-releases?ContentRecord_id=4F260BC4-2EC4-4D56-9102-DF03B2A19F9A,"Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and a group of their colleagues in pushing Congressional leadership to extend child nutrition waivers ahead of their expiration and enact a robust set of child nutrition priorities in any upcoming legislative vehicles. As school summer break is already underway in many states, it is vital that Congress extends and expands these programs as low-income families are facing a steep benefits cliff when the waivers expire on June 30, 2022. Specifically, in the letter, the senators call to extend child nutrition waivers, create a nationwide summer EBT program, and expand community eligibility (CEP), a flexible meal service option for school districts in low-income areas. These provisions are critical to fighting child hunger and food insecurity.“The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the child nutrition programs and the role they play in keeping hunger at bay for millions of children across the country. As schools close for summer across the country, families will soon lose access to free school meals and be faced with the prospect of increased food insecurity, weight gain, and learning disruptions,” wrote the senators. “As Congress develops legislation to support families impacted by high food costs, we must help ease the burden of these challenges and ensure that these child nutrition programs can fully meet children’s nutritional needs while they are at school, afterschool and summer programs, and childcare.” ""More must be done to fuel children's health and learning as millions of families continue to struggle with the fallout of COVID-19. Extending the child nutrition waivers, expanding community eligibility, and creating a nationwide Summer EBT program are surefire ways for our nation's children to have access to the nutrition they need to grow and thrive in the classroom and beyond,"" said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC). “We call on Congress to act quickly and include these provisions in any upcoming legislative vehicle. Hungry children can’t wait.” “In a typical year, Boys & Girls Clubs across the country serve 95 million meals and snacks to kids at no cost. Clubs also continually adapt to support the needs of communities during times of crisis including during the peak of the pandemic, providing more than 24 million meals to nearly a half million families nationwide,"" said Jim Clark, president and CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs of America. ""Extending the child nutrition waivers is critical to support the essential needs of kids, families, and communities still recovering from the economic and social impacts of the last two years.  We urge Congress to make child nutrition and hunger a priority by extending the waiver authority and investing in programs that keep youth healthy, safe, and learning.” “Summer is underway and YMCAs across the country are working to get healthy meals to every child in need. This summer, only 1 in 7 eligible children will have access to these meals, and Congress’ unwillingness to extend child nutrition waivers beyond June 30 is hampering our ability to provide meals when kids need them most,"" said Suzanne McCormick, President and CEO of YMCA of the USA. “We need to be able to use every possible tool to feed kids this summer, so the recommendations outlined by Senator Gillibrand and her colleagues cannot be passed soon enough. We are hopeful Congress works to enact these provisions, which will help ensure that every child has a summer free of hunger.” In addition to Feinstein and Gillibrand, the letter was also signed by Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Angus King (I-Maine), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). This letter is endorsed by Food Research & Action Center, YMCA of the USA, Afterschool Alliance, Boys & Girls Club of America, Feeding America, School Nutrition Association, American Heart Association, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, First Focus Campaign for Children, MomsRising, Center for Science in the Public Interest, National Parent Teacher Association, National Farm to School Network, School Superintendents Association, Save the Children, National Education Association, National Center for Health Research, Healthy Food America, Food Corps, Community Food Advocates, National CACFP Association, Society of Behavioral Medicine, Center for Food Equity & Economic Development, California Association of Food Banks, Healthy Schools Campaign, Voices for Georgia’s Children and Georgia Statewide Afterschool Network. Full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and Leader McCarthy, The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the child nutrition programs, and the role they play in keeping hunger at bay for millions of children across the country. As schools closed across the country, families faced the same challenges they face every summer when they lose access to free school meals: increased food insecurity, weight gain, and learning disruptions. As the Senate develops legislation to support families being impacted by high food costs and provide pandemic relief, we ask that it include the following three things in any upcoming packages to help ensure that the child nutrition programs are able to support recovery from the impact of the pandemic. School children have to have access to the nutrition they need to grow and thrive while they are at school and during the summer. These provisions will also set the stage for a much stronger Child Nutrition Reauthorization that can take additional steps to ensure that the child nutrition programs are able to fully meet children’s nutritional needs while they are at school, afterschool and summer programs, and in childcare.We look forward to working with you to include these provisions in the upcoming legislative vehicles being developed by Congress. ###[1] https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/FNS-Survey-Supply-Chain-Disruptions.pdf[2] http://afterschoolalliance.org/documents/Afterschool-COVID-19-Wave-6-Brief.pdf"
