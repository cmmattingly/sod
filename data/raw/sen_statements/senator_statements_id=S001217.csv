Families cannot underestimate this storm. Everyone along the Gulf Coast, especially Floridians in the Tampa Bay region and in Southwest Florida, must get prepared NOW. I am talking to mayors, sheriffs, FEMA and officials at the NWS who are all saying the same thing: do not ignore evacuation orders. If you have been asked to leave your home, LEAVE NOW. Don’t risk your life and wait to leave. Remember, first responders cannot save you once severe weather begins and parts of the Gulf Coast could be subjected to torrential rain, destructive winds and deadly storm surge FOR DAYS. You can rebuild your home, but you cannot rebuild your life.

Los datos continúan mostrando que la inflación es significativamente elevada bajo la administración del Presidente Joe Biden, con un índice de precios al consumidor que aumenta 8,3 % y un índice de precios al productor que aumenta 8,7 % durante el año. A principios de esta semana, luego de la publicación de los datos del PPI, el Senador Scott emitió la siguiente declaración: El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Ayer, después de que otro informe de inflación mostrara que los precios habían vuelto a subir, Joe Biden y los demócratas aquí en Washington organizaron una gran fiesta en la Casa Blanca. Este es el mensaje que están enviando a las familias estadounidenses: NO NOS IMPORTAN NI USTEDES NI SUS PROBLEMAS. Mientras crecía, mi familia era pobre y vivíamos en viviendas públicas y teníamos que cuidar cada centavo que gastábamos. No puedo imaginar lo que pensaría mi madre al ver a un Presidente de los Estados Unidos descorchar champán mientras ella apenas podía permitirse el lujo de alimentar a sus hijos. Pero eso es exactamente lo que está sucediendo en este país. “Para colmo, Biden continúa afirmando que nuestra economía es excelente y que se están creando toneladas de empleos. Eso es mentira y esto es lo que no te está diciendo: los trabajos de tiempo completo están muy por debajo y solo los trabajos de medio tiempo están creciendo. Los puestos de trabajo a tiempo completo cayeron en 242.000 SOLAMENTE en agosto. El autoempleo está a la baja. El informe PPI de hoy le dice por qué las empresas están recortando empleos: los costos siguen aumentando cada mes y las empresas, especialmente nuestras pequeñas empresas, se ven obligadas a reducir costos. Así que ahora los estadounidenses se ven obligados a aceptar múltiples trabajos de medio tiempo solo para sobrevivir. Ese es el resultado de la terrible economía de Joe Biden y está acabando con el sueño americano de las familias de todo el país. Cuando los republicanos recuperemos la mayoría en 2023, terminaremos con este gasto imprudente que alimenta la inflación, arreglaremos esta economía quebrada y devolveremos el poder al pueblo estadounidense, donde pertenece”. Desde que fue elegido para el Senado de los EE. UU., el Senador Scott ha instado repetidamente a tomar medidas para abordar la crisis de la deuda de los Estados Unidos y los efectos nocivos de la inflación.

Data continues to show that inflation is significantly elevated under President Joe Biden’s administration, with Consumer Price Index increasing 8.3% and Producer Price Index increasing 8.7% over the year. Earlier this week, following the release of the PPI data, Senator Scott released the following statement: Senator Rick Scott said, “Yesterday, after yet another inflation report showed that prices were up again, Joe Biden and the Democrats here in Washington threw a big party at the White House. Here’s the message they are sending to American families: WE DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS. Growing up, my family was poor and we lived in public housing and we had to watch every penny we spent. I can’t imagine what my mom would think seeing a President of the United States pop champagne while she could barely afford to feed her kids. But that’s exactly what’s happening all across this country. “To add insult to injury, Biden continues to claim that the economy is great and that tons of jobs are being created. That’s a lie and here’s what he’s not telling you: full time jobs are way down and it’s only part time jobs that are growing. Full-time jobs fell by 242,000 in August ALONE. Self-employment is DOWN. Today’s PPI report tells you why businesses are cutting jobs – costs are still skyrocketing higher every month and businesses, especially our small businesses, are being forced to cut costs. So now Americans are being forced to take multiple part-time jobs just to get by. That’s the result of Joe Biden’s terrible economy and it’s killing the American Dream for families all across our country. When Republicans retake the majority in 2023, we’ll end this reckless, inflation-fueling spending, fix this broken economy and deliver power back to the American people, where it belongs.” Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

For too long, people have suffered addiction and death because of this evil drug that is pouring across Joe Biden’s open southern border. Fentanyl has skyrocketed to the number one killer of young people, and to put an end to this crisis, strong actions must be taken. I am proud to join Senator Rubio in standing up for victims of this crisis, and urge the immediate passage of this critically important bill.” Read more from Senator Rubio’s office below.RUBIO, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BILL TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION OF DEADLY FENTANYL CHARGEABLE AS FELONY MURDER Illicit use of fentanyl is now the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18-45. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, drug dealers are increasingly targeting children and young people with fentanyl pills made to look like candy.  In response to the rise of fentanyl being trafficked across our southern border and into our communities, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the Felony Murder for Deadly Fentanyl Distribution Act. The bill, which Rubio announced in a Fox News op-ed, makes the distribution of fentanyl resulting in death punishable by federal felony murder charges.   ###"

Click HERE to download b-roll. Senator Rick Scott said, “Joe Biden has abandoned Latin America and has chosen to appease dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. He’s supported socialist candidates in Colombia and done the bare minimum to confront Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Today, as our nation marks the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month, I am proud to stand beside my colleagues in Congress and these brave Floridians as we renew our urgent calls for President Biden to reverse course and finally stand for freedom, democracy and security in the Western Hemisphere. “If Joe Biden is serious about supporting freedom and democracy in Latin America, he can show that today by calling for the immediate passage of my DEMOCRACIA Act, closing the Cuban embassy in Washington D.C., re-designating FARC as a terrorist organization, blocking access to U.S. assets to anyone involved or complicit in human rights violations or corruption in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and revoking licenses to U.S. companies operating in Cuba and Venezuela. If President Biden did all five of these things today, then our hemisphere would be a safer place and the freedom movements in Latin America would be emboldened. The fight for freedom and democracy in Latin America demands the support of the United States and we won’t stop fighting to reverse Biden’s failed appeasement agenda that is standing in the way of progress and stability in our hemisphere.” Senator Marco Rubio said, “The Biden Administration’s policy of appeasement with far-left tyrants and would-be tyrants in Latin America emboldens their grip on power, encourages drug trafficking in our region, and promotes illegal mass migration across our unsecured border. The United States, and democracies in our region, are less safe because of this administration’s desire to turn a blind eye to the needs of our hemisphere. We need real leadership and real solutions, not left-leaning policies from Marxist apologists.”  Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart said, “The Biden Administration continues to fail those who courageously struggle for freedom, human rights, and democracy in some of the world's most oppressive environments of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. In the wake of the historic July 11 protests in Cuba, and as hundreds of political prisoners still languish in prison, the administration is planning to fire as many as 30 people at the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Additionally, for a full year, the administration has failed to allow unfettered internet access to the Cuban people to counter the regime's internet blackouts, and the administration has weakened sanctions by expanding travel, remittances, and charter flights to Cuba. The Biden Administration should cease appeasing the world's worst actors in our hemisphere, and instead stand in strong, unequivocal solidarity with the heroes risking everything to be free.” Congressman Carlos Giménez said, “Biden has abandoned Latin America and with devastating effect. The lack of Biden’s leadership in the hemisphere is worsening our border crisis, plummeting the regional economy, and making Latin America vulnerable to nefarious actors such as China, Russia, and Iran. When our regional partners don’t find a reliable ally in the United States, one that actively works to defend freedom, democracy, and capitalism, Latin America is left with no choice but to shift leftward. We’re already seeing this dangerous shift happen in several key partners. Biden is failing Latin America. Biden is failing our hemisphere. America is less safe because of his abdication of leadership. It’s time for America to lead again in the hemisphere.” Congresswoman María Salazar said, “President Biden is absent, weak, and refuses to lead in Latin America. He has failed to prevent the breakdown of democracy in Nicaragua, has returned to Obama’s disastrous Cuba policy, has no strategy to restore democracy to Venezuela, and is applauding the rise of a Marxist terrorist in Colombia.” Sylvia Iriondo said “As long as the Cuban communist regime remains in power, there will be no peace, security and stability in our hemisphere.”  Rosa Maria Payá said, “We call upon President Biden to take sides with Cuban citizens who are held captive by the communist dictatorship. The failure to act has contributed to the ongoing largest migratory crisis in the regime’s history. Appeasement hasn’t stopped this threat to US national security it is time to support freedom for the Cuba People.” Orlando Gutiérrez-Boronat said, “The Cuban people are rising and they must not be abandoned!” Ernesto Ackerman said, “For years, our organization IVAC has been sounding the alarm that just 1,600 miles from our borders in Venezuela, a union of countries that detest the United States of America, our values, Democracy and freedom, are being united. I want to thank Senator Rick Scott for organizing this important press conference at a turbulent time for the United States.” Norma Reno said, “I want to thank Senator Scott for supporting the Venezuelan people and fighting for freedom and democracy. The Maduro regime has become more and more dangerous to the region especially now that Russia and Iran have opened operations in Venezuela.” Muñeca Fuentes said, “The longest and darkest night of human rights violations and heinous crimes in Nicaragua started back in 1979 when the Sandinistas took over with the help of the Carter administration. Since then, thousands have died and disappeared. The Sandinistas-FSLN are a narco-terrorist organization and should be included in the list of terrorists for they are a danger to our national security.” Fabio Andrade said, “As an American born in Colombia, we speak very loud together with Senator Scott to have FARC, a criminal group, back on the terrorist watch list.” ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-rick-scott-s-legislation-recognized-on-national-taxpayers-union-no-brainer-list,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) announced that Senator Rick Scott’s 1099-K reform legislation has been recognized on their 12th annual “No Brainer” List. Each year, NTU selects 10 bills highlighting the top pieces of legislation that benefit taxpayers in 2022. This year, NTU highlighted Senator Scott’s bill, which repeals an unnecessary tax hike included in the reckless so-called American Rescue Plan. Senator Scott’s bill repeals the tax increase Democrats placed on working class gig and sharing economy independent contractors. The Democrats’ provision requires companies to send 1099-K forms to gig workers and independent contractors earning at least $600 a year on any number of transactions, dramatically increasing the prior requirement of $20,000 a year on at least 200 transactions. Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden claims he won't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, but that's a lie – he's already done it. Along with trillions in unnecessary and unrelated in spending in the American Rescue Plan, Biden inserted a tax increase on gig workers, like hardworking Americans that work as drivers for Uber, Lyft or DoorDash. Increasing costs and regulations on already-struggling Americans is wrong but I won’t stop fighting to stop it. I want to thank National Taxpayers Union for recognizing the importance of reforming 1099-K forms for our gig workers and including it on their 12th annual ‘No Brainers’ List.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-rick-scott-and-colleagues-to-hhs-secretary-becerra-americans-deserve-full-accountability-of-covid-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senators Rick Scott, Roger Marshall and Rand Paul sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra highlighting concerns with Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) review. NIH funds taxpayer-funded research grants, and any grant focused on viruses that may become highly transmissible, such as COVID-19, are supposed to be subject to P3CO review. However, a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight Subcommittee hearing found that the P3CO review group lacks basic transparency and HHS is failing to operate the P3CO review effectively as it was intended. Alarmingly, only three projects have undergone review since its inception in 2017, and concerns are being raised in Congress that HHS and the NIH failed to complete critical review of research related to pandemic-level viruses. Senator Rick Scott said, “The American people deserve nothing less than full accountability and transparency from their government, especially when their tax dollars are being used. It is critical we finally get answers on the origins of COVID-19 so that we can prevent another global pandemic in the future—but HHS and NIH must be transparent. I thank Senators Marshall and Paul for joining me in demanding these answers from Secretary Becerra; he has a duty to the American people and he must promptly and fully answer our questions.” Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. said, “Oversight should not be an optional process with self-selected participation and that is exactly what the NIH created in the ineffective P3CO gain-of-function research risk analysis procedure.  It remains a mystery if anyone in the White House approved it. NIH and this dangerous research require legitimate, independent oversight by qualified individuals who do not have conflicts of interest.” Senator Rand Paul, M.D. said, “The American people deserve full transparency as to the federal government’s role in overseeing dangerous gain-of-function research. Having convened the first-ever congressional hearing on gain-of-function research, I am committed to providing that transparency. The secretive P3CO Review Group – which is supposed to provide a layer of much-needed oversight of this dangerous gain-of-function research – has largely been ineffective. I am glad to join Senators Rick Scott and Roger Marshall in sending this letter, and I’m hopeful that the NIH will respond to these critical questions promptly and in full.” Read the full letter HERE or below. Secretary Becerra: We write today regarding the troubling issues raised by the recent Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight Subcommittee hearing Revisiting Gain of Function (GOF) Research: What The Pandemic Taught Us and Where Do We Go From Here.[1] This hearing revealed concerning issues associated with the Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) review that must be addressed to protect the country from another deadly pandemic. The hearing found that although the P3CO Review Group is supposed to add a layer of oversight for GOF research, its effectiveness to-date has been questionable, primarily because it is a voluntary process in which U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies self-select research projects for the P3CO risk assessment review.[2] Additionally, the P3CO Review Group operates largely in secret, lacking critical transparency required when evaluating potential hazardous research, unless that research is classified.  Senators heard during the recent hearing that the P3CO review process amounts to self-policing on the part of NIH, and only evaluates the estimated results of proposed research in all HHS operations. According to the HHS website, only three research projects have undergone review since its inception in 2017.[3] However, the website was last updated in September 2021, so the current number of research project reviews is unknown. We are concerned that some projects should have been reviewed were not. Gain-of-function research is paid for by American tax dollars both domestically and internationally. The operations of this secret review panel embodies the center of the subcommittee’s two primary responsibilities – monitoring emerging threats and conducting oversight of federal dollars. We are also aware that the Ranking Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Health and Oversight subcommittees wrote to you in April 2022 and have not yet received a reply.[4]   Please provide to us a copy of your response to the Energy and Commerce ranking members and also provide written responses to the following questions:            The American people deserve nothing less than full accountability and transparency from their government. I appreciate your attention to this sensitive matter.  Sincerely, ###"

Ha apoyado a candidatos socialistas en Colombia y no ha hecho nada para enfrentar a Daniel Ortega en Nicaragua. Hoy, cuando nuestra nación marca el comienzo del Mes de la Herencia Hispana, me enorgullece estar junto a mis colegas del Congreso y estos valientes floridanos mientras renovamos nuestros llamados urgentes para que el Presidente Biden cambie de rumbo y finalmente defienda la libertad, la democracia y la seguridad en el Hemisferio oeste. “Si Joe Biden se toma en serio el apoyo a la libertad y la democracia en América Latina, puede demostrarlo hoy al pedir la aprobación inmediata de mi Ley DEMOCRACIA, cerrar la embajada de Cuba en Washington D.C., volver a designar a las FARC como organización terrorista, bloquear el acceso a activos estadounidenses a cualquier persona involucrada o cómplice en violaciones de derechos humanos o corrupción en Venezuela y Nicaragua, y revocar licencias a empresas estadounidenses que operan en Cuba y Venezuela. Si el Presidente Biden hiciera las cinco cosas hoy, entonces nuestro hemisferio sería un lugar más seguro y los movimientos por la libertad en América Latina se fortalecerían. La lucha por la libertad y la democracia en América Latina exige el apoyo de Estados Unidos y no dejaremos de luchar para revertir la fallida agenda de apaciguamiento de Biden que se interpone en el camino del progreso y la estabilidad en nuestro hemisferio”. El Senador Marco Rubio dijo: “La política de apaciguamiento de la Administración Biden hacia tiranos de la extrema izquierda y también hacia posibles tiranos en Latinoamérica alientan su control del poder, fomenta el narcotráfico en nuestra región y promueve la migración masiva ilegal a través de nuestra frontera, la cual no es segura. EE.UU. y las democracias de nuestra región están menos seguros debido al deseo de esta administración de hacerse los de la vista gorda ante las necesidades en nuestro hemisferio. Necesitamos un liderazgo real y soluciones reales, no políticas de izquierda de apologistas marxistas”. El Congresista Mario Díaz-Balart dijo: “La Administración Biden sigue fallando a quienes valientemente luchan por la libertad, los derechos humanos y la democracia en algunos de los entornos más opresivos del mundo, como Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua. A raíz de las históricas protestas del 11 de julio en Cuba, y mientras cientos de presos políticos aún languidecen en prisión, la administración planea despedir hasta 30 personas de la Oficina de Transmisiones a Cuba. Además, durante un año completo, la administración no ha permitido el acceso ilimitado a Internet al pueblo cubano para contrarrestar los apagones de Internet del régimen, y la administración ha debilitado las sanciones al expandir los viajes, las remesas y los vuelos chárter a Cuba. La Administración Biden debería dejar de apaciguar a los peores actores del mundo en nuestro hemisferio y, en cambio, mostrar una solidaridad fuerte e inequívoca con los héroes que arriesgan todo para ser libres”. El Congresista Carlos Giménez dijo: ““Biden ha abandonado a Latinoamérica de una manera devastadora. La falta de liderazgo de Biden en el hemisferio está empeorando la crisis fronteriza, desplomando la economía regional y haciendo a América Latina vulnerable a actores nefarios como la China, Rusia, e Irán. Cuando nuestros aliados regionales no encuentran en los Estados Unidos un aliado que defienda la libertad, la democracia y el capitalismo, la América Latina no tiene ninguna otra opción que girarse hacia la izquierda. Ya estamos viendo este cambio en varios de nuestros aliados claves en la región. Biden está fallando a Latinoamérica. Biden está fallando nuestro hemisferio. Los Estados Unidos está menos seguro por la abdicación de su liderazgo. Es tiempo para los Estados Unidos volver a ser líder en el hemisferio”. La Congresista María Salazar dijo: “El presidente Biden está ausente, es débil y se niega a liderar en América Latina. No ha logrado evitar el colapso de la democracia en Nicaragua, ha vuelto a la desastrosa política hacia Cuba de Obama, no tiene una estrategia para restaurar la democracia en Venezuela y está aplaudiendo el ascenso a la presidencia de un terrorista marxista en Colombia”. Sylvia Iriondo dijo: “Mientras el régimen comunista cubano permanezca en el poder, no habrá paz, seguridad y estabilidad en nuestro hemisferio”. Rosa María Payá dijo: “Hacemos un llamado al Presidente Biden para que tome partido por los ciudadanos cubanos que están cautivos por la dictadura comunista. La falta de acción ha contribuido a la mayor crisis migratoria en curso en la historia del régimen. El apaciguamiento no ha detenido esta amenaza a la seguridad nacional de los Estados Unidos, es hora de apoyar la libertad del pueblo cubano”. Orlando Gutiérrez-Boronat dijo: “¡El pueblo cubano se está levantando y no debe ser abandonado!” Ernesto Ackerman dijo: “Durante años, nuestra organización IVAC ha estado haciendo sonar la alarma de que a solo 1,600 millas de nuestras fronteras en Venezuela, una unión de países que detesta a los Estados Unidos de América, nuestros valores, la democracia y la libertad, se están uniendo. Quiero agradecer al Senador Rick Scott por organizar esta importante conferencia de prensa en un momento turbulento para los Estados Unidos”. Norma Reno dijo: “Quiero agradecer al Senador Scott por apoyar al pueblo venezolano y luchar por la libertad y la democracia. El régimen de Maduro se ha vuelto cada vez más peligroso para la región, especialmente ahora que Rusia e Irán han abierto operaciones en Venezuela”. Muñeca Fuentes dijo: “La noche más larga y oscura de violaciones de derechos humanos y crímenes atroces en Nicaragua comenzó en 1979 cuando los sandinistas tomaron el poder con la ayuda de la administración Carter. Desde entonces, miles han muerto y desaparecido. Los Sandinistas-FSLN son una organización narcoterrorista y deben ser incluidos en la lista de terroristas porque son un peligro para nuestra seguridad nacional”. Fabio Andrade dijo: “Como estadounidense nacido en Colombia, hablamos muy alto junto con el Senador Scott para que las FARC, un grupo criminal, vuelvan a estar en la lista de organizaciones terroristas”. ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/9/video-release-senate-democrats-block-sen-rick-scott-s-bill-to-stop-biden-s-reckless-student-loan-payoff-force-congress-to-vote,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate floor and requested unanimous consent to pass his bill, the Debt Cancellation Accountability Act, which would put a stop to President Biden’s reckless decision to transfer billions of dollars of debt from borrowers to American taxpayers, and instead force Congress to vote on the matter. The Debt Cancellation Accountability Act would require the U.S. Department of Education to obtain an express appropriation from Congress to pay for any federal student loan debts the Department proposes to waive, discharge, or otherwise reduce whenever granted to two or more borrowers in an amount greater than $1,000,000, rather than on a case-by-case basis. Senate Democrats blocked its passage. Watch Senator Scott’s speech HERE or below. Read Senator Scott’s remarks below.“Have you ever gone out to eat at a restaurant with a group of people, but your order was cheaper than everyone else’s. Maybe you weren’t as hungry, or the restaurant the group picked was more expensive than you could afford, so you were selective about what you ordered. Then, when the check comes, someone suggests that the group split it evenly. “What’s your immediate reaction? You’re upset, of course, because you ordered the salad, not the filet mignon, and you drank water, not the expensive bottle of wine. You ordered what YOU wanted and THEY ordered what THEY wanted. You shouldn’t be on the hook for their costs. “Sadly, this illustration is far too real as last month, Joe Biden announced that he would cancel billions of dollars in student loans. But let’s be clear – he isn’t CANCELLING student debt. No, he’s TRANSFERING that debt to EVERY American taxpayer. Now a construction worker in Florida is having to foot the bill for the loans of a Harvard grad which they voluntarily accepted for an education THEY received. “So here is what Democrats are saying to that construction worker: You didn’t go to college? Democrats don’t care. You’ll pay the debt of lawyers and doctors. And you’ll pay for those who wanted Ph.Ds in poetry. Talk about poetic IN-justice! “You went to community college or a state school and worked to graduate debt free? Tough luck. Joe Biden wants you to pay for the advanced degrees of the privileged few. YOUR tax dollars are now the money pot for other people’s student debt. “Of course, Joe Biden’s plan doesn’t even begin to address the real reason of rising higher education costs… that is universities’ decades-long practice of unnecessarily raising tuition. As Governor of Florida I addressed that problem and challenged our universities to keep education affordable. “Look at the University of Florida. Undergraduate tuition and fees for this academic year are less than $6,500, and it’s the 5th best public university in the country. You’ll get a FANTASTIC education there. Meanwhile, at Harvard, tuition and fees for this academic year cost more than $57,000. There are ways to make education affordable, but Democrats and elites aren’t interested in those solutions. “That’s why Joe Biden is engaging in this reckless move even though it doesn’t solve the real issue and even though he lacks the proper constitutional authority. “Everybody knows this. That’s why in July of last year, Nancy Pelosi herself denied the President had such power. When asked, she said ‘The president can’t do it. That’s not even a discussion.’  “Yet, now the Department of Justice is engaging in interpretive gymnastics to co-opt legislation that was passed to help our service members in the aftermath of 9/11. It’s a desperate attempt to stretch a good law well-beyond its intent so Joe Biden can give handouts to his liberal voters and Harvard pals. “Biden wants to spend money that Congress has not appropriated for a loan forgiveness that Congress has not authorized. It’s illegal. It’s unconstitutional. It’s a gross abuse of authority and I won’t stand for it. Congress MUST assert its authority here. We have the power of the purse. Not the president. “That’s why my I’ve introduced the Debt Cancellation Accountability Act. My bill would require the Department of Education to get an express appropriation from Congress before they can propose waiving, discharging, or reducing student loan debts to two or more borrowers in an amount greater than $1 million. If we want to transfer the debt of some and make everyone pay for it, then Congress has to make that decision. We should put it up for a vote. “Of course, Democrats here in the Senate won’t do that. Surely, they could have passed a bill by now if they really wanted to, but they wanted Biden to do it alone. It’s easy to see why. In just the past few weeks we’ve seen families from across the country speak out against Biden’s unfair and disastrous proposal. I’m hearing about it from Floridians every day and I know my colleagues are too. “I’d like to thank Senators Barasso, Lummis and Braun for supporting my Debt Cancellation Accountability Act and choosing to stand with me against Biden’s overreach. “Let’s pass this bill today to reverse Joe Biden’s unlawful decision and force Congress to decide this issue.” ### "
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-rick-scott-on-ppi-inflation-report-joe-biden-killing-the-american-dream,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which showed inflation continued to rise in August increasing 8.7% over the year. Senator Rick Scott said, “Yesterday, after yet another inflation report showed that prices were up again, Joe Biden and the Democrats here in Washington threw a big party at the White House. Here’s the message they are sending to American families: WE DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS. Growing up, my family was poor and we lived in public housing and we had to watch every penny we spent. I can’t imagine what my mom would think seeing a President of the United States pop champagne while she could barely afford to feed her kids. But that’s exactly what’s happening all across this country. “To add insult to injury, Biden continues to claim that the economy is great and that tons of jobs are being created. That’s a lie and here’s what he’s not telling you: full time jobs are way down and it’s only part time jobs that are growing. Full-time jobs fell by 242,000 in August ALONE. Self-employment is DOWN. Today’s PPI report tells you why businesses are cutting jobs – costs are still skyrocketing higher every month and businesses, especially our small businesses, are being forced to cut costs. So now Americans are being forced to take multiple part-time jobs just to get by. That’s the result of Joe Biden’s terrible economy and it’s killing the American Dream for families all across our country. When Republicans retake the majority in 2023, we’ll end this reckless, inflation-fueling spending, fix this broken economy and deliver power back to the American people, where it belongs.” According to today’s PPI release, price increases over the year in August included: Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

August’s CPI data shows that there has been significant inflation nearly every month of Biden’s presidency. While year over year consumer prices increased 8.3% in August, food prices reached an inflationary level not seen since 1979. Senator Rick Scott said, “While the White House will undoubtedly celebrate today’s inflation report, families are still suffering. Food prices are way up since Biden took office and STILL RISING HIGHER. And while gas prices have fallen slightly, they are still way higher than when Biden took office thanks to his war on American energy and failed policies like cancelling the Keystone Pipeline. Families in my state and all across the country don’t want a consolation prize, they want lower prices. But, instead of helping them and changing course, Joe Biden is a do-nothing president that is completely controlled by the radical left socialists in his party. Since Biden took office, inflation in America is up more than 13%. There is one solution to this problem: STOP RECKLESS GOVERNMENT SPENDING. Florida families are SICK AND TIRED of paying the price for Biden’s failed, woke agenda and I will keep fighting every day to stop it and the raging inflation its pushing on all Americans.” According to today’s CPI release, price increases over the year include: Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-rick-scott-to-sec-chairman-we-must-address-risks-from-communist-chinese-companies-operating-on-u-s-stock-exchanges,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), highlighting a disturbing lack of financial transparency, among other concerns, with an auditing agreement recently made between the SEC’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Senator Scott has previously raised concerns with Communist Chinese backed companies breaking their agreements and American laws while operating within the United States, putting U.S. investors at increased risk. He is urging the SEC to look into the matter and ensure that American investors are treated fairly and provided transparency on the risks of investing in Communist Chinese backed companies on securities exchanges. Read the full letter HERE or below. September 13, 2022 Dear Chair Gensler: Thank you for your ongoing efforts and the efforts of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expose Communist Chinese companies for their lack of transparency in American financial markets. On August 26th the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) reached an agreement to move forward with auditing requirements for Chinese companies to remain listed on American stock exchanges. While these efforts are a step in the right direction, I am concerned that this agreement does not go far enough and could threaten the integrity of any audits produced. According to the CSRC, it has no plans of allowing for an audit that is wholly independent of Chinese authorities. They state that “audit work papers and other information that the U.S. regulator need access to will be obtained by and transferred through Chinese regulators.”[1] Allowing Chinese regulators to sift through documents before transferring them to U.S. regulators creates doubt in the entire auditing process. The Communist Chinese Party (CCP) continues to skirt transparency in companies listed on our stock exchanges. Their aversion to properly comply with audits should concern all Americans. Giving in to the CCP’s wishes creates a lack of confidence in the financial products put forth for the American people to invest their hard-earned money in. The American people deserve to have markets that are free and transparent. Accountability is a cornerstone to our monetary marketplace. While I am encouraged by this step the SEC is taking toward forcing more transparency from Chinese companies, history suggests that the CCP are creating a façade to continue to funnel money out of American markets by using highly misleading records and methods. Given this history of Chinese companies not properly disclosing their accounts, I write today with questions regarding this new agreement. 1. How will this agreement be enforced? What are the repercussions for being caught breaking the agreement?2. Is it correct that United States representatives will not be permitted to receive documents in mainland China? Why will files need to be sent to Hong Kong?3.Given the power the CCP has over Hong Kong National Security Law, how can you ensure a fair legal process, if one is necessary?4. With Communist China’s notorious reputation for keeping a second set of books, how will we have certainty that the information provided is authentic?5. Will you ensure each company that does not comply with wholly independent audits will be delisted from U.S stock exchanges?6. How will the SEC make sure that no Chinese authorities interfere in any way with these independent audits? If and when Chinese backed companies are caught breaking this agreement, or any relevant American laws, I encourage the SEC to move quickly to remove them from our markets.                 I look forward to your response as we continue to work together to safeguard the financial markets of the greatest economy in the world. ###[1] http://www.csrc.gov.cn/csrc_en/c102030/c5572273/content.shtml"

After two years of Democrats’ radical agenda and reckless spending that wrecked America’s economy and drove the nation into more than $30 TRILLION in debt, the last thing American families need is for Congress to greenlight one more liberal priority that will simply send America further in the wrong direction. In the op-ed, Senators Rick Scott, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee wrote, “Month after month for the last two years, Democrats and President Joe Biden have been able to advance their radical agenda while Republicans have largely been sidelined. Well, we just got back to Washington after spending August back at home, and families in Florida, Texas, and Utah are FURIOUS. They are sick and tired of watching Washington’s broken status quo continue while they deal with the consequences of reckless spending in Congress. Who can blame them? As they’ve felt the pain of rising inflation month after month, they’ve had to watch from afar as too many Republicans have caved to the demands of the Democrats carrying out an agenda led by radical leftists in the White House and on Capitol Hill. That must end. It’s time for Republicans to stand united and demand that Congress pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) that simply maintains current federal spending levels—and not a penny more—until a new Congress begins.  Now, before the liberal media starts losing its mind, let’s make a few things clear. First, forcing Congress to pass a clean CR will not result in ANY cuts to funding or services. …  Second, this is not some convoluted scheme to cause a government shutdown…This is about accountability and doing what’s right for American taxpayers. That’s it.… We must ensure Washington prioritizes the needs of the American people by focusing on things like getting our economy back on track, reducing inflation, combatting violent crime, and keeping our families safe. America is more than $30 TRILLION in debt. The worst move imaginable would be to gift the Democrats one last liberal spending spree in December as they leave power.… It's time for Republicans to stand up and unite…We must show strength now and prove to the American people that we will end the madness in Washington and return power back to them, where it rightly belongs.” Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE. ###"

We, as Republicans, must stand strong and demand nothing more than clean government operations until a new Congress begins. “Doing this will not result in any cuts to funding or services and will ensure that the federal government continues to operate as it must for the American people until a new Congress begins in 2023. If members have other new issues, whether they involve appropriations or not, I hope they will bring them forward for individual votes so we can quickly act on them. Anything that is truly urgent can and should be voted on as soon as possible, not held hostage so it can be used as a political weapon in a government funding bill.” Last week, Senator Scott called on Congressional Republicans to join his fight this month to repeal the Democrats’ partisan plan to supersize the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with $80 BILLION and 87,000 new employees, and demand passage of his Debt Cancellation Accountability Act to reverse Joe Biden’s unlawful decision to spend hundreds of billions of tax dollars to “forgive” student loan debt and force this issue to be decided by Congress.

Rutherford (R-FL), Scott Franklin (R-FL), Byron Donalds (R-FL), Brian Mast (R-FL), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Kat Cammack (R-FL), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), Darren Soto (D-FL), Michael Waltz (R-FL), Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Frederica Wilson (D-FL), Kathy Castor (D-FL), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), and Ted Deutch (D-FL). Want more? Read the cover letter below and the full petition here. Dear Ambassador Tai:                                                           We are filing this petition under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to request the administration to conduct an investigation into the flood of imported seasonal and perishable agricultural products from Mexico, specifically fruits and vegetables grown with subsidized horticultural infrastructure and other forms of Mexican government support, which over the last two decades have burdened and restricted U.S. commerce. The contents of this petition make clear that Mexico’s scheme to displace Florida’s seasonal and perishable agricultural industry from the U.S. market is an unreasonable trade practice that constitutes export targeting, threatens Florida’s seasonal and perishable agricultural industry, endangers the long-term food security of the U.S., and raises the prospect that Mexico will become an unchallenged hegemon in the winter and spring fruit and vegetable supply chain, with the ability to set market prices that harm American consumers.                                                           The Biden Administration has affirmed its intention to protect and reinvigorate critical supply chains within the U.S., including agricultural supply chains. Mexico’s export targeting scheme, which is affecting U.S.-grown produce during the winter and spring months, is a direct threat to this objective. As this petition discusses, and as various government entities, including the U.S. Trade Representative, have confirmed, seasonal and perishable industries such as Florida’s generally do not enjoy access to trade remedies. The provisions of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, however, are uniquely suited to investigate Mexico’s trade-distorting practices and policies and provide urgently needed relief to Florida’s growers.                                                           As you know, the provisions of the amended Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) give you broad authority to investigate and redress unreasonable trade practices that burden and restrict U.S. commerce. The Trade Act also sets broad criteria for interested persons to file petitions under Section 301. The Bipartisan Florida Congressional Delegation is a group of U.S. Members of Congress, each of whom represents U.S. workers, farmers, family-owned businesses, and other businesses injured by Mexico’s unreasonable practices and policies.                                                           We respectfully submit this petition to redress the untenable situation imposed by Mexico’s practices and policies, and to seek relief.                                                           Sincerely,  ###"

Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Request Information on Alleged Fraud in Alzheimer’s ResearchWASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Ranking Member Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Aging Committee Members Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sent a letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, requesting information in light of recent allegations of data fraud with federally-funded Alzheimer’s research. “These allegations of misconduct in Alzheimer’s research — and the silence from Secretary Becerra — raise serious questions of credibility in the scientific community,” said Sen. Scott. “As ranking member of the Aging Committee, I know how much this research means to families across the nation. This administration has a duty to provide the answers and transparency that those families deserve.” “This administration demands that we ‘trust the science,’ yet it funds scientists that tamper with their own research. HHS will be failing the millions of vulnerable American seniors suffering with from Alzheimer’s disease if it chooses not to investigate these claims of misconduct,” said Sen. Rubio. Sen. Rick Scott said, “We can never tolerate compromising the integrity of medical research - especially that which focuses on a disease that impacts millions of American families. HHS must immediately launch an investigation into the misconduct alleged here and get answers for the millions of Alzheimer's patients, their families and American taxpayers.” Background:   On July 21, Science magazine published the results of a six-month investigation into allegations that a scientist manipulated images that have been used as the bedrock of Alzheimer’s research since their publication in 2006. To date, the National Institutes of Health has not addressed the allegations and continues to fund the scientist in question.  Read the full letter here."

The Simplifying Grants Act will make it easier for small towns across the country to access crucial federal funding to protect their communities. I fully support this legislation and urge its quick passage through the Senate.” See more from Senator Rubio’s office below.  RUBIO, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO MAKE FEDERAL GRANT PROCESS EASIER FOR SMALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS Small local governments face difficulties when applying for, and managing, federal grants in comparison to larger ones.

These investments carry enormous risks and could result in massive but completely preventable losses. Passing the TICKER Act will ensure that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses its resources and authority to protect both U.S. investors and American financial markets, and creates greater transparency regarding the grave risks posed by entities linked to Communist China.” Senator Chris Van Hollen said, “Following the passage of my Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, the SEC is already taking action to help ensure Chinese companies operating on US markets are held to the same standards as other foreign companies, in order to better protect American investors. This legislation will go a step further by ensuring investors are aware of particularly risky foreign companies that leave investors without any legal recourse or direct ownership interests, and ensure they have the tools necessary to make informed decisions about their holdings.” Within 180 days after becoming law, the TICKER Act would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to make clear to investors the potential high risk for investments in VIEs linked to foreign companies, including those based in the People’s Republic of China, by:1.     Using stock trading symbols to identify VIEs on U.S. exchanges.2.     Requiring that broker-dealers provide risk warning labels on the potential lack of legal recourse for investors for their investments in VIEs. ###"

Walensky, M.D., MPHDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention1600 Clifton RoadAtlanta, Georgia 30329 Dear Director Walensky: I write today regarding the concerning reports[1] that your agency frivolously spent tens of thousands of dollars of federal taxpayer funds for “media training and executive coaching” for you as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  As a member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I am seeking information, records and materials related to how such “media training and executive coaching” was procured, approved, conducted, and paid for by you and your agency.  It is abundantly clear to the American people that President Biden and members of his administration will go to great lengths to mislead them about the state of our country and effectiveness of their polices. Americans know that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is lying when he says the southern border is closed. Families in Florida know that President Biden was lying when he said his raging inflation crisis would be “transitory” and that the war in Ukraine was solely responsible for record-high gas prices. These false narratives alone are unacceptable and insulting to the American people. Learning that you have chosen to stick taxpayers with a bill to be trained in ways to advance the administration’s radical agenda and mistruths adds insult to injury and must be answered for.While we absolutely expect and require you and your agency to clearly and effectively communicate public health guidance, doing so should not require any special media training. This is especially true if we assume that your goal is to provide truthful, accurate, and complete information to the American people, and given that there is no shortage of resources available to you through the federal government, which come at no additional expense to the taxpayer. At a time when American families are suffering the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s reckless spending and repeated policy failures that have led to skyrocketing inflation, supply shortages of critical goods and continued uncertainty about public health concerns, we cannot and will not ignore that you have spent large sums of federal monies on partisan political consultants to improve your media image without any discernible benefit to the American taxpayer.  This is beyond shameful; it is wasteful, abusive federal spending directed to line the pockets of your political allies at the expense of hardworking Americans who deserve your accountability. Please respond to the following requests no later than September 23, 2022:                                                               i.      How such services were identified, selected, and procured by you and your agency;                                                            ii.      The scope of services to be provided by Grunwald;                                                         iii.      The intended recipients and/or attendees of Grunwald’s training;                                                         iv.      The total cost paid for such services, up to the date of this letter; and                                                            v.      Whether other individuals, organizations, or providers were considered or solicited to perform media training services for you and your agency;                                                              i.      How such services were identified, selected, and procured by you and your agency;                                                            ii.      The scope of services to be provided by Sullivan/ Wellesley Partners;                                                         iii.      The intended recipients and/or attendees of such trainings;                                                         iv.      The total cost paid for such services, up to the date of this letter; and                                                            v.      Whether other individuals, organizations, or providers were considered or solicited to perform “executive coaching” services for you and your agency; I appreciate your prompt attention to this request, and await your responsive reply no later than September 23, 2022.  Sincerely,###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/8/in-case-you-missed-it,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In case you missed it, Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News about the growing national debt, the horribly reckless decision to give state and local government billions of taxpayer dollars as “COVID bailout” money and the need to pass the Pay Down the Debt Act.In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote: ”As reckless government spending continues to fuel raging inflation, it’s time that we force Washington to face reality and stop giving our supposed ‘leaders’ the opportunity to ignore the debt hole they are digging. One of the most egregious examples of reckless spending that’s fueled America’s inflation and debt crises are huge state bailouts using your tax dollars. The CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan together allocated more than $500 billion in direct aid to state and local governments. In April 2020, just weeks after Congress passed the CARES Act, I joined a handful of my Republican colleagues in a letter urging President Trump to reject any funding for state bailouts in any future COVID-19 relief package. Even then, in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I knew that writing blank checks to state and local government would do nothing but reward decades of fiscal mismanagement and incentivize an increased reliance on federal taxpayers. Unfortunately, after looking at the results of the $500 billion investment, it seems I was right. … The lesson here is simple: no amount of government spending can save you from failed leadership. New Jersey, Illinois and New York – blue states run by Democrats - all face unfunded pensions, bloated budgets, large state debts and high taxes. They’re all failing. That’s why I opposed state bailouts from the very start and why I made fiscal responsibility and paying down the debt a major focus on my Plan to Rescue America. Now, Joe Biden is trying to send America down this same dangerous path and it’s up to us to stop him. … From the time President Biden was elected, he has pushed for one massive spending package after another. What are the results of his socialist agenda? Our nation is falling into a recession and American families are suffering as they dealing with sky-high gas and food prices. Things look grim, but there is always hope. We can turn America around and fix the mess Joe Biden has created. I know we can do this because I did it as governor of Florida. … It’s time we start holding our so-called ‘leaders’ in Washington and across the nation accountable. Here’s my challenge to state and local governments: balance your budgets, demand that my Pay Down the Debt Act becomes law and then SEND THE ‘COVID-RELIEF’ MONEY BACK.” Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE. ###"

The establishment of a bicameral, bipartisan committee will allow the Congress to conduct a full investigation into President Biden’s failed and tragic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan that took the lives of 13 brave U.S. service members, stranded hundreds of Americans behind enemy lines, handed power back to the Taliban and left billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment in the hands of terrorists. This Joint Select Committee would follow the precedent set in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair. Senator Scott introduced the legislation to establish a Joint Select Committee on Afghanistan in October 2021 after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer refused to answer his calls for accountability and failed to use their authority to launch a bicameral, bipartisan investigation. Senator Rick Scott said, “It has been one year since the United States suffered its most stunning, unforced and humiliating defeat in decades and there has been ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT. We lost 13 brave service members, stranded hundreds of our own citizens and left BILLIONS of dollars of military equipment in the hands of terrorists in President Biden’s horrifically botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, but he still hasn’t taken responsibility or been forced to answer for a single one of these failures. The president’s failures have placed Afghanistan back in the hands of the same terrorist-coddling extremists who ruled it on September 11, 2001. Afghanistan is once again a haven for the world’s most dangerous terrorists, who are back openly operating in Kabul. President Biden’s actions and decisions have put the national security of the United States in jeopardy more than any other president in modern history. He must be held accountable for it. It is shocking and unacceptable that after the loss of 13 American soldiers and the massive failure of President Biden’s Afghanistan withdrawal, Democrats can’t find the courage to demand answers. If Democrats are truly committed to exercising congressional oversight and protecting America’s national security, they’ll join me and move quickly to pass my resolution, launch a Joint Select Committee and begin the important work of getting answers for the American people.” Senator Scott has repeatedly called for accountability and answers for the Biden administration’s failures in Afghanistan, including for Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi to launch a bipartisan investigation into President Biden’s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan: ###"

Senator Scott is also urging his fellow Republicans to demand the passage of his Debt Cancellation Accountability Act to reverse Joe Biden’s unlawful decision to spend hundreds of billions of tax dollars to “forgive” student loan debt and force this issue to be decided by Congress.Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden and Democrats in Washington have turned their backs on hardworking American families. First, Biden and the Democrats used a totally partisan process to give the IRS $80 BILLION to hire more than 87,000 new agents, an unknown number of which will be armed, to go after families and small businesses. Now, President Biden is doubling down on his abandonment of working Americans by issuing an illegal order to use hundreds of billions of YOUR tax dollars to ‘forgive’ the loans of college-educated individuals who voluntarily took on debt to finance their education. The American people, who are already struggling to keep up with Biden’s raging inflation crisis, are disgusted with the Democrats’ dangerous, socialist agenda and demanding action. Republicans must stand united to repeal the IRS supersizing and pass my bill to force every member of Congress to go on the record for student loan forgiveness. I will be fighting tooth and nail to get these votes. Families in Florida and across the country will not tolerate more radical government overreach, and I will do whatever it takes to deliver the accountability they deserve.”Senator Scott’s Debt Cancellation Accountability Act will require the U.S. Department of Education to obtain an express appropriation from Congress to pay for any federal student loan debts the department proposes to waive, discharge, or otherwise reduce whenever granted to two or more borrowers in an amount greater than $1,000,000, rather than on a case-by-case basis. Last week, Senator Scott also introduced the Changing Our Learning, Loans, Endowments, and Graduation Expectations (COLLEGE) Act forces universities to take more responsibility when it comes to preparing students for successful careers and holds university administrators accountable for the unacceptable skyrocketing price of education. The COLLEGE Act puts higher education institutions on the hook for student debt, implements reporting requirements for metrics related to student success and ensures that massive university endowments benefit students and families first.

Following President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan announcement, Senator Scott released several tweets slamming the proposal which is expected further fuel Biden’s raging inflation crisis. Earlier this week, Senator Scott introduced the Changing Our Learning, Loans, Endowments, and Graduation Expectations (COLLEGE) Act to force universities to take more responsibility when it comes to preparing students for successful careers and to hold university administrators accountable for unacceptable skyrocketing price of education. Senator Scott’s legislation puts higher education institutions on the hook for student debt, implements reporting requirements for metrics related to student success and ensures that massive university endowments benefit students and families first. See more from this week on Twitter: Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-rick-scott-to-inspector-general-not-one-penny-of-taxpayer-money-should-benefit-communist-china,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Inspector General of the Department of Commerce, Peggy Gustafson, urging oversight of the agency’s grants process regarding the CHIPS and Science Act—ensuring a positive return on investment for the American people and their tax dollars. In March of this year, prior to the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, Senator Scott questioned Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger during a hearing in the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on how the government funds in this bill would provide a monetary return to hardworking American taxpayers and what his company’s reaction would be if Taiwan, a predominant semiconductor producer, was invaded by Communist China. Regrettably, Mr. Gelsinger doubled down on his commitments to continue operating in Communist China and he was unable to directly answer questions about how grants to companies, like Intel, would achieve a real return on investment with taxpayers’ dollars. Read the full letter HERE or below.  Ms. Peggy GustafsonOffice of Inspector GeneralU.S. Department of Commerce1401 Constitution Ave NWWashington, DC 20230 Dear Ms. Gustafson: As the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce, it is your duty to monitor all of the agency’s actions, ensure its full compliance with the law and accountability to taxpayers. With the passage and enactment of the CHIPS and Science Act, I write to urge vigorous and timely oversight of your agency’s issuance of grants authorized by this law and ask for your office to ensure a positive return on investment for the American people. Let’s be clear about what this law authorizes: billions in American taxpayer dollars will be used to prop up and facilitate investments for profitable, multibillion-dollar companies. It is imperative that your office guarantees rules are followed and companies do not take taxpayer money without maximum oversight. In March of this year, I questioned Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger during a hearing in the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on how the government funds in the CHIPS and Science Act would provide a monetary return to hardworking American taxpayers. Regrettably, he was unable to directly answer my questions, and my office never received written analysis as to how grants to companies, like Intel, would achieve a real return. This is not how we, as the fiduciaries of the American taxpayer, should operate. Additionally, in response to my questions about what his company’s reaction would be to an invasion of Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Gelsinger doubled down on his commitments to continue operating in Communist China for the foreseeable future. This is unacceptable and shows a blatant disregard for the interests of American taxpayers. If taxpayer funds are granted to companies and they continue to make “material expansion” in Communist China, it is your duty to claw back all investments. I urge your office to closely monitor how the Commerce Department defines “material expansion” to ensure a narrow definition to prevent any taxpayer subsidizing investments in Communist China. Ultimately, not one penny from the American taxpayer should go toward benefiting economic growth in Communist China. With this massive handout coming to the semiconductor industry, it is of the utmost importance that we have an Inspector General who understands the grave issues at hand. It was recently reported that for the past few years, nearly 90% of all applications for exports of sensitive technologies to Communist China have been approved by the Commerce Department.[1] This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed before American tax dollars are distributed for the production of even more advanced technology. We cannot continue to support the long-term ambitions of global dominance by the Chinese Communist Party in the name of short-term commercial gain. I look forward to working with your office on these issues moving forward. Sincerely, ###"

En la carta, el Senador Scott escribió: “Estados Unidos debe enviar un mensaje claro de tolerancia cero con la opresión y los abusos contra los derechos humanos de estos dictadores.

Lea más en el Nuevo Herald AQUÍ.24 de agosto de 2022 El Honorable Joe BidenPresidenteLa Casa Blanca1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, noroesteWashington, DC 20500 Estimado Presidente Biden: Le escribo para instar a que nieguen las visas a Miguel Díaz-Canel, Daniel Ortega, Nicolás Maduro y sus respectivas delegaciones para asistir a las reuniones de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas en la ciudad de Nueva York el próximo mes. Estos dictadores opresores y sus regímenes se involucran en actividades que continúan amenazando la estabilidad de América Latina y la seguridad nacional de los Estados Unidos. Cuba es uno de los cuatro países que Estados Unidos incluye como Estado Patrocinador del Terrorismo. Como jefe del régimen cubano comunista ilegítimo, Miguel Díaz-Canel es responsable de la voluntad de Cuba de albergar terroristas, incluidos miembros del Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN). Díaz-Canel y el régimen se han negado a apoyar las medidas antiterroristas y continúan albergando a fugitivos buscados por Estados Unidos, incluido un miembro de la Lista de terroristas más buscados del FBI. A los nicaragüenses se les ha negado una oportunidad legítima de elegir a su líder nacional porque Daniel Ortega pasó la mayor parte del año pasado encarcelando a sus oponentes políticos. Su administración ha reconocido que su elección más reciente fue fraudulenta.[1] E incluso antes de la asunción ficticia de Ortega, su administración prohibió a Ortega y a todos los miembros del régimen nicaragüense ingresar a los Estados Unidos.[2] Sería un error socavar su propia política por el bien de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas. Del mismo modo, el pueblo de Venezuela permanece unido detrás de Juan Guaidó, el líder de Venezuela elegido democráticamente. Nicolás Maduro es un matón violento que mata de hambre a sus propios ciudadanos y se confabula con grupos terroristas en Irán, incluido Hezbolá. Es un líder ilegítimo que orquestó elecciones fraudulentas y trabajó para desestabilizar la región. Hace solo dos años, el Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos (DOJ) emitió una recompensa de $15 millones por Maduro y lo acusó de dirigir el Cártel de Los Soles, una asociación narcoterrorista con las FARC. Según el DOJ, Maduro: …negoció cargamentos de varias toneladas de cocaína producida por las FARC; ordenó que el Cártel de Los Soles proporcione armas de grado militar a las FARC; coordinó asuntos exteriores con Honduras y otros países para facilitar el tráfico de drogas a gran escala; y solicitó asistencia de los líderes de las FARC para entrenar a un grupo de milicianos no autorizado que funcionaba, en esencia, como una unidad de las fuerzas armadas para el Cártel de Los Soles.[3] A menos que la administración tenga la intención de arrestar a Maduro, no se le debe permitir ingresar a los Estados Unidos. Estados Unidos debe enviar un mensaje claro de tolerancia cero para la opresión y los abusos contra los derechos humanos de estos dictadores. Permitir que Díaz-Canel, Ortega, Maduro -o sus representantes- ingresen a Estados Unidos les daría una legitimidad que no se han ganado ni merecen. Les imploro que defiendan la libertad y la democracia en América Latina y hagan lo correcto para proteger los intereses de seguridad de los Estados Unidos al negar la entrada a estos tres matones y sus aliados. Sinceramente, Rick ScottSenador de los Estados Unidos ###"

In the letter Senator Scott wrote:“The U.S. must send a clear message of zero tolerance for these dictators’ oppression and human rights abuses. Allowing Ortega, Díaz-Canel, or Maduro—or their representatives—into the United States would afford them a legitimacy they have neither earned nor deserve.”Read the full letter HERE or below. Read more in the Miami Herald HERE. August 24, 2022 The Honorable Joe BidenPresidentThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden: I write to urge you to deny visas for Miguel Díaz-Canel, Daniel Ortega, Nicolás Maduro, and their respective delegations to attend the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York City next month. These oppressive dictators and their regimes engage in activity that continues to threaten the stability of Latin America and the national security of the United States. Cuba is one of only four countries that the United States lists as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. As the head of the illegitimate communist Cuban regime, Miguel Díaz-Canel is responsible for Cuba’s willingness to harbor terrorists, including members of the National Liberation Army. Díaz-Canel and the regime have refused to support anti-terrorism measures and continue to harbor fugitives wanted by the United States, including a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Most Wanted Terrorists List. Nicaraguans have been denied a legitimate chance to choose their national leader because Daniel Ortega spent most of last year imprisoning his political opponents. Your administration has recognized his most recent election to be fraudulent.[1] And even before Ortega’s sham inauguration, your administration prohibited Ortega and all members of the Nicaraguan regime from entering the United States.[2] It would be wrong to undermine your own policy for the sake of the United Nations General Assembly. Similarly, the people of Venezuela remain united behind Juan Guaidó, the democratically-elected leader of Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro is a violent thug who starves his own citizens and colludes with terrorist groups in Iran, including Hezbollah. He is an illegitimate leader who has orchestrated fraudulent elections and worked to destabilize the region. Only two years ago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a bounty of $15 million for Maduro and charged him with running Cártel de Los Soles, a narco-terrorism partnership with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). According the DOJ, Maduro: …negotiated multi-ton shipments of FARC-produced cocaine; directed that the Cártel de Los Soles provide military-grade weapons to the FARC; coordinated foreign affairs with Honduras and other countries to facilitate large-scale drug trafficking; and solicited assistance from FARC leadership in training an unsanctioned militia group that functioned, in essence, as an armed forces unit for the Cártel de Los Soles.[3]             Unless the administration intends on arresting Maduro, he should not be allowed to enter the United States. The U.S. must send a clear message of zero tolerance for these dictators’ oppression and human rights abuses. Allowing Díaz-Canel, Ortega, or Maduro—or their representatives—into the United States would afford them a legitimacy they have neither earned nor deserve. I implore you to stand up for freedom and democracy in Latin America and do the right thing to protect the security interests of the United States by denying entry to these three thugs and their cronies. Sincerely, Rick ScottUnited States Senator [1] “Treasury Sanctions Six Nicaraguan Officials Ahead of Ortega-Murillo Sham Inauguration.” U.S. Department of Treasury, January 10, 2022. https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0552[2] “A Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Responsible for Policies or Actions That Threaten Democracy in Nicaragua.” The White House.

April’s CPI data shows that there has been significant inflation every month of Biden’s presidency. Year over year consumer prices increased 8.3% in April. Senator Rick Scott said, “Joe Biden has NO PLAN to fight the inflation crisis he has caused, and families all across America are experiencing this crisis every day. Yesterday, I invited President Biden to come to Florida for a debate on the economy and how to best fight inflation, but he’s too scared to leave his teleprompter in the White House and take me up on it. While Biden hides, across America we are seeing the highest gas prices in the history of our country, a low labor participation rate, a GDP that is declining and mortgage rates rising. Biden’s raging inflation is a tax on every American. Families are suffering, but Blame-Game Biden refuses to take responsibility. It’s clear that Biden is the problem. He is incoherent and confused and he needs to resign.” According to today’s CPI release, price increases over the year include: Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-rick-scott-to-fda-commissioner-baby-formula-shortage-demands-immediate-action,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, as parents across the country continue to struggle from Biden’s raging inflation crisis, and now face a growing and critical shortage of infant formula, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Califf urging his agency to take immediate action to fix the supply crisis and get infant formula back on shelves. Read the full letter HERE or below. May 11, 2022 The Honorable Robert M. Califf, M.D.CommissionerFood and Drug Administration10903 New Hampshire AvenueBuilding 32, Room 2346Silver Spring, MD 20993 Dear Commissioner Califf: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays an important role in safeguarding our food and drug supply chain. I write regarding the urgent shortage of baby formula facing mothers and families. In February, FDA and Abbott Nutrition announced a voluntary recall of Similac, Alimentum and EleCare baby formula manufactured in the same Sturgis, Michigan facility due to potential contamination by Cronobacter sakazakii, also known as Salmonella Newport. In response, the facility’s production came to a stop, affecting around 25% of the baby formula supply in the United States. Considering that baby formula shortages were already afflicting families across the nation, the contamination and recall could not have come at a worse time. Since the recall started, the supply of baby formula has decreased while demand for baby formula has remained consistent. This shortage of vital nutrition has even impacted a majority of states’ Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) because Abbot has been their exclusive supplier.[1] Now, it is estimated that about 40% of store shelves are out of stock of baby formula.[2]             The cause of the current shortage is especially infuriating given prior warning signs. In 2019, the FDA inspected the facility and noted issues dealing with “clean and sanitary conditions,” not washing soiled and containment hands before working with formula,[3] and the facility’s lack of adequate testing of samples.[4] Furthermore, in October 2021, a former employee at the plant sent a report to the FDA outlining concerns about the Sturgis plant’s dangerous practices.[5] Despite these reports, the facility continued to operate until four children were hospitalized, and two tragically died. There are more than 200,000 births in Florida each year, and formula is needed to provide critical nutrition for many of those children. Given the importance of baby formula to the well-being of children and families, and the need for the FDA to act quickly to ensure families have the food they need to feed their children, please answer the following the questions:  I look forward to your prompt response so that the youngest and most vulnerable among us have access to the nutrition that they need, and urge the FDA to take swift and decisive actions to solve this growing supply shortage. Sincerely, ###[1] https://www.nwica.org/blog/wic-providers-respond-to-abbott-recall-of-powder-infant-formula-similac-alimentum-elecare[2]https://www.axios.com/2022/05/06/baby-formula-shortage-abbott-recall [3] https://www.fda.gov/media/156747/download[4] https://www.fda.gov/media/156748/download[5] https://www.scribd.com/document/572168183/Redacted-Confidential-Disclosure-Re-Abbott-Laboratories-10-19-2021-Redacted-1-1#from_embed[6] https://www.fda.gov/media/157073/download[7] Australia, Bahrain, Barbados, Bermuda, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Guam, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Peru, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vietnam ANI South."

The most effective thing Joe Biden can do to solve the inflation crisis he created is resign. He’s the problem. Getting him out of office is a quick and easy solution. “Let’s be honest here. Joe Biden is unwell. He’s unfit for office. He’s incoherent, incapacitated and confused. He doesn’t know where he is half the time. He’s incapable of leading and he’s incapable of carrying out his duties. Period. “Everyone knows it. No one is willing to say it. But we have to, for the sake of the country. Joe Biden can’t do the job.”  Joe Biden’s speech today is the latest in a series of speeches and statements from the White House attacking Senator Scott with lies. Even the Washington Post fact-checker has called out the president for his lies.  Joe Biden’s inflation has already raised taxes on every single American by more than $5,000 while Senator Scott has cut more taxes than anyone in Washington and will continue to fight for lower taxes for hard-working Americans.  ###"

According to recent polling conducted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, 73% of voters agree that an unborn baby is a human being. So that raises the question: When do Democrats believe life begins? At conception? At viability? At birth? After birth? They won’t say. Even more disconcerting, reporters won’t ask them.… Since the leaked draft opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Democrats have come out as the abortion extremists we’ve always known they are. They’ve staked out a position that is simply outside the mainstream of where average American voters are.… Meanwhile, Republicans are happy to answer the question of when life begins: We believe life begins at conception because we believe in science and place value in every life, born and unborn. Once Democrats have an answer, we can have a legitimate debate on the issue.” Read the full op-ed in the Wall Street Journal HERE. ###"

Lo más efectivo que Joe Biden puede hacer para resolver la crisis de inflación que el creó es renunciar. Él es el problema. Sacarlo de la oficina es una solución rápida y fácil. Seamos honestos aquí.

In 2009, while Biden was vice president, a decision was made to downgrade this important statutory position which advised the president on all drug policy matters. As President Biden's border crisis rages and the nation continues to see the epidemic take a toll on families everywhere, Senator Scott remains committed to finding ways to ensure public safety and save lives. Elevating the Director of the ONDCP to its rightly deserved place in the presidential cabinet to help give attention and resources to curbing the epidemic. Read the full letter HERE or below. May 6, 2022 The Honorable Joe BidenPresidentThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: The unprecedented amount of illegal drugs flowing through our southern border calls for a unified course of action. From 1993 to 2009, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) served on the president’s Cabinet. This important statutory position, the president’s principal adviser on all drug policy matters, was downgraded in 2009 when you were vice president.[1] The ONDCP’s position in the White House has been limited since the downgrade in 2009. With more than 100,000 Americans dying last year from opioid overdoses[2], it is time the ONDCP director be elevated back to a Cabinet-level position. Given the unique role of the ONDCP to assess threats both domestically and internationally, the ONDCP director should lead the National Strategy on combatting this epidemic. Returning the director to the Cabinet would help improve information sharing and coordination between departments that is already required by law,[3] and allow the ONDCP to have better oversight of the National Drug Control Budget. In addition to returning the ONDCP director to the Cabinet, I urge you to use this opportunity to prioritize combatting the rise of fentanyl and its analogues as they flood through our southern border.[4] Fentanyl has become the leading cause of death among Americans aged 18–45, above both suicide and COVID-19.[5] Since 2018, the dramatic rise in synthetic opioid overdoses has sent a wave of grief through American communities. Your administration has shown a shocking lack of will to stop this flow of dangerous drugs, and the traffickers who bring them into our communities. You have a duty to the American people—not the illegal aliens that are flagrantly ignoring U.S. law and trafficking children and drugs, and committing crimes.[6] It is time to take action to protect our families. Recently, ONDCP released the National Drug Control Strategy. I am glad to see that the administration is considering the rising deaths associated with fentanyl to be of national importance, but the lack of reference to the issues faced at the southern border and the need for increased presence and support at the largest points of entry is alarming. Fentanyl is pouring across the border, and until the strategy addresses that, it is incomplete. We cannot ignore that Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continue to traffic drugs while our border agents are overwhelmed by the massive influx of illegal immigrants that your administration is welcoming with open arms. Until our border is secured, America lives will continue to be lost to this epidemic.  As we continue to see the epidemic take a toll on families everywhere, I remain committed to finding ways to ensure public safety and fight crime. Elevating the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy back to its rightful spot on the Cabinet is an important step in curbing the opioid epidemic. I urge you to consider this and recognize the important role they play in fighting this public health emergency. Sincerely, ###[1] https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-lz1e31hatch194129-downgrading-drug-czar-and-his-of-2009mar31-story.html[2] https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm[3] 21 USC §1704[4] https://rollcall.com/2021/06/11/bidens-border-policies-are-worsening-the-opioid-crisis/[5] https://www.gbhoh.com/fentanyl-becomes-leading-cause-of-death-for-ages-18-45/[6] https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/federal-report-shows-open-borders-bring-increased-crimes-and-costs-taxpayers"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-rick-scott-issues-weekly-update-on-biden-s-inflation-crisis,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released a weekly update on his actions to address America’s debt crisis and rising inflation. Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has urged government accountability to the American taxpayer. Following this week’s Federal Reserve’s announcement on its massive $9 trillion balance sheet and Chair Jay Powell’s failure to properly manage the Fed, Senator Scott released the following statement:  Senator Rick Scott said, “Once again the Federal Reserve is failing the American people. As inflation continues to skyrocket, GDP declines, and families’ budgets shrink, the Fed seems happy to sit back and do nothing to fix the financial nightmare hardworking families are living through. The Fed’s balance sheet is unprecedentedly high—$9 TRILLION—and Jay Powell’s plan to ‘address it’ is woefully inadequate.

Desde que fue elegido para el Senado de los EE. UU., el Senador Scott ha instado a que el gobierno rinda cuentas al contribuyente estadounidense.

A medida que la inflación continúa disparándose, el PIB disminuye y los presupuestos de las familias se reducen, la Reserva Federal parece feliz de sentarse y no hacer nada para solucionar la pesadilla financiera que viven las familias trabajadoras. El balance de la Reserva Federal es sin precedentes (9 BILLONES DE DÓLARES) y el plan de Jay Powell para “abordarlo” es lamentablemente inadecuado. Según el plan anunciado hoy, reducir el balance llevará casi una década. La inflación está ocurriendo HOY. La Fed necesita abordar esta crisis HOY. Sus continuas tácticas dilatorias están perjudicando a las familias y ponen en riesgo el futuro de nuestro país. Las familias ya no pueden permitirse los fracasos de la Reserva Federal”. Desde que fue elegido para el Senado de los EE.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-rick-scott-biden-s-thought-police-is-a-terrifying-assault-on-free-speech,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement regarding the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) new Disinformation Governance Board. Senator Scott will be demanding answers from DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on this new unit during Wednesday’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Joe Biden is using DHS to create thought police and it should scare the living daylights out of every American. The president claims to care about fighting disinformation, but he and his administration have repeatedly lied to the American people and even called on social media companies to censor and silence American voices. We need to be very clear: this isn’t about a commitment to the truth or keeping families safe. This is Joe Biden and the Democrats using the federal government to police speech. I look forward to pressing Secretary Mayorkas, someone who has repeatedly lied to Congress, on this when he comes before HSGAC this week. Biden’s thought police is something straight out of Orwell’s 1984 and I will do everything in my power to destroy this attack on free speech.” ###"

This is the largest annual increase in the PCE Price Index since 1982 – marking a 40-year high in prices under Joe Biden’s failed leadership. This data shows how President Biden’s inflation crisis, caused by his and Democrats’ socialist policies and reckless government spending, is shrinking budgets for families as the prices of everyday goods continue to skyrocket.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Inflation is a tax on every American and under President Biden’s failed leadership, that tax is going up every month. Joe Biden can keep lying about how ‘great’ the economy is doing and using all the excuses he wants, but here are the facts: inflation is the worst we’ve seen in more than 40 years, the economy is shrinking, labor participation is shockingly low and labor costs are at record highs we haven’t seen in two decades. For small businesses and our poorest families, like mine growing up, Biden’s raging inflation crisis is absolutely devastating. Hardworking Floridians simply can’t afford another two-and-a-half years of Joe Biden’s reckless, socialist policies and tax and spend agenda.” Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

Este es el mayor aumento anual en el índice de precios PCE desde 1982, lo que marca un máximo de 40 años en los precios bajo el liderazgo fallido de Joe Biden.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sen-rick-scott-biden-s-agenda-devastates-america-his-confusion-lies-only-make-things-worse,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following reports that U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined at a 1.4% annualized rate, Senator Rick Scott issued the following statement in response to Joe Biden’s confused lies about his plan to rescue America and the president’s failed agenda. Senator Rick Scott said, “Today, in response to a horrific GDP report showing 1.4% annualized decline, the president issued a desperate statement lying about my plan to rescue America and calling on Congress to pass legislation to bolster U.S. supply chains, lower the federal deficit and stop inflation. That’s rich coming from the man who is single handedly responsible for historically high inflation, wants to raise the federal debt to $45 TRILLION, has no plan to balance the budget and whose failed leadership is pushing our nation into an economic recession where the labor participation rate is shockingly low. “Joe Biden is clearly obsessed with my plan to rescue America and very confused about his own agenda that is devastating American families. Unlike Joe Biden, I’m a proven tax cutter. I’ve cut more taxes than anyone in Washington and even the liberal Washington Post has corrected Biden’s lies about me. Sadly, it’s no surprise after spending a year hiding in his basement before spending another year hiding in the White House and his Delaware vacation home, that Biden has lost his grip on reality. Thankfully, the American people aren’t buying his lies. As long as Biden and the Democrats keep trying to destroy this great country, I’ll be fighting to rescue it. We’ll stop at nothing to hold Biden and the radical Left responsible for the disasters they’ve created.” ###"

For months, Senator Scott has been pushing for a bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Afghanistan to conduct a full investigation into President Biden’s failed and tragic withdrawal of U.S. forces that stranded hundreds of Americans behind enemy lines, took the lives of 13 U.S. service members and left billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment in the hands of terrorists. Senator Rick Scott said, “Not only has Biden’s failed Afghanistan withdrawal led to the tragic deaths of U.S. service members, left Americans stranded and our world in a more dangerous place, it has literally made the Taliban regime that we fought for DECADES better equipped to fight. Thanks to President Biden’s failures and incompetence as commander in chief, over $7 BILLION worth of American military equipment, paid for by U.S. taxpayer dollars, was left behind enemy lines in Afghanistan and in the hands of terrorists. Months later, we still have no explanation as to what led to the United States’ most stunning, unforced and humiliating defeat in decades.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sen-rick-scott-rolls-out-package-to-hold-communist-china-accountable-protect-u-s-investors,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott announced a package of four finance-focused bills to hold Communist China accountable and better protect American investors and families. As tensions between the U.S. and Communist China continue to rise, these important bills will put safeguards in place to protect Americans’ hard-earned investments and stop exploitation by the Communist Chinese government. Since being elected to the Senate in 2018, Senator Scott has been urging both federal agencies and private businesses to decouple operations and investments from the genocidal Chinese regime. The proposed legislation will hold Communist China accountable by closing investment sanctions loopholes, protecting investors from dubious Chinese companies, imposing new sanctions, demanding additional transparency and accountability from publicly-traded companies, and identifying vulnerabilities and requiring disclosures so that transactions are transparent and safe for Americans. Senator Rick Scott said, “We know Communist China will stop at nothing to exploit American markets and take advantage of U.S. investors and companies doing business within its country. Communist China poses a clear and present threat to the U.S. economy and its top targets are our investors, markets, supply chains and jobs. I continue to strongly advocate for all American investors and business leaders to cut ties with Communist China, and forcing transparency to expose both financial and national security risks is absolutely necessary to achieve this. Chinese companies largely operate under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, and if they continue to act in bad faith, we cannot as a country continue to invest and provide capital to their regime. This package will do just that. I’m proud to have such strong support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in our fight to hold Communist China accountable and keep Americans’ finances and retirements safe.” Senator Scott’s package to hold Communist China accountable include the following bills: The Sanction Transactions Originating from Pernicious Chinese Companies and Policies (STOP CCP) Act, cosponsored by Senators Joni Ernst, Ted Cruz, Bill Hagerty and Mike BraunMany Chinese companies on the Non-Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) Chinese Military-Industrial Complex (NS-CMIC) list avoid sanctions by creating a subsidiary company as a loophole to receive investments. They also avoid sanctions by exploiting areas in the U.S. markets where the NS-CMIC list has no jurisdiction. This bill would expand the jurisdiction of existing U.S. investment restrictions targeting Chinese entities placed on the NS-CMIC Companies list as well as establish that Chinese companies sanctioned under one U.S. authority be automatically sanctioned under all other authorities. The bipartisan Protecting American Capital Act, co-led with Senator Jeanne ShaheenThe Chinese Communist Party continues to benefit from American capital entering their markets while providing little to no financial data to validate their domestic economic claims. This is both an economic gamble as well as a serious national security risk for the United States. This bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to analyze and submit an annual report to congress on the United States’ financial exposure among certain sectors of the Chinese economy that pose significant risk.  The Transaction and Sourcing Knowledge (TASK) Act, cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Braun The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has done very little to crack down on China’s abuses within the U.S. public markets, especially when it comes to the atrocities regarding forced labor and human rights violations within the Peoples republic of China (PRC). This bill would direct the SEC to report on specific sourcing and transaction activities within the forced labor region of the Xinjiang province. Additionally, this bill would require an annual report disclosing if there is a Chinese Communist Party committee member apart of the companies’ operation and summarize the actions and corporate decisions in which such committees may have participated. The Secure America’s Financial Exchanges (SAFE) Act, cosponsored by Senator Mike BraunChinese companies continue to list Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on America’s financial exchanges. Many of these companies have alarming ties to the Chinese Communist Party, yet this information is not required to be disclosed to investors or the SEC when seeking to list on American financial exchanges. This bill would require the SEC to implement specific disclosure requirements for Chinese-based companies seeking access into U.S.-based exchanges through Initial Public Offering (IPOs). ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sen-rick-scott-on-senate-floor-biden-s-fed-nominees-don-t-deserve-to-hold-their-seats,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate Floor to express his disapproval of President Joe Biden’s nominees to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and slam their disastrous policy decisions which continue to distort credit markets and hurt America’s poorest families and those on fixed incomes. Senator Rick Scott said, “FOR YEARS, I have urged Fed Chair Jay Powell and members of the Federal Open Market Committee to reduce the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet – but they have failed to act. Month after month, the Fed has purchased BILLIONS in Treasuries and Mortgage-Backed Securities, with no plan to wind down and right size its balance sheet. At every turn in recent years when the Fed could have been fighting for American families by mitigating the long-term risks of its massive balance sheet and telling the truth about the terrible consequences of reckless government spending, it instead chose to appease Joe Biden, Wall Street and the Democrats running Washington. These nominees have completely failed the American people and don’t deserve to hold their seats.” Watch more in the video HERE or below.###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sens-rick-scott-and-jeanne-shaheen-introduce-bipartisan-protecting-american-capital-act-to-hold-communist-china-accountable,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott was joined by Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to introduce the bipartisan Protecting American Capital Act. Companies based in Communist China often benefit immensely from American capital, but provide unreliable or manipulated financial data in an attempt to validate their claims. Without reliable data, U.S. investors are unable to accurately assess the large financial risks imposed by Communist China. The Protecting American Capital Act would require the U.S. Treasury to submit an annual risk assessment to Congress regarding American investors’ financial exposure in the Communist Chinese economy.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Communist China cares about one thing: exploiting Americans to drive up profits and further its mission of world domination. I continue to strongly advocate for all American investors and business leaders to cut ties with Communist China, and forcing transparency to expose both financial and national security risks is absolutely necessary to achieve this. We cannot allow Communist China to lie, cheat and steal any longer. I thank Senator Jeanne Shaheen for cosponsoring this legislation and urge our colleagues to join us in advancing this critical bill. Senator Jeanne Shaheen said, “As China intensifies aggression and economic manipulation of markets, tracking how U.S. dollars flow into China is critical to our national security. It’s alarming how little financial data and reporting requirements are currently in place to validate domestic economic claims made by China. That’s why I’m introducing this bipartisan bill to improve transparency measures and address significant investment risks posed by unchecked American capital in China. Ensuring accountability around U.S. investments that benefit China is critical to bolster U.S. economic and national security.” ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sen-rick-scott-to-cbp-commissioner-we-must-enforce-stop-act-end-cartel-drug-smuggling-via-usps,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Chris Magnus urging CBP to take immediate action to close a loophole allowing dangerous drug cartels to smuggle fentanyl into America using the United States Postal Service (USPS), and demanding answers on CBP’s enforcement of the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act. The STOP Act, signed into law in 2018, requires USPS to be held to the same standard as commercial shipping services, like FedEx and UPS, to use an informational marker system to share information between shippers, CBP and receivers. Currently under CBP’s direction, USPS is failing to follow the requirements of the law; allowing criminal organizations in countries like Communist China to use USPS to smuggle deadly fentanyl into the United States. Read the full letter HERE or below.  April 26, 2022 The Honorable Chris MagnusCommissionerUS Customs and Border Protection1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20229 Dear Commissioner Magnus: For too long, Cartels and other foreign drug organizations have been able to use the United States Postal Service (USPS) as their own drug smuggling delivery service. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has the opportunity to close a loophole in the existing rule which has allowed dangerous fentanyl to be shipped directly into our country by issuing guidance on the collection and sharing of advance electronic data (AED).  AED provides invaluable information on inbound packages such as where it is coming from, where it is going, who it is coming from, who it is going to, and what is in it. Fentanyl and its precursor chemicals have been able to be shipped directly into the country without AED information. Fentanyl has become the number one cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.[1] More than 100,000 Americans lost their lives due to opioid overdoses in 2021 and more young Americans are now dying from fentanyl poisoning than suicide and car accidents. Precursor chemicals, fentanyl, and other illicit drugs being used to manufacture counterfeit pills are flowing into our country through our mail system and across our broken southern border. Congress took steps to address this pervasive issue by passing the Synthetics Trafficking & Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act which was later signed into law in 2018.[2] The STOP Act required CBP to issue guidelines on Advanced Electronic Data (AED) to USPS by October 2019 in order to ensure implementation by the January 2021 deadline outlined in the legislation. However, CBP did not issue the guidelines until almost two years later[3] which delayed the requirement of AED on all packages. The Interim Final Rule (IFR), Mandatory Advance Electronic Information for International Mail Shipments, issued by CBP still leaves concerning loopholes open for future foreign drug traffickers to exploit. It is vital that every package shipped across our borders has AED in order to target and disrupt the flow of illicit drugs into the country. The language in the IFR is not strong enough to effectively curb it. The legislation passed states USPS should refuse any shipment without AED, but the IFR continues to delay the enforcement and adds exemptions. In addition, the IFR welcomes and accepts waivers for non-compliance with AED issued for over 100 countries. Communist China, one of the largest shippers of packages to the United States, has still been allowed to ship packages without AED even though the country has the means available provide the necessary data. Communist China has known criminal organizations that are able to ship dangerous chemicals across the world. CBP should focus on ensuring Communist China fully complies with the law. There has been ample time to for countries to prepare and comply with the law and the IFR should reflect that. CBP already requires AED for international packages shipped through FedEx and UPS, the USPS should be held to the same standard.[4] To ensure the law is being properly enacted, I request a response to the following questions regarding the collection and enforcement of AED no later than May 31, 2022:  Fentanyl is a danger to American communities across the country. Every step must be taken to forcibly end this crisis and save American lives. I look forward to your response. Sincerely, ###[1] https://www.familiesagainstfentanyl.org/research/byage[2] PL 115-271[3] https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/15/2021-04373/mandatory-advance-electronic-information-for-international-mail-shipments[4] https://datainnovation.org/2021/05/better-data-on-international-mail-packages-could-reduce-illegal-drugs-and-counterfeits/ "

La carta surge en medio de informes inquietantes de que la administración Biden continúa con sus peligrosas políticas de apaciguamiento y se reúne con miembros del ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano esta semana. Lea la carta completa AQUÍ o abajo. 20 de abril de 2022 El Honorable Joe BidenPresidenteCasa Blanca1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20500 Estimado Presidente Biden: Como anunció a principios de este año, Estados Unidos será el anfitrión de la Novena Cumbre de las Américas en Los Ángeles, California, durante la semana del 6 al 10 de Junio de 2022. Esta será la primera Cumbre de las Américas organizada por los Estados Unidos desde la Cumbre en 1994, que se llevó a cabo en Miami, Florida. Desafortunadamente, en Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua, estamos viendo a nuestros enemigos como la China comunista, Rusia e Irán interviniendo y apoyando a líderes totalitarios en su esfuerzo por desestabilizar la región. Estados Unidos debe ser una voz líder en defensa de la libertad, la democracia, el estado de derecho, los derechos humanos y el buen gobierno en nuestro hemisferio. Habiendo pasado años representando a los floridanos y a los millones de hispanoamericanos que llaman hogar al Estado del Sol, entendemos completamente la importancia de esta Cumbre para lograr ese objetivo. Por eso, hoy le escribimos para exhortarle invitar a Juan Guaidó, el Presidente democráticamente electo por la Asamblea Nacional de Venezuela, a asistir a la Cumbre. El Presidente Guaidó es el líder legítimo de Venezuela y representa los intereses de los venezolanos amantes de la libertad que están hartos de la tiranía, la opresión y el genocidio de Nicolás Maduro. Solo el Presidente Guaidó y representantes de su gobierno merecen un asiento en la Cumbre. Es de vital importancia que no permitamos que la Cumbre legitime a los tiranos en Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua. Estados Unidos debe prohibir que representantes de los regímenes ilegítimos de Miguel Díaz-Canel en Cuba, Nicolás Maduro en Venezuela y Daniel Ortega en Nicaragua asistan a la Cumbre. Estos hombres son dictadores que matan de hambre a su propio pueblo, encarcelan a los disidentes políticos y reprimen las protestas pacíficas. Dar la bienvenida a estos líderes malvados e ilegítimos, o a los representantes de sus falsos gobiernos, sería para los Estados Unidos nada menos que un gran apaciguamiento que perjudica a los movimientos por la libertad y la democracia en estas naciones. Hemos sido increíblemente francos sobre las amenazas que los enemigos totalitarios y corruptos, como Maduro, Ortega y el régimen comunista ilegítimo de Cuba, representan para los Estados Unidos y nuestras naciones democráticas amigas, y los horribles abusos contra los derechos humanos que ocurren bajo su dirección. Durante la Cumbre, los instamos a resaltar las luchas de los activistas por la democracia como José Daniel Ferrer, quien ha sido injustamente encarcelado y torturado por los matones de Díaz-Canel en Cuba durante casi nueve meses. Además, Estados Unidos debería usar la Cumbre para resaltar cómo los adversarios, como Rusia, la China comunista e Irán, apoyan y colaboran con estos regímenes burdos para desestabilizar el régimen, promover el socialismo y reforzar grupos terroristas como las FARC. Finalmente, antes de la Cumbre, le instamos a apoyar la aprobación de la Ley de Prohibición de Operaciones y Arrendamientos con el Régimen Autoritario Ilegítimo de Venezuela (BOLÍVAR), que prohibiría a las agencias federales hacer negocios con cualquier persona que apoye al régimen opresivo de Maduro. Bajo ninguna circunstancia debemos levantar las sanciones a Maduro o sus matones, y no existe un mundo en el que tenga sentido comprar petróleo venezolano. La Ley BOLIVAR,  liderada por el Senador Scott y el Congresista Waltz,  es un proyecto de ley bicameral y bipartidista que fue aprobado por unanimidad por el Comité de Asuntos Gubernamentales y Seguridad Nacional del Senado en Marzo de 2021. Este buen proyecto de ley merece su pleno apoyo, y promulgarlo antes de la Cumbre enviaría un fuerte mensaje de apoyo y liderazgo estadounidense. Debemos ser claros e inequívocos al enfrentarnos a los matones que están oprimiendo a los pueblos de Venezuela, Nicaragua y Cuba. Esperamos que aproveche esta oportunidad única para mostrar con firmeza el apoyo inquebrantable de Estados Unidos a la libertad y la democracia en todo el hemisferio occidental. Sinceramente, ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sen-rick-scott-florida-colleagues-to-joe-biden-juan-guaid-must-be-invited-to-summit-of-the-americas,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott, joined by Senator Marco Rubio and Representatives Mario Díaz-Balart, María Elvira Salazar, Carlos Giménez and Mike Waltz, sent a letter to Joe Biden calling on him to invite Juan Guaidó, the democratically-elected President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, to attend the Summit of the Americas, which the United States will host in Los Angeles the week of June 6-10, 2022. In the letter, Senator Scott and his colleagues are also calling on President Biden to prohibit representatives from the illegitimate regimes of Miguel Díaz-Canel in Cuba, Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua from attending the Summit. They also are urging President Biden to support the passage of their bicameral, bipartisan Banning Operations and Leases with the Illegitimate Venezuelan Authoritarian Regime (BOLIVAR) Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro regime. The letter comes amid disturbing reports that the Biden administration is continuing its dangerous appeasement policies and meeting with members of the illegitimate, communist Cuban regime this week. Read the full letter HERE or below.  April 20, 2022 The Honorable Joe Biden President White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Biden:           As you announced earlier this year, the United States will host the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California during the week of June 6-10, 2022. This will be the first Summit of the Americas hosted in the United States since the very first Summit in 1994, which was held in Miami, Florida. Unfortunately, in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, we are seeing our enemies like Communist China, Russia and Iran stepping in and propping up totalitarian leaders in their effort to destabilize the region. America needs to be a leading voice for freedom, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and good governance in our hemisphere. Having spent years representing Floridians and the millions of Hispanic-Americans who call the Sunshine State home, we fully understand the importance of this Summit in achieving that goal. That’s why, today, we write to urge that you invite Juan Guaidó, the democratically-elected President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, to attend the Summit. President Guaidó is the legitimate, democratically elected leader of Venezuela and he represents the interests of freedom-loving Venezuelans who are fed up with Nicolás Maduro’s tyranny, oppression and genocide. President Guaidó and representatives of his government deserve a seat at the Summit, while dictator Maduro certainly does not. It is critically important that we do not allow the Summit to legitimize the tyrants in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The United States must prohibit representatives from the illegitimate regimes of Miguel Díaz-Canel in Cuba, Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua from attending the Summit. These men are dictators who are starving their own people, jailing political dissidents and cracking down on peaceful protests. Welcoming these evil and illegitimate leaders, or the representatives of their sham governments, to the United States would be nothing short of gross appeasement that hurts the movements for freedom and democracy in these nations. We have been very outspoken about the threats posed to the United States and our fellow democratic nations by totalitarian and corrupt enemies, like Maduro, Ortega and the illegitimate communist regime in Cuba – and the horrific human rights abuses occurring at their direction. These regimes have failed to uphold the basic principles of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and have forfeited a position at the Summit. During the Summit, we urge you to highlight the fights of democracy activists like José Daniel Ferrer, who has been unjustly imprisoned and tortured by thugs in Cuba for almost nine months, while artists, musicians and even children were imprisoned following the July 11 protests. Further, we believe that the United States should use the Summit to highlight how adversaries, like Russia, Communist China and Iran, support and collaborate with these gross regimes to destabilize the region, promote socialism and bolster Marxist-terrorist groups like FARC. Finally, ahead of the Summit, we urge you to support the passage of the Banning Operations and Leases with the Illegitimate Venezuelan Authoritarian Regime (BOLIVAR) Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro regime. Under no circumstances should we lift sanctions on Maduro or his thugs, and there is no world in which it makes sense to purchase Venezuelan oil. The BOLIVAR Act, led by Senator Scott and Congressman Waltz, is a bicameral, bipartisan bill that was unanimously approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in March 2021. This good bill deserves your full support, and signing it into law ahead of the Summit would send a strong message of American leadership. We must be clear and unapologetic in standing up to the thugs who are oppressing the people of Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. Within all applicable rules and regulations, we encourage you to use this unique opportunity to strongly show America’s unwavering support for freedom and democracy across the Western Hemisphere. Sincerely, ###"

Samaritan’s Purse is a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world, including recent efforts to establish medical facilities in various parts of Ukraine and provide food and relief to the Ukrainian people amid Russia’s invasion. An initiative of Lee Health and Golisano Children’s Hospital of Southwest Florida, Kids’ Minds Matter is dedicated to advancing services and community coordination to meet children’s mental and behavioral health care needs in Southwest Florida. Senator Rick Scott and Mrs. Ann Scott said, “We are honored to support two great organizations that are working tirelessly to make a difference in our communities and around the globe: Samaritan’s Purse and Kids’ Minds Matter. Samaritan’s Purse has an outstanding record of providing immediate response and support for individuals and communities following hurricanes, natural disasters, and times of need – especially with their work to help provide medical assistance and aid to the Ukrainian people as Russia attacks their home. Another incredible group, Kids’ Minds Matter, holds a special place in our hearts as parents and grandparents for their work to improve services and raise awareness of mental and behavioral health needs for children in our community. We are so grateful for the efforts of these organizations and their hardworking, selfless teams.” Franklin Graham, President of Samaritan’s Purse, said, “I am deeply grateful for the incredible generosity of Senator Rick Scott and his wife Ann. I appreciate their heart to help others and make a difference. I recently returned from Ukraine where I saw how much people are suffering—they need our prayers and our help. As Samaritan’s Purse continues to respond to the crisis, this gift will help our teams provide medical care, food, water, and other relief items to hurting families while also reminding them that God loves them.” Dr. Larry Antonucci, President and CEO of Lee Health, said, “Senator and Mrs. Scott have proven to be strong philanthropists and advocates for children’s mental and behavioral health care needs. Their meaningful gift brings attention to the mental health crisis our community faces and will help us increase access to behavioral healthcare services in Southwest Florida.

Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has urged government accountability to the American taxpayer. According to March’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release and Produce Price Index (PPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), data shows that there has been a significant increase in inflation every month of Biden’s presidency with CPI increasing 8.5% and PPI increasing 11.2% over the year. This week’s data marks the largest annual increase in inflation since 1981 – marking a 40-year high under Joe Biden’s failed leadership.  Following this week’s announcements of continuing skyrocketing inflation, Senator Scott released the following statement: Senator Rick Scott said, “Yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed another month of skyrocketing inflation under Joe Biden’s failed presidency. Instead of owning the crisis it created, the Biden administration wildly claimed that anyone blaming the president is ‘in lockstep with Putin.’ It’s an embarrassing example of how out of touch Biden’s administration is with reality. When food banks in Florida are trying to serve more families and struggling to keep up with rising prices, they demand action. When a working mom, like mine growing up, is forced to make the impossible choice of putting another gallon in the tank or buying what she needs to feed her family, she wants leadership, not finger pointing. I hear it every week from families in my state. Floridians are SICK AND TIRED of watching Blame-Game-Biden duck responsibility for the crisis he has created. This week’s CPI and PPI reports prove that Biden’s reckless tax-and-spend agenda has been a disastrous failure. The president can cast blame all he wants, but he can’t hide from the truth and Florida families don’t believe his lies.” Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

I spent my life in business, and this idea never occurred to me. It must be some kind of new woke business theory, but it makes no sense. That’s why I just cannot understand what the Walt Disney Company is doing. Disney used to be the happiest place on Earth, now it’s just woke central. It’s on the losing side of an issue that the majority of families, regardless of political ideology, agree with. ... The people of Florida are not extremists or bigots. They do not hate gay people. Our state is a melting pot of cultures, and we embrace that. We’re proud of it. The Florida Legislature passed, and the governor signed, a very commonsense bill that discriminates against no one — except, that is, adults who want to talk to your children about sex. … What’s interesting is that the wokeness Disney has embraced in Florida isn’t reflected in its business around the world. While Disney tries to lecture us with these extreme views, the mouse is completely unwilling to speak up for freedom and against real oppression in places such as Communist China. … So apparently, genocide is tolerable, but demanding that parents have a say in their children's schooling goes just a bit too far. … Here’s what’s clear: Parents are smart, and woke businesses are as dumb and hypocritical as ever. Maybe we should thank Disney for showing us who it really is. I’ll tell you one thing — I won’t be going back or watching Disney+ anytime soon, and I bet a lot more parents and grandparents are making that same choice.” Read the full op-ed in the Washington Examiner HERE. ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/4/sens-rick-scott-joe-manchin-fight-to-block-imf-financing-for-russia-belarus,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Senator Rick Scott and Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced the Senate introduction of their bipartisan, bicameral Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act which would prohibit the U.S. Treasury Secretary from exchanging dollars for International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) held by Russia or Belarus. Russia and Belarus’ SDRs currently total more than $25 billion and represent unconditional liquidity for the Putin and Lukashenko dictatorships, which is being used to finance the invasion of Ukraine. Congressman French Hill has proposed companion legislation in the House of Representatives. Senator Rick Scott said, “As Russia wages war against Ukraine and threatens democracy in Europe, the United States cannot allow the IMF to be its piggy bank and finance these attacks. Without this legislation, IMF countries could provide Putin and his thugs in Belarus with relief from the devastating sanctions that America and our fellow democracies have levied and open channels to funding from Communist China to fuel Russia’s genocide and unjust war. This bill is an important step to again make clear that the United States stands firmly with the people of Ukraine and will continue to punish Russia, and its evil ally Belarus, until Ukraine wins this war and Russia retreats. I am proud to partner with Senator Manchin and Congressman Hill on this important legislation, and urge all of our colleagues to support this bill.” Senator Joe Manchin said, “Limiting the international financial support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine must be a top priority for the United States and our allies. Our bipartisan, bicameral bill will prohibit the IMF from financing this unprovoked invasion by limiting Special Drawing Rights held by Russia and Belarus. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join our bipartisan legislation to limit Russia’s financing of this horrific war.” Congressman French Hill said, “I’ve warned about the dangers of the IMF’s mistaken policy on SDRs for years and we should be very concerned about Russia’s ability to exchange its SDRs for Chinese renminbi, especially as it turns to China for trade and liquidity in response to sanctions. This bill is another effort to constrain the Russian and Belarus economies by preventing them from exchanging their IMF assets to further fund their illegal war and commit atrocities on the people of Ukraine. I thank my friends, Senator Scott and Senator Manchin, for leading this effort in the Senate and introducing companion legislation to my bill, H.R. 6899, the Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act.” The Russia and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition Act would:  ###"

America is seeing inflation at a 40 year high, but Biden has done NOTHING to stop these out-of-control prices, or fix the supply chain crisis that's making this problem even worse. Biden's failures are forcing hardworking Floridians, like the mom from Southwest Florida I spoke with recently, to rely on food banks just to feed their families.

Casi todo el comercio en Cuba, especialmente el turismo, beneficia directamente al régimen comunista ilegítimo y su ejército, no al pueblo, y financia la tortura, el encarcelamiento injusto y la opresión brutal del régimen de familias cubanas inocentes. A principios de esta semana, mientras conmemorábamos el sexto aniversario de las manifestaciones democráticas del 11 de julio en Cuba, el Senado de los Estados Unidos aprobó por unanimidad la resolución del Senador Scott que apoya al activista cubano por la democracia José Daniel Ferrer y a otros manifestantes que están injustamente encarcelados, y condena enérgicamente al brutal régimen. Lea la carta completa abajo. 14 de enero de 2022             Estimados Sr. Thykier y Sr. Kerby: Todos y cada uno de los días, el régimen comunista ilegítimo de Cuba comete atrocidades horribles contra su propio pueblo, encarcelando, torturando y silenciando injustamente a cualquiera que se atreva a oponerse al régimen. Es un hecho indiscutible que casi todo el comercio, especialmente el turismo, beneficia directamente al régimen y su ejército, no al pueblo, y financia la brutal opresión del régimen. Estos abusos de derechos humanos no pueden ser ignorados. Hoy les escribo para implorarles que consideren estos crímenes y las terribles implicaciones de promover los viajes y hacer negocios con el brutal régimen comunista cubano. Si bien los turistas pueden viajar libremente a la isla, el pueblo cubano no puede disfrutar de las mismas libertades bajo el régimen de Castro y Díaz-Canel, creando un sistema de exclusión imperdonable. La experiencia de los turistas y viajeros en la isla está completamente organizada por el régimen cubano. El cubano promedio no se mezcla libremente con los turistas. Solo los cubanos aprobados por el gobierno pueden interactuar con los turistas. El Partido Comunista de Cuba controla todo y a cada persona en la isla. Dondequiera que va un turista, cada evento al que asiste y cada hotel y restaurante que visita, es propiedad del ejército cubano o está estrechamente controlado por el régimen. Cada movimiento de un viajero es observado. Además de las preocupaciones por la privacidad, sabemos que los pocos cubanos a los que se les permite trabajar en la industria del turismo ganan centavos por dólar y se ven obligados a vivir en la pobreza extrema. La escasez de alimentos, agua, electricidad y gas es común, y estos artículos básicos son casi inasequibles para la mayoría de los cubanos. La pandemia solo ha exacerbado esta injusticia. La libertad de información también está muy restringida y el gobierno mantiene su control cobrando precios inasequibles por el acceso a Internet. El régimen comunista cubano ilegítimo también está explotando la pandemia de COVID-19 para traficar a sus propios trabajadores médicos con fines de lucro a través de su misión médica, el programa de médicos cubanos. La misión médica del régimen es la mayor fuente de ingresos del gobierno y, según se informa, generó más de $7 mil millones en 2017 y más de $6 mil millones en 2018, generando más dinero que el ron, el azúcar y los puros juntos. Lamentablemente, a estos médicos se les paga una fracción de lo que el régimen obtiene de sus servicios. Este sistema económico comunista represivo controla todos los aspectos de la vida del pueblo cubano y lo ha privado de la libertad durante más de 60 años. Como sabrán, el 11 de julio de 2021, activistas por la libertad y la democracia llevaron a miles de cubanos a marchar en las calles y expresar su oposición al régimen comunista de Cuba. Durante esas protestas, los cubanos en más de 40 ciudades realizaron manifestaciones al grito de “¡Libertad!” “¡Abajo la Dictadura!” y “Patria y Vida”. A través de esas protestas, el pueblo de Cuba exigió los derechos humanos básicos, sus libertades otorgadas por Dios y el fin del comunismo. Los cubanos se reunieron frente a la sede del Partido Comunista de Cuba coreando: “¡Cuba no es tuya!”. En un mensaje claro, los cubanos ejercieron sus derechos fundamentales a reunirse pacíficamente, expresar sus opiniones políticas y vivir libres de censura y opresión. Exigieron que el Partido Comunista de Cuba liberara su control del gobierno y devolviera el poder al pueblo. Durante estas protestas, el Partido Comunista de Cuba desató una ola de terror en toda la isla al desplegar su policía secreta y fuerzas militares contra manifestantes pacíficos y detenerlos ilegalmente. El régimen hostigó y amenazó a las personas en sus hogares, secuestró y torturó a líderes de la sociedad civil y otros cubanos que ejercían pacíficamente sus derechos fundamentales, y detuvo a más de 1.000 cubanos, incluidos menores de edad, por manifestarse pacíficamente. En un esfuerzo crudo y salvaje por silenciar al pueblo cubano, el régimen cortó la conexión a Internet y los servicios móviles en toda Cuba, lo que impidió que el pueblo cubano se organizara, y ocultó al mundo exterior imágenes y videos de la represión opresiva y brutal del régimen. Un ejemplo de uno de los valientes manifestantes es José Daniel Ferrer, activista cubano por la libertad y los derechos humanos y líder de la Unión Patriótica de Cuba (UNPACU), quien lleva más de 180 días injustamente encarcelado y está siendo psicológica y físicamente torturado por el ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano en un intento de acabar con su vida. Según los miembros de su familia, la salud de José Daniel es grave y solo empeora. Sufre fuertes dolores de cabeza, sangrado bucal, desnutrición, tos e insomnio, todos productos de las crueles torturas y tratos inhumanos del régimen cubano. Es claro que estas acciones se derivan del miedo del régimen a que el movimiento por la libertad y la democracia se extienda por Cuba. Esta semana, me enorgulleció ver que el Senado aprobó por unanimidad mi resolución apoyando a José Daniel y sus compañeros activistas por la democracia, y condenando enérgicamente al brutal régimen comunista. Al aprobar esta resolución, el Senado de los Estados Unidos envió un mensaje claro al régimen de que se acabó el tiempo y que Estados Unidos apoya a quienes claman por la libertad y la democracia en la isla. Sigo trabajando con las Naciones Unidas y la Organización de los Estados Americanos, y exijo que la Casa Blanca tome medidas para asegurar visitas médicas humanitarias para José Daniel y todos los injustamente encarcelados por el régimen y exijo su liberación inmediata. La violencia, la inestabilidad y el caos que vemos hoy en América Latina están directamente relacionados con el opresivo régimen cubano que continúa apoyando a dictadores peligrosos en toda la región, incluidos Nicolás Maduro en Venezuela y Daniel Ortega en Nicaragua. Los insto a que consideren las implicaciones de facilitar los viajes a la Cuba comunista y se tomen el tiempo para comprender todas las implicaciones de apoyar los viajes y los negocios con el régimen cubano. Si las últimas seis décadas de atrocidades, opresión y miseria infligidas al pueblo cubano no son suficientes, piense en cómo se utilizarán sus dólares para causar más daño. Cuando las agencias de viajes promueven o facilitan los viajes a Cuba, muestran su apoyo a una dictadura despiadada que ha negado a los cubanos sus derechos básicos durante demasiado tiempo. Los insto a apoyar al pueblo de Cuba en su lucha por una nueva era de libertad y oportunidades. Por el bien de la democracia y la libertad que le permite hacer negocios en todo el mundo, espero que reconsideren cualquier plan para apoyar al régimen cubano y distribuyan esta carta entre sus miembros. Atentamente, Rick Scott Senador de los Estados Unidos###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-issues-weekly-update-on-biden-s-inflation-crisis,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, following the release of December’s staggering Producer (PPI) and Consumer Price (CPI) Indexes earlier this week, Senator Rick Scott released a weekly update on his actions to fight Joe Biden’s raging inflation and debt crises. PPI and CPI data showed inflation continued to rise in December increasing 9.7% and 7.0% respectively over the year. Senator Scott has been adamant about the need to implement substantive fiscal reforms to end the ongoing inflation crisis fueled by the Biden administration’s socialist tax-and-spend agenda. December’s data shows that there has been a significant increase in inflation every month of Biden’s presidency, resulting in the highest inflation increases in 40 years. Earlier this week, following the damming CPI report, Senator Scott released the following quote:  Senator Rick Scott said, “Joe Biden’s presidency has been nothing but non-stop failure. Since Biden took office, Americans have been hit with the highest inflation increases in decades, yet the president has done NOTHING to stop skyrocketing prices. Instead of taking care of the issues that are hurting hardworking families, Biden and his Democrat underlings in Congress are 100% focused on their radical plan to federalize elections. It’s shameful just how far Joe Biden will go to put the Democrats’ political power grab over the needs of the American people. “I recently heard from a woman in Florida who helps operate a food pantry. It used to be normal for her to serve about 15 families per day, but now she is seeing upwards of 70 families per day. The terrible thing about inflation is that as more folks are coming to her food pantry in need, it’s getting harder and harder to afford to help them. That’s the reality of Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and I am sick and tired of seeing this failed president do NOTHING to help. I came to Washington to make this place work for Florida families. The reckless spending must end. The socialist agenda must end. Democrats may have turned their backs on the American people, but I won’t stop fighting.” Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has repeatedly urged action to address America’s debt crisis and the harmful effects of inflation.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-to-travel-advisors-don-t-allow-tourism-to-fund-the-communist-cuban-regime,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Chair of the World Travel Agents Association Alliance (WTAAA), Lars Thykier, and the President of the American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA), Zane Kerby, urging them to reconsider any plans to facilitate travel to Cuba. Nearly all commerce in Cuba, especially tourism, directly benefits the illegitimate communist regime and its military, not the people, and funds the regime’s torture, unjust imprisonment and brutal oppression of innocent Cuban families. Earlier this week, as we marked the six month anniversary of the July 11 democracy demonstrations in Cuba, the United States Senate unanimously passed Senator Scott’s resolution supporting Cuban democracy activist José Daniel Ferrer and other demonstrators who are unjust imprisoned, and strongly condemning the brutal communist regime. Read the full letter HERE or below. January 14, 2022 Lars ThykierChairWorld Travel Agents Association AllianceRue Dautzenberg 36B-1050 BruxellesBelgium Zane KerbyPresident and Chief Executive OfficerAmerican Society of Travel Advisors675 North Washington StreetSuite 490Alexandria, VA 22314             Dear Mr. Thykier and Mr. Kerby: Each and every day, the illegitimate communist regime in Cuba commits horrific atrocities against its own people – unjustly imprisoning, torturing and silencing anyone who dares to stand against it. It is an indisputable fact that nearly all commerce, especially tourism, directly benefits the regime and its military, not the people, and funds the regime’s brutal oppression. These human rights abuses cannot be ignored. Today, I write to implore you to consider these crimes and the terrible implications of promoting travel and doing business with the brutal communist Cuban regime.  While tourists may be able to travel freely to the island, the Cuban people are unable to enjoy the same freedoms under the Castro and Díaz-Canel regime, creating an inexcusable apartheid system. The experience of tourists and travelers on the island is completely organized by the Cuban regime. The average Cuban does not mix with tourists freely. Only Cubans approved by the government can interact with tourists. The Cuban Communist Party controls everything and every person on the island. Everywhere a tourist goes, every event they attend, and every hotel and restaurant they visit, is either owned by the Cuban military or closely controlled by the regime. A traveler’s every move is watched. In addition to privacy concerns, we know that the few Cubans who are permitted to work in the tourism industry make pennies on the dollar and are forced to live in extreme poverty. Food, water, electricity and gas shortages are common, and these basic items are close to unaffordable for most Cubans. The pandemic has only exacerbated this injustice. Freedom of information is also heavily restricted, and the government maintains its control by charging unaffordable prices for internet access. The illegitimate communist Cuban regime is also exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to traffic its own medical workers for profit through their medical mission, the Cuban doctors program. The regime’s medical mission is the government’s largest source of revenue, reportedly generating more than $7 billion in 2017 and more than $6 billion in 2018 – bringing in more money than rum, sugar, and cigars combined. Sadly, these doctors are paid a fraction of what the regime brings in from their services. This repressive communist economic system controls every aspect of the Cuban people’s lives and has deprived them of freedom for over 60 years. As you may know, on July 11, 2021, freedom and democracy activists led thousands of Cubans to march in the streets and voice their opposition to the communist regime of Cuba. During those protests, Cubans in more than 40 cities held demonstrations chanting “Freedom!” “Down with the Dictatorship!” and “Patria y Vida” (“Homeland and Life”). Through those protests, the people of Cuba demanded basic human rights, their God-given freedoms and the end of communism. Cubans gathered outside of the headquarters of the Cuban Communist Party chanting, “Cuba isn’t yours!” In a clear message, Cubans exercised their fundamental rights to peacefully assemble, express their political opinions and live free from censorship and oppression. They demanded the Cuban Communist Party release their control of the government and give the power back to the people. During these protests, the Cuban Communist Party unleashed a wave of terror throughout the island by deploying its secret police and military forces on peaceful protesters and unlawfully detaining them. The regime harassed and threatened people in their homes, abducted and tortured civil society leaders and other Cubans peacefully exercising their fundamental rights, and detained more than 1,000 Cubans, including minors, for peacefully protesting. In a crude and savage effort to silence the Cuban people, the regime cut internet connectivity and mobile services throughout Cuba, which prevented the Cuban people from organizing, and hid images and videos of the regime’s oppressive and brutal crackdown from the outside world. An example of one of the courageous demonstrators is José Daniel Ferrer, the Cuban freedom and human rights activist and the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), who has been unjustly imprisoned for more than 180 days, and is being psychologically and physically tortured by the illegitimate communist Cuban regime in an attempt to end his life. According to his family members, José Daniel’s health is dire and only getting worse. He’s suffering from severe headaches, mouth bleeding, malnutrition, cough and insomnia – all products of the cruel torture and inhumane treatment from the Cuban regime. It is clear that these actions stem from the regime’s total fear of the movement for freedom and democracy spreading across Cuba. This week, I was proud to see the Senate unanimously pass my resolution supporting José Daniel and his fellow democracy activists, and strongly condemning the brutal communist regime. In passing this resolution, the United States Senate sent a clear message to the regime that its time is up and the United States stands with those crying out for freedom and democracy on the island. I continue to work with the United Nations and the Organization of American States, and demand the White House take action to secure humanitarian medical visits for José Daniel and all unjustly imprisoned by the regime and demand their immediate release. The violence, instability and chaos we see today in Latin America is directly tied to the oppressive Cuban regime which continues to prop up dangerous dictators throughout the region, including Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. I urge you to consider the implications of facilitating travel to Communist Cuba and take the time to understand the full implications of supporting travel and business with the Cuban regime. If the past six decades of atrocities, oppression and misery inflicted on the Cuban people are not enough, think about how your dollars will be used to further cause harm. When travel agencies promote or facilitate travel to Cuba, it shows support of a ruthless dictatorship that has denied Cubans their basic rights for far too long. I urge you to stand with the people of Cuba as they fight for a new era of freedom and opportunity. For the sake of the democracy and freedom that allows you to do business around the world, I hope you reconsider any plans to support the Cuban regime and distribute this letter with your membership. Sincerely, Rick ScottUnited States Senator ###"

It happens in Congress all the time, but the flip-flops we are seeing from Senate Democrats right now on the filibuster is a case study in career politician amnesia. … For decades, the legislative filibuster has served as a defining rule of the United States Senate. The filibuster requires a 60-vote threshold to end debate on pending legislation, protects the minority party’s rights, fosters bipartisan cooperation and safeguards the interests of millions of Americans.… Here’s what’s strange (or not so strange, if you know how things work in Washington).  So many Senate Democrats who are fighting to eliminate this long-standing rule were once, and in most cases very recently, its most vocal supporters.… For decades, Democrats defended the filibuster as a vital and necessary rule to protect minority party rights. Now that Democrats have the majority, too many only care about one thing – radically transforming America and doing whatever they can to hold on to power.… So why the change of heart? Why are Democrats willing to be so blatantly hypocritical and flip-flop in such dramatic fashion? The answer is simple. Democrats want to do whatever it takes to keep themselves in power. That’s why they’re pushing a bill that would completely upend our current election system. They know if they pull this off, and pass their radical, dangerous bill to federalize elections and gut Voter ID laws across the country, it will effectively secure their hold on power in Washington.… Democrats can posture all they want, but the American people see them for what they really are – self-interested, power-hungry career politicians.” Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE. ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-demands-answers-from-team-usa-on-protecting-american-athletes-at-the-2022-beijing-olympics,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, demanding answers on how Team USA plans to protect athletes from the Chinese Communist Party at the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games. In the letter, Senator Scott asks Team USA how it will prevent athlete’s sensitive information from getting into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, and how it will ensure athletes are allowed to speak and communicate freely. This letter follows Senator Scott’s letter to President Biden asking what resources the federal government will deploy to ensure the safety of American athletes and coaches traveling to Communist China. President Biden has provided no response. Read the full letter HERE or below. January 13, 2022 Ms. Sarah HirshlandCEOU.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee27 S Tejon St.Colorado Springs, CO 80903 Dear Ms. Hirshland: With the 2022 Winter Olympic Games less than a month away, I write to inquire about the safety and security of the United States’ athletes competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.  At the direction of General Secretary Xi, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims and operating a massive surveillance campaign against its own citizens. Communist China has taken away the freedoms of Hong Kongers and imprisoned or silenced anyone who has spoken out against the Communist Party. This suppression of freedom is on full display through the CCP’s silencing of tennis player Peng Shuai after she accused Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual abuse. The CCP even uses multinational, often American, companies to suppress or influence Americans abroad. It is a sad fact that freedom of speech simply does not exist in the eyes of the CCP. That is why I have repeatedly called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games out of Communist China and to a country that respects human rights. It is for these and other reasons that the U.S. Department of State currently recommends that U.S. citizens should reconsider their travel to Communist China due to the “arbitrary enforcement of local laws.”[1] Recent reporting on Communist China’s “zero COVID-19” policy and its announcement that it is limiting spectator attendance only to Chinese citizens should raise concerns. The CCP has a track record of stealing American citizens’ biological and personal information and, because of the Olympic Games’ location in Beijing, we are sending U.S. citizens to a place where the CCP is in charge of so-called COVID-19 testing protocols. Additionally, reports indicate that your organization is aware of Communist China’s draconian technological surveillance by warning athletes in a memo that, “it should be assumed that all data and communications in China can be monitored, compromised or blocked.”[2] Our country is proud of all the American athletes that have earned the honor of representing our nation on the world stage. Their sacrifice and commitment to their sport is truly admirable and it is imperative that we ensure their protection and safety during the games. As athletes frequently do, during the Olympic Games, U.S. athletes may wish to use their platform to highlight Communist China’s human rights violations or suppression of free speech and must be protected in doing so. As a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee with oversight of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, I request prompt responses to the following questions to ensure our athletes traveling to Communist China are safe:   I look forward to your prompt response and working together to protect the safety and security of our distinguished American athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.Sincerely, Rick ScottUnited States Senator ###[1] United States Department of State.

https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-applauds-scotus-rejection-of-biden-s-unconstitutional-vaccine-mandate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the United States Supreme Court rejected President Joe Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate on private businesses. Ahead of the case, Senator Scott joined Senator Mike Braun and 45 of their Senate colleagues in an amicus brief arguing that Congress did not grant the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose such an overreaching mandate and urging the court to block it. Senator Scott also joined Senator Braun last month in leading a bipartisan group of their colleagues to pass a Congressional Review Act measure striking down President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate in the U.S. Senate. Senator Rick Scott said, “Today, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed what the American people have always known and put President Biden back in his place. Joe Biden thinks that he has the authority to tell Americans how to live their life and what health care decisions they must make. He could not be more wrong, and the Court’s decision should serve as a powerful reminder to Biden that he is a president, not a king. I had COVID and I got the vaccine, but I will NEVER support a mandate that kills jobs and takes decisions out of the hands of hardworking American families.” ###"

Durante casi un mes, el Senador Scott ha exigido que el Presidente Biden tome medidas inmediatas para asegurar visitas médicas humanitarias para los presos políticos del régimen. Esta resolución fue copatrocinada por los Senadores Marco Rubio y Mike Braun. Los Congresistas Mario Díaz-Balart y Carlos Giménez y la Congresista María Elvira Salazar introdujeron esta resolución en la Cámara de Representantes. La aprobación unánime del Senado de la resolución del Senador Scott sigue a sus llamadas en Diciembre con miembros de la familia del activista cubano por los derechos civiles José Daniel Ferrer, así como conversaciones con el Director Principal del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional para el Hemisferio Occidental de la Casa Blanca, Juan González, el Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas, António Guterres y el Secretario General de la Organización de los Estados Americanos, Luis Almagro. Poco después de su llamada de Diciembre con el Senador Scott, el Secretario General de la OEA, Almagro, emitió un comunicado exigiendo asistencia médica y la liberación inmediata de los activistas por la libertad injustamente encarcelados y torturados por el régimen cubano. El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Anoche, el Senado de los Estados Unidos envió un fuerte mensaje al ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano de que estamos unidos para apoyar al valiente pueblo de Cuba que lucha incansablemente por la libertad, y no nos detendremos hasta que haya un nuevo día de la libertad en la isla. Estoy orgulloso de que mis colegas del Senado se unieran para aprobar por unanimidad mi resolución de apoyo a los valientes activistas democráticos cubanos y condenar enérgicamente los abusos de los derechos humanos del ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano, pero no podemos detenernos ahora. Cubanos inocentes están muriendo simplemente porque quieren libertad y democracia para sus familias, y otros, como José Daniel Ferrer, están siendo torturados sin piedad. No dejaré de luchar para apoyar a estos valientes activistas por la libertad y a todos los que exigen el fin del brutal régimen comunista cubano”. El Senador Marco Rubio dijo: “Por años, José Daniel Ferrer y los miembros de la Unión Patriótica de Cuba (UNPACU) han sido blancos del régimen de Castro y Díaz-Canel. Ellos han sido sometidos a penurias inimaginables y detenciones arbitrarias simplemente por oponerse a la tiranía y la represión de la dictadura. Aplaudo al senado de EE.UU. por aprobar esta resolución, la cual reafirma nuestro apoyo y solidaridad a uno de los luchadores por la libertad más emblemáticos de Cuba”. El Senador Mike Braun dijo: “Las continuas violaciones de derechos humanos por parte del gobierno comunista de Cuba son reprensibles. Estoy orgulloso de unirme al Senador Rick Scott en esta resolución que reconoce las acciones del activista por la democracia José Daniel Ferrer García y todos los activistas de derechos humanos que se oponen al régimen totalitario cubano”. El Congresista Mario Díaz-Balart dijo: “Estoy orgulloso de codirigir esta resolución crucial con mi colega y amigo, el Senador Rick Scott. Seis meses después de las protestas pacíficas del 11 de julio de 2021, la dictadura cubana continúa reprimiendo y castigando a quienes se atrevieron a exigir valientemente la libertad. Algunos de los encarcelados, incluyendo los que están siendo sometidos a juicios falsos, son niños. La crueldad del régimen ha revelado no solo su malevolencia hacia el pueblo cubano, también ha resaltado el coraje inquebrantable de los muchos valientes activistas prodemocráticos de Cuba que están soportando atroces abusos contra los derechos humanos simplemente por exigir respeto por los derechos fundamentales. Ellos prevalecerán”. El Congresista Carlos Giménez dijo: “Estados Unidos debe denunciar los abusos contra los derechos humanos cometidos por el ilegítimo régimen comunista en Cuba.

Agradezco a los Senadores por su continuo apoyo al pueblo cubano”. La Congresista María Elvira Salazar dijo: “Como defensor de los derechos humanos y la democracia en Cuba, José Daniel Ferrer se enfrentó directamente al régimen durante años, sufriendo torturas y encarcelamiento en múltiples ocasiones. Pero Ferrer nunca ha renunciado a sus principios, y junto a su organización, la UNPACU, ha liderado la lucha por la libertad en Cuba. Ni José Daniel ni ningún cubano debe ser encarcelado ni torturado por protestar pacíficamente por los derechos que Dios les otorgó. ¡Estados Unidos siempre estará con los hombres y mujeres valientes que se levantan contra el régimen!” Vea más AQUÍ o en el video debajo. ###"

For nearly a month, Senator Scott has demanded that President Biden take immediate action to secure humanitarian medical visits for the regime’s political prisoners. This resolution was cosponsored by Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Braun. Congressmen Mario Díaz-Balart, Carlos Giménez and Congresswoman María Elvira Salazar introduced this resolution in the House of Representatives. The Senate’s unanimous passage of Senator Scott’s resolution follows his calls in December with members of Cuban civil rights activist José Daniel Ferrer’s family as well as conversations with White House National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro. Shortly after his December call with Senator Scott, OAS Secretary General Almagro issued a communique demanding medical aid for and the immediate release of the freedom activists being unjustly jailed and tortured by the Cuban regime. Senator Rick Scott said, “Last night, the United States Senate sent a strong message to the illegitimate communist Cuban regime that we stand unified in supporting the brave people of Cuba fighting tirelessly for freedom, and we won’t stop until there is a new day of freedom on the island. I am proud my Senate colleagues joined me to unanimously pass my resolution supporting the brave Cuban democracy activists and strongly condemning the illegitimate communist Cuban regime’s human rights abuses, but we can’t stop now. Innocent Cubans are dying simply because they want freedom and democracy for their families—and others, like José Daniel Ferrer, are being mercilessly tortured. I won’t stop fighting to support these brave freedom activists and all who demand the end of the brutal communist Cuban regime.” Senator Marco Rubio said, “For years, José Daniel Ferrer and the members of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) have been targeted by the Castro and Díaz-Canel regime. They have been subjected to unimaginable hardships and arbitrary arrests simply because they oppose the dictatorship’s tyranny and repression. I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing this resolution, which reaffirms our support and solidarity to one of Cuba’s most emblematic freedom fighters.”   Senator Mike Braun said, “The continued violations of human rights by the communist government of Cuba is reprehensible. I am proud to join Senator Rick Scott on this resolution recognizing the actions of democracy activist José Daniel Ferrer Garcia and all human rights activists that are standing up to the totalitarian Cuban regime.” Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart said, “I am proud to co-lead this crucial resolution with my colleague and friend, Senator Rick Scott. Six months following the July 11, 2021, peaceful protests, the Cuban dictatorship continues to crack down and punish those who dared to bravely demand freedom. Some of those imprisoned, including those being subjected to sham trials, are children. The regime’s cruelty has revealed not only its malevolence toward the Cuban people but has highlighted the unshakeable courage of Cuba’s many brave pro-democracy activists who are enduring egregious human rights abuses simply for demanding respect for fundamental rights. They will prevail.” Congressman Carlos Giménez said, “The United States must call out the human rights abuses committed by the illegitimate communist regime in Cuba. This resolution is an important signal to the political dissidents inside the island that the United States stands on their side. We have a moral responsibility to support the causes of freedom and democracy in our hemisphere. I thank the Senators for their continued support of the Cuban people.” Congresswoman María Elvira Salazar said, ""As a defender of human rights and democracy in Cuba, José Daniel Ferrer stood up to the regime directly for years, suffering torture and imprisonment on multiple occasions. But Ferrer has never given up on his principles, and together with his organization — the UNPACU — he has led the fight for freedom in Cuba. Neither José Daniel nor any Cuban should be imprisoned and tortured for peacefully protesting for their God-given rights. The United States will always stand with the brave men and women who stand up against the regime!” Watch more HERE or in the video below. ###"

Senator Scott’s letter comes as HHS prepares to buy 500 million at-home COVID-19 antigen tests. Read more in the letter HERE or below.  January 7, 2022 The Honorable Xavier BecerraSecretaryHealth and Human Services200 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, DC 20201 Dear Secretary Becerra: As our nation continues its work to fully reopen and recover from COVID-19, the best way forward for defeating this virus is making sure Americans have adequate prevention and treatment options against this terrible illness. I share the frustrations of public health leaders and the American people at the federal government’s lack of proactive leadership in fighting COVID-19, but I support the administration’s goal of making tests available to anyone who needs one. As policymakers, our top priority must be ensuring the health and wellbeing of American families, but we cannot allow this work to be done without maintaining our commitment to responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. It is imperative that the federal government do everything in its power to complete our public health mission in a cost-effective manner that prioritizes support for domestic manufacturing. This is especially important in this instance, as we know that at least two widely available COVID-19 antigen tests are manufactured in Communist China and imported into the United States.[1],[2]  Given this fact, it is not enough to simply purchase any FDA authorized test.  Every U.S. tax dollar spent must be carefully scrutinized, and it is my expectation that the Biden administration ensures that not a single dollar of taxpayer funding is used to purchase COVID-19 tests manufactured in Communist China. The federal government has a responsibility to support American manufacturers, and we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that it was the Chinese Communist Party that lied about this deadly virus, tried to hide it, and has continuously covered up the origins of COVID-19. Furthermore, we know that every dollar spent on COVID-19 tests manufactured in Communist China goes directly to supporting General Secretary Xi and his genocidal regime. I ask that you provide an immediate response to this letter with your commitment that the Biden administration will certify that ZERO American tax dollars will be spent on COVID-19 antigen tests manufactured in Communist China. I also ask that you provide all available details on how this planned purchase of 500 million antigen tests will support U.S. manufacturing and American producers. I look forward to hearing from you on this important issue and working together to ensure that our fight against COVID-19 both supports American jobs and holds Communist China accountable for the horrific virus it has unleashed on the American people. Sincerely, Rick ScottUnited States Senator###[1] https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/10/1062700278/how-the-u-s-got-on-the-slow-track-with-at-home-covid-tests[2] https://www.star-telegram.com/news/coronavirus/article257097642.html"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-scotus-can-protect-jobs-by-ruling-against-biden-s-unconstitutional-mandate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement as the United States Supreme Court hears oral arguments on President Joe Biden's overreaching, job-killing vaccine mandate on private businesses. Senator Scott recently joined Senator Mike Braun and 45 of their Senate colleagues in an amicus brief arguing that Congress did not grant the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose such an overreaching mandate and urging the court to block it. Senator Rick Scott said, “Throughout his campaign and much of his first year in office, Joe Biden, his administration and Democrats in Washington repeatedly promised the American people that they would never impose a vaccine mandate. They lied. It’s another broken promise, just like their broken promise not to raise taxes on hardworking families, and I’ve been fighting against this unconstitutional, job-killing vaccine mandate from the very start. “Biden and the Democrats’ broken promises have been devastating for American families and our economy at just the moment that we need economic momentum most. This is a fact and the reason why a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate voted last month to strike down this vaccine mandate on private businesses and workers. Just look at today's jobs report which came in drastically below estimates. Biden is killing American jobs with his socialist agenda and utter stupidity. Sadly, even after this vote and the terrible economic outcomes we've seen, many Democrats continue to blindly follow Biden’s misguided lead and just this week blocked my bill to prohibit vaccine mandates for domestic air travel and interstate commerce. Today, the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments on Biden’s unlawful mandate. It’s clear that we cannot rely on Democrats in Washington to do the right thing and the Court must rule. For the sake of millions of American workers and countless job creators, I hope the Court rules against Biden’s gross federal overreach and definitively strikes down this unconstitutional move that so clearly demonstrates Biden’s failure to lead.” ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-joe-biden-must-demand-life-saving-action-for-cuba-s-political-prisoners,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott wrote to President Joe Biden demanding that he take immediate action to secure humanitarian medical visits for José Daniel Ferrer, a Cuban freedom and human rights activists who has been unjustly imprisoned by the illegitimate communist Cuban regime for nearly six months, and all other political prisoners. Senator Scott is also urging President Biden to work with the international community to secure the immediate release of all political prisoners. Today’s letter follows Senator Scott’s calls in December with members of José Daniel Ferrer’s family as well as conversations with White House National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro. One day after his call with Senator Scott in December, OAS Secretary General Almagro issued a communique demanding medical aid for and the immediate release of the freedom activists being unjustly jailed and tortured by the Cuban regime. Read the full letter HERE or below.  January 5, 2022 Dear President Biden: I write to you today with extreme urgency to request a meeting on the dire conditions of José Daniel Ferrer, the Cuban freedom and human rights activist, who has been unjustly detained for nearly six months and is being psychologically and physically tortured by the illegitimate communist Cuban regime in an attempt to end his life. Last month, I spoke with Ana Belkis Ferrer, Luis Enrique Ferrer and Martha Ferrer. According to these family members, José Daniel’s health is dire and only getting worse. He’s suffering from severe headaches, mouth bleeding, malnutrition, cough and insomnia – all products of the cruel torture and inhumane treatment from the regime. Each time I have spoken with members of José Daniel’s family, I only hear more terrible and infuriating news about his declining health. It is clear that these actions stem from the regime’s total fear over José Daniel’s leadership in the movement for freedom and democracy spreading across Cuba. It has been six months since the demonstrations for freedom and democracy in Cuba began and your administration has done nothing to support this cause. Our immediate goal is to secure humanitarian medical visits for José Daniel and all political prisoners being held by the Diaz-Canel and Castro regime. These innocent people are dying and we must continue fighting for their release for this unjust imprisonment. In December, I spoke with White House National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres and Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Luis Almagro to discuss the urgent human rights crisis in Cuba. Following these conversations, I was proud to see OAS Secretary General Almagro immediately issue a communique demanding medical aid for and the immediate release of the brave freedom activists being unjustly jailed and tortured by the illegitimate communist Cuban regime. Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, your administration has refused to take similar action. As the leader of the free world, you have the responsibility and duty to stand up for human rights and democracy abroad. Why have you refused to directly engage on this issue when so many of your predecessors, presidents from both parties, have done so? Why have you refused to take up the cause of José Daniel Ferrer, a human rights crisis which both the OAS and UN deemed worthy of their immediate attention? The inaction of both yourself and your administration warrants explanation. You must have a reason for continuing to ignore the millions of Americans who urge immediate action to address these grave injustices. We cannot and will not tolerate continued inaction from your administration. I urge you to immediately follow the lead of the OAS and others and demand the Cuban regime release these innocent people. The Cuban people are in danger and the United States must lead in securing humanitarian intervention to save their lives. Sincerely, Rick ScottUnited States Senator###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-international-olympic-committee-is-complicit-in-communist-china-s-human-rights-abuses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following reports that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is refusing to meet with members from the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region, a group of civil society organizations and trade unions united to end state-sponsored forced labor and other egregious human rights abuses against people in Xinjiang. The coalition is asking the IOC to explain what steps it has taken to ensure official Olympic apparel has not been produced with forced labor after the IOC contracted with Anta Sports Products Ltd., a Chinese sportswear giant that uses cotton from Xinjiang, for the 2022 Olympic Games. Just last year, the IOC released a 42-page report on the state of human rights within the IOC that included a recommendation for the IOC work with trade unions to identify and address human rights risks associated with the Olympic Games. Senator Rick Scott said, “Why in the world does the IOC have someone in charge of human rights if they refuse to meet with human rights groups? Communist China is committing a genocide, putting Uyghurs into concentration camps and forcing them into slavery to pick cotton. The IOC should be able to definitively answer a simple question: Are Anta’s products, which will be used as the official IOC apparel for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, made with forced labor? If so, the IOC is 100% complicit in General Secretary Xi’s genocide. Over and over, when given the opportunity to stand for human rights, the IOC does nothing but cover-up for the Chinese Communist Party. The IOC has lost all credibility, and every freedom-loving country should do what Thomas Bach won’t. Stand up to General Secretary Xi and punish him for his genocide.” ###"

His request comes after Dr. Anthony Fauci suggested that the U.S. should consider vaccine mandates for domestic flights. Senator Scott’s bill is co-sponsored by Senators Cynthia Lummis, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and Roger Marshall, and Representative Dan Crenshaw has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Senate Democrats blocked its passage. Senator Rick Scott said, “Joe Biden said it himself – there is no federal solution. States should be leading the effort to control this pandemic. Providing information about the virus, providing tests, supporting vaccine and therapy developments, and getting the economy back on track should be the only role of the federal government in this pandemic. That’s why I introduced Prevent Unconstitutional Vaccine Mandates for Interstate Commerce Act, and why the U.S. Senate passed a Congressional Review Act measure to invalidate President Biden’s vaccine mandate on a bipartisan basis. “It is Chinese-style communism for anyone in government to suggest that families and businesses should be required to show a vaccine passport before boarding a plane or carrying goods across state lines. We all can see that these unconstitutional vaccine mandates are JOB KILLERS, and it’s shameful that Democrats want to give the government more power, uphold regulations that are causing prices to rise, and force people to choose between keeping their jobs and getting the vaccine at the very time families and businesses are struggling to keep up with the cost of inflation.” See more in his speech HERE or below.###"

El Senador Scott también insta al Presidente Biden a trabajar con la comunidad internacional para asegurar la liberación inmediata de todos los presos políticos. La carta de hoy deriva de las llamadas del Senador Scott en Diciembre con miembros de la familia de José Daniel Ferrer, así como conversaciones con el Director Senior del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca para el Hemisferio Occidental, Juan González, el Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas, António Guterres, y el Secretario General de la Organización de los Estados Americanos, Luis Almagro. Un día después de su llamada con el Senador Scott en diciembre, el Secretario General de la OEA, Almagro, emitió un comunicado exigiendo asistencia médica y la liberación inmediata de los activistas por la libertad que fueron injustamente encarcelados y torturados por el régimen cubano. Lea la carta completa en español AQUÍ o abajo. 5 de enero de 2022 Estimado Presidente Biden: Les escribo hoy con extrema urgencia para solicitar una reunión sobre las pésimas condiciones de José Daniel Ferrer, el activista cubano por la libertad y los derechos humanos, quien ha sido injustamente detenido durante casi seis meses y está siendo torturado psicológica y físicamente por el ilegítimo régimen comunista Cubano en un intento de acabar con su vida. El mes pasado hablé con Ana Belkis Ferrer, Luis Enrique Ferrer y Martha Ferrer. Según estos miembros de la familia, la salud de José Daniel es terrible y solo está empeorando. Sufre de fuertes dolores de cabeza, sangrado en la boca, desnutrición, tos e insomnio, todos productos de la cruel tortura y el trato inhumano del régimen. Cada vez que he hablado con miembros de la familia de José Daniel, solo escucho noticias más terribles y exasperantes sobre su salud en declive. Es evidente que estas acciones se derivan del temor del régimen por el liderazgo de José Daniel en el movimiento por la libertad y la democracia que se extiende por Cuba. Han pasado seis meses desde que comenzaron las manifestaciones por la libertad y la democracia en Cuba y su administración no ha hecho nada para apoyar esta causa. Nuestro objetivo inmediato es asegurar visitas médicas humanitarias para José Daniel y todos los presos políticos detenidos por el régimen de Díaz-Canel y Castro. Estas personas inocentes están muriendo y debemos seguir luchando por su liberación por este injusto encarcelamiento. En diciembre, hablé con el Director Senior del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca para el hemisferio occidental, Juan González, el Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas (ONU), António Guterres, y el Secretario General de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA), Luis Almagro, para discutir la urgente crisis de derechos humanos en Cuba. Después de estas conversaciones, me enorgulleció ver al Secretario General de la OEA, Almagro, emitir de inmediato un comunicado exigiendo asistencia médica y la liberación inmediata de los valientes activistas por la libertad que fueron injustamente encarcelados y torturados por el ilegítimo régimen comunista cubano. Desafortunadamente, pero como era de esperar, su administración se ha negado a tomar medidas similares. Como líder del mundo libre, usted tiene la responsabilidad y el deber de defender los derechos humanos y la democracia en el extranjero. ¿Por qué se ha negado a participar directamente en este tema cuando tantos de sus predecesores, presidentes de ambos partidos, lo han hecho? ¿Por qué se ha negado a asumir la causa de José Daniel Ferrer, una crisis de derechos humanos que tanto la OEA como la ONU consideraron digna de su atención inmediata? La inacción tanto de usted como de su administración merece una explicación. Debe tener una razón para seguir ignorando a los millones de estadounidenses que instan a que se tomen medidas inmediatas para abordar estas graves injusticias. No toleraremos la inacción continua de su administración. Los insto a que sigan inmediatamente el ejemplo de la OEA y otros, y exijan al régimen cubano que libere a estas personas inocentes. El pueblo cubano está en peligro y los Estados Unidos debe liderar para asegurar intervención humanitaria para salvar sus vidas.  Atentamente, Rick ScottSenador de los Estados Unidos###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2022/1/sen-rick-scott-schumer-s-filibuster-flip-flop-is-a-self-serving-power-grab,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following a Dear Colleague letter Senator Chuck Schumer sent to Democrat Senators urging them to vote in favor of ending the filibuster rule. This announcement, which directly contradicts Senator Schumer’s 2017 position while Democrats held the minority, proves that, once again, Senator Schumer’s priority is not protecting democracy, as he claims, but rather increasing Democrat control through a self-serving power grab. Senator Rick Scott said, “Chuck Schumer cares about one thing: preserving power for Chuck Schumer. The proof can be found in his own contradictory self-serving statements. This week, Senator Schumer wrote a letter to his Democrat Caucus members on why they must fundamentally and irreversibly alter the rules of the United States Senate and destroy the rights of the minority to pass their unpopular and disastrous bills to federalize elections. This is an interesting take given Senator Schumer’s previous position on the filibuster. In 2017, then-Minority Leader Schumer urged Leader McConnell to, ’find a way to build a firewall around the legislative filibuster, which is the most important distinction between the Senate and the House.’ He went on to say, ‘Without the 60-vote threshold for legislation, the Senate becomes a majoritarian institution like the House, much more subject to the winds of short-term electoral change. No Senator would like to see that happen, so let's find a way to further protect the 60-vote rule for legislation.’ So the question we must ask ourselves is this: What changed, Chuck? The answer, of course, is he is now in the majority and wants to do as he pleases rather than respect the longstanding rights afforded to the minority party. Schumer is only interested in trashing the filibuster now because he fears he will lose power in the next election. That’s no way to lead. “If the Democrats’ bill was good, it would pass. It’s not. The Democrats’ election takeover bill is an assault on American elections that will fuel fraud, waste billions of taxpayer dollars on funding political campaigns and attack ads and make it nearly impossible to oversee fair elections. Remember that fact the next time Chuck Schumer demands to change the same rules that he spent years fiercely defending when they protected his interests.” ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2021/3/democrats-block-sen-rick-scotts-no-budget-no-pay-proposal,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, as Democrats pushed their massive $1.9 trillion “COVID” spending bill that includes billions for wasteful liberal priorities, Senator Rick Scott fought against Washington’s dysfunction by securing a vote on his No Budget, No Pay proposal, which requires Congress to meet appropriations bill deadlines, or forgo their own salaries until the job is done.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Washington’s dysfunction is at an all-time high, and that was on full display as Democrats delayed voting all day so they could push their massive, wasteful and partisan $2 trillion spending package in the middle of the night. It’s clear Democrats don’t want to work with Republicans to get things done, but I will never stop fighting to make Washington work for the American people. Today, my No Budget, No Pay amendment received a vote on the Senate floor, which says if members of Congress cannot work together to pass a budget, they should not get paid.  “I grew up in a poor family, and I’ve been blessed to live in this country and enjoy the opportunities it provides. I’ve owned a business and I can tell you that in the business world, if you don’t do your job, you don’t get paid. There’s no reason members of Congress shouldn’t be held to the same exact standard as the American people. If they can’t do their most basic job, they shouldn’t get a taxpayer-funded salary. Accountability shouldn’t be controversial. It's ridiculous that my Democrat colleagues would block a simple measure to make sure they do their jobs, but I’ll keep fighting to get this common-sense proposal passed.“ ###"
https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2021/3/sen-rick-scott-ill-never-stop-fighting-against-washingtons-dysfunction,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after Senate Democrats voted to pass their massive and wasteful $1.9 trillion “COVID” spending package, of which less than 10% actually goes to help fight COVID.Senator Rick Scott said, “Washington is completely dysfunctional. I’ve said all along that I want targeted relief for families and businesses suffering from the pandemic. That’s why Republicans just spent the entire night trying to work with Senate Democrats to get something done that will actually help Floridians and Americans across our nation who are still struggling due to COVID-19. But that’s not what the Democrats wanted. This was never about helping the American people. Instead, they’re using trillions of American taxpayer dollars, under the guise of COVID relief, to fund their liberal priorities and pay back their blue state Governor pals. They really should be ashamed of this political theater.“Our nation is $28 trillion in debt. With the passage of this bill, Senate Democrats have increased the debt to $30 trillion, knowing that they and President Biden have no plan to address it or its devastating consequences for American families. At this rate and the direction Democrats are taking us, there is no way our nation will ever be able to pay off this unsustainable debt without significant change. It’s time to get serious about what this means for our nation moving forward. I will never stop fighting to ensure accountability to American taxpayers and get Washington’s insane spending under control.”###"
