	September 23, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Mylke Coffee Company of Island, Kentucky, as Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Mylke Coffee Company of Island, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Shane Case had a vision for his home in Western Kentucky. Seeing that there was no source of freshly-roasted coffee beans anywhere near his region of the state, he decided to fulfill this need and thus in 2017, Mylke opened its doors. Shane’s innovative vision led Mylke to become the first and only craft commercial coffee-roaster located within one hundred miles of his hometown, and their popularity has continued to grow since its founding. Many people ask about the unique nature of the company’s name. The name boils down to a sort of fusion between old and new: old in the way of Old English, a nod to Shane’s Scottish heritage, and new, in the newfound rise and popularity of mylk, which typically refers to milk derived from beans, nuts, or plants rather than from an animal. Mylk has undoubtedly been on the rise in recent years as consumers have increasingly turned to dairy-free options as they search for quality coffee. Shane understood this shift in consumer demand and has responded accordingly with his forward-thinking business.When Shane first opened his business, his intention was to provide the western half of the blue grass state with high-quality coffee beans and other coffee products from a source more local than the distant Louisville or Nashville, Tennessee. However, as his company and customer base grew, he set his sites on entering into new markets beyond those of his native Western Kentucky. Since its founding in 2017, Mylke has consistently managed to break into new markets as far away as Atlanta and Indianapolis. Mylke now provides freshly-roasted coffee to more than twenty independently-owned coffee shops and restaurants. Not only has Shane kept an eye on the potential of emerging markets, he readily adapted to a newfound customer landscape when the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the coffee shop and restaurant industries. Faced with government mandates forcing him to close his doors, Shane pivoted and started offering alternative products to the typical coffee that is brewed onsite, instead providing ready-to-drink options, including the very popular Sweet Mylke Cold Brew or Mylke Kups that customers can use at home in their Keurig Coffee Machine.Throughout his venture into founding his own enterprise, Shane has maintained a keen eye for business and an awareness of the needs of his larger community. As the company has grown, Mylke has partnered with several community organizations and charities that give back to the community. The company has helped facilitate numerous fundraisers for the McLean County High School Moot Court, an organization that exposes students to constitutional law and the work of advocates in the U.S. Supreme Court. Shane understands the importance of investing in the young minds of his community, and that such investments, especially when pared with a focus on civic duty, are to the wide benefit not only for the youth involved but for the community at large. Moreover, Mylke has assisted in fundraising efforts for the Green River Area Down Syndrome Association (GRADSA), and continues to partner with them whenever possible.Shane’s charitable nature extends far beyond than what Mylke is able to do at a local level. He also pays mind to source his coffee beans from suppliers that share in his desire to give back to the community. Mylke has partnered with Legacy Farms Coffee since its founding, a coffee bean supplier working out of Honduras. Using proceeds earned through their coffee crops, Legacy Farms Coffee provides numerous services to the surrounding community, including livestock donations to hungry families, donations of books and supplies to local schools, and providing microloans to growing small businesses. This partnership, as well as those in his native Kentucky, have ensured that every pound of Mylke coffee sold benefits both the local and global community.Mylke has seen unprecedented growth in 2022, with the christening of the Mylke Coffee Shop food truck, an asset that allows the company to grow their customer base and reach newfound customers. Moreover, the company has acquired a new commercial coffee roaster which will increase production capacity by 2,000 percent, to satisfy all those craving the high quality coffee Mylke is known for. Given his track record for entrepreneurial wisdom it is not hard to believe that Mr. Shane Case will continue to grow Mylke at the rate he has already seen. I want to wish congratulations to Mr. Case and the entire team at Mylke Coffee Company. I look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	September 21, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. –  The deadline for East Kentucky flood survivors to apply for federal assistance from FEMA is Wednesday, September 28, but Kentucky's Congressional Delegation says residents need more time. In a letter to the FEMA administration, U.S. Senator Rand Paul joined U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and Congressmen Hal Rogers (KY-5), Andy Barr (KY-6), James Comer (KY-1), Brett Guthrie (KY-2), Thomas Massie (KY-4) and John Yarmuth (KY-3) in requesting a 30-day extension to allow more time for individuals to seek funding to rebuild homes and repair property.  ""As you know, the severity of this flooding event has displaced thousands of Kentuckians, many of whom are still seeking temporary shelter and basic needs as they work to rebuild their lives. The continued rain and challenging topography of this emergency has created a prolonged response phase and more time is needed to ensure that all eligible individuals are able to apply for the assistance they so desperately need,"" the letter stated.FEMA has disbursed more than $67.6 million in Individual Assistance for housing and other needs since the Major Disaster Declaration was issued. While many applications are still being processed and other claims have been appealed, the delegation is concerned for individuals who still do not have resources to request assistance.  ""Further, many Kentuckians have expressed challenges in registering for assistance with FEMA, which has been complicated by damages to critical infrastructure that in some cases prevented Eastern Kentuckians from traveling to in-person registration centers or registering through telephone or internet based services. More time is needed for those who have not yet been able to register, and this extension will help ensure our most vulnerable families are not left behind,"" the delegation expressed in the letter.You can read the full letter HERE. ###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	September 16, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Heartland Chia of Franklin, Kentucky, as Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Heartland Chia of Franklin, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Chris Kummer’s small business was founded on an idea that virtually no one thought possible: successful chia crops planted and harvested in the United States. But as a fifth-generation farmer, Mr. Kummer is no stranger to the challenges posed by mother nature. Thus, with decades of farming experience under his belt and a tireless dedication to his crops, Mr. Kummer has turned this once crazy idea into a thriving business. Founded in 2012, Heartland Chia develops and markets locally grown chia to buyers across the country. Chris’ wife, Jill Kummer, joins her husband at the helm of their business, handling most of the marketing and administrative duties while her husband works with the crop directly in the field. Together, the Kummers are proud to be the only chia seed growers in the U.S.A, a tremendous feat that adds to the biodiversity of Kentucky’s burgeoning agricultural industry. Mr. Kummer will be the first to tell you that his business would not be possible had it not been for the visionary researchers at the University of Kentucky College of Food, Agriculture, and Environment. Since his great-grandfather planted his first crop on their family farm in 1889, the Kummers have grown crops traditional to the Midwestern U.S., such as soy, wheat, and corn. It never occurred to them to plant chia as the plant requires a very long summer in order to grow and produce seed, meaning that most of the world’s chia plants are grown in regions near the equator, such as Central America. Farmers everywhere took it for granted that this plant could not be grown north of the U.S.-Mexico border, but the breeding program over at the University Kentucky sought to change that. Over a period spanning six to eight years, researchers Dr. David Hildebrand and Dr. Tim Phillips, both plant and soil scientists, used decades old breeding methods to create a new strain of chia that would flower earlier in the year, allowing the crop to survive in less temperate climates than those near the equator. Once the scientists created a product they were confident in, they were careful in selecting a steward for their new “Early Flowering” chia seed. Dr. Hildebrand knew Chris Kummer from his days as a student at UK and knew of his farming background therefor he immediately came to mind. In 2011, Dr. Phillips and Dr. Hildebrand gave Mr. Kummer half the world’s seed supply of this new strain of chia. In the first year of planting, the Kummers lost most of their chia crops, as they and the researchers over at University of Kentucky were still learning best practices for growing this new crop. But through the persistence instilled in him from his farmer forebears, Chris and his wife absorbed as much knowledge as they could from this first planting season and put it to the test the next year. By the end of their second planting season, the Kummers had already entered into commercial production. The success of this second season led UK to purchase a patent for the seed, ensuring that it only be used for benefit of American famers, domestic food manufacturers, and domestic consumers. Today, Heartland Chia works with several farmers across four different states that all use the Kummer’s chia for manufacturing processes. By producing this previously ungrowable plant in the U.S., the Kummers have not only added to the biodiversity of the state, they have created a reliable source of what is now widely considered “a superfood.” In a recent publication, the Mayo Clinic listed chia as one of the few foods truly deserving the distinction of “superfood” due its long list of health and nutritional benefits. Given this growth in consumer demand, it was only natural that Mr. Kummer would embark on this experimental journey with the support of his family, University of Kentucky scientists, as well as food manufacturers seeking top-quality chia. Chris has been celebrated for his innovative spirit as several food companies encouraged him to pursue this unlikely feat of growing chia on American soil. Chris has fulfilled a need within the U.S. market as many food suppliers lacked a reliable source for top quality chia seeds. After overcoming the odds, the Kummers continue to grow and produce their own chia and market their products direct to consumers and to food suppliers alike. Not only are they doing a great service to the economy and ecology of Kentucky, they are spreading the good word about an unlikely food that greatly bolsters our body’s health. Through persistence and dedication, the Kummers have made their dream a reality, to the great benefit of Kentucky and beyond. Congratulations to Chris and Jill Kummer along with the entire team at Heartland Chia. I thank you for your innovative outlook and entrepreneurial spirit, and I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky.As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	September 12, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Prioritizing Disaster Relief Act, which would authorize states and localities to use unspent COVID-19 relief funds to help repair and rebuild in federally declared disaster areas. “My home state of Kentucky has experienced two unprecedented disasters in the past year, both of which have left a major impact on our Commonwealth. As we continue to recover, I remain committed to doing all that I can in helping Kentuckians repair and rebuild their homes and businesses,” said Dr. Paul. “In an effort to respond to the ongoing needs and concerns of people on the ground, my bill prioritizes disaster relief efforts by freeing up already appropriated and unspent COVID-19 relief funds to go to those who need it most. Whether it be a flood in eastern Kentucky, tornado in western Kentucky, hurricane in Florida, or fire in California, my bill would unlock millions of leftover COVID-19 funds to be immediately used to help rebuild homes and businesses in disaster areas.”On August 9, while visiting the flooded areas of Eastern Kentucky, Dr. Paul sent letters to both President Joe Biden and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear requesting issue waivers authorizing the Commonwealth of Kentucky and communities affected by major disasters to use unspent COVID-19 relief funds to repair and rebuild homes and businesses damaged within a federally declared disaster area. You can read the Prioritizing Disaster Relief Act HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	September 9, 2022
	 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized The Hitching Post & Old Country Store of Aurora, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize The Hitching Post & Old Country Store of Aurora, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week. For generations, Land Between the Lakes has been one of the premier travel destinations in Western Kentucky. The gorgeous strip of land nestled between lakes Barkley and Kentucky contains breathtaking nature scenes, a plethora of outdoor activities, and numerous local businesses that visitors travel from far and wide to enjoy. A local favorite among those many businesses is The Hitching Post and Old Country Store. Located on a four and a half acre property on the western side of Kentucky Lake, The Hitching Post and Old Country Store first opened their doors to customers in 1941. The structures themselves are over 200 years old, but starting with the Perryman family in 1941, three families of stewards have maintained these stores in all their historic glory. Today, the stores are owned by Su Festen and her husband Tom Trenkle, who ventured south from Illinois to buy the property in 2008. In the years since, Su will tell you that she has grown a southern heart, which is more than evident in the warm hospitality she shows to all who dawn her doors.Though The Hitching Post and the Old Country Store needed some notable maintenance when it came into Tom and Su’s hands, they both decided to maintain the old fashioned nature to the interior of the stores. Su was inspired to perpetuate the historic feeling of the of the property on her first day on the job as one of the very first patrons to come in was a fourth-generation customer with an abundance of love for these two stores. From then on, Su and her husband ensured that the Hitching Post and Old Country Store would be a place where everyone from out of town travelers to generational customers and locals could come to reminisce, remember, and enjoy the simpler things that only a small-town small business could provide.When travelers traverse the beautiful land between lakes Barkley and Kentucky, they are confronted with the abounding beauty of the landscape surrounding them. Given this gorgeous scenery, it would be easy to overlook the charming shops around them. This is not the case for patrons of the Hitching Post and its neighboring Old Country Store. Customers are struck by the old-fashioned interior which harkens back to memories from a simpler time. From the stacks of local fruit preserves and canned country favorites to spiced apple cider, customers are reminded of a time when local produce was the all that was available—before the days of instant gratification fostered by online shopping and rapid delivery.Not only are the two stores brimming over with charm, the two provide a wide variety of products to satisfy every traveler. If you are looking for something sweet to snack on for the trip home, you will find a delightful selection of homemade fudge and crates filled to the brim with saltwater taffy and old-fashioned candy. However, there is one offering that sticks out above all the others. As soon as you enter the Old Country Store, your eyes are immediately drawn to the towering wall of old-fashioned glass bottled sodas that line the back wall of the store. With over 200 different flavors offered, ranging from classic root beers to seasonal soda recipes, it is nearly impossible to choose what unique sodas to try, which is one of the many reasons why customers often return to The Hitching Post and Old Country Store year after year. To brighten up the weekends of their customers, Su and Tom created their weekly All-American Soda Showdown. From May to September, the most indecisive or adventurous customer can come in Sunday afternoons to sample both new and old flavors of soda the Old Country Store has to offer. However, both the Hitching Post and Old Country Stores have more than just sweet treats for the car ride home. Customers can also find a collection of retro toys and trinkets that introduce new generations to the beloved pastimes of their parents and grandparents. Family of some of the previous owners of the stores were avid collectors of unique items and oddities. Customers are encouraged to peruse their treasure trove of antiques and vintage novelties great for giving as gifts or keeping for home décor. One notable item on display is a moonshine still designed by Casey Jones, a famous Prohibition-era moonshiner whose brew was enjoyed by notable mob-boss Al Capone. Even upon exiting the stores visitors will encounter an array of impressive chainsaw carvings of forest creatures and mythical characters hand-crafted by talented local artisans. There is something about family vacations that is uniquely American. The places that families travel for both relaxation and recreation hold a special place in the hearts of those who visit them. All across the country are areas like Land Between the Lakes whose beauty is enjoyed by generations of families who bring their children and grandchildren to relish in the wonder they themselves appreciated as children. Part of this landscape are small businesses like The Hitching Post and Old Country Store that bravely confront the onward march of time. Though their original customers have aged over the 81 years that they have been open, the stores themselves remain ageless, as they look just like they did since that first year of operation in 1941. For decades these stores have been serving local Kentuckians and travelers alike, and it is clear that they will be cherished for generations to come. Congratulations to Tom Trenkle and Su Festen along with the entire team at The Hitching Post & Old Country Store. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	September 9, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act, a bill providing much needed regulatory relief to Kentucky’s agriculture community by reducing red tape and streamlining temporary agriculture worker visa programs. By allowing certain categories of temporary workers currently under the capped H-2B program, such as those in the equine and livestock industries, to apply through the uncapped H-2A program, this legislation would ensure Kentucky farmers are able to hire and retain the workers they need. It would simultaneously reform the H-2A application system, alleviating unnecessary bureaucratic delays from an outdated application system.“My Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act provides a commonsense solution to a frustrating problem by reforming our antiquated H-2A and H-2B temporary worker programs to meet the labor needs of Kentucky’s entire agriculture community. By providing greater flexibility within the programs, increasing reliability from season to season, and eliminating unnecessary regulatory burdens, my bill gets government out of the way so these Kentucky farmers and industries can grow, succeed, and continue supporting the Commonwealth’s economy,” said Dr. Paul.Over the last several years, Sen. Paul has led the charge to enact necessary reforms to our outdated temporary worker programs. His past legislation to streamline the H-2A program, introduced in 2016 and again in 2017, came from listening to Christian County farmers and working directly with them to ensure the bill addressed their issues. In 2018, the Trump Administration responded to the push for reform and announced their intention to streamline the H-2A program. Dr. Paul’s Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act is a continuation of his efforts on behalf of Kentucky’s agriculture community.  You can read the Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act HERE. BACKGROUND:The Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act provides solutions to several critical issues within the H-2A and H-2B temporary worker visa programs that are currently leaving many farmers frustrated and unable to hire and retain the workers they need. While there is no cap on the number of temporary visas issued under the H-2A program, the H-2B program has an annual cap of 66,000 visas. This restrictive cap has caused many farms and businesses in need of livestock, poultry, dairy, and equine workers—as well as those in supporting jobs such as landscapers and groundskeepers—to suffer, as these workers are locked into the H-2B program. Additionally, the H-2A program is in need of streamlining and reform.Senator Paul’s Paperwork Reduction for Farmers and H-2A Modernization Act does the following:###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Local News and Broadcast Media Preservation Act which would give local broadcasters and newspapers much-needed relief from outdated government restrictions that are currently threatening their ability to succeed in an evolving media environment.“With the rise of social media and an ever-changing media landscape, it is imperative that our local newspapers and broadcasters are given the freedom to adapt. My Local News and Broadcast Media Preservation Act gets government out of the way and frees broadcast media from the restrictions currently hindering their ability to better serve their customers,” said Dr. Paul.The Local News and Broadcast Media Preservation Act would exempt print, broadcast, and digital news organizations from federal antitrust laws to allow them to compete with and negotiate with national tech companies. Additionally, the legislation would allow local broadcast companies to merge without government interference to allow those broadcasters to better compete against these tech giants. Lastly, the bill would eliminate the local and national caps on radio and television ownership and would create an environment which would allow maximum flexibility for competition and negotiation.You can read Dr. Paul’s Local News and Broadcast Media Preservation Act HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), formally requested both President Joe Biden and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear issue waivers authorizing the Commonwealth of Kentucky and communities affected by major disasters to use unspent COVID-19 relief funds to repair and rebuild homes and businesses damaged within a federally-declared disaster area.Dr. Paul originally announced his intent to ask for these waivers during a press availability this morning in Perry County, Kentucky, after receiving an update from first responders and local officials on the status of rebuilding efforts following the devastating flooding across eastern Kentucky.During President Biden’s visit on Monday, in remarks at a news briefing on response and recovery efforts held at Marie Roberts-Caney Elementary School in Lost Creek, KY, the President mentioned his openness to ideas on how to assist flood victims. Specifically, he stated, “I promise you, if it’s legal, we’ll do it, and if it’s not legal, we’ll figure out how to change the law.”As Dr. Paul writes in his letters, “Such waivers would not only immediately benefit flood victims in eastern Kentucky, it would also help those western Kentuckians who were impacted by last winter’s tornado outbreak.”You can read Dr. Paul’s letter to President Biden HERE and his letter to Governor Beshear HERE.Dr. Paul is committed to doing all he can to assist local and state officials as they manage recovery and relief efforts. Our team has been on the ground since day one assisting Kentuckians and will continue to work alongside first responders and volunteers in the coming weeks and months. Our office is also helping those who are in need of help with the Disaster Relief process. If you are a Kentuckian in need of assistance with federal agencies, including applying for FEMA assistance and replacing lost or damaged documents such as Social Security cards, VA records, military medals and records, passports, and tax paperwork, you can contact our Bowling Green office and someone on our staff will be happy to help.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Larry’s Mini Mart of Whitley City, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Larry’s Mini Mart of Whitley City, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.When Larry Sumner founded Larry’s Somerset Oil in 1973, he had no idea it would grow into the family business that it is today. Larry got his start in business when he opened his service station in Somerset, KY. Three years later, he relocated to Whitley City. It was there in Whitley City that Larry’s children watched their father run a business that bolstered their home-town community. As the Sumner children grew older, they learned first-hand what it meant to devote one’s energy to their customers, so it was only natural that they inherited their father’s entrepreneurial nature. Thus, Larry Sumner’s business continues operating today in the exact location he moved to in 1976, with the Sumner children at the helm of operations.Today Larry’s Mini Mart, as it is now called, is Whitley City’s one stop shop for full-service gas, kerosene, and diesel. Unlike the days of old, most people nowadays pump their own gas and rarely interact with the folks working at their local gas stations. That is not the case for Larry’s Mini Mart, as they carry on the tradition of pumping gas for their customers, always doing it with a smile. Larry’s is also the local stop where folks can drop in to pick up cold drinks, snacks, ice, and anything else they might need whether in a hurry or just for an afternoon excursion. Larry’s Mini Mart even goes beyond what a typical service station offers by renting out their extra storage space to their loyal customers. When the late Larry Sumner first opened his business back in the 1970’s, he wanted to create a place that was more than the average filling station. He understood that offering quality service and a wide variety of conveniences would make his store a success, but his dream went beyond those of profits. Larry Sumner’s goal was to create a place that would foster community within the town of Whitley City. When Larry Sumner’s son Mark and daughter Marlo took over the business in 1998 following their father’s death, they stayed true to his mission. Today, as it has always been, Larry’s Mini Mart is a place where locals can come to catch up on the latest news in the county, whether that news travels through the local paper or word-of-mouth. As is often the case with small towns, sometimes it takes a trip down to Larry’s just to hear about the goings-on about town, and the late Larry Sumner would not have it any other way. Larry’s has often been recognized for the quality service they provide to their community. Most recently in 2020, Larry’s Mini Mart received McCreary County Chamber of Commerce Business of the Month. They have also won McCreary County Business of the Year numerous times due to the charitable spirit of the owners and staff. Throughout their years of operation Larry’s Mini Mart has supported local school systems and all their various sporting activities. Larry’s has become a well-known for hosting car wash fundraisers for various causes within their community. Larry’s Mini Mart has also contributed to the Banquet of Blessings, a McCreary County tradition that provides a free Christmas meal to anyone in need. Larry’s has also contributed to the local chapter of Relay for Life, a cancer awareness nonprofit. Moreover, the public library, the local chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the McCreary County Chamber of Commerce, right down to the McCreary County Little League baseball team, have all seen support from the fine folks at Larry’s Mini Mart.Larry’s Mini Mart is known not only for their quality service and charitable spirit, but they also maintain their reputation for being a fantastic place to work. Currently, Mark Sumner and his wife Stephanie operate Larry’s with the help of their daughter Taylor and their son Tyler. This family affair fosters a friendly environment, to which Charlie Strunk and Crawford Tucker can attest; the two have been a part of the Larry’s Mini Mart team for over forty years. That type of longevity clearly shows that Larry’s is not your average service station. Larry’s Mini Mart is a community institution that goes above and beyond to support their friends and neighbors, whether it be during or outside of their regular business hours. Congratulations to the Sumner family and entire team at Larry’s Mini Mart. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	August 5, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) spoke on the Senate floor and advocated for Kentucky farmers and consumers with the Ethanol Access for a Sustainable Economy Act of 2022 or the EASE Act which would allow the sale of E-15 fuel year-round, and provide relief for Americans on the road, not only this year but every year.“Gas prices are sixty-four percent higher in my home state of Kentucky than they were in January of 2021. This means Kentuckians are paying $1.43 more for a gallon of gas than they were at the beginning of last year. For average Americans, already struggling to put food on the table, sky high gas prices are a daily punishment,” said Dr. Paul. “Passing the EASE Act would benefit consumers, farmers, and the environment by increasing access to a clean and affordable fuel derived from one of this nation’s most abundant agricultural outputs: corn. I hope that we can finally enact this change into law to address the current challenge posed by historically high gas prices and to ensure the availability of affordable and environmentally friendly fuel in the future.”Democrats objected to Dr. Paul’s legislation because they chose to put their radical Green New Deal agenda ahead of working Americans and families. Background:E-15 is a gasoline blend containing up to 15 percent ethanol, a renewable fuel typically made from corn. A 2008 study published in Atmospheric Environment found that ethanol-based fuels like E-15 emit up to 16 percent less carbon dioxide than traditional gasoline. A more recent study published by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory found that these fuels emit up to 23 percent less carbon dioxide and provide a cheaper alternative to typical gasoline, and yet the Clean Air Act currently prohibits the sale of E-15 between June and September every year.Under current law, gas with up to 10 percent ethanol, commonly known as E-10, can be sold in the summer. But inexplicably the law treats E-15 differently, even though the higher ethanol blend is better for the environment.American drivers ought to be able to access E-15 year-round. Prohibiting its sale in the summer months artificially restricts supply, especially when Americans are paying historically high prices for a gallon of gas.Republican and Democrat presidents have taken action to lift this arbitrary restriction. Both Presidents Trump and Biden approved the removal of barriers to the sale of E-15 during the summer months, but Congress has it in its power to permanently allow the sale of E-15.Dr. Paul first introduced legislation on this issue in 2015 and has since advocated for this long overdue change.You can read the EASE Act HERE and watch Dr. Paul’s floor remarks HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-43WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Bubby’s BBQ of Corbin, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Bubby’s BBQ of Corbin, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.For as long as he can remember, Marcus “Bubby” Shepherd loved to cook. He appreciated how food could bring people together and create a sense of comfort for everyone at the table. After working as a truck driver for fifteen years, Marcus decided to switch career paths and open a restaurant that showcased his specialty: cooking and smoking meat. Hence, Bubby’s BBQ of Corbin, Kentucky was born and very quickly became a Shepherd family affair, spearheaded by Marcus.From carefully-crafted pulled pork barbecue to exceptionally crisp fried catfish, Bubby’s BBQ has a vast selection of menu items that are undeniably delectable. Whether customers choose to order from the menu or opt for the all-you-can-eat buffet, it is certain that the food will always be excellent. Marcus ensures that all of the food served abides by his recipes, so that each meal eaten at Bubby’s tastes as if Marcus had whipped it up himself. The barbeque is smoked for 10-12 hours each night using hickory wood, and everything is homemade, right down to the BBQ sauce. This attention to detail is what has made Bubby’s BBQ widely recognized for its consistency and high-quality food. A testament to their success, Bubby’s BBQ has won the People’s Choice Award for Best Restaurant several years in a row in various categories.The delicious food attracts thousands of customers from all over Kentucky, and the welcoming ambience and high-quality service at Bubby’s makes people never want to leave. The waitstaff goes out of their way to guarantee the customers are always satisfied and their drinks are never empty. Everyone that visits Bubby’s BBQ feels as if they are part of the restaurant family, and a missing regular never goes unnoticed by the staff. Some will go to the restaurant as many as 4-5 times a week, and never get tired of the food. Bubby’s care is not limited to its customers, it extends to its local community. The restaurant hosts many fundraising events to raise money for the youth sports teams in the Corbin area. Bubby’s BBQ also uses its resources to support those who do not have stable access to food through its involvement in the Corbin Community Backpack Program, an initiative that provides local school children, who have little or no food available at their home, backpacks full of food to last them over the weekends. Additionally, Bubby’s BBQ assists with Operation James Scott, a veteran-led community activity that purchases Christmas presents for local children. Bubby’s BBQ has cultivated a famed reputation for its authenticity. There is a strong sense of comfort every guest can feel when they dine at Bubby’s. With food that resembles family cooking, phenomenal service that prioritizes customer satisfaction, and interior design that reflects a southern country style, Bubby’s makes you feel at home. This quality of care and intimacy with customers is distinct to small businesses. Everyone who goes to Bubby’s BBQ knows there is just no place like it, nor could it ever be replicated. Marcus’s ability to transform his passion into a successful business is an embodiment of the entrepreneurial spirit that uplifts this country. I want to thank Marcus Shepherd and the Shepherd Family for all of the work they have done to support their community of Corbin and the American people. I look forward to watching your continued growth and success in Kentucky.As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

While not all of these studies are obvious wastes of taxpayer dollars, many still raise major concerns about the importance of your agency’s mission,” the Senators wrote.“These concerns are compounded when NSF funds research projects with a particular political bent,” the Senators continued. “While NSF enjoys independent status in order to protect the agency’s scientific mission, grants such as these call into question the NSF’s impartiality and whether the agency considers it is appropriate to fund projects leveraged for political advocacy.”The Senators concluded, “We live in a time where most Americans are trying to make ends meet to put food on the table and gas in the cars, meanwhile our government agencies seem to be spending money frivolously on a wish list of special interest research projects. Given these concerns, we are beginning an oversight investigation into NSF’s grant-making processes.” You can read the full letter HERE. ###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	July 28, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343Washington, D.C.— Kentucky's congressional delegation urged President Joe Biden to issue a federal emergency disaster declaration last night for the Commonwealth of Kentucky after deadly flash flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky beginning July 26, 2022. In a joint letter to the President, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) joined U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Congressmen Brett Guthrie, Hal Rogers, Andy Barr, James Comer, Thomas Massie and John Yarmuth in supporting Governor Andy Beshear's request for an expedited Major Disaster Declaration to activate federal resources for relief efforts in Breathitt, Clay, Floyd, Johnson, Knott, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, Owsley, Perry, Pike and Wolfe counties.""Excessive rainfall caused deadly flash flooding across Eastern Kentucky leading to significant rescue efforts as a result of blocked roads and destroyed bridges from high water, mud slides, and downed trees. Several Kentuckians are confirmed dead, with many still unaccounted for. Hundreds of homes and many businesses were severely damaged or totally lost in the flood,"" the letter stated. ""Governor Beshear rightly declared a State of Emergency in quick response to the disaster, and mobilized the Kentucky National Guard, but this remains an ongoing, dynamic, and dangerous situation.""The Kentucky National Guard and countless first responders across southern and eastern Kentucky heroically conducted water rescue missions and helicopter evacuations, safely moving individuals out of harm's way. The immediate aftermath of the catastrophic flooding resulted in power outages for tens of thousands of households, and severe damage to critical infrastructure. Numerous roads and bridges were destroyed or blocked by debris, delaying rescue efforts and supply deliveries. While local and state efforts are underway, federal assistance will be necessary for long-term recovery efforts. ""We appreciate your timely consideration of this request, which will greatly assist Kentucky communities in a desperate time of need.

	July 27, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) sent a letter to Acting Director of the National Institutes of Health, Lawrence A. Tabak regarding the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s processing of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to the origins of COVID-19. The letter is in response to recent revelations that the NIH is withholding information from the public for political reasons.“Unfortunately, NIH has repeatedly disregarded its responsibilities under FOIA and the American people's right to agency records. For almost two years, public interest groups and media organizations have been forced to engage in protracted litigation to obtain documents related to NIH's involvement in COVID-19. The records NIH has produced have been heavily redacted,” Dr. Paul wrote. “Of particular concern is NIH' s recent admission in Court that the agency is withholding portions of emails between employees because they ‘could be used out of context and serve to amplify the already prevalent misinformation regarding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.’ This suggests NIH is censoring the information it releases to the public about the origins of the pandemic.”Dr. Paul requested the following information in response to his letter:BACKGROUND:FOIA provides the public a legal right to agency records unless the material falls within a narrow set of identified exceptions. Congress enacted FOIA to ensure the Executive Branch is transparent and accountable to the American people. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently reaffirmed the importance of FOIA, notifying agencies that the Justice Department would not defend nondisclosure decisions of agencies that failed to apply a presumption of openness. The Attorney General recognized, ""[FOIA] has been a vital tool for advancing the principles of open government and democratic accountability that are at the heart of who we are as public servants.""You can read Dr. Paul’s full letter to Acting Director Tabak HERE. ###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

The dangers are so acute that from 2014-2017, the National Institutes of Health suspended funding for all gain-of-function projects…the emergence of COVID serves as a reminder that dangerous research conducted in a secretive and totalitarian country is simply too risky to fund.“I, therefore, ask my colleagues to restore this crucial provision that would prohibit the funding of gain-of-function research in China.”You can watch Dr. Paul’s full floor remarks HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized House Doctors Handyman of Hardin County, in Elizabethtown, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:
	 Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize House Doctors Handyman of Hardin County, in Elizabethtown, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	For most people, retirement is the clear choice following an illustrious career in their chosen field. Franko Antolovich, on the other hand, is not like most people. After serving in the United States Army for thirty-five years, including over twenty years in the special forces, Franko took the road less traveled. When many would have chosen retirement, Franko embarked on a new endeavor, swapping his combat boots for work boots by becoming the franchise owner of House Doctors Handyman of Hardin County, Kentucky.
	 
	House Doctors provides top quality home repairs and maintenance to residents of Central Kentucky and the surrounding areas. Franko ensures that his customers receive exemplary service by employing handymen who are the best at what they do, with most members of his team having years of experience in the realm of home repair. Franko understands that it takes a great amount of trust to employ someone to work on your own home. As the name House Doctors would imply, each employee of this successful franchise provides an unrivaled level of care, because they understand that a house is more than just a roof over one’s head. The repair men and women operating at House Doctors treat their customers’ homes with as much respect as they would treat their own: that is the level of quality that Franko and his team are committed to providing to Central Kentucky. 
	 
	House Doctors’ services range from one-time maintenance repairs for home appliances, to small projects like drywall installation and repair, all the way up to full home remodels. Whatever the need may be, residents of Central Kentucky can count on House Doctors to provide the services they need for quick and professional home repair. In addition to the wide array of services they perform, House Doctors offers a one-year labor guarantee for each job they perform, proving their steadfast commitment to quality craftsmanship. This commitment extends beyond House Doctors’ policy of a one-year labor guarantee, as Franko ensures that all the handymen and women he employs are professional, insured, bonded, and trained. Residents of Central Kentucky can achieve full peace of mind knowing that the job they have entrusted to House Doctors will be completed only after the highest standards of quality have been met. 
	 
	I want to thank Frank Antolovich for the service he has paid to this country and commend him for his transition from active duty to being an active member in his central Kentucky community. After putting his mind and body to work for our country, he saw a franchise opportunity that allowed him to work towards the betterment and protection of central Kentucky homes. It is the level of dedication and service that has been a hallmark throughout Franko’s life that makes his franchise thrive. Congratulations to Franko Antolovich and to the entire team at House Doctors Handyman of Central Kentucky. I look forward to watching your continued growth and success in Kentucky.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/paul-booker-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-amend-right-try-act-assist-terminally-ill-patients,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
	July 20, 2022
	 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced legislation to clarify that the Right to Try Act should allow terminally ill patients to have access to Schedule I drugs for which a Phase 1 clinical trial has been completed. Specifically, the Right to Try Clarification Act would remove any obstacle presented by the Controlled Substances Act with respect to Schedule I substances when they are used by doctors and patients in accordance with the federal Right to Try law. Companion legislation will be introduced in the House by Representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Nancy Mace (R-SC).The federal Right to Try law permits patients who have been diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions, and who have exhausted all approved treatment options, access to certain treatments that have not yet received final FDA approval. In general, a drug is eligible for Right to Try use after a Phase 1 clinical trial has been completed for that drug but prior to the drug being approved or licensed by the FDA for any use. In other words, in limited conditions involving life threatening illness and for drugs that have been proven to be safe, the federal Right to Try law removes the FDA out of doctor-patient decisions and reverts regulation back to the states. Under the terms of the federal Right to Try law, states remain free to permit or prohibit Right to Try use under their own laws.In recent years, two substances currently classified as Schedule I drugs—MDMA and psilocybin—have shown exceptional promise in treating a variety of mental health conditions, including suicidal depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, these drugs have been shown to be safe and effective—so effective that FDA has designated them “breakthrough therapies,” meaning that they demonstrate substantial improvement over any currently available therapies. “As a physician, I know how important Right to Try is for patients facing a life-threatening condition,” said Dr. Paul. “Unfortunately, the federal bureaucracy continues to block patients seeking to use Schedule I drugs under Right to Try. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan legislation with Sen. Booker that will get government out of the way and give doctors more resources to help patients.”“Recent studies suggest that MDMA and psilocybin could represent an enormous advancement in mental health and psychopharmacology,” said Senator Booker. “Unfortunately, many eligible patients who urgently need care do not currently have access to these promising therapies. This legislation will put the patient first and help ensure access to life-changing and life-saving drugs.”“Oregon has a long legacy of ensuring that end-of-life patients have access to the full spectrum of treatment options to alleviate their condition and improve their quality of life. Patients and doctors deserve to discuss treatments—including psilocybin—that researchers find provide immediate and sustained relief from pain, anxiety, and depression for people battling terminal illness,” Rep. Blumenauer said. “Federal restrictions have obstructed access to end-of-life care for too long, this legislation will change that and ensure that all patients have the Right to Try. I appreciate Senator Booker’s leadership, it is timely and important.”“Advances in science and technology are often made when we think outside the box and try new things,” said Rep. Mace. “This legislation gives patients the power to choose alternative options like psilocybin or MDMA when facing a life-threatening condition. We know these chemicals have the potential to save lives, and today is an important step forward in medical progress. I want to thank Senators Booker and Paul for their bipartisan work to bring these exciting new options into the mainstream medical world.”“I am glad to see federal legislators clarifying that I and others dealing with the reality of advanced cancer can access promising drugs in the investigational process, even if they are on Schedule I,” said Erinn Baldeschwiler, a patient who has been seeking access to psilocybin therapy for relief of debilitating anxiety and depression as she manages advanced cancer. “I am eager to try psilocybin therapy to help gain comfort and peace with what is unfolding for me, and be able to be more present for my children even in this most difficult time.”“The Washington State Psychological Association applauds the introduction of a clarifying amendment to the federal Right to Try law, making it abundantly clear that RTT applies to investigational drugs on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. WSPA hopes that terminally ill patients suffering anxiety and depression will soon be able to receive psilocybin therapy, improving the last bit of their lives,"" said the Washington State Psychological Association.“This bill will open access to MDMA- and psilocybin-assisted therapy for Veterans who are at serious risk of suicide and have exhausted all other options,” said Martin R. Steele, a retired Lieutenant General in the United States Marine Corps., Chief Executive Officer of Reason for Hope, and head of the recently formed Veteran Mental Health Leadership Coalition. “We thank Senators Paul and Booker for considering the realities on the ground for the Veteran community, where a growing number are seeking treatment outside the country or in the underground market, which increases the risk of harm for Veterans in need of healing.”The full text of the support letter from the Veteran coalition can be viewed here.The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.  ###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	May 6, 2022
	 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and Homemade Products of Morgantown, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:
	 
	Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and Homemade Products of Morgantown, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	As any small business owner knows, the path of entrepreneurship is rarely straight and narrow. As is the case with this small business owner, Tabby Daugherty, who opened P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and Homemade Products, also known as P31 Storefront Insiders, in 2018. P31’s story began a couple years prior to her official opening date.  In 2016 Tabby was a part time employee at Life-Skills, working with adults with disabilities while she raised her several children. As a mother of a large family, she strived to keep the meaning of Proverbs 31 at the core of her work and home life. What served as a motto of sorts became the inspiration for her business and its name, hence the P31.
	 
	Proverbs 31:17-18 reads “She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.” Taking from that verse, Tabby sought to make herself and her household more self-sustaining, and started to make her own laundry soap. Word gathered around town and soon there was widespread interest in Tabby’s homemade soap. This Do-It-Yourself project and the demand it garnered, soon led to her founding her own business.
	 
	A business selling soap grew into a venture that offered over 100 products. After a friend suggested she start creating products using essential oils, Tabby expanded her variety of products and began to sell moisturizers, serums, bracelets, and diffusers. She also creates custom products used to treat maladies. Around town people know Tabby as a giver, evident in her role as a mother of a big family and in her previous job at Life-Skills looking after those with disabilities. For that reason, many put their faith in her and her products, often coming to her with a special request for a specific blend. Tabby gladly takes all requests even though it requires extra time and care on her part to learn how create these specially-requested items. 
	 
	Customers keep coming back to P31 Storefront Insiders because they appreciate the diligent care Tabby takes in creating her line of items. The citizens of Morgantown and beyond seek her out because they know that all her products are made with real ingredients, are made in store, and are created without fragrances or synthetic products. Moreover, Tabby and her business operations abide by a strict set of codes, the most fundamental of which is customer appreciation. Patrons walk in to feel welcomed and lifted up. Tabby keeps the essence of her favorite proverb at the core of her life and her shop, evident for all to see.
	 
	Tabby is a strong force within the Morgantown community. She stays involved with the local chapter of the Boys and Girls Club, as well as the local bass fishing team. She also makes sure her business is there to fill any sort of community need that may arise, for example, in previous clothes drives she has offered P31 Storefront Insiders as a drop off location. And when her children’s sports team needed to raise money for new equipment, she took a creative approach towards lending a hand; providing the ingredients of her famous soap to the team’s players, requiring them to make it and sell it on their own. In this way she provided the team the tools to achieve their fundraising goals but allowed the children to take responsibility for their efforts. Given its popularity, she has also opened that opportunity to other Butler County schools.
	 
	A giving and charitable spirit permeates throughout Tabby’s life and her business. She currently offers a “Maggie Collection” product line of bracelets. Maggie is a local young girl who was diagnosed with leukemia, and P31 donates $2.00 from every bracelet sold towards Maggie’s treatment. Tabby also hosts an in-store bible study every Wednesday for local teenage girls, allowing them the opportunity to speak about devotion over pizza and soda. Without a doubt Tabby is a force for good and she capitalizes on her position as a local entrepreneur to help improve the lives of those around her. She truly captures the benevolent essence that so often goes hand in hand with the entrepreneurial spirit. I want to congratulate the whole team at P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and Homemade Products and wish Tabby the best of luck. I look forward to watching her continued growth and success in Kentucky.

	May 5, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA) which includes Senator Rand Paul’s (R-KY) language that directs the Secretary of the Army to develop specific criteria for the annual evaluation and ranking of maintenance dredging requirements for small, remote, and two subsistence harbors.“Maintaining America's robust inland waterway system means properly caring for harbors of all sizes, as the system's interconnectedness requires dredging smaller connecting harbors to ensure goods are efficiently transported,” said Dr. Paul. “The current system prioritizes dredging for larger harbors, hindering economic growth and threatening the future of smaller harbors in Kentucky. These smaller ports are the backbone of local commerce in communities along our waterways, and I am thrilled my language has now been included in the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 that prioritizes smaller harbors and channels which will increase commerce across the Commonwealth.”This is a continuation of Dr. Paul’s commitment to ensuring our waterways remain a vital part of our country’s infrastructure and a source of economic growth for all Kentucky communities. Along with the inclusion of Dr. Paul’s language in the WRDA, Dr. Paul has also previously introduced his Harbor Equity Act which modifies the existing criteria used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge smaller harbors.You can read the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	May 4, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Senate passed a motion to instruct conferees on H.R.4521, to retain the language originally introduced by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) as an amendment to S.1260 and passed by the Senate in May 2021 that prohibits funds made available to any federal agency from being used for gain of function research conducted in China.“Even as Dr. Fauci denies it, there is strong evidence COVID-19 started in a lab in Wuhan,"" said Dr. Paul. ""But, if we have learned anything from this pandemic, it’s that risky virus-enhancing research - like the type conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also funded by the U.S. government - is an unnecessary form of science that could lead to the death of millions of people.

	  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized A Place To Belong Home Care of Radcliff, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record: 
	Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, A Place To Belong Home Care of Radcliff, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 It is not every week that I have the privilege of honoring a veteran-owned small business, but when I do, it is with profound gratitude and respect not only for this Kentucky entrepreneur, but for our men and women in uniform. A Place to Belong Home Care was founded by Sergeant First Class Lolita R. Martin who, before opening her business, spent 24 years in uniform, three and half of which spent on the battlefield in support of Iraq Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Even while serving her country overseas, Ms. Martin knew that entrepreneurship was her next calling. With that in mind, Ms. Martin remained steadfast in her desire to continue serving others in her career, which led her to the idea of senior care. Thus, after retiring from a lengthy career in our nation’s uniform, Lolita Martin founded A Place to Belong Home Care in 2019.
	 
	The mission behind A Place To Belong Home Care is to improve the quality of life for aging adults and to support their families in caring for loved ones. The business provides a wide variety of services, not limited to elderly care. Whether the client is an adult or child with special needs, recovering from surgery or illness, or managing a disease or lifelong condition, A Place To Belong Home Care is there to help. And with services offered in Hardin, Bullitt, Meade, and Grayson County, as well as in other parts of Kentucky, Ms. Martin ensures that her business reaches the broad scope of needs for anyone requiring daily care.
	 
	Upon her retirement from the United States Armed Forces, Ms. Martin was primed for her current career. During her third deployment to Iraq, Ms. Martin began pursuing her Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management. A requirement for the degree was a capstone project on Senior Care, thus the seed for A Place To Belong Home Care was planted. The idea grew and developed throughout her time protecting our nation, hence there is no doubt as to why her business has seen such success and growth in Kentucky. In 2019 Ms. Martin was proud to receive the Best in Class Home Health Certification from the 21st Century Health Care Consultants group. After caring for others throughout her life, Ms. Martin clearly is the right fit for the job.
	 
	This entrepreneur also understands the importance of maintaining an active presence in her local community. Ms. Martin preserves her dedication to national service by being an active member of the National Association of Black Veterans, The Kentucky Colonel, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars group. Though this patriot has moved on from her active duty career, she stays true to her roots as she ventures into an equally honorable career of providing care for those who are not able to take full care of themselves. Congratulations to Lolita Martin and the entire team at A Place To Belong Home Care. I thank you for your brave service to this country and for your enduring desire to serve others. I wish the whole team the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and Republican members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) requested information from U.S. Small Business Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman regarding illegally obtained Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans received by Planned Parenthood affiliates across the U.S.“On May 19, 2020, SBA notified a number of Planned Parenthood affiliates that they had wrongfully applied for 38 PPP loans totaling more than $80 million dollars. SBA determined that these local affiliates of Planned Parenthood Federation of America were ineligible for PPP loans under the applicable affiliation rules and size standards, and that the loans they received should be returned,” the Senators wrote. “Despite this determination, the SBA approved 17 new PPP loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates totaling nearly $40 million in 2021. Moreover, under your leadership, the SBA has forgiven at least 34 Planned Parenthood PPP loans to date. This raises serious questions about the SBA' s management of the PPP program which was intended to provide relief to small businesses. In order to better assist Congress in performing its oversight function, please provide the information requested in this letter no later than 5:00PM on May 10, 2022.”Dr. Rand Paul has continually requested information on this matter and has repeatedly called for Planned Parenthood to return the more than $80 million it stole from American taxpayers. Dr. Paul was joined by Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) in sending the letter.BACKGROUND:Under 5 U.S.C. § 2954, ""[a]n Executive agency, on request of the Committee on [Oversight and Reform] of the House of Representatives, or of any seven members thereof, or on request of the Committee on [Homeland Security and] Governmental Affairs of the Senate, or any five members thereof, shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.""The U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is charged with studying:the efficiency and economy of operations of all branches of the Government including the possible existence of fraud, misfeasance, malfeasance, collusion, mismanagement, incompetence, corruption or unethical practices, waste, extravagance, conflicts of interest, and the improper expenditure of Government funds in transactions, contracts, and activities of the Government or of Government officials and employees and any and all such improper practices between Government personnel and corporations, individuals, companies, or persons affiliated therewith, doing business with the Government, and the compliance or noncompliance of such corporations, companies, or individuals or other entities with the rules, regulations, and laws governing the various governmental agencies and the Governments relationship with the public.You can read the letter HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	April 11, 2022
	 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) announced that he saved more than $480,000 from his official fiscal year 2021 operating budget, bringing the total amount Dr. Paul has returned to the taxpayers to over $5.7 million since taking office in January 2011.
	 
	“It’s easy to picture Washington’s out-of-control spending as a massive, untamable beast,” said Dr. Paul. “I’m determined to show change is possible by starting in the area under my control, while working everywhere else I can to stop ‘business as usual.’ When I ran for office, I promised Kentuckians I would stand for smaller, more efficient government, balanced budgets, and spending restraint. I’m proud my staff and I have kept that pledge while operating one of the most active federal offices.”
	 
	Dr. Paul has achieved the savings by asking his staff to do more with less.
	 
	While most congressional offices remained closed under the guise of the COVID pandemic, Dr. Paul’s office stayed open. This past year, Dr. Paul and his staff have assisted thousands of Kentuckians with casework all across the Commonwealth of Kentucky, fielding over 18,000 calls and over 14,000 letters, emails, and faxes to Kentuckians in need of assistance. They were among the first on the ground and have continued to assist local and state officials in the aftermath of the December tornadoes across Kentucky. They have also traveled and met with Kentuckians in all 120 counties over this past year.
	 
	In Washington, D.C., Dr. Paul and his staff continue working for all Kentuckians and taxpayers by fighting for commonsense, fiscally conservative solutions to bureaucratic problems and waste. Dr. Paul has led the way for reform by introducing a five-year balanced budget, and shining a spotlight on reckless federal spending. Dr. Paul and his staff continue to defend the liberties and rights of every American, and are committed to doing so while also preserving your tax dollars.

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Total Equine Services of Falmouth, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:The breeding, training, and of course racing of horses is an integral component in the history and culture of our beautiful state. Many refer to Lexington, Kentucky as the Horse Capital of the World, with their 1,200 acre Kentucky Horse Park in addition to the hundreds of horse farms operating in the area.  Moreover, as of 2019, the Kentucky equine industry had an economic impact of $3.4 billion and supplied 80,000 direct and indirect jobs. Needless to say it’s a leading industry in our state. For that reason I am delighted to honor a business so involved in that iconic industry, Total Equine Services, founded by Steve Thomas and his wife Patti Thomas.When it comes to raising Quarter horses, Steve Thomas is a seasoned veteran. He and his wife founded Total Equine Services fifteen years ago, but he has over twenty years’ experience caring for this breed under his belt. Together they opened the business which initially offered only an arena where one could come and ride horses. They quickly expanded to provide a variety of services ranging from boarding, breeding, and training horses. In addition to that same arena, the Thomas’ constructed a Foaling Barn and sixteen enclosed stalls where owners can board their horses. The Thomas’ also offer nutrition and feed balancing services as well as a full tack shop where one can satisfy all their riding equipment needs. When it comes to the care and maintenance of horses, Total Equine Services offers a full package. With parents like Steve and Patti, it is no wonder that their son Jason Thomas grew up with a love for horses. He and his wife Nikki Thomas have joined the team at Total Equine Services. Nikki was a natural addition to the team since, just like her in-laws, she has an extensive background in raising Quarter horses. Moreover Nikki is seasoned in training horses in the art of barrel racing and pole bending. Pole bending is a timed event where a rider must direct their horse in a speedy serpentine path around six poles arranged in a line. Meanwhile barrel racing is an event where the horse and rider must attempt to run a cloverleaf pattern around preset barrels in the fastest time possible. Needless to say training of this sort requires meticulous repetition and a keen eye for detail, which Nikki gladly brings to the arena. And with all the exercise and activity that their stock see, the Thomas’ make sure to keep their horses properly shod, with Jason being a certified farrier, a blacksmith that creates horseshoes, who keeps their fleet equipped with the proper horseshoes they need.The Thomas’ have developed a reputation for covering every need a horse owner or rider might have, but they are also highly regarded for their breeding services. Their current stud horse, Redneck Jettin Down, has not only won several local shows, he has placed at national competitions held through the American Quarter Horse Association.  In 2014, Redneck Jettin Down placed 4th at the All American Quarter Horse Congress, placed 6th at the AQHA World show in Jr Pole Bending, and placed 5th at the North American Live Stock Show. It goes without saying that Redneck Jettin Down is an asset to Total Equine Services.Whether they grew up in the heart of our big cities or in our smallest of towns, every Kentucky citizen has heard about the glamour of Keeneland and Churchill Downs. The equine industry plays an active part of the Kentucky identity, and it is businesses like Total Equine Services that retain the respect and renown of that industry by taking special care of their breeds. Moreover the Thomas’ and families like them play a vital role in our state’s economy, as they support commerce within our more rural communities. Congratulations to Steve, Patti, Jason, and Nikki Thomas and the rest of the team at Total Equine Services. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	April 1, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Kelsey's On Main of Jackson, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, Kelsey’s On Main of Jackson, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Like a good Southerner, Kelsey Sebastian is passionate about hospitality. After leaving her native Jackson, she pursued a degree in Hospitality Management and Tourism from University of Kentucky. However, instead of taking her university expertise to the opportunities of the big city, Kelsey returned home to put her knowledge and skills to work. Thus in 2014, with the help of her family, Kelsey Sebastian opened Kelsey’s On Main. The idea for Kelsey’s On Main was born out of several needs for the little town of Jackson. With only a small number of sit-in dining establishments in Jackson, local residents needed more restaurant options. Moreover, there was a need for revitalization in the heart of downtown Jackson, a heady mission that Kelsey and her family bravely took on. The Hogg building, now home to Kelsey’s On Main, was 98 years old when she and her family began the renovation process in 2012. A former pharmacy and pool hall, this historic building located in the center of downtown needed a healthy dose of tender love and care. Renovating the establishment was by no means an easy task but the town of Jackson and its residents will tell you that it was worth it. In 2014, the centennial anniversary of the Hogg building, Kelsey’s On Main opened their doors. Kelsey’s desire to restore beauty to the dilapidated old Hogg building corresponded with her mission to provide great food and top quality service to her hometown. In keeping the original tin roof and leaving one of the old walls exposed in its brick, customers can see that this building is mature in age but well taken care of. To that end, Kelsey and her family keep old photos of downtown Jackson as well as photos of her friends and family throughout the historic building. Of course her family is not just present in the photographs that hang on the wall, her parents often come by to pick up a shift or two to support their daughter. And as a tenant in her aunt’s building, Kelsey’s On Main is a true family affair. Returning to Jackson to open her own business is not the only way Kelsey supports her community. She is an active member of the Jackson Women’s Group and as a Jackson City Council member, Kelsey always volunteers her restaurant to host the monthly Jackson Chamber of Commerce lunch. Kelsey is also involved in the Breathitt County Honey Festival, a tradition that has been around for over four decades, by supporting the festival’s Musical Committee. As someone so involved in the goings-on of her town, Kelsey does her best to bring life to the Jackson community, as illustrated by she and her family’s decision to revitalize a historic downtown building. Moreover, as a recent participant in Kentucky’s BRIGHT program, a professional and entrepreneurial development program, it is clear that Kelsey is headstrong in her desire to keep improving and impacting the community around her.All across the country are little towns like Jackson whose downtowns have been left empty by a shift in industry, and it is businesses like Kelsey’s On Main that bring life back into those empty storefronts and keep historic communities thriving. Congratulations to Kelsey and her family and the entire team at Kelsey’s On Main. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	March 25, 2022Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Our Best Restaurant of Smithfield, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:
	 Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, Our Best Restaurant of Smithfield, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	In 1990, the late Kenneth Way and his wife Kay embarked on a new adventure in the autumn of their lives. After retiring from a career in the retail industry, Kenneth bought an old wheat mill in Smithfield, Kentucky, population 100. Joined by his wife Kay who had just retired from her career serving the Kentucky state government, the two opened Our Best Restaurant. Kenneth’s son Kenny Way will tell you himself that his father was not in the restaurant business, he was in the “people business.” Kenneth’s motto was that if you treat people well, your business will succeed no matter what you do. Clearly Kenneth was on to something as his restaurant and legacy continue to thrive for the past 32 years. 
	 
	Kenneth’s son Kenny Way now owns and operates the business, carrying on his father’s mission of providing top quality service to everyone who walks in the door. Though Our Best Restaurant consistently serves delicious country cooking, it is the warm and friendly atmosphere that keeps people coming back time and time again. With a population as small as Smithfield’s, the restaurant cannot depend on the typical walk-in customer that other main street businesses often see; their bread and butter are the locals, and even visitors, who keep coming back. A change in ownership never stopped their “regulars” from choosing Our Best Restaurant, because Kenny learned from his late father that a loyal customer will only come back if you treat them right. That is why the staff of Our Best Restaurant put in such an effort to get to know their customers, to meet their families and their children, to ask them about their day and to show that they care about the customer’s experience, beyond just the meal. 
	 
	Such high quality customer service and food have allowed Our Best Restaurant to grow and expand. Since 1990 they have expanded their dining space and have branched out to offer catering services asides from their dine-in operations. The catering business became a crucial stream of revenue for the restaurant as the COVID-19 pandemic put a temporary end to in-person dining. Local energy and utility companies turned to Our Best Restaurant to safely serve meals to their employees during the height of the pandemic. Our Best Restaurant has consistently proved to be a steadfast member of the small community of Smithfield. The restaurant maintains great relationships with the local high school, looking out for the local students and always feeding them a hearty meal of Kentucky country cooking. 
	 
	The reputation of the feel-good-food and friendly atmosphere of Our Best Restaurant has allowed them to be a destination in themselves. They often have folks drive in from Jefferson County and Franklin County to enjoy their famous cooking. And of course any and all visitors receive the same small-town welcome as any Smithfield local would. Our Best Restaurant is the entrepreneurial embodiment of the late Kenneth and Kay’s dream come true and a wonderful example of a father’s mission carried on by his son. All across the country are little towns like Smithfield, areas that contain little more than a post office and a church, and it’s businesses like Our Best Restaurant that keep those small communities thriving. Congratulations to Kenny, his son Aric, and the entire Our Best Restaurant team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.

	  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Seasonal Shoppe of Salyersville, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, Seasonal Shoppe of Salyersville, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.             Bekah Frazier Rudd, owner of Seasonal Shoppe will tell you herself that retail runs in her blood. Bekah inherited her knack for running a business from her mother and father, who owned Frazier’s Prater Drug Store, the longest continuously operating business in Salyersville. Bekah’s mother, Patricia Frazier, started off with a little corner in her husband’s store selling arts and crafts items. Throughout the years in the drug store, the popularity of Patricia’s corner eventually led her to start a business of her own, just a few doors down from her husband’s pharmacy. Thus, Seasonal Shoppe was born, and has been operating since 1997. Eight years later, when Patricia left to take over Frazier’s Prater Drug Store, Bekah stepped in to fill her mother’s shoes as owner and operator of Seasonal Shoppe.  Though Seasonal Shoppe has since shifted towards selling more clothes and general home goods than arts and crafts, little else about the store or its quality of service has changed. Bekah continues the same friendly atmosphere created by her mother, by bringing her family around to lend a hand in the store. Bekah works alongside her sister-in-law, as well two full time staff and two local high school students who work part-time for Seasonal Shoppe. And just how Bekah used to work inside her father’s drug store, her two children are common faces at Seasonal Shoppe, helping out with merchandise sales and with seasonal events.  Bekah not only perpetuates the same family-friendly atmosphere created by her mother; she pays mind to the traditions passed down to her by her father. Mr. Frazier always said that it was their duty as main street mainstays to support the community. Bekah continues this tradition by sponsoring the local high school sports teams, community churches, and most recently helping out the local fire department with their annual fundraiser. This charitable spirit instilled in her by her parents comes in addition to the good business sense she inherited from them, and it is this special combination of devotion to the community and to the livelihood of the store that has kept Seasonal Shoppe running these past 25 years. Small businesses like Seasonal Shoppe are the lifeblood of small towns across Kentucky, and they serve as an inspiring example of how the entrepreneurial spirit transcends multiple generations. Moreover, the story of Seasonal Shoppe illustrates that sometimes it takes an existing business to start a new business, in that Patricia reached her customer base through her husband’s drug store. Seasonal Shoppe and their role in the Salyersville community demonstrates how small businesses are an integral part of the daily life of small towns across the country, and I am thankful for the chance to honor these entrepreneurs and what they represent. Congratulations to Bekah and the entire Seasonal Shoppe team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	March 15, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul (R-KY) forced a vote on his resolution to repeal travel mask mandates on public transportation, the Senate passed the resolution with bipartisan support voting 57-40.
	 
	“Today, the Senate said enough is enough, and sent a message to unelected government bureaucrats to stop the anti-science, nanny state requirement of travel mask mandates,” said Dr. Paul. “Since March 2020, unelected bureaucrats have incessantly declared that we should ‘follow the science.’ But the same bureaucrats continue to defy science by imposing an ineffective and restrictive mask mandate for individuals travelling on public transit and airplanes. As the entire world is learning to live with COVID, the federal government still uses fear mongering to stubbornly perpetuate its mandates, rather than giving clear-eyed, rational advice on how to best protect yourself from illness. That is why, I forced this vote, and I applaud the Senate for rejecting this nonsense.”
	 
	This vote comes on the heels of last Thursday’s announcement from the TSA that mask mandates on air plane travel would be extended another month. The resolution will now head to the House of Representatives for consideration.
	 
	Dr. Paul has been a leading advocate against mask mandates. He previously introduced the Travel Mask Mandate Repeal Act of 2021, and continues to be outspoken against mandates.

	March 14, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced an amendment to eliminate Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and replace it with three separate national research institutes. “We’ve learned a lot over the past two years, but one lesson in particular is that no one person should be deemed “dictator-in-chief.” No one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans,” said Dr. Paul. “To ensure that ineffective, unscientific lockdowns and mandates are never foisted on the American people ever again, I’ve introduced this amendment to eliminate Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and divide his power into three separate new institutes. This will create accountability and oversight into a taxpayer funded position that has largely abused its power, and has been responsible for many failures and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Background:As recently as 2012, Congress passed a law that eliminated the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and reassigned some of its programs to a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and assigned other NCRR functions to other institutes within NIH.Dr. Paul’s amendment would keep with this precedent of reorganization, and would immediately eliminate Dr. Fauci’s position and replace it with three new directors of the following new institutes:Each of these three institutes will be led by a director who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a 5-year term. This amendment also aligns with NIAID’s existing mission statement, which begins by saying:  “NIAID conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases.” You can read Dr. Paul’s amendment HERE. ###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Burchett’s Heating and Cooling of Paintsville, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the small business, Burchett’s Heating and Cooling of Paintsville, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.    Rogell Burchett had a keen eye for business opportunities, which is why he opened Burchett’s Heating and Cooling in 1978. As a gas company employee, he could not ignore all the new homes being built in his area when he knew there was little market for natural gas and furnace installations. So he started what was then a side venture called Burchett’s Heating and Cooling. Rogell’s vision and dedication allowed that side venture to grow into a family business now entering into its third generation of management.When the business was first founded, Burchett’s operations mainly involved natural gas and furnace work. However as Kentucky saw the coal industry abate, Burchett’s Heating and Cooling adapted to include more geothermal work as well as some light commercial work. Clearly Rogell passed his sharp intuition for running a business along to his children and grandchildren, as this transition took place over multiple generations. Growing into what his father created, Neal Burchett took over the business when his father Rogell retired. Later on, Neal’s son Ryan Burchett would also become part of the operation, serving as the management arm of this family owned business. Together, these three generations of Burchett men have kept Paintsville warm during the cold Kentucky winters, and cool in the summers, with the comfort of Paintsville citizens remaining their top priority.With over forty years of experience, Burchett’s Heating and Cooling maintains close relationships with customers that count on them for quality, year after year. Of course when the business stays in the family as it has with the Burchett men, it is easy to see how the community of Paintsville could place their trust in their services. That being said, Burchett’s Heating and Cooling remains an active member of the Paintsville community outside of their normal business operations. Staying true to their family-owned nature, the business sponsors the local high school basketball and football teams, teams that both Neal and Ryan used to play for during their high school years. Burchett’s Heating and Cooling also provides free services to their local church so that parishioners can worship comfortably.  Small businesses like Burchett’s Heating and Cooling are the lifeblood of small towns across Kentucky, and they serve as an inspiring example of how the entrepreneurial spirit transcends multiple generations. Congratulations to Neal and Ryan and the entire Burchett’s Heating and Cooling team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs.

	March 10, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, in light of the recent release of the $1.5 trillion spending package, U.S. Senator Rand Paul renewed his calls for the Senate to pass his Read the Bills resolution (S. Res. 20), which would provide sufficient time for legislation to be thoroughly reviewed. Dr. Paul’s resolution would require bills, amendments, and conference reports to be filed for 1 day for every 20 pages before they can be considered, while leaving legislators room to act in emergencies. “Do you think there is a single person in the U.S. who believes that Congress is filled with speed readers capable of digesting thousands of pages in a matter of hours?” said Dr. Paul. “The 2741-page omnibus with a $1.5 trillion price tag that was released in the middle of the night is a perfect example of why Congress needs time to read the bills.”If Dr. Paul’s resolution was enacted, the current omnibus bill would take 137 days to be called for a vote in the Senate. ""I stand by my pledge to increase transparency and accessibility in the U.S. Senate, and my resolution will not only give members ample time to read all legislation before they vote but also incentivize legislation to be shorter,""said Dr. Paul.

While government stimulus spending was intended as a form of relief, and low and middle-income families as well as small business owners were promised that their taxes would not increase, Americans everywhere are now paying a hidden tax called inflation,” said Dr. Paul. “In recent months, prices on nearly everything from gas, food, and clothes to electricity, car prices, and rent, have all increased, and unfortunately it's only going to get worse. Congress needs to realize that further spending at this time of rapidly rising prices is only going to continue the trend of rising prices on this nation’s already vulnerable businesses and families.” Background: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on January 12, 2021 found that prices had risen 7 percent in the 12 months prior to December. This represents the largest increase in a 12-year period in the last four decades. Similarly, the Producer Price Index (PPI) final demand release on January 13, 2021 found that prices for businesses had jumped 9.7 percent in 2021, the largest calendar year increase in prices for businesses in the history of this index. While elected officials did not promise tax breaks, they did spend $4.9 trillion in COVID-19 stimulus since the beginning of the pandemic. These programs included popular programs geared towards families, workers, and business owners alike, such as the Paycheck Protection Program, the Economic Impact Payments (stimulus checks), and the Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. Congress passed these popular programs without raising taxes, but now Americans are faced with the hidden tax that is a risk with any form of government spending: inflation. In an attempt to understand how this tax was levied and how it affects American workers, this report arrived at three key conclusions:You can read the full report HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul (R-KY) announced he will be introducing legislation next week to overturn the COVID-19 vaccination requirements on consumers and students imposed by the District of Columbia. Dr. Paul’s bill, the Restore Parental and Consumer Medical Rights in the Nation’s Capital Act will repeal the mandate requiring a vaccine to enter any indoor food and drink establishments, indoor cultural and entertainment establishments, indoor exercise and recreational facilities, indoor event and meeting establishments, and any other indoor establishment designated by the Director of the DC Department of Health in the District as well as the D.C. student vaccine mandate.
	 
	“Enacting a vaccine mandate that infringes upon the right of parents to make medical decisions for their children and the personal liberties of consumers, in the capital of what is supposed to be the freest country in the world, doesn’t sound like freedom at all,” said Dr. Paul. “My legislation would stop these ridiculous, unscientific mandates and restore individual and parental rights in the District.”

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q of Bowling Green, Kentucky, as the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:
	 Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a family-owned small business, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q of Bowling Green, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Kaye and Phil Huffer purchased Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q in 1999. Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q’s founder, Ned “Smokey” Nickerson, began serving up his signature Monroe County-style barbecue in 1969 when he established the restaurant. To prepare this southern Kentucky staple, the meat is prepared with no spices before being smoked over hickory wood. The hickory-smoked meat has a distinct flavor, and is served with a vinegar-based sauce. Before his family bought the business, Phil regularly made the 100-mile round trip from Bowling Green to his home town to purchase Monroe County-style barbecue. Noticing the absence of this particular style of barbecue in Warren County, Kaye and Phil decided to run a barbecue restaurant. They bought Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q, welcoming their first customers in March 1999. 
	 
	More than 20 years later, Kaye and Phil continue to serve up some of the best barbecue in Bowling Green. Folks drive from all over the commonwealth to enjoy their delicious cuisine and family-friendly hospitality. Kaye and Phil’s care and attention to detail are evident in every aspect of Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q’s restaurant and catering business. Even the charcoal is made on site, using hickory wood from local sawmills. Their son Scott has also joined his parents in dedicating himself to the restaurant's continued success.
	 
	Together, Kaye and Phil seek to give back to their community in any way possible. Through Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q, Kaye and Phil regularly support community organizations, including Norton Children’s Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. When their son, Matthew, was born preterm, they turned to the Children’s Hospital for support. Now, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q is a longtime supporter of the Hospital, supporting their mission to continue helping children overcome health challenges.
	 
	Over the years, Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q’s unique cuisine has been profiled by local and national media. It is currently rated as TripAdvisor’s #1 Quick Bites in Bowling Green, and Grubwire named it the best restaurant in Bowling Green in 2019. Additionally, the Kentucky Pork Producers Association honored Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as the 2018 Pork Restaurant of the Year. For more than a decade, locals have voted Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q as “Best of Bowling Green” in BG Daily News’s annual readers’ choice awards. The restaurant was also featured in the Food Network’s Feasting on Asphalt series hosted by Alton Brown.
	 
	Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q is a remarkable example of how hard work and ingenuity can turn a dream into reality. Small businesses like Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q form the heart of towns across Kentucky and regularly step up to support their communities. Congratulations to Phil, Kaye, and the entire Smokey Pig Bar-B-Q team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-sanctions-against-nord-stream-ii-are-more-about-mercantilism-and-protectionism,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
	January 13, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	 
	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) spoke on the Senate floor to object to proposed sanctions against the Nord Stream II pipeline.
	 
	Below are Dr. Paul’s remarks as prepared:
	 “Sanction this. Sanction that. The Department of the Treasury is currently administering dozens of sanction programs designed to change the behavior of certain countries.
	 
	“And yet, no one seems to ask the important question: Do sanctions promote peace and understanding or escalate tensions between nations? What behavior has China modified since the U.S. began sanctions? Has Russia changed her behavior? Has Russia given back Crimea?
	 
	“Sanctions, though lacking in proof of effectiveness, are very popular with both parties. Embargoes, sanctions’ big brother, also garner bipartisan enthusiasm. The U.S. embargo of Cuba has now endured for more than 60 years without any evidence of a change in regime or even a change in the regime’s policy.
	 
	“Embargoes are often described, especially by the embargoed country, as an act of war. Many historians say the U.S.’s embargo of 1807 ultimately led to the War of 1812. President Jefferson’s embargo was intended to punish France and England for their aggressions at sea but instead the embargo crippled American shipping exports. Exports declined by 75 percent along with a reduction in imports.
	 
	“Some historians also blame the U.S. embargo of Japan in 1941 for the ensuing war. Franklin Roosevelt seized all of Japan’s assets and Japan lost access to the vast majority of its international trade and over 80 percent of its imported oil. Effectively, at least from Japan’s perspective, the embargo was an act of war.
	 
	“Yet enthusiasts for embargoes and sanctions still clamor for more. Sanctionistas point to the international sanctions against Iran as the lever that brought about the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran.
	 
	“Perhaps. But an equally valid argument can be made that it was the extension of carrots rather than sticks that brought Iran to the table. Funny how diplomacy seems to require give and take and not just take, take, take.
	 
	“Our interaction with Iran should illuminate today’s debate over sanctions on the Nord Stream II pipeline from Russia to Germany. But, the shade of mercantilism is dimming the light of experience. Opponents of the pipeline, not surprisingly, are largely from states that compete in the sale of natural gas.
	 
	“Reports are that the pipeline will cause a significant reduction in U.S. exports of liquid natural gas.
	Acknowledging that this debate is only superficially about national security and really more about provincial protectionism helps us better understand the dynamics.
	 
	“History demonstrates that trade and interconnectedness between nations is a barrier to war. Engaging in mutually beneficial commerce coupled with a potent military deterrence is the combination that best promises peace.
	 
	“Over the past decade Congress and presidents have heaped sanctions on Russia and China. When I’ve asked State Department officials to reveal what behavioral changes have come about as a result of sanctions, I’ve gotten only blank stares. Now the sanctionistas want to sanction an already completed pipeline. But what behavior are they asking Russia to change? What specifically is Russia being asked? What Russian action is necessary for the sanctions to end?
	 
	“I’ve asked the sponsor of these sanctions what he wants Russia to do, what behavior he wants Russia to change. The sanctions supporters respond that no behavior changes will suffice. They just want Russia to be unable to ship natural gas to Germany.
	 
	“If Nord Stream II sanctions were really about changing Russian policy or deterring aggression, then NATO, including Germany, could threaten sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Now that threat of sanctions, with Germany as an ally, might actually have deterring value.
	 
	“In fact, last summer, the U.S. and Germany announced an agreement that warns Russia that “any attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine” will be met with sanctions. The commitment is designed to ensure Russia will not misuse any pipeline, including Nord Stream II, to achieve aggressive political ends.
	 
	“The rush to impose sanctions now undermines the threat of sanctions to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine.
	 
	“But as today’s debate unfolds, I think you’ll find that sanctions against Nord Stream II are more about mercantilism and protectionism than national security.”

	January 11, 2022 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee challenged Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on his authoritarian claim that he unilaterally represents science. 
	 
	As Dr. Paul said during the hearing:“The idea that a government official would claim to unilaterally represent science and that any criticism of that official would be considered a criticism of science itself, is quite dangerous.
	 
	“Central planning, whether it be of the economy or of science, is risky because of the fallibility of the planner. It would not be so catastrophic if the planner where simply one physician in Peoria, then the mistakes would only affect those patients who chose that physician, but when the planner is a government doctor, who rules by mandate, the errors are compounded and become much more harmful.
	 
	“A planner who believes he is “the science,” leads to an arrogance that justifies, in his mind, using government resources to smear and destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with him.”
	In a recently released email exchange with Dr. Collins, Dr. Fauci conspired, to create “a quick and devastating published takedown of three prominent epidemiologists from Harvard, Oxford, Stanford and label them, “fringe.” Instead of engaging with the epidemiologists on merits, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins sought to smear and discredit any questions, opinions, and concerns they had. This is not only antithetical to the scientific method; it is the epitome of cheap politics that Dr. Fauci continues to prioritize over any questions surrounding COVID-19.

This week I am honored to recognize the Lenoxburg General Store of Foster, Kentucky as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	When Scott and Angela Horn took over the Lenoxburg General Store nearly two years ago, they inherited more than four walls stacked with merchandise. The illustrious history and culture of the store bring with it a tradition that the Horn’s were determined to uphold and enhance. Founded by Sam Lenoxburg in 1938 during the height of the Great Depression, the General Store brought local farmers and tradesmen together for excellent meals and butchering services. It represented a gathering place for a rapidly expanding community and was the cornerstone of Bracken and Pendleton County. While large cities and towns had cinemas and famous diners to bring about this connection, it was Sam Lenoxburg’s store that generated the communal culture in the tight-knit Kentucky town for generations.
	 
	Today, the Lenoxburg General Store continues to supply both general service and deli processing to its local clientele. The location remains a congregation hub, drawing folks from all over and the bordering counties to dine and shop with a traditional flair. Since the Horn’s took ownership, the store has branched into catering and offers delivery for local events across the community it serves. The location also hosts events of its own, including fish-fry contests and holiday celebrations. But most importantly during this time, Angela and Scott have continued in their tradition of hiring within their community, serving as a boon to their local economy. This family-owned business has supported a community-first atmosphere in the store which attracts visitors and customers from surrounding counties.
	 
	Philanthropy and hospitality are crucial tenants to Kentucky’s character, and the Horns exemplify these traits through their charitable work. Scott, the local game warden, has partnered with Kentucky Hunters for the Hungry to deliver more than 1,450 pounds of venison to more than 350 families in need. The Horns are also involved with national charities and use their business to contribute to the Bracken and Pendleton Tourism Committees, along with the counties’ 4-H programs. Lenoxburg General Store was heavily involved in the preparation and execution of the Heritage Days in Augusta, the longest-running event in the area. Scott and Angela are committed to serving their friends and neighbors and get involved whenever they can to improve the lives of those around them.
	 
	The Horns’ dedicated approach to supporting the store’s family-like atmosphere goes beyond their praised home-cooked specials. As business owners and operators, Scott and Angela go above and beyond for their community, and demonstrate how small businesses serve as the backbone of towns across Kentucky. Congratulations to Scott, Angela, and the entire Lenoxburg General Store team. I wish them the best of luck, and I look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.
	 
	As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Dr. Paul continues the tradition of honoring America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship oversees proposed legislation on matters relating to the Small Business Administration and investigates all problems relating to America’s small businesses.

	December 7, 2021 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Member Rand Paul (R-KY) urged the Senate to support his bipartisan joint resolution of disapproval to block proposed U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Dr. Paul was joined by U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Mike Lee (R-UT) in introducing the resolution last month. Dr. Paul gave remarks on the floor before the Senate proceeded to vote on a motion to discharge the resolution from the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
	  
	“A message needs to be sent to Saudi Arabia that we don’t approve of their war with Yemen,” said Dr. Paul. “By participating in this sale, we would not only be rewarding reprehensible behavior, but also exacerbating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Congress and the Biden Administration should consider the possible consequences of this sale that could accelerate an arms race in the Middle East and jeopardize the security of our military technologies.”
	 
	You can watch Dr. Paul’s floor remarks HERE, and learn more about Dr. Paul’s efforts in his op-ed published in The American Conservative HERE.
	 Background:
	 
	On November 4, 2021, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and related equipment for an estimated cost of $650 million. The AIM-120C is predominately used defensively to strike drones from the air; although, they could conceivably be used in an offensive strike on other aircraft. The proposed sale comes in light of the Saudi-led fuel blockade of Yemen, which has prevented the free flow of food and water in the country. Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced an end to “offensive” support in the war in Yemen. However, Saudi Arabia has continued its blockade in Yemen, which has worsened the humanitarian crisis in the country.
	 
	The joint resolution of disapproval is cosponsored by Senators Sanders (D-VT), Lee (R-UT), Leahy (D-VT), Wyden (D-OR), Warren (D-MA), Markey (D-MA), Merkley (D-OR), and Murray (D-WA).
	You can read the joint resolution HERE.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-we-can-end-saudi-blockade-and-bring-relief-long-suffering-yemeni-people,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
	December 7, 2021 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) penned an op-ed published in the American Conservative on his joint resolution of disapproval to block proposed U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The joint resolution will be voted on in the Senate today. You can read Dr. Paul’s full op-ed HERE or below, and learn more about his joint resolution HERE. Saudi Arabia’s air and naval blockade of Yemen is an abomination. For years now, ships that would otherwise carry food, fuel, and medicine are turned away by the Saudi-led coalition, depriving the Yemeni people of the necessities to sustain civilization. Saudi Arabia’s intervention in the Yemeni civil war is a chilling example of the cruelty of warfare by starvation. According to the United Nations, five million people are one step away from succumbing to famine and disease, and ten million more are right behind them. But, this week, the Senate can start the process of ending this crisis by passing my legislation to cancel an American arms sale to Saudi Arabia that aids and abets the subjugation of the Yemeni people. The children of Yemen who survive Saudi Arabia’s barbaric blockade will inevitably tell their sons and daughters of the horrors of their youth. And those sons and daughters will tell their sons and daughters. Through oral tradition, a thousand generations of Yemenis will know of the Crown Prince’s ruthlessness. And they will also know that it was the Americans that sold him the weapons to wage his murderous campaign.The reports from Yemen describe a nightmare. The Washington Post reported of a three-year-old boy, who could not walk or speak, described his face as “skeletal” and arms and legs as “thin as twigs.” He weighed ten pounds, and his father said that he sometimes goes two days without eating because Saudi import restrictions have made food prohibitively expensive, as if mere sustenance was a luxury. The New York Times told the story of a mother who, after three days of failing to find a ride, carried her 8-month-old son while walking two hours to reach medics to treat acute malnutrition. Even after a week of treatment with enriched formula, the boy still lay motionless on his hospital bed. Tens of thousands of children have already died from disease, malnutrition, or starvation. International aid agencies, who also have to fight the Saudi blockade to provide humanitarian assistance, put it succinctly: “the people of Yemen are not starving. They are being starved.”The Saudi siege of Yemen is made possible because of American weaponry. The arsenal provided by the United States includes billions of dollars’ worth of military aircraft and thousands of air-to-ground munitions. Only weeks ago, the Biden Administration approved a new $650 million sale of 280 advanced medium range air-to-air missiles and 596 missile launchers to the Saudis. As painful as it is to admit, the United States is an accessory Saudi savagery. President Biden says the latest sale is merely to help defend Saudi territorial integrity, but the commander in chief’s words do not match Saudi actions. According to William Hartung, the Director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy, “the air blockade is enforced by a threat to shoot down any aircraft, military or civilian, that enters Yemeni air space with the goal of landing at Sana’a airport. The provision of air-to-air missiles gives further credibility to this threat, dissuading any government or aid group from bringing in crucial medicines or flying patients in and out of Yemen.” In other words, no weapon is exclusively defensive and continued American arm sales means continued death and starvation in Yemen. I am leading a bipartisan effort to end America’s complicity in Saudi Arabia’s war on the Yemeni people. This week, I will force a vote on a bipartisan disapproval resolution that proposes to cancel the arms sale. To overcome an almost certain veto, this effort will require the support of two-thirds of both chambers of Congress. If Members of Congress believe in humanitarianism, if they believe America is a force for good that serves as a model for other nations to emulate, if they believe that the crushing of the Yemeni people must be stopped, then they must vote for the resolution of disapproval. We have a chance to tell the Crown Prince that American arms sales will end until he gives up his starvation campaign. We can end the Saudi blockade and bring relief to the long-suffering Yemeni people. Should we fail to seize this opportunity, history will never let us forget that America, the last best hope for humanity, failed to protect defenseless civilians from the cruelty of a criminal regime.   ###

	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Recently, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, recognized Imogene’s Alterations of Bowling Green, Kentucky, as the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Dr. Paul entered the following into the Congressional Record:
	 Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Imogene’s Alterations of Bowling Green, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.
	 
	Located on Nutwood Street, Imogene’s Alterations has served Bowling Green, Kentucky for over 20 years. Imogene Garmon, a longtime Bowling Green resident, embarked on her first career in the grocery sector. After 33 years working at the Kroger meat counter, she was ready for a new challenge. A self-taught seamstress, Imogene began selling fabric and doing minor alterations after leaving Kroger. Seeing a business opportunity, Imogene went on to establish a fabric shop. She thrived as a small business owner, serving the greater Bowling Green community. Word spread quickly of Imogene’s talent as a seamstress. Request for alterations poured in, including everything from everyday clothing to suits and ball gowns. To meet the demand, Imogene decided to focus solely on alterations. She established Imogene’s Alterations, providing full-time alterations for men and women’s clothing.
	 
	Today, Imogene’s Alterations continues providing alterations for all types of events and special occasions. This woman-owned business has grown along with the area, moving into its current location at Nutwood Street about twenty years ago. Customers are welcomed by name, and treated like family. At 88 years old, Imogene continues to be involved in every aspect of her business. From operating the store to sewing alterations, her care and attention to detail are evident in her work. Her strong sense of family has built a tight-knit, supportive team.
	 
	Like many entrepreneurs, Imogene established a successful business while building community. As a mother, grandmother, and aunt, Imogene raised and continues to mentor generations of her family. Remarkably, Imogene founded Imogene’s Alterations in her 60s. It took innovation and courage to pursue her goal, switching from the grocery industry which she knew well, to the tailoring sector.
	 
	Imogene’s Alterations is a remarkable example of the resilience and adaptability of locally-owned small businesses. Small businesses like Imogene’s Alterations form the heart of cities and towns across Kentucky. Congratulations to Imogene and the entire team at Imogene’s Alterations. I wish them the best of luck, and I look forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.

				November 29, 2021 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement on the Biden administration’s new and expansive waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that was quietly issued just over a week ago.  “Kentucky’s farmers and agricultural industry suffered when the Obama administration implemented its burdensome WOTUS rule, and now the Biden administration has chosen to follow in their footsteps by appeasing the far left’s priorities over the economic well-being of farmers across America. Their new rule essentially reverts to pre-2015 standards, which regulates every puddle and ditch in America, and further intrudes on Americans’ private property rights and the Constitution’s limits on federal power,” said Dr. Paul.The Kentucky Farm Bureau Federation and Kentucky Cattlemen’s Association also released the following statements on the ruling:“Farm families have always been on the forefront of good stewardship when it comes to natural resources, and certainly taking care of their water supplies is paramount. But as the EPA proposes to return to the pre-2015 interpretation of WOTUS, we need to have some clear directions on the definition of navigable waterways that are not subject to change with every new administration,” said Mark Haney, President of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Federation.“Cattlemen depend on clean water for the health of our livestock and the sustainability of our operations. We know the importance of protecting and maintaining traditionally navigable waters and abutting wetlands, however, jurisdiction over prior converted cropland, stock ponds, and agricultural ditches is an unnecessary burden to livestock producers,” said the Kentucky Cattlemen’s Association. Background:Recently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) quietly issued its proposed rule re-writing the definition of “waters of the United States,” commonly referred to as WOTUS. After promising to listen to the concerns of the farming community, the EPA introduced its rule before finishing consultations with the agriculture industry. The proposed rule harkens to the pre-2015 Obama standards with even less certainty over which waters are covered and is already facing opposition from agriculture groups such as the American Farm Bureau Federation. The regulation would also repeal the Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR), which was applauded by the agriculture industry as a step in the right direction, and is similar to Dr. Paul’s Defense of Environment and Property Act which he reintroduced in July. You can read more about Dr. Paul’s Defense of Environment and Property Act HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Reed Family Floral of Virgie, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. In January 2020, Evan Sykes founded Reed Family Floral. Evan, who grew up in Pike County, was inspired by his family’s legacy of entrepreneurship. From 1981 to 2003, his great-aunt and great-grandmother owned and operated a flower shop called Reed Floral. After graduating from Shelby Valley High School and earning an AA from Big Sandy Community and Technical College, Evan decided to honor that legacy and establish his own floral business. Starting with $500, he began making and selling wreaths. The business grew rapidly, enabling Evan to purchase a small building to house his operation. When Reed Family Floral expanded again, Evan had the perfect location in mind. In August 2021, Evan moved his business into the same building that had housed his family’s flower shop decades earlier.    Today, Reed Family Floral has become a local favorite. As the owner and sole full-time employee, Evan handles every aspect of the business – from accounting and marketing, to floral design and delivery. He prepares flower arrangements for any occasion, including weddings, school functions, and funerals. Evan’s floral arrangements are in demand year-round, especially around Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. Notably, Evan balanced his entrepreneurship and education. While running a full-time business, he is pursuing a BA in Accounting at Morehead State University. As a non-essential business, Reed Family Floral was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns. Evan rose to the challenge, working with other small businesses to source supplies and adapting his contactless delivery options. Like many small business owners, Evan is active in his community. Locally, Reed Family Floral has sponsored the Pikeville High School tennis team and the Shelby Valley High School cheer team. They provide arrangements for school events, and participate in local fairs. From day one, Reed Family Floral has valued customer service and high-quality products. Recently, they were recognized by local news outlet Mountaintop Media as one of the best flower shops in the area. Reed Family Floral is a remarkable example of the critical role small businesses play in every aspect of building community. Small businesses like Reed Family Floral form the heart of towns across Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their communities. Congratulations to Evan and the entire team at Reed Family Floral.

	“Today I begin my exodus from Big Tech, starting with the worst censor of all, YouTube,” said Dr. Paul. “As a libertarian leaning Senator, I think private companies have the right to ban me if they want to, however, those of us who believe that truth comes from disputation and that the marketplace of ideas is a prerequisite for innovation should shun the close-minded censors and take our ideas elsewhere, which is exactly what I’m doing.”
	 
	Over the last year, YouTube has continued to wage its dangerous, anti-progress of science war against free speech, choosing to act in lockstep with government and ban videos posted by Dr. Paul that dared to contradict the government’s position. These videos included conversations with journalists where he discussed the efficacy of masks, particularly cloth masks, and a video explaining the science behind why cloth masks don’t work.

	December 9, 2021 Contact: Press_Paul@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	 WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner today, U.S. Senator and physician Rand Paul made clear his opposition to raising the debt limit and waiving PAYGO.
	 
	“For months, Republicans gave President Joe Biden’s social spending bill the accurate label: “the Democrats’ reckless tax and spending spree.” Republicans, in unison, opposed the $2 trillion spending spree Democrats passed this spring. But now, Republican leadership is pushing a bill to forgive all that spending,” stated Dr. Paul in the piece. “According to the law that governs Congress’s budget process, this spending has to be offset by equal cuts from somewhere else. The law is called PAYGO. But Republican leadership and Democrats are going to waive PAYGO, allowing Biden’s spending spree to become debt instead of being offset by spending cuts.”

	 Republicans musn’t enable Biden’s overspending by waiving PAYGO
	By: Dr. Rand Paul
	December 9, 2021https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/republicans-musnt-enable-bidens-overspending-by-waiving-paygo
	 
	There’s a palpable chill in the air in Washington this week, and I’m not talking about the weather.
	 
	I’m talking about the icy forecast of our country’s fiscal stability and the possibility that Republicans could be complicit in creating such treacherous conditions.
	 
	For months, Republicans gave President Joe Biden’s social spending bill the accurate label: “the Democrats’ reckless tax and spending spree.” Republicans, in unison, opposed the $2 trillion spending spree Democrats passed this spring. But now, Republican leadership is pushing a bill to forgive all that spending.
	 
	According to the law that governs Congress’s budget process, this spending has to be offset by equal cuts from somewhere else. The law is called PAYGO. But Republican leadership and Democrats are going to waive PAYGO, allowing Biden’s spending spree to become debt instead of being offset by spending cuts.
	 
	This monstrosity of a bill also allows the debt ceiling to go up with a simple majority vote. Republican leadership, which ostensibly guards the filibuster, is allowing this bill to neuter the filibuster with respect to the debt ceiling. The bill sets a precedent that the debt ceiling can be raised without requiring a supermajority — a big concession.
	 
	Voters should be appalled that Republican leadership is basically giving Democrats their Christmas wish list on a silver platter. This horrible “deal” they concocted gives Democrats an easy path to raise the debt ceiling using expedited procedures and would enable even more reckless spending.
	 
	The current debt limit is $28.9 trillion. That’s essentially the limit on America’s credit card. What happens when you don’t pay the balance of your credit card bill? You pay interest charges. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now projects that interest costs on our debt will be $5.4 trillion over 10 years, and the projected deficit for this year is $1.1 trillion.
	 
	We cannot afford to raise the debt limit without meaningful spending reform. Continued reckless spending is dangerous to the health of our country and our national security. Simply put, the bill provides reckless spenders with a blank check and sends the country further down a dangerous path that threatens a future of confiscatory tax rates, low employment prospects, and high inflation.
	 
	I hate to say it, but I told you so.
	 In March, I tried to force Congress to follow the rules it had set for itself and pay for new COVID spending by enforcing PAYGO rules. Speaking from the Senate floor, I noted that “big spenders like to say the federal government is different than a family budget and that we have the Federal Reserve who can print up money to buy our debt. But all that does is cause inflation.”
	 
	And what do you know, just as I predicted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that inflation hit 6.2% — the highest level in a generation.
	 
	Ready for the worst part of all this? If the Biden administration’s Build Back Better spending bill passes this year, it won’t be subject to the mandatory PAYGO cuts. Republicans would literally be facilitating Biden and the Democrats’ priorities.
	 
	I’ve often said that both Republicans and Democrats are at fault for the spending crisis in Washington, and this case is no different. Republicans ought to stop assisting the Democrats in playing their reckless game of kick-the-can-down-the-road and resist this bizarre attempt to facilitate their agenda.
	 
	I have tried to warn of the dire forecast for our nation if we continue with this fiscal insanity. And while I may not be a meteorologist, I can see when a storm is brewing. Congress ought to join me in keeping an eye on the horizon and act before it’s too late.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-reintroduces-school-act,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:March 10, 2021Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) reintroduced the Support Children Having Open Opportunities for Learning (SCHOOL) Act to provide parents and students with much-needed flexibility and options regarding K-12 education. U.S. Representative Chip Roy (R-TX-21) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. “I’ve led the effort to reopen our schools from the very beginning, and as we continue our push, it’s imperative that we empower parents to make the decision that’s best for their child’s education -- without being restricted by the political games our governors and teachers’ unions have been playing with our children’s lives and well-being,” said Dr. Paul. ""I have a bill to do exactly that – my SCHOOL Act would give parents and students a choice in education, and the tools to succeed no matter where they are learning.” “Nearly one year after Americans were told we should take “two weeks to slow the spread,” too many children are still barred from attending school in person, while billions of dollars have been allocated to the very local authorities keeping schools closed. No more funding should be allocated to these local tyrants at the expense of our children’s futures. Parents should be in control of their child’s education, period, not politicians or union bosses. I’m proud to reintroduce The SCHOOL Act with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) which allows federal funds for K-12 education to follow the eligible child, regardless of whether the child is in public school, private school, or homeschool,” said Rep. Roy. “The past year put a spotlight on the main problem with K-12 education: a long-existing massive power imbalance between the public school monopoly and individual families. Reallocating existing education funding from buildings to students is a great step toward empowering families. Education funding is meant for educating children, not for protecting a particular institution. We should fund students instead of systems,” said Director of School Choice at Reason Foundation, Corey DeAngelis. ""Senator Paul understands, like so many Americans, that families deserve choice in how their children are educated, now more than ever. Any federal dollars spent on education should fund students, not systems; but certainly not schools that refuse to safely and smartly reopen,” said President of FreedomWorks, Adam Brandon. “His SCHOOL Act would go far in addressing the deep structural issue of 'one-size-fits-all' federal programs that fall short far too often, instead empowering families with true educational freedom and setting an example for states and localities to do the same."" ""Sen. Paul's SCHOOL Act is an important school choice proposal that would allow federal K-12 funding to follow students rather than schools—which is especially critical while many schools remain closed. This proposal would put students first by giving them much-needed flexibility when navigating education options, during the pandemic and beyond,"" said Vice President of Government Relations and Communications, Heritage Action for America, Garrett Bess. “Directly empowering families, especially lower income and special needs families, to choose the best educational environment for their children is the way we will ensure educational opportunity for every child. We applaud Sen. Paul for introducing legislation that puts families and students first,” said President of American Federation for Children, John Schilling.  The Support Children Having Open Opportunities for Learning Act would allow Federal funds for K-12 education to follow the eligible child, regardless of whether the child is in public school, private school, or homeschool. These funds could be used for a wide range of educational needs, including: curriculum materials, technological educational materials, and educational therapies for students with disabilities. No matter what the learning landscape looks like moving forward, this bill empowers parents to put their children’s futures first. You can read the SCHOOL Act HERE, and find more information below: Dr. Rand Paul’s Support Children Having Open Opportunities for Learning (SCHOOL) Act    ◦    Curriculum materials    ◦    Technological educational materials    ◦    Tutoring    ◦    Extracurricular activities     ◦    Private school tuition    ◦    Educational therapies for students with disabilities###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	March 3, 2021Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) reintroduced the Federal Reserve Transparency Act or the “Audit the Fed” bill, to prevent the Federal Reserve from concealing vital information on its operations from Congress. The bill currently has 6 cosponsors.
	 
	“Audit the Fed is a widely supported grassroots movement that aims to shake up the Washington establishment’s spending addiction,” said Dr. Paul. “It is by far time Congress passes this legislation to hold the Federal Reserve accountable to the people’s representatives.”
	 
	This legislation would require the nonpartisan, independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a thorough audit of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and reserve banks within one year of the bill’s passage and to report back to Congress within 90 days of completing the audit.
	 
	Audit the Fed would amend section 714b of Title 31 of the U.S. Code to allow the GAO to fully audit:

	March 6, 2021Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) issued the following statement regarding his vote against the $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill advanced by President Biden and congressional Democrats as COVID relief. The bill passed along party lines with a 50-49 vote. 
	 
	“I am disappointed but not surprised that Senate Democrats rejected efforts to open schools now, target aid to only those who need it, and end programs that are keeping people out of work. Instead they chose to borrow money to give to their political allies and further their radical agenda. While I fear the consequences of adding $2 trillion more our children will have to pay back, I am proud to have successfully stopped their multiple attempts to give taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood abortion mills across America,” said Dr. Paul.
	 
	Dr. Paul won an early victory in forcing Democrats to remove a provision that would have allowed every Planned Parenthood across America to receive free money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) – money which was always intended for small businesses. The Paul team strenuously argued to the Senate Parliamentarian that this waiver would only benefit Planned Parenthood and thus violated the so-called Byrd rule. 
	 
	In the final minutes before passage, Democrats made a last-ditch effort to add the provision back, but Dr. Paul and his team successfully blocked that too.
	 
	As part of the nearly 24-hour “vote-a-rama” amendment process, Dr. Paul also introduced an amendment to stop Democrats’ attempts to use taxpayer dollars to fund labor unions and other large, well-financed nonprofits through expanded access to paycheck protection loans. It failed to pass.

	“Democrats are trying to provide free money to their political allies, instead of fighting for small businesses and the American people, ”said Dr. Paul. “The original congressional intent of PPP was to limit large and well-financed groups from receiving a loan, and instead provide relief to small businesses.”

				March 5, 2021Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, forced Democrats to remove a provision in their massive $1.9 trillion liberal wish list of a spending bill that would have allowed every Planned Parenthood across America to receive free money through the Paycheck Protection Program – money which was always intended for small businesses.
				 
				“Democrats knew this was never about COVID relief or helping small businesses,” said Dr. Paul. “It was a shameless attempt to fund their radical agenda on the taxpayers’ backs and I was successful in preventing that from happening by stopping these funds from going to abortion mills.”
				 BACKGROUND:
				Under the House passed version of the bill, individual Planned Parenthood locations would be treated as separate and distinct entities, being eligible for federal assistance under the PPP. The original congressional intent of PPP was to limit large and well-financed groups, such as Planned Parenthood from receiving a loan, and instead provide relief to small business affected by COVID-19. Democrats had planned to waive affiliation rules for nonprofits to provide paycheck protection loans to Planned Parenthood in the House version of the COVID-19 relief package. The Paul team strenuously argued to the Senate Parliamentarian that this waiver would only benefit Planned Parenthood and thus violated the so-called Byrd rule.  Before the Parliamentarian was able to rule on the arguments presented, the Democrats filed an updated version of the bill that did not include the offending provision – a concession that avoided setting a precedent.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/icymi-dr-rand-paul-continues-efforts-return-war-powers-congress," FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:March 4, 2021 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), in a continuation of his longtime efforts to return war making powers to Congress, joined several of his fellow Senators in reintroducing bipartisan legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq. The bill would formally end the authorizations for the Gulf and Iraq wars – 30 and 19 years, respectively, after these AUMFs were first passed, reasserting Congress’ vital role in not only declaring wars, but in ending them.The repeal of these authorizations also recognizes the strong partnership the United States now has with a sovereign, democratic Iraq. The bill was reintroduced by Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Todd Young (R-IN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Dick Durbin (D-IL). Since his first day in office, Senator Paul has been fighting to reassert congressional authority over war powers. As far back as 2011, he introduced amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) focused on putting an end to the current permissions granted after 9/11 which have been abused by presidents of both parties for years. “For years I’ve led the fight to return war making powers back to Congress where they belong, and I’m proud to continue those efforts by joining a bipartisan group of Senators in reintroducing this legislation,” said Dr. Paul. “It’s long past time that we respect the balance of power and reassert Congress’ voice by forcing legislators to specifically approve or disapprove of the direction of our foreign policy.” “Last week’s airstrikes in Syria show that the Executive Branch, regardless of party, will continue to stretch its war powers,” Kaine said. “Congress has a responsibility to not only vote to authorize new military action, but to repeal old authorizations that are no longer necessary. The 1991 and 2002 AUMFs that underpinned the war against Iraq need to be taken off the books to prevent their future misuse. They serve no operational purpose, keep us on permanent war footing, and undermine the sovereignty of Iraq, a close partner. I call on Congress to promptly take up this measure and for the Biden Administration to support it to finally show the American people that the Article I and II branches can work together on these issues.” “It has been thirty years since the first Gulf War began and nineteen years since the United States went back into Iraq. In the years since, Congress has been operating on autopilot when it comes to our essential duties to authorize the use of military force. The fact that authorities for both of these wars are still law today is illustrative of the bipartisan failure of Congress to perform its constitutionally-mandated oversight role,” Young said. “Today, Senator Tim Kaine and I have re-introduced our bipartisan legislation to continue our fight to repeal these outdated war authorities. Congress must not shy away from this debate and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to advance this important legislation.”  “One of Congress’s most solemn constitutional responsibilities is deciding when and how we choose to send America’s sons and daughters into danger overseas,” Duckworth said. “As a nation, we are long over-due to have a thorough and honest reckoning about responsibly exercising Congressional war powers, which includes repealing outdated authorities like the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs. For decades, administrations of both parties have kept these authorizations on the books to justify military action in the region without returning to Congress to make their best legal case for the need for such action. I’m proud to join this bipartisan resolution that would repeal these outdated war authorities and I hope we can work in a bipartisan way to address war powers.”  “Congress has a responsibility to not only declare war but also to bring conflicts to a close,” Lee said. “As demonstrated by presidents from both political parties, when authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) remain on the books long past a conflict’s conclusion they become ripe for abuse, expanding far beyond congressional intent. Closing out U.S. authorizations for war in Iraq is long overdue, and Congress owes it to the men and women who sacrificed blood and treasure to declare victory and come home.”    “The airstrikes against Iranian-backed forces in Syria last week demonstrate the need to review and revise the way in which our leaders collectively choose whether or not to wage war. An initial yet important part of that process is removing unnecessary war-making resolutions that are still on the books,” Coons said. “I’m proud to join Senator Kaine in this bipartisan effort to repeal the 1991 and 2002 AUMFs, and I look forward to working with the Biden Administration and my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee to ensure Congress plays its rightful role in future decisions about the use of force.”  This bill is an effort to prevent the future misuse of the expired Gulf and Iraq War authorizations and strengthen Congressional oversight over war powers.  You can read the bill text HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

Although the Founders included the principle of the separation of powers as a central feature of our government, an emergency, such as a military invasion of the United States, can justify the suspension of the constitutional order so that the president can protect the nation immediately and without congressional authorization.  The REPUBLIC Act will continue to allow the president to take immediate action in necessary situations but also require expeditious and continual congressional review of declared national emergencies to ensure that the separation of powers is preserved. “The REPUBLIC Act strengthens the separation of powers by instituting critical reforms, including requiring Congress to specifically approve of a national emergency declaration in a timely fashion instead of being forced to disapprove of an overreach by supermajority, as well as preventing a president from taking over the internet and other means of communication,” said Sen. Paul. “It does all this while preserving the president’s authority to act immediately to defend our nation.” “Checks and balances are a bedrock principle of American democracy. Congress cannot allow any White House to declare phony emergencies just to get around the legislative progress envisioned by the Constitution. The REPUBLIC Act would reassert Congress’ role as a coequal branch of government, while still allowing a President to address real emergencies without abusing their authority,” said Sen. Wyden. The REPUBLIC Act would:     •    Permit the president to take emergency action for no more than 72 hours without congressional approval;        ◦    Under current law, the burden is on Congress to pass a joint resolution of disapproval if it finds that a president has misused his authority to declare a national emergency.        ◦    By imposing a requirement for approval, the REPUBLIC Act would empower the people’s representatives to combat misuse of presidential emergency powers.    •    Establish expedited procedures by which Congress would consider a joint resolution of approval;    •    Sunset congressionally approved national emergencies 90 days after the issuance of the presidential declaration, unless renewed;    •    Exempt the president’s powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) from the amendments made by this legislation to allow the president to immediately impose and sustain sanctions on our foreign adversaries. By carving out IEEPA, the REPUBLIC Act will not require Congress to vote every 90 days to continue sanctions on North Korea, Iran, transnational crime organizations, etc.;    •    Repeal the statutory authority empowering a president to unilaterally control communications, such as the internet, cell phone service, and television/radio broadcasts; and    •    Terminate all existing national emergencies that do not specify IEEPA as the source of presidential authority.  You can read the REPUBLIC Act HERE.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

	“The National Right to Work Act ensures all American workers have the ability to choose to refrain from joining or paying dues to a union as a condition for employment.” said Dr. Paul. “Kentucky and 26 other states have already passed right to work laws.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-introduces-%E2%80%98three-penny-plan-balanced-budget%E2%80%99,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
	February 4, 2021
	 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343 WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced his own “Three Penny Plan” federal budget that will balance within five years by assuming the repeal of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2021 and utilizing the “Three Penny Plan.” Dr. Paul’s budget includes instructions that would pave the way for the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to help Americans more easily cover their health care costs.
	 
	“When I started offering these kinds of budgets four years ago, we could balance with a freeze in spending. Not cut anything, then we went to just a penny, then two, now it is three,” said Dr. Paul. “We cannot keep ignoring this problem, this budget sets a goal for balance and provides Congress with necessary tools to achieve that objective.”
	 
	“Senator Rand Paul has long been a champion of balancing the federal budget and protecting the American taxpayer,” said Frontiers of Freedom President George Landrith. “Too often opponents of fiscal responsibility argue that to balance the budget would require draconian cuts. But Senator Paul’s proposal only requires a budget cut of 3 pennies on the dollar each year for the next five years and then limits spending increases thereafter by 2 percent per year.”
	 
	“Senators should support Rand Paul’s balanced budget plan to expand HSAs, reject tax hikes, and reduce spending by 3 pennies for every dollar,” said Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist.
	 
	“I’m glad to see Senator Rand Paul continue his work to address the rampant growth in federal spending and the national debt,” said American Legislative Exchange Council Chief Economist Jonathan Williams.
	 
	Council for Citizens Against Government Waste also released a letter urging Senators to support Dr. Paul’s amendment.
	 
	Dr. Paul’s plan requires that for every on-budget dollar the federal government spends in Fiscal Year 2021, it spends three pennies fewer each year for the next five years. Senator Paul’s proposal doesn’t change anything about Social Security, but reduces spending by $67.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 and by $7.2 trillion over ten years.

	February 4, 2021
	 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, in a continuation of his efforts to rebuild our bridges and roads here at home, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced two amendments that would prioritize funding for Kentucky and the nation’s critical infrastructure projects. By redirecting just one percent of non-infrastructure spending and funds from certain foreign aid development programs to domestic projects, these amendments would ensure more of Kentuckians’ hard earned tax dollars are spent on important projects in their own backyards and communities.
	 Senate Amendment #377 – This amendment would initially redirect 1% of non-infrastructure spending to infrastructure projects, providing an almost $60 billion in additional funds this year, and more than $450 billion over 10 years. With these funds redirected, infrastructure projects such as the Brent-Spence Bridge – which has been an issue concerning Kentuckians for over a decade – could finally receive the funding it so desperately needs. 
	 Senate Amendment #441 – This amendment redirects money from Foreign Economic Development programs to domestic infrastructure projects in the U.S. This provides an additional $26 billion this year, with an additional $263 billion over the next 10 years.
	 
	“I know how important these infrastructure projects are, and I want to ensure Kentucky isn't hurt or left behind by a Congress who can't figure out how to put our communities' needs first. Kentucky shouldn't suffer because Washington is unwilling to cut less-important spending,” said Dr. Paul. “My amendments would ensure more of your hard-earned tax dollars are allocated to infrastructure projects right here in your communities, not sent overseas or spent on wasteful programs.”
	 
	Sen. Paul has long been a champion on the issue of prioritizing Kentucky’s infrastructure projects, and in past years he has introduced his similar Penny Plan for Infrastructure as both stand-alone legislation and as an amendment.

Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb.”
	 
	The Defund Planned Parenthood Act would ensure federal tax dollars aren’t going to organizations, like Planned Parenthood, to perform abortions.Cosponsors for the bill include Sens. Blackburn (R-TN), Braun (R-IN), Kennedy (R-LA), Marshall (R-KS), Rounds (R-SD), Tillis (R-NC).

	The Life at Conception Act ensures the 14th Amendment protections on the right to life are truly guaranteed for all human beings, including the unborn in all stages of development. Cosponsors for the bill include Sens. Blackburn (R-TN), Braun (R-IN), Cramer (R-ND), Crapo (R-ID), Daines (R-MT), Inhofe (R-OK), Kennedy (R-LA), Marshall (R-KS), Risch (R-ID), Rounds (R-SD), Scott (R-SC), Thune (R-SD), Wicker (R-MS).

Grassley (R-IA), Portman (R-OH), Rick Scott (R-FL), Rubio (R-FL), Inhofe (R-OK), Young (R-IN), Moran (R-KS), Rounds (R-SD), Cramer (R-ND), Blunt (R-MO), Ernst (R-IA), Sullivan (R-AK), Blackburn (R-TN), Toomey (R-PA), Sasse (R-NE), Lee (R-UT), Cassidy (R-LA), Marshall (R-KS), Braun (R-IN), Cruz (R-TX), Johnson (R-WI), Risch (R-ID), Crapo (R-ID), and Hyde-Smith (R-MS).“For too long, an ever-growing federal bureaucracy has piled regulations and red tape on the backs of the American people without any approval by Americans’ elected representatives,” said Dr. Paul. “By making Congress more accountable for the most costly and intrusive federal rules, the REINS Act would give Kentuckians and citizens throughout the country a greater voice in determining whether these major rules are in America’s best interests.”“Unelected bureaucrats in Washington have far too much unaccountable power over the American people. The REINS Act would give Congress the authority to reject any federal government regulation with costs over $100 million, thus giving Americans an important check on federal regulators,” said Senator Mike Lee. “We’ve already seen this new administration is full steam ahead on enacting their radical agenda through executive action. The REINS Act is a common-sense piece of legislation that would ensure Congress has a say in any new major regulation that would have a significant economic effect of $100 million or more. We must ensure that unaccountable and unelected regulators do not hamper our economy with burdensome regulations as we try to come back from the hardship caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus,” said Senator Roger Marshall, M.D.“The rise of the administrative state cannot go unchecked. When agency rule makers bypass Congressional review, the agenda of unelected bureaucrats dominates over the interests of American businesses and workers. This legislation will ensure greater accountability for executive rulemaking at time when agencies are growing especially emboldened to flex their regulatory powers.” said Senator Blackburn.“We have made significant progress reining in costly, job-killing regulations since I first introduced the REINS Act in the House eight years ago, but as we enter a new administration, it is more important than ever that we pass this legislation,” said Senator Young. “Congress must play a role in approving major federal rules and regulations to ensure Americans’ best interests are being considered by elected officials who can be held accountable, not just unelected bureaucrats in Washington.”“In recent decades Congress has largely abdicated its duty and deferred major policy decisions to federal agencies and the unelected bureaucrats who run them. This has created significant problems for our constituents and made Washington less accountable to the people we serve,” said Senator Cramer. “The REINS Act gives Congress more authority over the decisions made by the bureaucracy and will spur Congress to write better bills.”“For far too long I have said we must not only cut through the red tape, but also ensure those in the Executive Branch are held to the highest level of transparency and accountability,” Senator Inhofe said. “With the REINS Act, Congress would have a voice in approving major rules created by the Executive Branch. It’s past time we rein in unelected government officials, so that we can reduce the harmful effects of their overregulation.” “Regulatory agencies play an important role in executing the laws Congress writes, but for too long, Congress has ceded too much authority to the agencies. I am pleased to support the REINS Act, which would help restore Congress to its appropriate place in the lawmaking process by ensuring it has the chance to review the most significant and costly regulations,” said Senator Portman.The bill defines a “major” rule as one that the Office of Management and Budget determines may result in an economic impact of $100 million or greater each year; “a major increase in costs or prices” for American consumers, government agencies, regions, or industries; or “significant adverse effects” on the economy.Under the REINS Act, once major rules are drafted, they must then be affirmatively approved by both chambers of Congress and then signed by the President, satisfying the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution. Currently, regulations ultimately take effect unless Congress specifically disapproves.You can read the bill—S. 68 in the 117th Congress—in its entirety HERE.###

	January 6, 2021Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343
	  WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) released the following statement on the loss of his long-time senior adviser and former State Director Jim Milliman, who passed away after long-term complications due to a previous stroke:
	 
	“Kelley and I, and our entire team, are heartbroken over the loss of our dear friend, my long-time adviser and former State Director, Jim Milliman. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Nan and all those who had the honor of knowing Jim. He was a great American, proud Kentuckian, loyal teammate, and loving husband. He will be truly missed,” said Dr. Paul.
	 
	For your reference, below is the transcript of remarks Dr. Paul gave on the floor of the Senate when Mr. Milliman retired from the State Director position in October of 2019 and transitioned into a senior adviser role.  You can view the video HERE.
	 Sen. Rand Paul Honors Longtime State Director Jim Milliman - Oct. 29, 2019
	 “I rise today to honor and pay tribute to one of the most tenacious and dedicated Kentuckians I’ve had the pleasure of knowing, Mr. Jim Milliman.
	 
	“Jim began his career in 1964, after graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1964. He subsequently graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Louisville Law School in 1970.
	 
	“He married Nan Milliman, and they made their home in Louisville, KY. They have been married for 48 years.
	 
	“When I first met Jim, I knew him as one of Kentucky’s finest attorneys, who represented Brown & Williamson during their tobacco litigation and the state Republicans in election law matters. I knew him as an accomplished managing partner of the Louisville-based law firm, Middleton Reutlinger.
	 
	“And I knew him as the fiery conservative co-host who often sat opposite Congressman John Yarmuth on WAVE 3 TV’s political show “Hot Button” for spirited debates.
	 
	“After over 40 successful years in commercial litigation, and numerous awards from his peers, such as being named one of the top 50 attorneys in Kentucky, Jim decided to retire….  From the law at least.
	 
	“In 2010, right after I was elected to the Senate, I went out on a limb, and I asked Jim to come back out of retirement to be my State Director for Kentucky. I am truly grateful that he said yes, because for nearly a decade, Jim has served in that role and been one of my most trusted advisers.
	 
	“Anyone who knows Jim knows that he is a force to be reckoned with. He is fiercely loyal, a real problem solver, and a highly accomplished legal mind. Moreover, he is an incredibly kind person who cares deeply about his friends and colleagues.
	 
	“When I ran for President, Jim spearheaded the approval of a caucus for Kentucky so I would not be kept from the ballot for President and the U.S. Senate.
	 
	“Recently, Jim has decided to transition from the daily State Director duties into more of an advisory role.
	 
	“Considering he tried to retire over 10 years ago, I think it’s well deserved! No matter in what capacity, I will always be thankful to have Jim as a part of my team, as an ally and adviser.
	 
	“He has dedicated so much of his time to the pursuit of liberty and freedom… to defending the principles that made this nation great… to supporting a pro-Kentucky policy agenda.
	 
	“Thank you, Jim, for your service to Kentucky and this country.
	 
	“I yield the floor.”###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

It’s wrong and un-American. “The vote we are about to cast is important. “Now more than ever. “The question is: “Should Congress override the certified results from the states and nullify the states’ right to conduct elections? “The vote today is not a protest; the vote today is literally to overturn the election! “Voting to overturn state-certified elections would be the opposite of what states’ rights Republicans have always advocated for. “This would doom the electoral college forever. “It was never intended by our founders that Congress have the power to overturn state-certified elections. “My oath to the Constitution doesn’t allow me to disobey the law. I cannot vote to overturn the verdict of the states. “Such a vote would be to overturn everything held dear by those of us who support the rights of states in this great system of federalism bequeathed to us by our founders. “The electoral college was created to devolve the power of selecting presidential electors to the states. “The electoral college is, without question, an inseparable friend to those who believe that every American across our vast country deserves to be heard. “If Congress were given the power to overturn the states’ elections . . . what terrible chaos would ensue. “Imagine the furor against the electoral college if Congress becomes a forum to overturn states’ electoral college slates. “It is one thing to be angry. It is another to focus one’s anger in a constructive way. That hasn’t happened today, to say the least. We simply cannot destroy the Constitution, our laws, and the electoral college in the process. I hope as the nation’s anger cools, we can channel that energy into essential electoral reforms in every state. “America is admired around the world for our free elections. We must, we absolutely must, fix this mess and restore confidence and integrity to our elections.”###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-introduces-hemp-act-relieve-unnecessary-constraints-hemp-industry-provide,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
	December 15, 2020
	 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) continued his efforts to address Kentucky hemp farmers’ concerns with federal overreach and bring clarity, transparency, and certainty to regulation by introducing the Hemp Economic Mobilization Plan (HEMP) Act of 2020.
	 
	In response to concerns raised by Kentucky hemp farmers and processors, Dr. Paul’s HEMP Act would change the legal definition of hemp to raise the THC limit from 0.3% to 1%. Currently, any hemp crops testing above 0.3% have to be destroyed.
	 
	The legislation would require testing of the final hemp-derived product instead of the hemp flower or plant itself, as the 15-day window for testing the hemp flower or plant does not take potential testing backlogs, lack of personnel to collect samples, harvesting time, or environmental factors that farmers cannot control into account.
	 
	Dr. Paul’s HEMP Act would also protect legitimate hemp farmers, processors, and transporters by requiring hemp shipments to contain a copy of the seed certificate showing the hemp was grown from 1% THC seed, and it would address current uncertainty by defining a margin of error for testing THC levels. Neither current law nor the USDA’s interim final rule provide such a margin.
	  
	“For years, I’ve led the fight in Washington to restore one of Kentucky’s most historically vital crops by legalizing industrial hemp. We achieved a hard-won victory, but there is still work to do to prevent the federal government from weighing down our farmers with unnecessary bureaucratic micromanaging. My legislation will help this growing industry reach its full economic potential, and I am proud the bill has strong support all the way from local Kentucky farmers and activists to national groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation,” said Dr. Paul.
	 
	“The U.S. hemp industry has had its share of roadblocks, but we continue to push forward and make changes that will help hemp producers thrive. Senator Paul's HEMP Act has the potential to improve upon the highest priority issues for hemp growers, processors, and labs, while making sure to keep our consumers safe as well. We are grateful for the continued support from our federal delegation and ask that folks at home call their Congressional representatives to ask for their support,” said Katie Moyer, Owner of Kentucky Hemp Works. 
	 
	""We are so excited to hear about Senator Paul's H.E.M.P. Act, which will help farmers, processors and retailers in our young hemp industry. We believe that loosening up some important interstate business requirements are a much-needed step toward more prosperous times in the hemp economy,” said Kentucky Hemp Association President Tate Hall and Vice President Jana Groda. 
	 
	“We appreciate Sen. Paul’s leadership and support for hemp farmers in Kentucky and across the United States. The HEMP Act makes critical improvements that will better allow farmers to successfully grow and profit from hemp,” said Vote Hemp President Eric Steenstra.
	 
	Dr. Paul has been a leading voice for removing government restrictions on hemp, and his past efforts, including championing legislation, testifying before the Kentucky legislature, and advocating for Kentucky farmers in Washington, have helped ensure Kentucky can rebuild its hemp industry and push forward to a prosperous future. You can find a video detailing his efforts HERE.

	December 11, 2020
	 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) reintroduced the Government Shutdown Prevention Act under Rule 14 to make it available for quick consideration. The bill incentivizes Congress to properly consider and debate spending legislation in the future, as it is the only shutdown prevention plan that immediately cuts spending if an agreement is not reached.
	 
	Instead of Congress risking government shutting down operations, Dr. Paul’s plan would keep government open but institute a one-percent cut to then-current funding levels for any agency, program, and activity that Congress failed to fund by the start of the fiscal year (October 1). Funding would be reduced by another one percent every 90 days thereafter that an agreement is still not enacted.
	 
	“My Government Shutdown Prevention Act would help ensure Congress starts hitting its deadlines, making it a more responsible steward of the American people’s resources,” said Dr. Paul.
	 
	Currently, Congress does not face any consequences for failing to pass appropriations bills on time, which has helped lead to it pursuing procrastination over prudence and risking shutdowns due to impasses.
	 
	Along with ensuring government honors its obligations and maintains its operations, Dr. Paul’s proposal would give agencies the certainty of knowing that, in a worst-case scenario, they will always be able to operate with a full year of funding at no less than 96 percent of their then-current levels.

	December 10, 2020
	 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) condemned a provision in the U.S. House-passed 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that is aimed at preventing President Trump from withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and that could instead extend the war indefinitely. Dr. Paul specifically called out the hypocrisy of those who would at any other time argue for virtually unlimited presidential power to start a war without congressional authorization now seeking to prevent a president from ending one.
	 
	Currently, language in the 2021 NDAA would tie the president’s hands in red tape before troops could be withdrawn and the war ended. It would also cut off funding for those aims in the meantime.
	 
	“The hawks and the neocons somehow want you to believe, in contrast to all logic, that the President of the United States has the unitary power to go to war anytime he wants, anywhere, free from interference from Congress. That’s their stated position anytime war comes up. Yet, today, in the NDAA, they say they now want a president that cannot leave a war without their permission,” said Dr. Paul. 
	 
	“This Defense Authorization bill could more aptly be called, ‘A Bill to Prevent the President from Ending the Afghan War,’” he later observed.

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/icymi-dr-rand-paul-urges-senate-block-us-arms-sales-united-arab-emirates,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:December 9, 2020 Contact: Press@paul.senate.gov, 202-224-4343WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Rand Paul (R-KY) urged the U.S. Senate to support two bipartisan joint resolutions of disapproval he offered with Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) to block proposed U.S. arms sales to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The sale includes 50 F-35A fighter jets (costing an estimated $10.4 billion), 18 MQ-9B drones (costing an estimated $2.97 billion), and Hellfire missiles, among other weapons and associated training and support. Currently, Israel is the only country in the Middle East that has the F-35.In his speech, Dr. Paul cited his concerns with the UAE’s record on attacking free speech in the country, discussed the humanitarian crisis the Saudi-UAE coalition helped create in Yemen, and talked about a report that some of the weapons and vehicles that were sent to the coalition ended up in the hands of terrorists.Dr. Paul stated his support for the recent advance toward peace between Israel and the UAE in his speech, but he asked, “Can a lasting peace be purchased with more weapons? Will selling sophisticated fighter jets and weaponized drones bring more stability to the Middle East?”Regarding concerns about how the sales will impact Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge (QME), Dr. Paul observed, “The easiest way, if you favor protecting Israel’s QME, or military edge, is to stop sending military assets to other countries in the region.”“I would urge my colleagues to consider the possible consequences of this sale. We should not accelerate an arms race in the Middle East. We should not jeopardize the security of our military technologies, and we should not reward a decade-plus of undesirable behavior by the UAE,” Dr. Paul said.You can watch Dr. Paul’s speech HERE.Unfortunately, a majority of the Senate chose to support the sales, further fueling a Middle East arms race.The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 provides the special procedures whereby a senator can force a vote on an arms sale, and, over the past several years, Dr. Paul has led multiple efforts to stop the sale of U.S. weapons and equipment to Saudi Arabia and other nations that have been involved in the devastating war in Yemen.###Contact one of my officesMain State Office

https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/icymi-dr-rand-paul-holds-hearing-state-and-local-cybersecurity-during-pandemic,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management (FSO) Subcommittee for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), held a hearing on “State and Local Cybersecurity: Defending Our Communities from Cyber Threats Amid COVID-19.”
				 
				“Effective cybersecurity is an ongoing, everyday line of effort. The threat landscape is diverse. The best practices are constantly changing. The information you get may not always be reliable. The maintenance tasks can seem overwhelming, and, most importantly, the stakes are high. And in this context, I have often found myself thinking: effective cybersecurity cannot move at quote ‘the speed of government,’” Dr. Paul said in his opening statement.
				 
				As Americans continue to conduct more of their activities online due to the pandemic, including going virtual for school and sensitive needs such as consultations with physicians, the subcommittee hearing examined cybersecurity threats faced by state and local governments, with a focus on concerns about ransomware attacks/cyber extortion in critical sectors such as health care and public education.
				 
				Over the past several months, a number of school districts around the country have been victims of ransomware attacks, including Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia — one of the largest public school districts in the country. Unfortunately, Fairfax County Public Schools declined to appear at the hearing or to give a reason for turning down the opportunity.
				 
				Earlier this year, the first day of school for Hartford Public Schools in Connecticut had to be postponed due to a ransomware attack, and, just this week, Baltimore County Public Schools were forced to close for multiple days for the same reason.
				 
				On September 17, the Associated Press reported that a Düsseldorf, Germany, woman died en route to a hospital in a neighboring city because the hospital in Düsseldorf had been taken off-line by a ransomware attack.
				  
				While this hearing was originally scheduled for September 22, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) forced its postponement by blocking the Senate from conducting committee business in protest of President Donald Trump’s then-upcoming selection of future Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
				 
				In an example of how Washington should function, Dr. Paul worked in close cooperation with subcommittee Ranking Member Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) to craft the hearing.
