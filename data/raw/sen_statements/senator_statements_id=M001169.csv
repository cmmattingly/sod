https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-tillis-introduce-the-consensual-donation-and-research-integrity-act,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senators
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Thursday
introduced the Consensual Donation and Research Integrity Act,
legislation to protect the dignity of those who donate their bodies to
education or research. Specifically, it would create standards for
registration, inspection, chain of custody, labeling and packing, and proper
disposition to ensure donated bodies are not unknowingly contributed to a
for-profit industry in which body brokers take advantage of donors and their
families. While the process for donating a body for the purpose of
transplantation is highly regulated and transparent, there is no federal law
governing the donating of a body or body parts for research or educational
uses.  “The exploitation of bodies
that have been donated for education or research is deeply disturbing and
heartbreaking for the families who expect their loved one’s remains to be
treated with dignity. For too long, an unregulated industry has allowed body
brokers to profit off donor bodies and their grieving families,
disproportionally impacting the poor and elderly. This legislation would
increase accountability and transparency and stop bad actors from committing
these gross abuses,” said Murphy.""Most Americans would be
shocked to learn that there is a for-profit body broker industry that creates
significant ethical dilemmas and public health threats because of a lack of
regulation,"" said Tillis.
""Our bipartisan legislation will introduce much-needed accountability and
regulatory oversight to protect public health and ensure that donors and their
families are treated with respect and dignity.""“It’s hard to imagine in this
day and age, that whole body donation isn’t regulated,” said National
Funeral Directors Association President Randall P. “Randy” Anderson, CFSP, CCO.
“What’s even harder to hear are the stories from families that have
experienced heartbreak and grief when they discovered the bodies of their loved
ones has been desecrated and sold – sometimes repeatedly – by body brokers. NFDA
and its members strongly urge the Senate and House to pass the CDRI Act and
provide long-overdue accountability and transparency to the whole-body donation
process. This will help ensure donors’ bodies are treated with dignity and
respect at all times.”“NFDA is grateful to Sens.
Murphy and Tillis for introducing this important legislation in the Senate and
call on both houses of Congress to prevent families from enduring the heartache
that far too many have already endured by passing this bill,” said National
Funeral Directors Association CEO Christine Pepper, CAE. “In doing so, we
can put a stop to the anguish that far too many families have experienced at
the hands of body brokers.”Full text of the bill is
available here.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-statement-on-republican-filibuster-of-the-disclose-act,"WASHINGTON–U.S Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Thursday released the following statement after
Senate Republicans blocked consideration of the Democracy Is Strengthened by
Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act (DISCLOSE), legislation to
require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their
donors:“This feels pretty basic – for democracy to work, Americans have to know
who is behind the millions and millions of dollars being spent to block
progress on lowering health care costs, tackling climate change, protecting
reproductive rights, and making sure big corporations pay their fair share.
Billionaires and special interests pour money into American politics, picking
winners and losers while hiding their identities behind innocuously-named
political action committees. This is terrible for our nation. The DISCLOSE Act
would lift this veil of secrecy and let the American public see who is
responsible for the uncontrolled spending that poisons our politics. It’s
disappointing – albeit
unsurprising – that Republicans blocked a commonsense way to bring
greater transparency to elections,” said Murphy.###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-after-four-years-of-failed-maximum-pressure-in-iran-we-know-were-better-off-with-a-nuclear-agreement,"WASHINGTON–U.S Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism and a
member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, on Wednesday spoke on the
U.S. Senate floor to highlight the failures of Trump’s maximum pressure
campaign in Iran and explain why reaching a new nuclear agreement is critical
to the security of the United States and our allies.On the failed policy of four
years of maximum pressure in Iran, Murphy said: “Not only did Iran not come
to the table on everything, they came to the table on nothing. Their behavior
in the region got much worse and much more adversarial to U.S. Interests. Just
look at the reality on the ground, in a place like Lebanon, or Yemen or Iraq or
Syria. At the end of Trump's term, did Iran have more or less influence in
those places? Unquestionably more. More integrated with the Houthis. By the end
of Trump's term they were in charge of the Lebanese government. There was less
separation between the Iraqi power structure and Tehran. At the end of that
four year period of time testing maximum pressure, Iran was more deeply
involved with its proxies than ever before. They were not negotiating with the
United States on any of the conditions that the Trump administration laid down
for us. And they were shooting at us.Murphy added: “And so I'm
not sure why we have to do a lot of guessing now as to whether we're better off
with or without a nuclear agreement with Iran. Because here's what we got from
maximum pressure: American troops under fire, more support for proxies, no
hopes of negotiation, and the icing on the cake, an Iranian nuclear program
that is now weeks away from having enough fissile material to produce a nuclear
weapon. Compare that with a year away during the time of the agreement.”“We just see what [the
Iranian government is] doing right now on the streets of Tehran, brutally
repressing another wave of protests. We listen to what the
[Iranian] President said on TV just this week, denying the Holocaust. These
are our adversaries. This is our enemy. But all throughout American history
we’ve understood that there are times when it makes sense to sit down across
the table with your enemy and your adversary and engage in a diplomatic
conversation that's good for you and good for the world,” Murphy concluded.A full transcript of his
remarks can be found below:“Reserving the right to
object, I have such respect for my colleague from Oklahoma. We’ve are often on
the same side of issues related to matters of national security in the Middle
East. But I disagree with his analysis that he's presented here today. Let me
make just a remark or two about his immediate request and then make a few
remarks about the broader work to try to protect the world from a nuclear
weapons armed Iran.“First, as I understand it,
and I've just had a few days to take a look at the underlying legislation, it
would significantly remove the administration's discretion to waive sanctions
or to enter into certain oil sales or authorized business with Iranian
financial institutions in that only a treaty entered into by the United States
would provide that authority to the administration. I think that's generally
bad policy.“We can imagine we can
imagine a whole set of diplomatic engagements with any nation including Iran,
in which an executive may wish to toggle sanctions or licenses in order to
provoke some behavior beneficial to the United States. That's in fact why we regularly
build waivers into our sanctions statutes. And so to suggest that on Iran
policy, the president is going to have no ability to impact sanctions or
licenses until a treaty is entered into ties the administration’s hands - both
Republican and Democratic administrations in a way that I simply don't think is
helpful.“I understand that my
friend’s argument - he was not a supporter of the JCPOA and he does not desire
for the United States to enter back into a nuclear agreement with Iran. And at
the heart of this request, is the essence of President Trump's Iran policy. The
idea that if we just keep hammering Iran with sanctions, that either their
behavior will get better or they will, at some point, choose to come to the
table and do a comprehensive deal: the nuclear program, their ballistic missile
program, their support for terrorism.“I think that was a credible
argument back during the Obama administration. Many people said Obama shouldn't
give Iran anything until Iran comes to the table on everything. This Congress
went a different way. We ended up taking a vote that by our rules allowed for
the nuclear agreement to go forward. But we now have the benefit of the
opposition's argument to the JCPOA having been tested for four years.“Trump basically took that
philosophy - Keep sanctioning Iran. Don't worry about the fact that it's unilateral.
And eventually Iran will come to the table on everything - he tested that for
four years. And it was an unmitigated disaster, an unmitigated disaster.“Not only did Iran not come
to the table on everything, they came to the table on nothing. Their behavior
in the region got much worse and much more adversarial to U.S. Interests. Just
look at the reality on the ground, in a place like Lebanon, or Yemen or Iraq or
Syria. At the end of Trump's term, did Iran have more or less influence in
those places? Unquestionably more. More integrated with the Houthis. By the end
of Trump's term they were in charge of the Lebanese government. There was less
separation between the Iraqi power structure and Tehran.“At the end of that four year
period of time testing maximum pressure, Iran was more deeply involved with its
proxies than ever before. They were not negotiating with the United States on
any of the conditions that the Trump administration laid down for us. And they
were shooting at us.“Not a single attack on U.S.
service members by Iranian proxies while the United States is in the JCPOA. Let
me say it again: not a single attack on U.S. service members by Iranian proxies
when the United States was in the JCPOA. They occur with regularity today. Attacks
against U.S. forces housed in bases in Iraq and Syria restarted once we
withdrew from the deal. In this year alone, there have been attacks in
February, March, April, May, June, July, and August.“And so I'm not sure why we
have to do a lot of guessing now as to whether we're better off with or without
a nuclear agreement with Iran. Because here's what we got from maximum
pressure: American troops under fire, more support for proxies, no hopes of
negotiation, and the icing on the cake, an Iranian nuclear program that is now
weeks away from having enough fissile material to produce a nuclear weapon.
Compare that with a year away during the time of the agreement.“So we tested this theory
that you just hit them with sanctions, him them with sanctions, and eventually
they capitulate. It didn't work by I think, all objective measures it didn't
work and so it makes sense that the Biden administration wants to engage and
try to put back together a deal that was good for the United States and our
allies.“And lastly, I'll just say
this. The senator from Oklahoma is right. The Iranians are bad people. We just
see what [the Iranian government is] doing right now on the streets of Tehran,
brutally repressing another wave of protests. We listen to what the [Iranian]
President said on TV just this week, denying the Holocaust. These are our
adversaries. This is our enemy. But all throughout American history we’ve
understood that there are times when it makes sense to sit down across the
table with your enemy and your adversary and engage in a diplomatic
conversation that's good for you and good for the world.“It is true if Iran was
further away from a nuclear weapon, it'd be good for us and it'd be good for
other countries, including Russia, which is why Russia is sometimes part of
these negotiations. But I don't know that because something's good for
everybody, it shouldn't be acceptable to the United States Congress.“And so I'm going to object
to this request because I believe that the JCPOA is the right thing for the
security of this nation. Because I believe in diplomacy even with your
adversaries. Because I think we have tested the proposition that maximum
pressure will work better than a nuclear agreement and we now know the results.
And I also believe that some of the details of this resolution ultimately bind
the hands of American presidents in a way that probably isn't good precedent
for the long term security of the nation.“So again, I think my
colleague comes to the to the floor with good faith objections and long
standing objections. I come down in a different place and for that reason, I
would object.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-applauds-senate-ratification-of-the-kigali-amendment-phasing-out-use-of-hydrofluorocarbons,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday released the following statement after
the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol,
which affirms U.S. commitment to phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. HFCs are highly potent greenhouse gases
that trap heat in the atmosphere 1,000 times more effectively than carbon
dioxide:“Phasing out harmful HFCs
is not only good for the planet – it’s good for American business and will
ensure we maintain a competitive edge on the global market. Super pollutants
are some the most aggressive contributors to climate change, and we need to do
more to address these dangerous chemicals head on. It’s taken too long for the
United States to join the 137 other countries who have already ratified the
Kigali Amendment, but with today’s action coupled with the Inflation Reduction
Act, America is once again leading the fight against climate change,” said Murphy.In 2016, Murphy urged Secretary of State John Kerry and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy to take a strong position
to rapidly phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) at the 28th Meeting
of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda, and he hailed
the adoption of the amendment. Murphy sponsored the Super
Pollutants Act of 2019 along with U.S. Senator Susan Collins
(R-Maine), which aims to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants
like HFCs.###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-bonamici-introduce-bicameral-resolution-designating-malnutrition-awareness-week,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Suzanne Bonamici
(D-Ore-1) on Wednesday introduced a resolution designating the week of
September 19 through September 23, 2022, as “Malnutrition Awareness Week.”
Malnutrition is a significant problem in the United States and around the world
that occurs when a person does not get enough nutrients.  Malnutrition
disproportionally impacts children.  In 2021, five million American
children lived in food-insecure households. Additionally, disease-associated malnutrition in older adults costs the United
States more than $51.3 billion each year. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal
(D-Conn.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maggie Hassan
(D-N.H), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) co-sponsored the
resolution.The resolution
recognizes registered dietitian nutritionists and other nutrition professionals,
health care providers, social workers, and advocates for their efforts to
advance awareness and to prevent malnutrition. It also recognizes the
inextricable link between poverty and malnutrition, and the disproportionate
affect felt by communities of color.“Malnutrition has serious
implications for health outcomes, and it’s an issue that disproportionately
impacts communities of color and the most vulnerable among us – seniors and
kids. Increasing access to healthy, affordable food through federal nutrition
programs is critical to reducing malnutrition and improving quality of life.
I’m proud to introduce this resolution to bring awareness to this serious
problem and highlight those working to address it,” said Murphy.“No one in our country should go hungry, but millions of Americans
are struggling with malnutrition and hunger,” said Bonamici. “Too often the most
vulnerable members of our communities are stuck in a cycle of poverty and
nutritional disparities. Over the years programs like the Older Americans Act
(OAA), Meals on Wheels, SNAP, and school nutrition programs have helped feed
those who need assistance accessing healthy foods. Unfortunately, malnutrition
and food insecurity still affect many, especially seniors; Black, Indigenous, and
people of color; and low-income children and families. This Malnutrition
Awareness Week, we reaffirm our commitment to ending hunger so everyone has
access to the nutrition they need to succeed.” ""There
are millions of children across the country living without access to
sufficient, nutritious food. The devastating impacts of childhood malnutrition
on long-term health and wellness cannot be understated. More must be done to
support federal programs to ensure every child, adult and senior has the
nutritious foods they need to live a long, healthy life. I am proud to
co-sponsor this resolution to raise awareness of the impacts of malnutrition
and to recognize the professionals devoted to providing nutritional care and
access to food for those in need,” said Blumenthal.Full text of the resolution can
be found here.

Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
introduced Justice Maria Araújo Kahn, President Biden’s nominee to fill a
vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, at her confirmation
hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Following today’s hearing,
Justice Kahn’s nomination is expected to receive a vote in the committee and,
if approved, will advance to the full Senate. Maria Araújo Kahn has served as an Associate Justice on the

United States Attorney, as a Deputy Assistant Public Defender for the State of
Connecticut, and as a Staff Attorney in the Connecticut Office of Protection
and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities. During her time as a public
defender, Justice Kahn represented indigent children in delinquency
proceedings. As a Staff Attorney in the Office of Protection and Advocacy,
Justice Kahn litigated civil rights cases on behalf of individuals with
disabilities. As a federal prosecutor, Justice Kahn handled civil and criminal
white collar investigations with a focus on health care fraud, bank fraud, bankruptcy
fraud, and trade secrets.“Justice Kahn has had a long and distinguished career as a member
of the Connecticut legal community, and I am confident that she has the skills,
experience, and temperament to serve as a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. I look forward to voting for her confirmation on the
Senate floor,” said Murphy.“As impressive as her immigrant story, as inspiring as her
accomplishments are her incredible intellect, experience, integrity, and
dedication to public service, She is a judge’s judge. She is deeply and
extraordinarily well-qualified…Her life experience, her depth of compassion and
empathy, as well as her strict adherence and respect for the rule of law will
broaden the quality of our Second Circuit Court of Appeals.” said
Blumenthal.Born in Angola and fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese,
Justice Kahn immigrated to the United States when she was ten years old,
attended New York University for her undergraduate degree and completed her
legal education at the Fordham University School of Law. Justice Kahn is a
former law clerk for the Honorable Peter C. Dorsey of the U.S. District Court
Judge for the District of Connecticut and currently serves as co-chair of the
Judicial Branch’s Access to Justice Commission and the Limited English
Proficiency Committee. Justice Kahn has also taught several courses at the

Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. Just days before the
fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S.
history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding,
unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds.In
2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to
the Trump Administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane
Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster
recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge
of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in
continued frequent and widespread power outages.“Governor
Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto
Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to
approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources
available to respond to this disaster,” said the bicameral
group of lawmakers to President Biden.“Furthermore,
750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are
blocked with debris, and schools are damaged, FEMA Public Assistance is
urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”  the

President Biden,Governor
Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto
Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to
approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources
available to respond to this disaster.Hurricane
Fiona devastated the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented
rainfall, and high-speed winds. The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout,
leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours.
Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have
collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public
Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.In
addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across
the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require
significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance
is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We
thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past
Sunday.In
2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to
the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the
island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery
resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico
Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical
system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages.
These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to
extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably
recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they
urgently need.Given
the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor
Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-cassidy-van-hollen-introduce-legislation-to-improve-neurological-health-research,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senators
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee, Bill Cassidy, M.D., (R-La.), and Chris
Van Hollen (D-Md.), on Wednesday introduced legislation to reauthorize the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Neurological
Conditions Surveillance System (NNCSS) program, which collects data which
collects privacy-protected data on neurological conditions to inform research
and help advance better treatments and cures.Specifically, the legislation
would reauthorize the NNCSS for another five years and increase funding to $10
million starting in FY23 and up to $20 million by FY26. Reauthorization would
allow the program to complete its current work on Multiple Sclerosis and
Parkinson’s and expand to other neurological conditions.“The NNCSS is a critical
program that helps us better understand neurological conditions like Multiple
Sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease, which each impact more than a million
Americans and their families. Their research is key to developing more
effective treatments and ultimately finding a cure for these horrific diseases.
We must continue to support their lifesaving work,” said Murphy.“Hope for cures comes through advances in knowledge.
Let’s create that hope,” said
Cassidy. “This bill supports research
into treatments and cures while protecting patients’ privacy.”“For Americans living with
neurological conditions, like Parkinson’s and MS, good data holds the key to
advancing innovative treatments and cures. That’s why it’s crucial that we
fully fund the NNCSS program for another five years to expand data collection
and research capabilities. This legislation will help millions of patients –
and families – who are impacted by these conditions each year, as we seek to
strengthen our responses to and treatments available for neurological
conditions,” said Van Hollen. “Curing and preventing Parkinson’s
means providing researchers with the most robust information about how the
disease originates and what potential triggers exist here in the United States.
The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is a world-class
engine that is integral to curing Parkinson’s and other neurological
conditions,” said Ted Thompson, JD,
senior vice president of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s
Research. “On behalf of the Parkinson’s community, we call on Congress to
reauthorize the NNCSS so that the world’s best and brightest can have access to
the data and information they need to cure and, one day, prevent
Parkinson’s.  Parkinson’s costs the United States more than $52 billion
every year, and that will grow to at least $80 billion in the next 15 years.
Investing $10 million in FY 2023 in the NNCSS to be able to eventually offset
billions of dollars in the cost for care is a smart investment I hope Congress
will support."" “Brain health
is crucial to individual health. A key way policymakers can improve brain
health is through gathering more data about the incidence and prevalence of
neurologic disease,” said
Orly Avitzur, MD, MBA, FAAN, President of the American Academy of Neurology.
“The National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System has begun to provide
critical insights into Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.  This
legislation will ensure this important project continues and has the resources
to expand to more neurologic conditions over time. Neurologic diseases cost the
United States more than $600 billion each year – we need investments like the
NNCSS to provide essential data to researchers to help improve brain health.”“With a new
study identifying the annual economic burden of multiple sclerosis (MS) at
$85.4 billion, it is more important than ever to provide researchers with
accurate and up-to-date data to lead to answers and a cure for MS,” said Bari Talente, executive vice president of
advocacy and healthcare access at the National MS Society. “The
National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System is positioned to
provide crucial information to researchers working to end MS and
other neurological diseases. MS activists urge Congress to support
the reauthorization and $10 million in federal funding for FY23 of the
NNCSS.”This legislation is endorsed
by the American Academy of Neurology, National Multiple Sclerosis Society,
Michael J. Fox Foundation.Text of the bill is available

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/on-national-voter-registration-day-murphy-blumenthal-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-make-registering-to-vote-easier-for-all-americans,"WASHINGTON–On National Voter Registration Day, U.S. Senators
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) joined 15 of
their colleagues to introduce two pieces of legislation to make it easier for
Americans to register to vote and to know their registration status.The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to
offer same day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during
early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their
Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from
removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained
objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes
notification requirements once a voter is removed. These bills were included as
part of the Freedom to Vote Act.“Democracy only works when
every citizen has the power to make their voice heard. Offering same-day
registration at polling locations just like Connecticut does and preventing the
unjust purge of voters from the rolls are two commonsense ways to make it
easier – not harder – for more Americans to participate in the democratic
process,” said Murphy.“No freedom is more
important than the right to vote. We must protect the sanctity of this
fundamental American freedom, which is why I am proud to co-sponsor this
legislation with many of my Senate colleagues. Connecticut already offers same
day voter registration but more than half of states do not — an unnecessary and
unacceptable barrier that keeps people from voting. Guaranteeing that voters
can register on election day and preventing states from purging their voter rolls
without concrete evidence that the person in question is ineligible to vote,
will make it easier for Americans to cast their ballots and participate in our

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security, on Tuesday released the following statement:“The
Emergency Food and SheIter Program is a vital tool that provides humanitarian
aid to migrants and helps the Border Patrol reduce overcrowding at its
facilities. If Republicans were serious about more effectively managing the
border, they would support increased funding for a program that the Border
Patrol views as critical. Instead, they want chaos, so they cheer on the
Governors of Texas and Florida as they use millions in taxpayer dollars to exploit
desperate and vulnerable people with cruel political stunts. I hope my
Republican colleagues will put politics aside to support funding in the
upcoming CR for a program that provides humanitarian assistance for migrants
and their families,” said
Murphy.In July,
Murphy announced the fiscal year
2023 Homeland Security bill, which includes $200 million for the
Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) to provide funding to non-profit
organizations, critical partners working with DHS to offer food, housing, and
transportation for noncitizens and ultimately reduces pressure on Border Patrol
operational capabilities.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-op-ed-in-modern-healthcare-americas-gun-violence-crisis-fuels-our-mental-health-crisis,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) authored an op-ed
for Modern Healthcare’s congressional health care policy special issue, “What’s
ailing American healthcare?,” to explain the impact of gun violence on
America’s mental health crisis and call on Congress to build upon the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act.“When we talk about the gun violence epidemic, the focus is
usually on the number of persons killed or injured. But this doesn’t come close
to describing the massive scope of this crisis. We ignore the ripples of grief
and trauma that wash over a community and leave wounds, especially devastating
to children,” Murphy said.Murphy explained the harmful link between experiencing gun
violence and children’s brain development: “Growing up in a violent neighborhood not only
erodes any sense of safety or security, it alters your brain chemistry.
Scientists have documented how violence-based trauma and fear for one’s safety
inject damaging amounts of the hormone cortisol into the brain. This is
particularly damaging to the growing brains of children, and it makes it hard
for them to sleep, learn and process emotions. It dramatically impacts brain
development, making these young people more likely to develop post-traumatic
stress disorder, anxiety and depression.”Murphy
highlighted the funding for mental health programs in the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act: “There
is just no doubt that a conversation about gun violence has to include a
conversation about mental health. I was glad that the Bipartisan Safer
Communities Act, of which I was the lead sponsor, provides $13 billion to
expand school-based mental health programs, train more providers, and improve
access to mental health services for everyone. But an investment in mental
health won’t end the gun violence epidemic. It’s treating the symptoms, not the
cause.”“America faces both a mental health and gun violence crisis,
but only one of them fuels the other. And contrary to the gun lobby’s talking
points, it’s the guns fueling our mental health crisis—not the other way
around. In fact, people with mental illness are far more likely to be victims
of violence rather than perpetrators,” Murphy added.Murphy concluded: “We should continue investing in mental health programs that
help survivors, families and communities learn to cope, but the most meaningful
action we can take is to build upon the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and
take steps to ensure gun violence impacts fewer people. Passing universal
background checks and banning assault weapons are proven ways to save lives and
keep guns out of the wrong hands.”You can read the full op-ed here.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-capito-introduce-bill-to-address-parkinsons-disease,"WASHINGTON–U.S.
Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.),
introduced the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act, which aims to unite
the federal government in a mission to cure and prevent Parkinson’s, alleviate
financial and health burdens on American families, and reduce government
spending over time. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common – and
fastest-growing – neurological disease globally with at least 60,000 new cases
diagnosed every year. U.S. Representatives Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Bilirakis
(R-Fla.) introduced companion legislation, H.R. 8585, in July 2022.“Anyone
living with Parkinson’s or caring for a loved one impacted by the disease knows
just how devastating a diagnosis it can be. The National Plan to End
Parkinson’s Act would create a comprehensive strategy to get us closer to a
cure while also ensuring we do everything we can to help patients and their
families access higher quality, more affordable care,” said Murphy. “Far too many West Virginians are impacted by Parkinson’s
disease. Whether they are living with the disease or caring for someone
impacted by it, Parkinson’s takes a terrible toll on the physical, mental,
emotional, and economic well-being
of everyone involved. The National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act is
commonsense legislation which will establish a robust response to address the
disease and move us towards new treatments and a cure,” said Capito.“With more Parkinson’s therapies available today and more in
clinical testing, we’re hopeful about the future of Parkinson’s research and
care. Yet, to realize our mission we know it’ll take the collaborative effort
of individuals across sectors to move the dial and find a cure. The Parkinson’s
community across the United States is grateful for the leadership of Senator
Capito and Senator Murphy in leading the Senate effort on The National Plan to End Parkinson’s — an important bill
that will allow collaboration between the public and private sectors to
prioritize research advancements toward better treatments and access to quality
care that every
person touched by this disease urgently needs,” said Deborah W.
Brooks, CEO and Co-Founder of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s
Research.“Senator
Capito is an incredible leader and champion of better cures and treatments for
neurological diseases. Her leadership on the National Plan to End
Parkinson’s Act gives people suffering from Parkinson’s disease new hope
for a cure. When I was diagnosed, I began working with state and federal
lawmakers to prioritize the need for a cure and public-private collaboration to
make it happen. Senator Capito is a hero to those of us living with
Parkinson’s, and I am thankful for her work to create this important bill,” said George Manahan, a
Charleston business owner and person living with Parkinson’s disease.“Parkinson’s
disease is impacting patients and their families in America more than ever
before. It causes progressive disability in movement, cognition, and other
functions with no cure on the horizon. We need to coordinate and accelerate our
research and management efforts so that we can better understand this disease, in
hopes that one day soon we will see an end to this disease,” said Dr. Ali Rezai, Executive
Chair of WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI).The National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act will create an
advisory council comprising members of every federal agency that supports
research, care, and services for Parkinson’s, plus caregivers, patients, and
other non-federal experts.The council will:·      
Ensure coordination among all federal entities with responsibility
for managing, treating, and curing Parkinson’s disease;·      
Evaluate all current federal programs related to Parkinson's;·      
Write a national plan to prevent and cure Parkinson’s, and reduce
the financial impact of the disease on patients and the federal government; and·      
Report annually to Congress on progress toward the plan’s goals.For bill text, click here. For a

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis-and-impact-of-us-policy,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke on Thursday at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing assessing U.S. policy towards Venezuela with Assistant Secretary of
State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols and USAID’s Assistant Administrator
of the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean Marcela Escobari.Murphy
highlighted the consequences of the Trump administration’s disastrous Venezuela
policy: “It’s really
hard to overhype what a disaster President Trump’s Venezuela policy was — this
decision to push all of our chips into the middle of the table all at once,
recognize Guaidó and try to facilitate a coup, made us look ham-handed and in
the end feckless. Recognizing someone as the leader of a country who is not
actually the leader of the country, it doesn’t actually make us look strong, it
makes us look weak.“And we are
stuck inheriting a policy that did not work, that has in part contributed to a
humanitarian disaster that now brings thousands and thousands of Venezuelans to
our border seeking salvation. And so I support strategic engagement with a
purpose, and that purpose has to be an election that draws the participation of
all political groups, and gives Venezuelans the chance to exercise their right
to determine the future of the country,” Murphy added.Murphy
discussed the impact of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis: “[T]here’s no doubt the humanitarian disaster in
Venezuela is first, second, and third a consequence of the regime’s
unconscionable policies. But I think we should be honest that our sanctions
contribute to the humanitarian nightmare, and we can argue that there are good
reasons for our sanctions. But what worries me is a [Government Accountability
Office] report from last year that suggests we actually don’t have real good
information about how and if our sanctions are contributing to the humanitarian
crisis inside Venezuela. The report found that Treasury and its interagency
partners are limited in their ability to develop further actions to ensure that
U.S. sanctions don’t disrupt humanitarian assistance.”You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with Nichols and Escobari:MURPHY: “Thank you very much,
Mr. Chairman. Thank you to both of our witnesses for being here today. I was in both Mexico and Columbia over the August
recess in part to take a look at our Venezuela policy. It’s really hard to
overhype what a disaster President Trump’s Venezuela policy was — this decision
to push all of our chips into the middle of the table all at once, recognize Guaidó and try to facilitate a coup, made
us look ham-handed and in the end feckless.“Recognizing someone as the
leader of a country who is not actually the leader of the country, it doesn’t

our border seeking salvation. And so I support strategic engagement with a
purpose, and that purpose has to be an election that draws the participation of
all political groups, and gives Venezuelans the chance to exercise their right
to determine the future of the country.“And, so I’ve heard Assistant
Secretary Nichols, you suggest that there's a possibility of being able to get
to an election in 2024. But what does a free and fair election look like in
Venezuela? What are our benchmarks to know whether this is an election that we
can support, and that the Venezuelan people actually have a chance at
exercising their free will?“Listen, I understand it's
not going look like an election in our country, right? And I don’t know that we
should hold it to that standard, but we have to have some pretty clear
baselines. What are we looking for as we try to get towards a viable election?”NICHOLS: “Thank you senator.
The European Union’s electoral observation mission, I think has provided the
most comprehensive roadmap, along with the Carter Center, to what that would
look like. And it involves things like inequality of access, an equality of access,
to the media, rules that ensure that electoral authorities cannot disqualify
candidates arbitrarily, access to areas to campaign, and a cessation of the
abuses by security forces of opposition candidates, transparency in the
preparations technically for the election, and the conducting of the election.“It means allowing the
opposition to carry out a primary process. As we’ve seen, when they have
unified candidates, they will beat the regime candidates even when everything
else is tilted against them. A key part of the discussions between the unitary
platform and the regime will be the implementation of this process and we
support that.”MURPHY: “Ms. Escobari,
there’s no doubt the humanitarian disaster in Venezuela is first, second, and
third a consequence of the regime’s unconscionable policies. But I think we
should be honest that our sanctions contribute to the humanitarian nightmare, and
we can argue that there are good reasons for our sanctions.“But what worries me is a

contributing to the humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela. The report found that
Treasury and its interagency partners are limited in their ability to develop
further actions to ensure that U.S. sanctions don’t disrupt humanitarian
assistance. Are you familiar with this report? And if so, how is USAID engaged
with our implementing partners to mitigate these challenges? And how do we make
sure that we have visibility inside Venezuela to understand what the actual
impact of our sanctions are?”ESCOBARI: “As you said, you
know, it's very hard to separate the secondary effect. It is also very clear
that the deterioration of the economy preceded the sanctions, and that we have
this capacity to work on humanitarian aid and the government also has the
capacity to have invested in many of the services that are now not functioning
in Venezuela.“A lot of our financing and
our work goes to create a network of human right defenders, universities, and
civil society organizations that are getting information about where the most
vulnerable people are, the nature of the crisis as to target our humanitarian
aid to those that are most vulnerable. There’s actually a very sophisticated
and courageous network of humanitarian organizations that are on the ground
that know where the most vulnerable people are, and it is where we focus our
humanitarian assistance inside the country.”MURPHY: “Well I look forward
to speaking with you more directly about this specific report and your
responses to it. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman.”

and Security Act in the Department of State Authorization Act of 2022:“More and more of the
conflicts we’re facing abroad cannot be solved through military force alone.
American troops are highly capable and skilled, but they aren’t trained as
diplomats and we shouldn’t expect them to be. Our foreign policy toolkit is
dramatically limited when the State Department is operating under a bunker
mentality, and I’m glad the Committee recognizes that more diplomats on the

conditions that Congress placed on the security assistance:“I

progress on releasing political detainees. Out of some 60,000 political
prisoners, less than 1 percent have been released over the last year. During
that same time period, 10 times as many prisoners had their detentions renewed.

Pensions Committee hearing on the federal response to the spread of Monkeypox
with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle
Walensky and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) Dr. Anthony Fauci.Murphy highlighted the
challenges the CDC faces in access to data, including data related to
Monkeypox: “[O]utside of emergency
authorities, you’re stuck in a position today in which you have to negotiate
fifty different data sharing agreements with states all over the country. And
we expect a lot of the CDC, but it's hard to expect too much of the CDC when
you don’t have the authorities, as I understand it, to get the data you need absent
an emergency. And when we look at what’s happening today with Monkeypox — you’re getting data, but it’s patchy. For
instance, you’re not getting full demographic data. So there’s a lot of states
that aren’t reporting to you, for instance, breakdowns of cases on race or
ethnicity, and that really hurts our ability to target who gets the vaccine,
who gets resources.”“I would just much rather
have you be in the business of fighting the public threats presented to the
country than in constant negotiation over data sharing agreements. It just
seems like an essential function of the federal government to set up a uniform
way in which you get data, rather than putting you in the position of
negotiating over, and over, and over again these data use agreements,” Murphy
added.In a question to Dr.
Fauci, Murphy asked about how to best communicate
information regarding the Monkeypox vaccine: “I just want to talk a little bit about what we learned, what you
learned over the course of the information distribution campaign for the COVID
vaccine, and how that relates to what we are communicating about JYNNEOS [an
approved Monkeypox vaccine]. Because there’s been some amount of information
regarding questions about the level of protection, the duration of the immunity
when it comes to the Monkeypox vaccine.”Murphy, along
with U.S. Senators Time Kaine (D-Va.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) introduced the
Improving Data Accessibility Through Advancements Act, legislation to
modernize our nation’s public health data infrastructure at the CDC. This bill
would increase timely and accurate information sharing between local, state,
and federal public health departments and other health care entities like
hospitals and laboratories to improve our preparedness and response to emerging
public health threats.You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with Walensky and Fauci:MURPHY: “I’ll recognize
myself for questions. I have two, one for you Dr. Walensky, and one for Dr.
Fauci.“Dr. Walensky, one of the
things I panic about is your access to data. And you’ve talked to this
committee about it, we’ve talked personally about it, but outside of emergency
authorities, you’re stuck in a position today in which you have to negotiate fifty
different data sharing agreements with states all over the country.“And we expect a lot of the
CDC, but it's hard to expect too much of the CDC when you don’t have the
authorities as I understand it, to get the data you need absent an emergency.
And when we look at what’s happening today with Monkeypox — you’re getting data, but it’s patchy. For
instance, you’re not getting full demographic data. So there’s a lot of states
that aren’t reporting to you, for instance, breakdowns of cases on race or
ethnicity, and that really hurts our ability to target who gets the vaccine,
who gets resources.”“So, certainly in the context
of Monkeypox, but maybe more broadly, what position does it leave you in when
you don’t have the authorities to be able to compel states in a uniformed way
to get you good data?”WALENSKY: “Thank you senator,
and thank you for the question and for your leadership in working with Senator
Kaine, Senator Baldwin in trying to get us the authorities so that we can
provide these data to you. We have been working closely, tirelessly, with state
and local public health staff who have been doing the same to extract data on
this outbreak specifically.“We’ve actually negotiated
now 61 data use agreements. We’ve navigated bureaucratic approvals for data to
get flowing. We’ve set up voluntary arrangements directly with large commercial
labs to send their data, but it's been hard, and it should not be this hard and
if we can’t make informed decisions based on the best possible data coming into
us, we’re not making the best decisions for the American people.“The existing patchwork of
data systems is not working. It’s not working to the best ability of the American
people. For Monkeypox specifically, I can tell you that I don’t know the total
number of people hospitalized with Monkeypox, the data on laboratory testing in
the United States, complete demographic data, as you noted, which people with
Monkeypox have been vaccinated. We can’t link the Monkeypox vaccine to the
laboratory data. And demographic data, as you noted, we get 27% of our
demographic data on testing, we’ve received 47% of our demographic data on
cases, and 91% of our demographic data because of these data use agreements on
vaccination.MURPHY: “I would just much
rather have you be in the business of fighting the public threats presented to
the country than in constant negotiation over data sharing agreements. It just
seems like an essential function of the federal government to set up a uniform
way in which you get data, rather than putting you in the position of
negotiating over, and over, and over again these data use agreements, and my
hope is that soon, we’ll be able to find a consensus on that here. It’s scary
that you don’t know how many are hospitalized for the Monkeypox today because
of your inability to get that data.“Dr. Fauci, in the minute and
a half remaining, I just want to talk a little bit about what we learned, what
you learned over the course of the information distribution campaign for the
COVID vaccine, and how that relates to what we are communicating about JYNNEOS.
Because there’s been some amount of information regarding questions about the
level of protection, the duration of the immunity when it comes to the
Monkeypox vaccine.I don’t know if this was
necessarily your fault, but in the euphoria of the sort of early news of the
COVID vaccine, we probably got out a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of
what level of protection it could provide. So, what did we learn about how to
talk about a vaccine in its early distribution stages? And how does that inform
how we should talk about the Monkeypox vaccine?”DR. FAUCI: “Well, first of
all, they are two entirely different pathogens and the response and the
durability of response to each is really quite different.“It was a rather unique
situation with COVID vaccine where there was no doubt that the initial
protection against symptomatic disease, as well as severe disease, was well
into the 90s. That was the really good news. The sobering news was the
durability of protection, particularly against infection and symptomatic
disease.“Fortunately, the durability
against severe disease lasted. But if you look at coronaviruses in general,
which is usually a good parameter of what the response to a vaccine is, even
with a coronavirus infection, the durability of protection against reinfection
long before COVID came along, just the typical common coronaviruses, did not last
very long and we see instances of reinfection with the same coronavirus.“That poses a very different
situation, which leads to the need for and the importance of updating vaccines
and giving the boosters that are part of the regimen in addition to the primary
regimen.“When you’re dealing with a
pox virus, inherently pox viruses have a much greater durability of protection.
We know that because smallpox itself once you get infected, you’re essentially
protected for life against reinfection. Once you get vaccinated with the
standard smallpox vaccination, you can be sure that the durability is measured
at least in decades and maybe lifetime.“What we’re dealing with now
with JYNNEOS is that it likely is going to have durability of protection if you
get the two doses. Not just one. We want to make sure people get their two
doses. The durability very likely is going to be much greater than that
shortened durability of the COVID, because they are really fundamentally two
different viruses.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-highlights-harmful-impact-of-non-compete-agreements,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke on Tuesday about working to crack down on unjustifiable
non-compete agreements at a U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
Committee Hearing with Jessica Looman, nominee for the U.S. Department of
Labor’s (DOL) Administrator for the Wage and Hour Division.Murphy highlighted the
recent increase in non-compete agreements, which depress wages and hurt workers: “There’s a growing body of literature, frankly both
on the right and the left, that shows one, the massive explosion of non-compete
agreements, both for high-income workers, where we tend to think non-compete
agreements exist, but also low-income workers. And today, it's estimated that,
you know, somewhere between 20, maybe as high as 30 or 40 percent of American
workers have these non-compete agreements. The vast majority of them are not
negotiated. And in fact, maybe as high as 30 or 40% of these non-compete
agreements are signed after the employee starts the job, when they have very
little leverage to refuse it.”Murphy continued: “In Connecticut, we’re hearing about these
non-compete agreements being used for very low-income home care workers…These
non-compete agreements, they depress wages, they hinder entrepreneurship. And
we have a good bipartisan consensus growing in the Senate to restrict their
usage. Senator Young, Senator Cramer, Senator Kaine, and myself have introduced
legislation that would make them broadly impermissible with certain
common-sense exceptions.”Murphy and
U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.)  introduced the
Workforce Mobility Act, bipartisan legislation to limit the use of
non-compete agreements that negatively impact American workers. Last year,
Murphy also applauded President
Biden’s Executive Action to encourage the FTC to limit non-compete agreements.You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with Looman:MURPHY: “Thank you very much
Madam Chair. Thank you to both of you for your willingness to serve.”“I had just one topic that I
wanted to raise with you, Ms. Looman, and that is the issue of non-compete
agreements. There’s a growing body of literature, frankly both on the right and
the left, that shows one, the massive explosion of non-compete agreements, both
for high-income workers, where we tend to think non-compete agreements exist,
but also low-income workers.“And today, it's estimated
that, you know, somewhere between 20, maybe as high as 30 or 40 percent of
American workers have these non-compete agreements. The vast majority of them
are not negotiated. And in fact, maybe as high as 30 or 40% of these
non-compete agreements are signed after the employee starts the job, when they
have very little leverage to refuse it.“In Connecticut, we’re
hearing about these non-compete agreements being used for very low-income home
care workers. Of course there’s the famous instance of Jimmy Johns sandwich
shop requiring its workers to sign non-compete agreements and then denying them
the ability to go work for another franchise of Jimmy Johns because it was
owned by a different ownership group.“These non-compete
agreements, they depress wages, they hinder entrepreneurship. And we have a
good bipartisan consensus growing in the Senate to restrict their usage.
Senator Young, Senator Cramer, Senator Kaine, and myself have introduced
legislation that would make them broadly impermissible with certain
common-sense exceptions.“I know Senator Rubio and
Senator Hassan have introduced more targeted legislation to restrict their
usage for lower income workers. The president has put out an executive order,
sort of starting to put the administration more firmly on the side of workers.
What can the Wage and Hour Division do, what role can the Division play in
reducing the proliferation of these harmful agreements? What’s the sort of
boundaries of what the law allows you to do today? What additional authority
might you need from Congress?LOOMAN: “Thank you, Senator.
We too are concerned about — and again, in my role as the deputy administrator,
but also in my previous roles — we are concerned about issues that would impact
workers, in terms of either the wages that they earn today, or also from any
chilling effect about them stepping forward, and fear of suffering from
retaliation because they have exercised their rights under the Fair Labor
Standards Act.“And we see some arrangements
that could really result in that chilling effect. And that could include these
non-compete agreements, this could include other issues that are particularly
concerning in terms of again empowering workers to make sure that they are
getting the rights that they are entitled to under the law.“So, from the Wage and Hour
perspective, we very much look in the course of our investigations to make sure
that workers are getting all the protections that they should be getting under
the Fair Labor Standards Act, but we also work very closely with employers to
help identify and address areas that could be considered retaliation and
prevent those from happening in the first place. And so, in some ways a
non-compete agreement really could have that chilling effect and we’re
concerned about that for working people.”MURPHY: “Often these
non-compete agreements are unenforceable, many of them are limited in scope,
but they often allow the employer to make certain threats to employees that may
not be based in law, because many states, frankly, limit the usage of these
non-compete agreements that end up binding the employee to their workplace,
even though their agreement actually does not limit their ability to go seek
other employment.”“I guess my only other
question is a simple one. I do hope that we’re going to be able to have some
success in moving this bipartisan legislation through. If you look at the map
of states that restrict them, it has nothing to do with which party controls
the state legislature or the government’s office. Again, this is a pretty
nonpartisan issue. I just ask for your commitment to work with those of us who
are trying to develop legislation to empower the administration to crack down
on unjustifiable non-compete agreements. Will you just commit to working with
those of us on both sides of the aisle that are trying to address this issue?”JESSICA LOOMAN: “Thank you,
Senator. Absolutely, if confirmed, I’m happy to continue to work on this issue
with you.”###

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism and a
member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, spoke on the U.S. Senate
floor to call attention to Egypt’s extensive human rights violations and to
urge the Biden administration to withhold the full $300 million in aid that
Congress made contingent on significant progress toward releasing political
prisoners and improving Egypt’s human rights record.Murphy highlighted the
story of his constituent, Muhammad Amasha, a PhD student at Yale University
whose father is one of 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt: “Muhammad Amasha is studying at Yale University,
pursuing his PhD. Meanwhile, his father Dr. Ahmed Amasha was imprisoned in
Egypt from 2017 to 2019, and re-arrested and jailed again in June of 2020.
According to the UN, his detention seems ‘to constitute acts of reprisals
against Dr. Amasha for documenting cases of enforced disappearances for the
Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council of the United Nations.’ Since
his arrest in 2020, Dr. Amasha reportedly has endured abuse during his
interrogations that resulted in broken ribs and other injuries; his abuse
included rape, electrocution, threats to rape his wife, and physical abuse
while blindfolded.”On Egypt’s failure to make
“clear and consistent progress in releasing political prisoners and providing
detainees with due process of law” as required by Congress in order to receive
$75 million of Egypt’s $1.3 billion military aid package, Murphy said: “If you're going to be an ally of the United States,
you shouldn't be locking people up for political speech. But of those 2,954
detainees, the government released 49. That's not clear and consistent
progress. Another metric: since April, Egypt's terrorism courts have ordered
the release of 417 prisoners. But over that same time period, at least 4,400
political prisoners have had their detentions renewed by the courts. That's not
clear and consistent progress.”On Egypt’s failure to take
sustained and effective steps toward improving its human rights record as
required by Congress to receive $225 million of the military aid package,
Murphy said: “Congress has also tied
an additional $225 million of Egypt's military aid to “sustained and effective
steps” in improving Egypt’s human rights record, a broader record of human
rights abuses. The statute lays out that in order to receive this money Egypt
needs to allow NGOs and the media to operate freely, protect women and
religious minorities, hold security forces accountable when they violate human
rights, and investigate and prosecute these cases of forced disappearances.
Again, the record is overwhelmingly clear that things in Egypt have gotten
worse on these fronts, not better over the last year.”Murphy pushed back on the
argument that Egypt will stop cooperating with the United States if aid is
withheld: “Just last year, the
administration actually did withhold $130 million of Egypt’s aid. Of course,
the Egyptians were angry. It probably did make our diplomats’ life a little bit
harder in Egypt. But by and large, our relationship didn't change. Egyptians
still cooperated with us on counterterrorism. They provided us Suez and
overflight access. They again facilitated the truce in Gaza. Why? Because all
of these areas in which we engage are beneficial for the Egyptians. They don't
do it as simple payback for our aid. They engage with us on these issues, they
engage with Israel because it's good for Egyptian security notwithstanding
whether they get $1 billion or $1.3 billion from the United States.”Murphy concluded: “The United States needs not just to talk the talk when
it comes to human rights abroad. We need to be able to walk the walk as well.
And the decision that the administration will make this week as to whether to
comply with the conditions set forth by Congress on holding Egyptians
accountable for progress on human rights is critical to American credibility
globally when it comes to our call to protect human rights and democracy
abroad. And for that reason, I would urge the administration to withhold the
full $300 million as called for by the [FY21] Appropriations Act until Egypt’s
record gets better.”Murphy
has been a vocal
proponent of withholding
security aid based on human rights concerns. Earlier this year, Murphy released
a statement on the administration’s decision to reprogram the $130 million in security
assistance that had been withheld after the Egyptian government failed to meet
conditions related to improving human rights.A full transcript of his
remarks can be found below:“Egypt is one of America’s
closest allies. Our taxpayers send them more direct funding for their military
than we send almost any other nation in the world. But here's what happens to
political opponents of the Egyptian regime when they get arrested, and they get
arrested at a dizzying rate, and get sent to the infamous Tora prison. Arrivals
there are blindfolded and then are forced to run through a human corridor of
guards who pummel them with sticks until they collapse. Following this
initiation for political prisoners, many of them are routinely beaten and tortured
for months or years on end, often with no formal charges being filed. Some
never make it out alive.“Human rights groups estimate
that there are around 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. I get it that big
numbers sometimes lose their meaning in this place. But by comparison,
estimates are that Russia has 420. China likely has around 1,000. Egypt locks
up 60,000 political opponents of the regime. To keep up with the demands of
President El-Sisi's imprisonment spree, the country has had to build 60 new
detention centers over the last decade. These prisons houses some of the
country's most prominent human rights defenders, journalists, opposition
leaders, but also just ordinary people who are locked up for years because they
just attended a protest, or they liked the Facebook post, or they recorded a
TikTok video.“Let me tell you the story
of just one of these 60,000 people. Right now, one of my constituents is
suffering through the pain and uncertainty of having a relative unjustly
imprisoned in Egypt. Muhammad Amasha is studying at Yale University, pursuing
his PhD. Meanwhile, his father Dr. Ahmed Amasha was imprisoned in Egypt from
2017 to 2019, and re-arrested and jailed again in June of 2020. According to
the UN, his detention seems ‘to constitute acts of reprisals against Dr. Amasha
for documenting cases of enforced disappearances for the Special Procedures of
the Human Rights Council of the United Nations.’ Since his arrest in 2020, Dr.
Amasha reportedly has endured abuse during his interrogations that resulted in
broken ribs and other injuries; his abuse included rape, electrocution, threats
to rape his wife, and physical abuse while blindfolded. He was forced to sign a
written confession during this time.“Since President Sisi came to
power in 2013, more than 1,000 people have died in Egyptian custody. 14% of
those deaths were tortured. More than 70% are because of a denial of health
care.“This isn't an adversary of
the United States. This is Egypt – our ally. And every day that we continue to
send billions of dollars to the Egyptian government, while paying lip service
to these egregious human rights violations, it is a blow both to our nation's
character and to our credibility around the world.“For the last several years
I've fought to change our Egypt policy, and for the first time in FY21 we
conditioned with no waiver $75 million of Egypt’s $1.3 billion military aid
package on ‘making clear and consistent progress on releasing political
prisoners and providing detainees with due process of law.’“Because there is no waiver,
the administration either has to certify that Egypt has made this progress to
merit the release of the money, or they haven't made that progress and withhold
the money. The record is clear that they have not. Let me just provide one way
of measuring clear and consistent progress and releasing political prisoners.“A group of Egyptian human
rights organizations submitted a list of 2,954 known political prisoners to the
government's presidential pardon committee earlier this year. These are people
that should not be in jail, they simply protested the government. If you're
going to be an ally of the United States, you shouldn't be locking people up
for political speech. But of those 2,954 detainees, the government released 49.
That's not clear and consistent progress.“Another metric: since April,
Egypt's terrorism courts have ordered the release of 417 prisoners. But over
that same time period, at least 4,400 political prisoners have had their
detentions renewed by the courts. That's not “clear and consistent progress.”“Now, it's progress, but it’s
always been one step forward, and two or three steps backwards at best. Egypt
has certainly not made the kind of progress required to merit the release of
$75 million.“In addition to that piece of
funding tied to political prisoners, Congress has also tied an additional $225
million of Egypt's military aid to sustained and effective steps in improving
Egypt’s human rights record, a broader record of human rights abuses. The
statute lays out that in order to receive this money Egypt needs to allow NGOs
and the media to operate freely, protect women and religious minorities, hold
security forces accountable when they violate human rights, and investigate and
prosecute these cases of forced disappearances.“Again, the record is
overwhelmingly clear that things in Egypt have gotten worse on these fronts,
not better over the last year. Journalists are regularly was still charged with
joining a terrorist group or spreading false news or any critical reporting.
Journalists are regularly charged with ‘joining a terrorist group’ or
‘spreading false news’ for any critical reporting. Just last week, four
journalists from the independent outlet Mada Masr were charged [for] a single
news article that documented corruption within a political party close to the
president. Earlier this year, human rights lawyer Youssef Mansour was charged
with ‘inciting terrorism’ after he wrote a social media post denouncing prison
conditions. Egypt is also not content with imprisoning its critics at
home, but increasingly its pursuing its critics abroad. News
reports emerged in December that a prominent opposition leader, who
lives in exile in Turkey, had his phone hacked with NSO Group
software. In January, the U.S. Justice Department arrested a
foreign agent here, acting on behalf of Egypt. This is not the
behavior of a foreign government that made significant progress to
improving human rights to merit the  release of $225 million.“Lastly, every year when we
have this debate, there are always proponents who argue that even though Egypt
has this horrific human rights record, we should give them the money anyway.
The argument is that Egypt is a really important strategic ally, if we withhold
just a portion of the $1.3 billion, Egyptians might stop cooperating with us or
shop around for another partner. Let me just take a minute to address the
fallacy of this argument.“First, Egypt does provide
strategic benefits to the United States. Egypt provides counterterrorism
cooperation, shares intelligence with us about shared threats, access to the
Suez Canal is critical for the United States. When violence does flare up in
Gaza, Egypt often steps in and helps mediate and facilitate a truce through its
ties with Hamas. There’s good reasons for the United States and Egypt to be
partners. And it’s not crazy that we give them military aid, but we shouldn't
delude ourselves into thinking that reducing our aid from $1.3 billion to $1
billion after giving Egypt the entire year to meet these common sense
conditions is going to cause the sky to fall.“Just last year, the
administration actually did withhold $130 million of Egypt’s aid. Of course,
the Egyptians were angry. It probably did make our diplomats’ life a little bit
harder in Egypt. But by and large, our relationship didn't change. Egyptians
still cooperated with us on counterterrorism. They provided us Suez and
overflight access. They again facilitated the truce in Gaza. Why? Because all
of these areas in which we engage are beneficial for the Egyptians. They don't
do it as simple payback for our aid. They engage with us on these issues, they
engage with Israel because it's good for Egyptian security notwithstanding
whether they get $1 billion or $1.3 billion from the United States.“We also sent a signal to the
Egyptians by withholding some of that money last year, and while we didn’t see
significant improvements, we did see some political prisoners released. This
year, we have to keep the pressure up. The United States needs not just to talk
the talk when it comes to human rights abroad. We need to be able to walk the
walk as well. And the decision that the administration will make this week as
to whether to comply with the conditions set forth by Congress on holding
Egyptians accountable for progress on human rights is critical to American
credibility globally when it comes to our call to protect human rights and
democracy abroad. And for that reason, I would urge the administration to
withhold the full $300 million as called for by the [FY21] Appropriations Act
until Egypt’s record gets better.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-requests-update-on-department-of-justice-and-atf-implementation-of-the-bipartisan-safer-communities-act,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Monday requested the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) provide
updates on the implementation of provisions in the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act, which was signed into law in June.In a letter to Attorney
General Merrick Garland, Murphy requested updates on the distribution of funds
for Extreme Risk Protection Order programs and community violence intervention
initiatives, efforts to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted domestic
violence abusers, plans to communicate with federal firearms licensees about
their responsibilities, and confirmation that the National Instant Criminal
Background Check System (NICS) is processing background checks for under-21
buyers.Murphy highlighted the
urgency of DOJ’s implementation of these core provisions of the Bipartisan
Safer Communities Act: “Since the BSCA’s passage, the country has
experienced an alarmingly high number of shootings, many of which have gripped
the public’s consciousness. As I have noted, the BSCA contains several
commonsense reforms which could have prevented some of these acts of violence
had Congress acted sooner. Now that the BSCA is law, we cannot afford to waste
any time implementing the law’s life-saving provisions.”In a letter to ATF Director
Steve Dettelbach, Murphy requested updates on ATF’s work to ensure convicted
domestic violence abusers do not illegally purchase firearms, communicate with
federal arms licensees what facts would give them reason to believe a purchaser
is engaged in gun trafficking, ensure all appropriate firearms sellers properly
register for a Federal Firearms License as well as what steps are being taken
to further clarify which sellers are “engaged in the business.” Murphy also
requested updates on ATF’s plans to communicate with licensed dealers to
expedite delayed background checks and retrieve firearms mistakenly sold to
prohibited purchasers, enforce new ghost gun regulations, develop the Bureau’s
data analytics capacity, investigate online gun marketplaces for illegal
activity, work with licensed gun dealers to identify and remedy security
weaknesses, and reduce and prevent gun-involved suicides.“It is no secret that the
survivors, families, and advocates who built the gun violence prevention
movement have been eagerly awaiting a confirmed Director to lead ATF. That your
confirmation coincided with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act
demonstrates that ordinary people across the country will no longer tolerate
the status quo of daily gun violence, mass shootings, and suicides, fueled by
weak firearm regulation and lax enforcement,” Murphy wrote to Director Dettelbach. “Congress and the President
have given the Bureau substantial authority and responsibility to prevent more
violence, keep guns out of the wrong hands, and hold criminals accountable to
the law.”Full text of the letter to

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) joined a bipartisan group of New England
senators to call for the Biden Administration to take action to lower energy
costs for New Englanders as the winter season approaches and Americans continue
to face high energy costs. In the letter, the senators write, “As winter approaches, we
are calling for federal action to help bring down heating costs for households
in our region, including releasing stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating
Oil Reserve.” They continue, “With lower inventories of crude oil, propane,
and natural gas and the continued global disruption caused by the Russian
invasion of Ukraine contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs,
we urge the administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast
and release stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve.”The full list of senators who signed the bipartisan letter
include: U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Susan
Collins (R-Maine), Angus King (I-Maine), Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Elizabeth
Warren (D-Mass.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.).The text of the letter is available here
and below. Dear President Biden:As winter approaches, we are calling for federal action to help
bring down heating costs for households in our region, including releasing
stockpiles from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. Given the current state
of energy markets, particularly in New England, we urge you to consider
additional targeted actions in preparation for the cold weather season.To help combat the increased cost of heating oil, we believe that
now is an appropriate time to release inventory from the Northeast Home Heating
Oil Reserve, similar to the action you took earlier this year with the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve at our urging. Doing so can help address
constrained regional energy supplies and recent residential energy price
increases.The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in its August
Short-Term Energy Outlook, forecasts a significant increase in energy prices,
particularly in the Northeast. These increased costs will have an outsized
impact on households that heat with natural gas, propane, and heating oil –
which includes many of our constituents. These costs can have a very real
effect on the ability of many New England families to keep their homes at a
safe temperature this winter. No family should have to make the decision
between paying their bill to keep their children warm, putting food on the
table, and keeping the lights on. As New Englanders purchase heating oil and
propane for the winter season, it is vital that the administration use all
tools available to bring down fuel prices and ensure that there is adequate
supply to meet demand.With lower inventories of crude oil, propane, and natural gas and
the continued global disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine
contributing to a sharp rise in residential energy costs, we urge the
administration to closely monitor the energy needs of the Northeast and release
stock from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve. This action is consistent
with the discretion granted to the President under 42 U.S.C. § 6250b, in order
to directly and significantly reduce the adverse impact of a significant
regional shortage of home heating oil.This is a critical economic issue facing millions of Americans,
and we appreciate your attention to this important matter.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-markey-call-for-ftc-investigation-of-firearms-industrys-unfair-and-deceptive-advertising,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.),
and Edward Markey (D-Mass.) on Monday led a group of twelve
senators in calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to “to
undertake an investigation and consider regulation of the unfair and deceptive
advertising practices used by the firearms industry.” In a letter to
FTC Chair Lina Khan, the senators highlighted the firearms industry’s efforts
to mislead consumers about the safety of guns and the employment of advertising
tactics that target children and teenagers –
including using video games, popular musicians and television shows, and even
Santa Claus to market its deadly products.“The industry regularly and routinely makes
false and misleading representations about firearm safety and unfairly exploits
children and teenagers through unfair and deceptive marketing practices,
including targeting teenagers, particularly young men, with advertising for
military-style weapons,” the senators wrote. “Time and again, these practices have
had deadly consequences.”The gun industry’s advertising and marketing practices have
received increased attention following the massacre at Robb Elementary School
in Uvalde, Texas, where the mass shooter used an assault rifle manufactured by
Daniel Defense. Daniel Defense’s marketing materials highlight the company’s
military contracts and reference popular first-person shooter video games to
target children and teenagers.Earlier this year, the families of nine victims of the shooting at
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut secured a settlement of
their claims against Remington Arms based on the company’s advertising
practices.The letter was also signed
by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Cory Booker
(D-N.J.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Kirsten
Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Jack
Reed (D-R.I.).The full text of the letter can be found here and below.
Dear Chair Khan:We write to
urge the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to undertake an investigation and
consider regulation of the unfair and deceptive advertising practices used by
the firearms industry. Following the
horrific massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas on May 24, 2022,
Daniel Defense—the manufacturer of the assault rifle used in the attack—has
come under increased and warranted scrutiny for its advertising practices.
Daniel Defense touts military contracts and ties in order to market weapons of
war to the general public, and specifically targets and tailors its
advertisements to children and teenagers with invocations of and references to
popular first-person shooter video games like Call of Duty—a game reportedly
played by the 18-year-old shooter in Uvalde. Daniel Defense
is not the only firearms manufacturer that has, appropriately, come under
mounting scrutiny for its advertising practices. For example, in February 2022,
the families of nine victims murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School secured a
settlement against Remington Arms—the manufacturer of the firearm used to kill
20 children and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut almost 10 years ago—for
its own marketing tactics. Daniel Defense and Remington, however, are far from
outliers in the firearms industry. The industry regularly and routinely makes
false and misleading representations about firearm safety and unfairly exploits
children and teenagers through unfair and deceptive marketing practices,
including targeting teenagers, particularly young men, with advertising for military-style
weapons. Time and again, these practices have had deadly consequences.The FTC has the
power to address these deceptive marketing practices that threaten consumers
and public safety. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act empowers the
FTC to investigate and regulate “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or
affecting commerce,” including in the advertising of products.  The FTC
has previously investigated and taken strong action against other industries
for similar false and misleading safety-related claims, particularly when such
claims target and endanger children. The tobacco and e-cigarette industries are
perhaps the paradigmatic example. Since the 1940s, the FTC has brought
enforcement actions against tobacco companies for unfair and deceptive claims
over the health and safety of cigarettes—most prominently with its lawsuit
against R.J. Reynolds over the use of the Joe Camel cartoon to market to
children.The same should
be done here with respect to the firearms industry and the unsubstantiated
claims it has made—and continues to make—in its advertisements. For decades,
the firearms industry has marketed firearms to consumers as a safe and proven
product to protect themselves and their homes. Consumers should be informed of all
the substantial and unavoidable risks that come with firearm ownership,
possession, and use, and the FTC is in the best position to make sure that the
firearms industry tells them—and tells them accurately.The first
petition calling for the FTC to investigate the firearms industry was filed in
1996 —more than 25 years ago—and numerous petitions have been filed in the
intervening years. A petition for an investigation filed in April by the
Firearms Accountability Counsel Taskforce (FACT) documents in chilling detail
how the firearms industry has knowingly engaged in a long pattern of unfair and
deceptive advertising to mislead the American public into erroneously believing
that gun ownership makes them safer, when the available evidence overwhelmingly
proves the opposite.  The petition also highlights the violent results of
the industry’s efforts to “target and radicalize” consumers by “convincing them
that they need expensive, military-grade weaponry for everyday use.”  The
petition includes examples of efforts that targeted young men in particular
with connections to video games and claims that owning military-grade weapons
was the only path to manhood. Everytown for Gun Safety, Brady, and Fred
Guttenberg, whose daughter Jamie was killed in the 2018 Parkland shooting,
filed a petition in May 2020, and followed up with a letter last year
reiterating their request for an investigation of Smith & Wesson’s
marketing practices.  And, in July, Everytown for Gun Safety filed a
petition specifically focused on the highly violent and militarized marketing
practices of Daniel Defense, to which teens and young men are particularly
susceptible.  The FTC, however, has never taken public action in response
to the petitions that have exposed these practices.These petitions
show that the available evidence strongly demonstrates that firearm possession,
ownership, and use render consumers substantially less safe and substantially
more at risk of injury and death with limited, if any, protective
benefit.  The rare instances in which a gun owner successfully uses a
firearm for self-defense are far outweighed by the vastly higher number of
injuries and deaths for the owners, family members, and other cohabitants. In
fact, research indicates that for each instance in which a firearm in the home
is used successfully in self-defense, there are 11 attempted or completed
firearm suicides, seven criminal assaults or homicides involving a firearm, and
four unintentional shootings. That fact
comports with broader gun violence research and data. More than half of the
near 46,000 suicides reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in 2020 involved firearms.  64 Americans die by firearm suicide
every day, and 700 children die by firearm suicide each year.  Firearm
suicides are almost always deadly: 9 out of 10 firearm suicide attempts result
in death.  In addition, unintentional and accidental shootings are also a
serious problem specific to firearm possession, ownership, and use—particularly
for children. Well over four million children live in households with at least
one unlocked and loaded firearm.  Although 70 percent of parents reported
that adolescents could not access firearms in their household, more than
one-third of children in those households reported being able to access the
firearm in less than five minutes.  Every day, eight children are
unintentionally injured or killed due to an unlocked or unsupervised gun in the
home.  In 2022, so far, there have been at least 181 unintentional shootings
by children, resulting in 77 deaths and 115 injuries.  In 2021, there were
almost 400—including 163 deaths and 248 injuries. None of this
evidence is new. We and, more importantly, the firearms industry, have known
for decades that firearm possession, ownership, and use can have serious—often
deadly—irreversible consequences. But that has never stopped the firearms
industry from advertising guns as indispensable to protect oneself in and
outside the home. If anything, the firearms industry has doubled-down on its
unfair and deceptive advertising with a specific emphasis on military and law
enforcement grade firearms and a particular focus on children and teenagers,
using video games, popular musicians and television shows, and even Santa Claus
to market its products.  This scheme has
worked—to the benefit of the firearms industry and the detriment of consumers.
Evidence shows that decades of deceptive advertising has deceived Americans
into believing, inaccurately, that having a gun in the home decreases the risk
of violence when the opposite is true. This mistaken belief has led to a
historic surge in gun sales and industry profits tragically in tandem with the
number of gun-related deaths in the United States.  Data from the CDC
shows that gun deaths in 2020 in the United States reached the highest level
ever recorded—45,000.  In 2020, firearms were also, for the first time, the
leading cause of death among children and teenagers—a 29-percent increase from
2019.  Firearms are now among the leading causes of death nationwide, as
more than 120 Americans are killed each day with a gun.  If the firearms
industry’s commercial representations were based on fact and evidence instead
of profit motives, the gun violence trendline would be trending downward.
Reality reflects otherwise. The FTC must
act to ensure that the firearms industry, which has operated without oversight
and with impunity for far too long, is held accountable for misleading
consumers about the harms guns can cause to themselves, their children, and
their communities. To that end, we encourage the FTC to make full use of all
its tools and authorities to investigate and regulate the firearms industry’s
unfair and deceptive advertising practices.Sincerely,

(D-Conn.) and AJR’s Adam Met authored an op-ed for Katie
Couric Media urging the gun violence prevention and climate change movements to
build upon the successes of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and Inflation
Reduction Act, which both passed this summer. Murphy and Met, the
bassist of multi-platinum band AJR and Executive Director of the social impact
venture Planet Reimagined, highlighted the important role of young people in
keeping up the fight.“The
last time the Senate passed a major gun safety bill was 1994, and the show
Friends had just premiered, the first PlayStation had just been released, and
Michael Jordan was playing baseball. The last time the Senate passed major
climate change legislation? Never. That’s because for decades the gun lobby and
fossil fuel industry had federal policy in a chokehold, successfully blocking
every effort to shift power from corporations back to the people,” wrote
Murphy and Met. “And then in one summer, that changed. Congress passed the
most comprehensive gun safety legislation in thirty years and made the largest
single investment in tackling the climate crisis in history.”Murphy and Met highlighted the power of young people’s leadership
in social movements: “Power in Washington doesn’t shift easily, and these two issues
coming unstuck at the same time is not a coincidence. Young people are almost
always at the forefront of the social change movements you read about in history
textbooks, and the anti-gun violence and climate movements are prime
examples…In the past few years, young people led hundreds of marches across the
country, held rallies, and called their representatives. They partnered with
bands like AJR to meet people where they are and register them to vote. They
built power, brought more people into the fight, and turned out to vote in 2020
at the highest rate ever. Young people sent Democrats to the House, Senate, and
White House with a mandate to deliver on a better future, and these victories
are in large part thanks to the momentum they helped build.”On the path ahead, they wrote: “The legislation Congress passed
this summer dealt a seismic blow to the status quo and are testaments to the
strength of these movements. But we’ll be the first to admit, there’s a lot of
work left to do: banning assault weapons, a price on carbon, widespread
environmental justice initiatives, and so much more. Big, complicated problems
like the epidemic of gun violence and the existential threat of climate change
tend to breed pessimism and hopelessness. That’s exactly what the cynical
corporate interest groups are still betting on.”“There
would be no gun safety or climate legislation without the tireless
efforts of survivors and advocates who — despite countless setbacks — never
gave up. It was resilience that got us to today. That same fire and refusal to
accept anything less than the future our kids and grandkids deserve is what
gets us to tomorrow. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and
the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act are
important first steps, but they can’t be our last. With young people leading us
in this fight, we know we’re just getting started,” Murphy and Met
concluded.You can read the full op-ed here.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-smith-lujan-introduce-legislation-to-give-the-us-department-of-labor-authority-to-enforce-mental-health-parity-laws,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee, along with U.S. Senators Tina Smith (D-Minn.)
and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) on Thursday introduced legislation to
hold insurance companies accountable and give the U.S. Department of Labor
(DOL) the authority to assess civil monetary penalties for violations of mental
health parity requirements. This new authority would incentivize compliance and
strengthen the protections of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity
Act.“It’s already the law that
insurance companies must cover mental health just like they cover physical
health, and yet they’re still finding ways to dodge compliance and deny
coverage of care. This bill would give the Department of Labor new tools to
enforce mental health parity laws, incentivize compliance, and hold insurers
accountable,” said Murphy.  “We need to treat mental
health with the same urgency we treat physical health, and that means making
sure everyone has access to the care they need,” said Smith. “This bill would help make mental
health care more accessible and affordable by holding insurance companies
accountable when they violate mental health parity requirements. I am proud to
introduce this legislation, which will bring us one step closer to ensuring
everyone has access to quality, affordable mental health care.”“Americans of all
backgrounds are dealing with mental health challenges which have only been
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic – and it’s critical that there is proper
enforcement of mental health parity law to ensure insurance providers are
abiding by the law and helping Americans, instead of maintaining barriers that
prevent full access to mental and behavioral health services” said Luján. “I’m proud to join Senators Murphy and
Smith in introducing this legislation that will make mental health parity a
reality by allowing the Department of Labor to deter violations of the law and
increase access to life-saving treatment.” “Empowering our government
with tools to hold health plans accountable for equal coverage of mental health
and addiction treatment is critical to getting more people on the road to
recovery. Most Americans cannot
afford to pay for care out of pocket—it’s time we seize the opportunity before
us and do what it takes to save lives,” said former Congressman and lead
author of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, Patrick J.
Kennedy.“The American
Psychological Association applauds Sen. Murphy for introducing the Parity
Enforcement Act, which would give the Department of Labor the necessary
enforcement power to help practitioners deliver much-needed behavioral health
services,” said APA CEO Arthur C.
Evans Jr., PhD. “Although insurers are required by federal law to offer
mental health care at the same level as the physical health care that they
cover, many still do not comply. This bill will help to hold these plans
accountable.”“Insurers are required to
cover mental health and substance use conditions just as they would any other
condition. Yet too often, patients are denied coverage when they need it most,” said Laurel Stine, J.D., M.A., Executive Vice
President and Chief Policy Officer of the American Foundation for Suicide
Prevention. “The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention commends Senator
Murphy for introducing the Parity Enforcement Act, which will provide the U.S.
Department of Labor with expanded oversight authority to ensure compliance with
existing federal parity requirements and ultimately increase access to
life-saving behavioral health care.”“Correcting discriminatory
insurer practices is critical to removing the stigma surrounding addiction and
increasing access to evidence-based treatment for substance use disorder. The
American Society of Addiction Medicine fully supports the Parity Enforcement
Act, which would provide much-needed enforcement of existing federal parity law
and help more Americans access comprehensive addiction treatment services,” said Paul H. Earley, MD, DFASAM, immediate past
president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM).""Giving the
Department of Labor the authority to impose civil monetary penalties on health
plans and insurers for violating the parity law is a critical next step for
improved accountability. The Department's report to Congress earlier this year
demonstrated that despite increased transparency, plans and insurers are still
falling short of full compliance. We appreciate Senator Murphy’s continued
efforts to ensure true mental health parity enforcement,” said APA CEO and
Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A. Earlier this year, Murphy and
U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) introduced legislation to reauthorize the historic federal
mental health and substance use disorder programs that were signed into law in
2016 as part of their Mental Health Reform Act and strengthen existing mental
health and substance use disorder parity laws.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-loan-forgiveness-is-a-first-step-in-helping-students-and-families-but-we-also-have-to-get-serious-about-holding-colleges-accountable-for-leaving-students-worse-off,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
Committee, on Tuesday spoke at a press conference in Hartford to highlight the
impact of the Biden administration’s decision to cancel $10,000 in federal
student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 a year (or households
earning $250,000 or less a year) and up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell
Grants, extend the pause on federal student loan payments through the end of
2022, and establish a new income-driven
repayment plan for federal loan borrowers.Murphy highlighted
the impact of President Biden’s decision on Connecticut: “[T]his reform –
forgiving debt, but also reducing the monthly payments – it's a really big deal for Connecticut. It's going to convince
a lot of younger people to stay in our state and work here. And it's going to
convince a lot of young workers to come to Connecticut, because we have it all.
We have so many things going for us as a state, and when we can reduce the cost
of living just a little bit, well that makes all of Connecticut’s other advantages
shine even more brightly.”“I just
finished up doing a business walk on Pratt Street in Hartford. There’s new
businesses, new retail establishments, new restaurants coming back to downtown
Hartford. Now all of a sudden, there's going to be hundreds of thousands of
nurses and teachers that are going to be able to bring a little bit of extra
money into the retail and consumer economy,” Murphy continued.Murphy also
called for greater federal accountability of higher education: “I'm an
accountability hawk when it comes to higher education. I've introduced several
pieces of legislation to dramatically reform the federal government's
relationship with colleges. I don't think we should be giving federal aid to
schools that are scamming kids. I don't think we should be giving aid to
schools where only a small percentage are graduating. I think we should expect
performance from colleges. We should expect colleges to get students to
completion. We should expect colleges to get students and graduates into jobs
that pay enough to be able to pay back their loans.”A full
transcript of his remarks can be found below:“Listen, student
debt is absolutely crippling to Americans generally, but to people here in
Connecticut specifically.  “Why does
President Biden's action matter so much to us here in Connecticut? Well, I'll
tell you why. It's expensive as a young person to decide to start your life in
Connecticut. Housing costs a little bit more. The cost of living is a little
bit higher. Quality of life is better here, healthcare outcomes are better in
Connecticut, educational outcomes are better in Connecticut. But costs are a
little bit higher.“And so for a lot
of young people who are thinking of moving to Connecticut, or who are thinking
of staying in Connecticut, paying $1,000 less a month in student loan costs
might be the difference between being here in this state or moving somewhere
else.“So this reform –
forgiving debt, but also reducing the monthly payments – it's a really big deal for Connecticut. It's going to convince
a lot of younger people to stay in our state and work here. And it's going to
convince a lot of young workers to come to Connecticut, because we have it all.
We have so many things going for us as a state, and when we can reduce the cost
of living just a little bit, well that makes all of Connecticut’s other
advantages shine even more brightly.“Every year,
there's a reporter in Washington that writes about the members of Congress that
still have student loan debt. I'm still on that list. I have private loans, not
public loans. But both my wife and I put ourselves through graduate school and
have been paying back the loans. Now, we can afford to pay back those loans.
We’re at the end of their term.“But 400,000
people in the state benefiting from President Biden's proposal, that's serious.
That’s money that is going to allow families to stay in Connecticut, invest in
Connecticut. That's going to be money that goes straight back into the
Connecticut economy.“I just finished
up doing a business walk on Pratt Street in Hartford. There’s new businesses,
new retail establishments, new restaurants coming back to downtown Hartford.
Now all of a sudden, there's going to be hundreds of thousands of nurses and
teachers that are going to be able to bring a little bit of extra money into
the retail and consumer economy.“And as Dick
mentioned, while the headline has been the forgiveness of debt – that's a big deal: $10,000 up to $20,000 in
Pell Grants – the changes to the existing
repayment structure are just as significant.“What Biden's
proposal means is that nobody who has a federal student loan is going to pay
more than 5% of their discretionary income to student loan payments. But the
way that discretionary income is defined effectively means that anybody making
less than $30,000 in this country won't be paying any in student loans if you
have a federal student loan. There are still starting salaries here in
Connecticut that are easily getting below $30,000.“So this is a big
deal, and I'll end here before turning it over… I agree with Dick that this is
just the first step. I'm an accountability hawk when it comes to higher
education. I've introduced several pieces of legislation to dramatically reform
the federal government's relationship with colleges. I don't think we should be
giving federal aid to schools that are scamming kids. I don't think we should
be giving aid to schools where only a small percentage are graduating.“I think we
should expect performance from colleges. We should expect colleges to get
students to completion. We should expect colleges to get students and graduates
into jobs that pay enough to be able to pay back their loans.“So I think we've
got to get serious when it comes to accountability in higher education. But the
first step is to just make sure that the cost of education isn't bankrupting
people and workers in this country. This is a really important step forward.
So, again, a big thanks to President Biden for seeing this through.“I would argue
the impact of this loan forgiveness and payment reduction plan is going to be
bigger in Connecticut, then maybe anywhere else in the nation. We have a bigger
share of our citizens with college degrees, and we have a slightly higher cost
of living, so this relief goes a longer way in a state like Connecticut. A
really big deal for the state of Connecticut.” ###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-op-ed-in-the-economist-our-taiwan-policy-must-evolve-without-abandoning-strategic-ambiguity,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, authored
an op-ed in the Economist
arguing that China’s aggressive actions against Taiwan demand a response, but
we should make changes to our Taiwan policy carefully and thoughtfully to
advance our interests, make Taiwan safer, and avoid a catastrophic war with
China.On China’s aggressive actions towards Taiwan, Murphy said: “Today this
delicate peace is under greater threat than ever before as saber-rattling from
China grows louder and the reality of an invasion creeps closer. In 1995
China’s defense budget was about twice the size of Taiwan’s. Today it is 20
times larger. Over the past two decades, China has implemented the largest
military buildup of any country in the world. This buildup is not just to
strengthen President Xi’s nationalist bona fides at home, but to enable China
to exercise influence as a rising global power—and China is now eagerly and
regularly flexing its military muscles on Taiwan’s doorstep.”On the importance of the policy of strategic ambiguity for
maintaining peace, Murphy said: “For the past four decades, Republican and Democratic
American presidents have maintained the policy of ‘strategic ambiguity’ toward
the defense of Taiwan, maintaining the capacity and military capabilities to
defend the island against attack by China without explicitly committing America
to doing so. And the policy has been a success, preserving peace for those four
decades...Our policy has also kept our most important security allies across
the world, especially in Europe, together on Taiwan strategy.”Murphy warned against those who are clamoring to abandon
strategic ambiguity without adequately considering the consequences: “Some in
Congress and on the Washington think-tank circuit have taken this moment to
argue that American policy should abandon strategic ambiguity in favor of ‘strategic
clarity’ by functionally recognizing Taiwan and extending an explicit security
guarantee to the island, declaring that America will defend it with American
troops. But of course, it is not necessary to do a complete reversal of decades
of Taiwan policy to still make a serious pivot that appropriately responds to
China’s aggression.”He continued: “The question we should be asking is a simple one: what
policy changes will make Taiwan more secure, and decrease the likelihood of
armed conflict with China? Some of the proposals floated by the ‘strategic
clarity’ proponents—de facto diplomatic recognition of Taiwan’s independence,
officially declaring Taiwan a Major Non-NATO Ally, telegraphing the expected
American military response to hostile acts by Chinese forces, or formally
announcing the potential diplomatic, economic and military consequences we
would impose on China in advance of an invasion—fail to clear that bar. They do
little practically to aid Taiwan’s defense, and instead mostly just fan the
flames of Chinese nationalism. It’s important to remember that today, Taiwan is
not ready to defend itself adequately against invasion.”Murphy laid out policies that would benefit Taiwan’s
security, including: First, we certainly should mobilize and expedite more arms
deliveries to Taiwan…Second, Congress can grant the president new authority to
mete out crushing sanctions against Chinese decision-makers should they move
against Taiwan…Third, through assistance programs, we should double down on our
investments overseas to counter Chinese influence campaigns designed to
undermine Taiwan’s democracy or coerce allies like Lithuania from working with
Taiwan. Fourth, we should push for Taiwan’s representation in international
bodies and multilateral institutions, countering China’s attempts to isolate
the island diplomatically.” You can read the full op-ed here.

the longstanding ties between our nations and reaffirmed Congress’s commitment
to the region. I appreciated the opportunity to be one of the first delegations
to meet with Colombia’s new government, and I commend their commitment to
building prosperity for all Colombians,” said Murphy. “The trafficking
of guns into Mexico and fentanyl into the United States are problems we must
solve by working together, and we had productive conversations about doing more
to stop these drugs and weapons from crossing the border. Right now, neither
the U.S. nor Mexico is doing enough. We also met with NGOs and civil society
experts doing critical democracy promotion and human rights work to learn how
the U.S. can be a better partner in those efforts. At Mexico’s southern border,
we met with migrants who had escaped violence in their home countries and
discussed economic development with Tabasco Governor Campos. I’m glad Representatives
García and Bush joined me for this important trip, and we’re grateful to our
hosts and the embassy staff in Colombia and Mexico for their support.  ”“We had productive meetings in Colombia where we
reiterated our partnership and support as President Petro implements his
progressive and inclusive agenda. In Mexico, Secretary Marcelo Ebrard expressed
a commitment to work together towards solutions that will allow Mexican
undocumented seniors to have access to health care and Social Security benefits
so they can have a dignified retirement. I look forward to working with leaders
of both countries as they implement needed reforms,” said García.“Our Congressional delegation’s visit to Colombia and
Mexico highlighted how critical collaboration is in addressing regional and
economic security, mass migration, and racial equity,” said Bush. “It is
clear that our country’s foreign policy must focus on strengthening bilateral
efforts to advance social, racial, and economic equity. United States policies
have a significant impact on human rights, and our work is to make sure that
those rights are valued and protected. I am grateful to have had the
opportunity to meet with human rights groups and progressive lawmakers in each
of these countries and will proudly carry these conversations with me as we

Senado de los EE. UU. y Presidente del Subcomité de Asignaciones de Seguridad
Nacional del Senado de los EE. UU., encabezará el lunes una delegación del
Congreso con el Representante de los EE.
UU. Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill .-04) y la
Representante de los Estados Unidos Cori Bush (D-Mo.-01) a Colombia y
México. Murphy, García y Bush viajarán a Colombia como la primera delegación
del Congreso en reunirse con el presidente Gustavo Petro desde su toma de
posesión. También se reunirán con otros funcionarios electos y miembros de la
sociedad civil en Bogotá. En México, los tres viajarán a la Ciudad de México y
al estado de Tabasco para reunirse con funcionarios electos, miembros de la
sociedad civil, autoridades locales de inmigración y asilo y ONGs para discutir
la relación entre Estados Unidos y México, así como los lazos comerciales,
derechos humanos, el tráfico de armas y drogas, los esfuerzos anticorrupción y
las causas profundas de la migración.“Por muchos años, Colombia y México han sido socios importantes de los Estados Unidos, y
es fundamental que sigamos profundizando esas relaciones. Esta visita es una
oportunidad para reunirse con funcionarios gubernamentales, líderes
empresariales, miembros de la sociedad civil y ONG para discutir formas en que
podemos trabajar juntos para expandir las oportunidades económicas, mantener
seguras a las comunidades e implementar una estrategia efectiva sobre migración.
Espero un viaje productivo que fortalezca nuestros lazos con la región,” dijo Murphy.“México y Colombia son socios clave de Estados Unidos, no solo por el
comercio, sino por los millones de personas que viven en nuestro país y que
tienen sus raíces en esos países,” dijo García. “Como el primer migrante de México elegido para el
Congreso del Medio Oeste, estoy ansioso por discutir cómo asociarme con el
presidente Petro y apoyar su agenda progresista e inclusiva. En México, espero
dar voz a la comunidad que represento discutiendo temas importantes para mis
electores, incluida nuestra estrategia general para abordar la reforma
migratoria, el respeto por los derechos humanos y la búsqueda de soluciones a
la violencia que no se centren en la estrategia fallida de una mayor
militarización.”“La relación de Estados Unidos con Colombia y México como socios juega
un papel fundamental en el mantenimiento de la seguridad social y económica
internacional,” dijo Bush. “Visitare estos
países con mis colegas, el senador Chris Murphy y el representante Chuy García,
y espero reunirme con líderes progresistas recientemente electos para discutir
cómo podemos promover aún más los derechos humanos, examinar las causas
profundas de la migración, abordar el racismo sistémico y la desigualdad que
afecta comunidades negras e indígenas, abordar la crisis climática global que
daña a nuestro planeta y a las generaciones futuras, y obtener una comprensión
más profunda de los efectos de la política exterior de EE. UU. en América Latina.”

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday released the following statement
after the U.S. Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act:“For
decades, Big Pharma and the fossil fuel lobby blocked every effort in Congress
to shift power from these corporate elites to
struggling Americans. The Inflation Reduction Act will lower drug
prices for seniors, cut health care costs, invest in clean energy, cut electricity costs, all while creating millions of
jobs and making sure big corporations and the wealthy finally pay their fair
share. Like the gun safety bill represented a
fundamental break from the era of gun industry control of Washington, this bill
marks a break from decades of oil industry and drug company ownership of
federal policy. This bill will make life better and cheaper for regular Americans,
and it stands as part of an unprecedented string of legislative successes by
this Congress,”
said Murphy.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-colleagues-introduce-new-bipartisan-bill-to-support-economic-development-promote-democratic-resilience-and-combat-corruption-in-the-balkans,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, and U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Roger Wicker
(R-Miss.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.)
and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) introduced new bipartisan legislation, the Western
Balkans Democracy and Prosperity Act. This legislation would support
economic development in the region through initiatives on infrastructure, trade
and anti-corruption, including codification of sanctions to deter destabilizing
activity In the Western Balkans.“Maintaining
peace in the Balkans is critical to European security, especially as Putin
grows more desperate in Ukraine and may turn to other countries for a victory.
During my trip to the region this spring, it was clear the United States must
deepen our engagement. This legislation will strengthen U.S.-Balkan ties,
expand economic opportunity, and support efforts to advance democracy and root
out corruption,” said Murphy.“Amid
Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine and Putin’s clear ambitions to spread malign
influence across Eastern Europe, the United States’ relationship with the
Western Balkans is pivotal. That’s why I’m proud to introduce new bipartisan
legislation that strengthens trade and investments between the U.S. and Western
Balkans, while rooting out local corruption and codifying sanctions against
destabilizing actors – all of which pave the way for greater Euro-Atlantic
integration,” said Shaheen.
“When I traveled to the Western Balkans in the Spring, I met with young leaders
who shared their dreams of building a prosperous future in countries with
strong democratic institutions and economic opportunity. Their stories – their
visions of building a brighter future for the next generation – inspired my
legislation. This region deserves every tool possible to build sustainable
democracies, and I’m proud to lead this bipartisan bill that would foster
relations between the U.S. and our Balkan partners and encourage greater
regional integration.” “The Balkans are countries with a rich and varied heritage, and they also occupy an increasingly important position in European affairs,” said Wicker. “This bill would send a strong bipartisan signal that the United States is committed to supporting diplomacy in the region.” “As
Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine rages on, we must not forget the hard won
peace in the Balkans, which suffered terrible violence after the breakup of
Yugoslavia.  The United States and our allies contributed greatly to
ending that horrific conflict, and this legislation reaffirms our commitment to
seeing a stable future for the region—one squarely rooted in the West,” said
Durbin.
“The Balkans region is critical to Europe’s security,
and we must deepen existing engagement with our partners as Russia continues
its illegal war against Ukraine and threatens our NATO allies,” said
Tillis. “In the spring, I was proud to visit Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Kosovo, and Belgium with Senator Shaheen to hear from leaders of these
countries and relay to our colleagues the importance of expanding economic
opportunity and combating corruption. This bipartisan legislation will
demonstrate our support for their efforts to advance democracy, and I will work
with my colleagues to build support and pass it out of Congress.”“Despite
Putin’s intent, his bloody war in Ukraine has not weakened our global
alliances, but bolstered them. Increasing our partnerships with the Western
Balkans will allow us to build on this and spur new economic cooperation
between our nations. This legislation will help us capitalize on these
opportunities as we continue to support strengthening democracy in the region,”
said Van Hollen.“While
the Western Balkan nations have made great strides towards democratic
governance since the end of the Yugoslav Wars, increasing political divisions
and corruption threaten to erode this progress,” said
Cardin. “We must continue to support our democratic partners and allies in
the Balkans. This bipartisan bill will advance regional stability and
anti-corruption efforts by establishing programs that encourage inclusive
economic development, national anti-corruption strategy, and hold accountable
those who threaten peace in the Western Balkans.”Specifically,
the Western Balkans Democracy and Prosperity Act: ·       Establishes a regional trade and economic competitiveness initiative, which would support democratic resilience, economic development and prosperity in the region. ·        Establishes an anti-corruption initiative that directs the Secretary of State to provide technical assistance for each country in the Western Balkans to develop a national anti-corruption strategy.  ·         Codifies two U.S. executive orders that would grant authority for sanctions against those who threaten peace and stability in the Western Balkans and are engaged in corrupt behavior.  ·        Boosts university partnerships, encourages Peace Corps engagement in the region, creates a Balkans Youth Leadership Initiative and requires the Development Finance Corporation to open a previously announced office in the region. Full text of the bill is available here. Murphy recently participated in a bipartisan congressional delegation with Shaheen and Tillis to the Balkans to convey continued U.S. support for its allies amid Russian aggression against Ukraine and the implications for European security in the region. During their visit, the Senators met with members of the respective countries’ governments, members of civil society and members of the press to address numerous issues, including support for the region amid Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, anti-corruption efforts, democratic reforms, youth engagement, safeguarding freedom of the press and more.   ###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-chairs-hearing-on-chinas-role-in-the-middle-east,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and
Counterterrorism, on Thursday held a subcommittee
hearing on China’s role in the Middle East.“There’s
no question that China’s growing presence in the Middle East presents a
challenge to the United States that we have to confront. With such a large U.S.
military footprint in the region, we must assure that China does not get its
hands on our most sensitive technology. Frankly, that’s why I’ve opposed
selling F-35s and our Reaper drones to the UAE. And while Middle East oil
doesn’t matter to us as much as it used to, it still matters. And so we don’t
want China to get a monopoly on the Middle East energy trade. China is also an attractive partner to
dictators in the region who are looking for more tools of repression and
surveillance that the Chinese have perfected. As the world’s leading human
rights and democracy defender, the U.S. should push back on the spread of these
tools of repression,” Murphy said.On
China’s limitations in the region, Murphy said: “[W]e should recognize that while
China’s influence in the region is increasing, it has its limits, and that the
United States’ commitment to the region — despite much hyped fears of
abandonment — continues, as we remain the leading security partner for every
country in the region (except, of course, for Iran). We shouldn’t be so
insecure as to believe that our partners in the Middle East think China can be
taken seriously as an alternative to the United States. For example, while the
U.S. preserves the security of shipping lanes in the Gulf as a global public
good, it’s hard to imagine China acting to preserve anything but its own
shipments. And let’s face it — if a war erupted between the Arab Gulf countries
and Iran, the Chinese navy is not sailing to anyone’s defense.Murphy
highlighted the opportunity to reset U.S.-Gulf relations: “Recognizing these limitations to
China’s influence gives us real leverage with the region, and we need to use it
to reset our relationships. For decades, our approach to the Middle East has
been overly militarized at the expense of economic diversification and
inclusive political reform. Which leads me to my last and most important point:
We should not deprioritize political and economic reform priorities in the
Middle East for the sake of competing with China. Poor, corrupt, and unequal
societies make for a combustible mix that can quickly cause superficially
stable regimes to collapse quickly. In the long run, the most stable countries
are democracies, and we should not lose sight of that goal.”A full
transcript of Murphy’s opening remarks can be found below:MUPRHY: “We
convene the subcommittee today to discuss China’s role in the Middle East.
Thank you to our witness for being here today as well as my colleagues.“As much
as it’s possible in an open setting, my goal in this hearing is to have a frank
conversation so that we can appropriately factor China’s Middle East goals as
we right size American goals.“The
United States has been the dominant power in the Middle East for decades.
America’s deal with regional despots — particularly in the Gulf — has long been
a straightforward one: providing security in exchange for the steady provision
of oil to the global economy. But for the past 20 years, several of the
dynamics that underpinned this arrangement have changed.“First,
back in 1980, the United States relied heavily on energy imports to power our
economy. At that time, one third of the oil used in the U.S. came from the
Persian Gulf. Today, the United States produces as much oil as it gets from
abroad, and only 9 percent of those imports comes from Gulf countries.“Today,
the U.S. is not totally dependent on Gulf fossil fuels. But China is. Today,
more than 50 percent of China’s oil comes from the Gulf states.“Second,
our allies in the Gulf no longer honor the deal made decades ago. Even though
we still have a big physical military presence in the Gulf — bigger than ever
before — and we keep giving Gulf nations a pass on human rights
violations, too often our Middle East allies act in conflict with our security
interests. Recently, for instance, it took a high profile trip from the
American President to Riyadh in order to simply convince our supposed allies
into producing enough oil to address spiraling global prices. “And
third, today China now needs the Middle East more than we do. Consider this
stunning fact — the value of Saudi fossil fuel exports to China has grown from
$1.5 billion in 2000, just about twenty years ago, to $43 billion in 2021. It’s
no secret why China is deepening its ties to the region. It’s the Chinese
economy, not the U.S. economy, that has become completely dependent on Middle
East oil.“This
hearing gives us an opportunity to explore China’s role in the Middle East, and
help us craft a policy that enables us to counter China’s influence in the
areas that threaten U.S. interests while finding ways to cooperate in the
limiting areas where our interests align.“There’s
no question that China’s growing presence in the Middle East presents a challenge
to the United States that we have to confront. With such a large U.S. military
footprint in the region, we must assure that China does not get its hands on
our most sensitive technology. Frankly, that’s why I’ve opposed selling F-35s
and our Reaper drones to the UAE.“And while
Middle East oil doesn’t matter to us as much as it used to, it still matters.
And so we don’t want China to get a monopoly on the Middle East energy trade.“China is
also an attractive partner to dictators in the region who are looking for more
tools of repression and surveillance that the Chinese have perfected. As the
world’s leading human rights and democracy defender, the U.S. should push back
on the spread of these tools of repression.“But, at
the same time, I hope this hearing considers whether it’s worthwhile to
approach every Middle East issue through a lens of U.S.-China competition. For
example, China’s recent sale of armed drones to Saudi Arabia does not mean that
we should rush to provide them ourselves; the Saudis have a clear record of
misusing such weapons against civilians in Yemen, and we are right to distance
ourselves from those abuses. In addition, Chinese investments into the vanity
projects of shiny new cities for Egypt’s President Sisi and Saudi’s Crown
Prince MBS — they pose questionable returns for investors. There’s no
compelling reason why the U.S. should be seeking to counter China’s investments
into these projects with our own funding.“And of
course there are areas where China and the U.S. share interests. We shouldn’t
ignore them. For example, both China and the United States have a shared
interest in secure shipping lanes in the Gulf. Both benefit from an Iranian
nuclear deal to avoid regional nuclear proliferation. Both the U.S. and China benefit
from stability in the region.“Finally,
we should recognize that while China’s influence in the region is increasing,
it has its limits, and that the United States’ commitment to the region —
despite much hyped fears of abandonment — continues, as we remain the leading
security partner for every country in the region (except, of course, for Iran).
We shouldn’t be so insecure as to believe that our partners in the Middle East
think China can be taken seriously as an alternative to the United States. For
example, while the U.S. preserves the security of shipping lanes in the Gulf as
a global public good, it’s hard to imagine China acting to preserve anything
but its own shipments. And let’s face it — if a war erupted between the Arab
Gulf countries and Iran, the Chinese navy is not sailing to anyone’s defense.“Recognizing
these limitations to China’s influence gives us real leverage with the region,
and we need to use it to reset our relationships. For decades, our approach to
the Middle East has been overly militarized at the expense of economic
diversification and inclusive political reform. Which leads me to my last and
most important point: We should not deprioritize political and economic reform
priorities in the Middle East for the sake of competing with China. Poor,
corrupt, and unequal societies make for a combustible mix that can quickly
cause superficially stable regimes to collapse quickly. In the long run, the
most stable countries are democracies, and we should not lose sight of that goal.“I look
forward to the witness’s testimony today to learn more about how the State
Department is diagnosing and taking on this important issue. With that, I’ll
turn to the Ranking Member for his opening remarks.”###

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, on Wednesday released the following statement after the U.S. Senate
voted to ratify Finland and Sweden as members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). The vote was 95-1.“Expanding NATO to include
Finland and Sweden advances U.S. national security interests and sends a strong
signal to the Kremlin that the alliance is stronger than ever. Putin’s playbook
has long been to stoke chaos and sow divisions in the West in order to grow Russia’s
sphere of influence. The United States and our European partners have stood
united in support of Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion. Today’s vote
is a reminder that NATO’s door remains open, and I congratulate the people of
Finland and Sweden on this historic day,” said Murphy.In May, Murphy signed a letter
urging President Biden urging him to expedite the Executive Branch’s process to
advance Sweden and Finland’s applications for NATO membership and pledging to
work with the administration to ensure swift ratification of the Washington
Treaty.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-co-sponsor-legislation-to-protect-doctors-from-republicans-anti-abortion-attacks,"WASHINGTON–U.S.
Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal
(D-Conn.) joined 23 of their Senate colleagues
in introducing the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act
to protect doctors against Republicans’ non-stop attacks and ensure they can
safely provide abortion care in states where it is still legal. This week, the
Senators will take to the Senate floor to seek unanimous consent to pass the
legislation.Republicans’ nonstop attacks against
women’s reproductive freedom has long targeted doctors, with state laws like
Texas’ SB8 allowing for anyone to bring a lawsuit against an abortion provider.
But in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade,
these attacks have ramped up—with Republican state legislators drafting
legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion on a state
resident even in another state where abortion is legal. And already,
abortion providers are facing non-stop attacks from Republican politicians,
including Dr. Caitlin Bernard — an abortion provider who is facing legal
threats after providing legal abortion care to a 10-year-old rape victim who
was forced to cross state lines. Dr. Bernard’s case is emblematic of what
abortion providers across the country are facing, as Republicans lob legal
threats and intimidate doctors providing legal abortion care.The Let Doctors Provide
Reproductive Health Care Act will protect against these attacks, ensuring
that providers in states where abortion remains legal are protected from any
efforts to restrict their practice or create uncertainty about their legal
liability.“In the wake of the
Dobbs decision, we knew Republicans would start going after doctors who provide
legal abortions, and that’s exactly what’s happening. It’s critical we protect
the ability of doctors to do their job in states like Connecticut where
abortion remains legal. This legislation will ensure they can continue
providing care without the threat of prosecution,” said Murphy.“No doctor should be punished,
threatened, intimidated or attacked for providing patients with abortion care.
Reproductive rights and health care are under attack across the nation and we
must do everything in our power to protect doctors performing legal abortion
services from the very real threats they now face. Doctors take an oath to do
no harm and provide the best care possible for their patients. Congress must
pass this legislation to protect doctors’ ability to provide health care free
from political interference,” Blumenthal
said.“As a full-spectrum OBGYN and abortion
provider, I wholeheartedly appreciate the Senate’s effort to create legislation
that protects our ability to provide important reproductive healthcare for our
patients. I have experienced personal and professional harassment for simply
doing my job, including inflammatory and intimidating statements from the
highest levels of my home state government and threats of violence from people
I have never met. This behavior cannot continue,” said Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who has
endorsed the legislation. “Living in a state with one of the highest
maternal mortality risks and with a severe shortage of OBGYN specialists, I can
say firsthand how much people in my state need the care I and other OBGYNs
provide. If we do not stop this state-sanctioned harassment, we will lose
OBGYNs and health risks will increase substantially. I stand with our Senators
to promote the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act to preserve our
ability provide important health services in my home state, including abortion
care.”“Imagine
looking someone in the eye and saying: ‘I have all the skills and the tools to
help you, but our state’s politicians have told me I can’t,’” said Dr. Nisha Verma with Physicians
for Reproductive Health. “As a doctor, I am being forced to grapple with
impossible situations more and more–situations where the laws of my state
directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training and
the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients. I am heartbroken that
the people in my communities in the South are not able to access the same
quality of care as those living in other parts of the country, not because
their doctors don’t have the skills or knowledge to provide that care, but
because they are prohibited from doing so by abortion bans that are based
solely on politics. Politics. Not medicine.”“Being an abortion provider means
being for our communities, supporting them and providing care in the way they
want or need. It also means living with the threat of surveillance, harassment,
intimidation and violence from those that seek to eliminate abortion access and
harm providers of this care. This is our reality,” said Dr. Jamila Perritt, an OBGYN and
President & CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Considering the
long history of harm against abortion providers, I am glad to see Congress
introducing the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act. Every
person—abortion providers, supporters, staff, every person in our
community—deserves support and protection. We deserve to what we are trained to
do: provide comprehensive reproductive health care that patients need without
bias, shame, or stigma. We deserve to provide this essential health care
without violence or harassment.”The Let Doctors Provide
Reproductive Health Care Act will ensure that providers in states where
abortion remains legal are protected from any efforts to restrict their
practice or create uncertainty about their legal liability. Specifically, the
bill will:·        
Protect
health care providers in states where abortion is legal from being subject to
laws that try to prevent them from providing reproductive health care services
or make them liable for providing those services to patients from any other
state. These protections could be enforced by a federal lawsuit from the
Department of Justice, a patient, or a provider, ensuring a future Department
of Justice could not turn a blind eye to state laws that violate these
protections;·        
Prohibit
any federal funds from being used to pursue legal cases against individuals who
access legal reproductive health care services or against health care providers
in states where abortion is legal;·        
Create
a new grant program at the Department of Justice to fund legal assistance or
legal education for reproductive health care service providers;·        
Create
a new grant program at the Department of Health and Human Services to support
reproductive health care service providers in obtaining physical, cyber, or
data privacy security upgrades necessary to protect their practice and
patients; and·        
Protect
reproductive health care providers from being denied professional liability
insurance coverage because of legal services offered to patients.Joining Murphy and Blumenthal, U.S. Senators

Chris Murphy (D-Conn), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security, on Wednesday introduced legislation to
prevent the Secret Service from unilaterally withholding records from the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General (IG).The Secret Service Transparency and Accountability Act
would amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to clarify that the Privacy Act
or Presidential Records Act cannot be used as a basis to deny records to the
IG, to ensure that the decision to deny the IG access to records cannot be
delegated to any Director or Agency head, and to increase transparency by requiring
the IG to brief Congress on audits, inspections, evaluations, and settlement
agreements.“While I share the
concerns of my colleagues about the actions of the current Inspector General,
it is also clear the Secret Service tried to impede the Inspector General’s
investigation into the events of January 6th by withholding
records and ultimately erasing text messages. This legislation would prevent
the Secret Service from undermining the work of the agency watchdog, and stop
them from keeping the American people in the dark about things they deserve to
know,” said Murphy.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-op-ed-on-cnn-the-electoral-count-act-as-written-provides-too-many-avenues-for-abuse,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) authored
an op-ed on CNN.com
to discuss the legislation
he and a bipartisan group of senators introduced to reform and modernize the
antiquated Electoral Count Act of 1887. Murphy laid out why it’s critical to
get this done before the end of the year.“Trump and his band of loyalists are
responsible for what happened on January 6, but there is no doubt that the
Electoral Count Act, as currently written, provides far too many avenues for
abuse from those who want to replace American democracy with American
monarchy,” said Murphy.On increasing the threshold for
objections to slates of electors, Murphy said: “Our bill raises the threshold – from just one member to one-fifth
of the House and Senate – for objections to elector slates, in order to prevent
a handful of bad-faith actors from using the objection process to force
Congress to debate and vote on spurious objections.On ensuring states
certify results that reflect the will of the voters, Murphy said: “[O]ur bill requires states to certify and transmit the
results of their election to Congress according to the laws in place before the
election occurred – and prohibits a state from changing the rules of how
electors are chosen after the election.”On the role of the vice president,
Murphy said: “The bill eliminates any uncertainty about the vice
president’s authority to unilaterally throw out votes – there is none – and
makes reforms to reduce the concern that votes will be thrown out in a
bad-faith attempt to let the House choose the next president.”On the process of
federal judicial review, Murphy said: “[T]he bill sets up a new, expedited
path in the federal courts to settle any contests over electors, before the
controversy gets to the Congress.”Murphy concluded:
“While
I am confident that the bill we introduced will address many of problems we saw
during the 2020 election, I am the first to admit it will not address a
critical shortcoming in our federal voting laws, namely a lack of statutory
prohibitions against the measures some states are taking to restrict
citizens’ right to vote. We should pass this bill, but we should know that it
is just the first step in restoring faith in our democracy.”You can read the full op-ed here.###

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations
Committee, and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday announced the
inclusion of over $107 million for Connecticut Congressionally Directed
Spending projects in eight bills posted by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
These bills are not yet final, and funding will only be made available when the
appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. However, the Appropriations Committee’s selection of these projects is an important
first step towards securing federal funding. Murphy and Blumenthal are
committed to pushing for passage of these bills and ensuring Connecticut
priorities are reflected in the final spending package.“I’m a member of the
Appropriations Committee to make sure the federal budget puts money into
Connecticut projects that help our economy and help families. This draft budget
includes targeted, local funding for projects that support workforce
development and economic growth, help us protect Long Island Sound, and make
important infrastructure improvements. We still have a great deal of work to do
to make this draft budget a reality, but I am committed to working to get this
over the finish line,” said Murphy.“This
potential funding will pack a powerful punch for CT’s economic growth and
quality of life. These requests represent millions of dollars in funding that
Connecticut has asked me to fight for in D.C. and bring home for critical
infrastructure projects and social services. From reducing gun violence to
improving transportation infrastructure to job training and much more, these
projects make important and invaluable contributions not only to their
communities, but to our state as a whole. Senator Murphy and I will continue
advocating and fighting for these projects and I urge my colleagues in the
Senate to pass the appropriations bill so these organizations can get to work

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-this-is-a-coordinated-republican-led-effort-to-put-more-women-under-government-control,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Thursday took to the U.S. Senate floor to
call out Senate Republicans’ continued efforts to block legislation that would
protect women’s reproductive freedoms in the wake of Dobbs.Murphy highlighted
Republicans’ success in blocking the Freedom
to Travel for Health Care Act and the Right to Contraception Act: “A few weeks ago, on this floor, Republicans
refused to allow a debate on a bill that simply says government can't tell
women which states they can travel to in order to receive health care. And
yesterday, Republicans blocked proceeding to a bill that simply says that men
shouldn't be able to stop women from buying birth control.Murphy
continued: “So, put
that all together: You see the pattern emerging here? See what's going on? This
is a pretty coordinated industrial-scale effort to bring women under control of
the state, to take away decades of rights' accumulation from women, and put
them back where they were in the 1940s to the 1930s. This is a massive
coordinated effort by Republicans to put more women under government control.”On the efforts to restrict
access to contraception at the state level, Murphy said: “Other Republicans will say that these are imagined
crises, that states really aren't going to ban birth control. But just pay
attention to what's happening in state legislatures, right now. All over the
country, states are trying to restrict women from accessing contraception
because — many Republicans will tell you — that protecting life, in their view,
involves banning the use of birth control.“[T]his isn't a fake crisis.
This is real. And I'm not making up this new wholesale Republican effort to try
to drag women back 100 years and to sideline them in a way that we thought was
history. That's all real too. And we will give Republicans the chance, over and
over again, to prove that wrong,” Murphy concluded.A full transcript of his
remarks can be found below:MURPHY: “Mr. President, I
came down to the floor to talk about something that happened yesterday, as
well: that was an effort by Democrats to get a bill on the floor that would
protect women's access to contraception. And Republicans, predictably, blocked
that bill from receiving consideration. And I want to talk about the broader
picture of what's going on here today.“J.D. Vance is a candidate
for the United States Senate. He's a Republican star; he's maybe the party's
highest profile candidate running for the Senate. And here's what he said about
men who beat up their wives. He said, ‘One
of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American
populace’ was convincing people in unhappy or violent marriages that getting
divorced would make them happier. Women should stop complaining, he suggests,
about getting the crap beat out of them. Stop trying to leave abusive husbands
and just stick it out.’“Senator Hawley, a few months
ago, gave a whole speech explaining how men have certain virtues critical to
the maintenance of the American Republic — like aggression and competitiveness
and independence — that women don't have in equal measure. He made a pretty
unapologetic case for the superiority of men over women. Marjorie Taylor Greene
— who is the biggest draw in the Republican Party right now; nobody gets a
bigger crowd than she does — she says women should just accept that they are
‘the weaker sex.’“A few weeks ago, on this
floor, Republicans refused to allow a debate on a bill that simply says
government can't tell women which states they can travel to in order to receive
health care. And yesterday, Republicans blocked proceeding to a bill that
simply says that men shouldn't be able to stop women from buying birth control.“So, put that all together:
You see the pattern emerging here? See what's going on? This is a pretty
coordinated industrial-scale effort to bring women under control of the state,
to take away decades of rights' accumulation from women, and put them back
where they were in the 1940s to the 1930s. This is a massive coordinated effort
by Republicans to put more women under government control. No more abortion
services, no more divorces from your abusive spouses, no more, driving your car
wherever you want. No more birth control. Women are on their way back to
becoming second-class citizens. That's what the cumulative agenda looks like
here. And I don't think I'm paranoid. I don't think I'm over reading the tea
leaves. I'm just picking up the pieces that Republicans keep putting down day
after day after day.“I know Republicans will
dispute this characterization. But if they do, we're going to continually give
them the chance to prove us wrong. Vote for a bill that says states can't ban
birth control. Vote for legislation that says states can't tell women where
they can drive. What we're asking for is — not an expansion of women's rights —
just the protection to make sure that we don't take these big leaps backwards.“Other Republicans will say
that these are imagined crises, that states really aren't going to ban birth
control. But just pay attention to what's happening in state legislatures,
right now. All over the country, states are trying to restrict women from
accessing contraception because — many Republicans will tell you — that
protecting life, in their view, involves banning the use of birth control. In
Texas. The state already bans its family planning centers from distributing
birth control. In Missouri, conservatives are trying to block health providers,
who receive federal funds, from prescribing contraception. And the Supreme Court
in the Dobbs decision basically previewed that it is likely to strike down the
right to birth control sometime soon.“So, this isn't a fake
crisis. This is real. And I'm not making up this new wholesale Republican
effort to try to drag women back 100 years and to sideline them in a way that
we thought was history. That's all real too. And we will give Republicans the
chance, over and over again, to prove that wrong.“I yield the floor.” ###

chain by including funding to the maximum extent possible in the Fiscal Year
(FY) 2023 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.U.S.

text of the letter can be found here and
follows below:Dear Chair Feinstein,We respectfully request
that you support Presidential Determinations 2022-15 through 19, issued
pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act (DPA), by including
funding to the maximum extent possible in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Energy and
Water Appropriations bill.Manufacturing the
components and building the supply chains to power the transition to a clean

worst impacts of the climate crisis, while creating thousands of high-quality
manufacturing jobs here in the United States. As the COVID-19 pandemic and the

a lack of domestic renewable energy manufacturing denies “consumers access to
cost-cutting clean energy options, add(s) risks to our power grid, and stall(s)
domestic clean energy construction projects that are critical to tackling the
climate crisis.” With these Presidential Determinations, President Biden
provided the Department of Energy (DOE) with the authority to use the DPA to
accelerate domestic production of key energy technologies including: solar;
transformers and grid components; heat pumps; insulation; electrolyzers; fuel
cells; and platinum group metals.Not long ago the United
States was the global leader in solar manufacturing but we have allowed China,
which is investing heavily in its own manufacturing, to corner the market for
solar modules and supply chain components. This has reduced American
manufacturing capacity far below domestic solar demand, forcing us to rely on
China for our solar needs, even as it is well documented that China is using
unfair trade practices, including forced labor in parts of the country. The DPA
can help American companies re-establish themselves as leaders in solar
manufacturing, and other technologies, essential to the transition to clean
energy but only if Congress provides DOE with adequate funds to utilize it.We urge you to support
President Biden’s Presidential Determinations by appropriating funds to the
maximum extent possible in the FY 2023 Energy and Water Appropriations bill so
that DOE can effectively utilize the authorities that have been delegated to it
under the DPA.Sincerely,###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-announces-fy23-homeland-security-budget,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.),
Chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security,
released the following statement on the fiscal year
2022 Homeland Security bill, which provides discretionary funding of $81.2
billion. “This bill makes smart investments to ensure the Department of Homeland
Security can tackle threats to our security like climate change and domestic
violent extremism while managing the border in a more humane and practical way.
I’m especially proud of the major increases at FEMA to make communities more
resilient to climate-related disasters and at CISA to strengthen our defense
against cyberattacks. We also continue to invest in humane and effective border
security programs and make important reforms to our immigration laws that will
help reunite more families and address labor shortages. For the first time
ever, this bill also provides funding for CBP to crack down on gun trafficking
through a new initiative that will increase seizures of weapons at the border.
I look forward to working with my colleagues to make these critical investments
a reality,” said MurphyKey Points & HighlightsReforming Our Nation’s Immigration System:  The bill makes a
number of significant reforms to the nation’s immigration laws that seek to
reunite families, meet employer needs, deter irregular migration, and start to
bring a badly outdated immigration system into the current century.  For
instance, currently, some families seeking to lawfully reunite have been
waiting 25 years for a visa to become available and employers are struggling to
find workers.  The bill works toward addressing this problem by
recapturing thousands of lost immigrant and diversity visas, helping deter
irregular migration, reunite these families faster and ensure employers can
hire workers.  Additionally, the bill would help provide stability and
permanency for children who have been determined to have been abused, abandoned,
or neglected by the proper state authorities, by making them exempt from the
numerical limitations in the employment-based visa categories. 
Furthermore, the bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to
make individualized determinations about whether someone should continue to be
detained, in lieu of treating all persons the same regardless of individualized
threat level as current law does today.  Importantly, for the first time
in the DHS appropriations bill, the bill would provide grant funding to support
legal representation for asylum seekers with applications before the United
States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  The bill provides
$866 million, $457 million above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level which
includes funding for the Department to create a safe return program for
unaccompanied children that extends beyond removal from the country and creates
additional safeguards for this vulnerable population. Finally, the bill
requires the issuance of additional H-2B visas to help address workforce
shortages and meet employee needs.Responsibly Meeting Today’s Border Security
Requirements and Improving and Modernizing Capabilities for Tomorrow:  The bill provides
funding to secure our borders today while making investments to improve
planning and leverage technology to create smarter pathways for noncitizens
seeking protection.  The bill provides $700 million for: soft-sided
facilities to humanely and safely process noncitizens encountered at the
border; transportation requirements to prevent overcrowding at facilities; and
other costs relating to border management requirements that provide the tools
needed for the DHS workforce to manage our nation’s borders.  It also
includes $200 million in the Emergency Food and Shelter-Humanitarian program to
provide funding to non-profit organizations, critical partners working with DHS
to offer food, housing, and transportation for noncitizens which ultimately
reduces pressure on Border Patrol operational capabilities.The
bill includes funding to fully implement the proposed asylum officer rule,
which is projected to result in 15 percent fewer cases in the immigration
court.  Such investments help vulnerable asylum seekers obtain lawful
status faster, while increasing government efficiencies by reducing referrals
that add to the immigration court backlog.  Additionally, to evaluate
options for noncitizens seeking protection while also reducing growing pressure
on DHS personnel and capabilities on the southwest border, the accompanying
report to the bill includes direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security to:
(1) review the “Uniting for Ukraine” initiative to leverage the pathways
developed under that initiative for applicability for individuals in Central
and South American countries; and (2) direct Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) and USCIS to work with the State Department on a new pathway that would
allow noncitizens seeking asylum from certain countries in the hemisphere to
apply from their home countries via the CBP OneTM mobile application. 
Both of these assessments present new options for those seeking protection that
would eliminate the need for the dangerous journey many families and
unaccompanied children make to the southwest border, requiring them to pay and
rely on transnational criminal organizations for entry and instead allow, for
those approved, to arrive in the U.S. at a port of entry.Finally,
the bill supports planning for border security, immigration enforcement, and
immigration services requirements by including new language directing the
Secretary of Homeland Security to develop regular projections of arrivals at
the southwest border (broken out by single adults, families, and unaccompanied
children) and to share such projections with the Attorney General, and the
Secretaries of Health and Human Services and State.  Such projections will
help to prevent future imbalances between Federal agencies responsible for
border security, immigration enforcement, and immigration services.  The
Secretary is also directed to use such projections to estimate future workload
on DHS agencies and the requirements that stem from that workload and include
that data in annual budget justifications, providing Congress with critical
data to make informed budget decisions.Strengthening Resiliency of Our Nation’s Communities:  The bill
fortifies Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program with an additional $2 billion on
top of the current available balance of approximately $945 million, a 112
percent increase, to incorporate climate adaptation into national preparedness
and community grants and projects.  BRIC projects reflect an ongoing shift
in federal investments from simply reacting to disasters, to working to
mitigate the effects of disasters—including the loss of life and
property—before they happen.  An independent study by the National
Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) (Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves 2019 Report (nibs.org)) found that
“society will ultimately save $6 for every $1 spent on up-front mitigation
costs.”Reforming TSA Pay Reform:  The bill provides funding to initiate
pay equity for TSA’s dedicated workforce, ensuring that the aviation industry’s
first layer of security is compensated on par with the rest of the federal
workforce and allows TSA to recruit in a competitive employment market. 
Additionally, the pay reform measures include collective bargaining rights and
protections long sought by the TSA workforce and the American Federation of
Government Employees.Customs and Border Protection:  The bill provides
$16.4 billion, $1.7 billion above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for
CBP.  This level of funding equips CBP and its 64,000+ workforce (agents,
officers, trade specialists, agriculture inspection officers, mission support
personnel, and many others) with the resources and tools to facilitate trade
and travel while securing our borders.  It makes investments in a range of
programs for employees, such as $23 million for onsite clinicians, and $23
million for 300 additional processing coordinators to take over processing of
noncitizens, allowing 300 agents and officers to return to the field faster to
patrol our borders and facilitate trade and travel at ports of entry.  New
investments are made at land ports of entry, such as $50 million to combat gun
trafficking for a new initiative dedicated to outbound inspections to increase
seizures of weapons and money (resulting from the sale of narcotics) leaving
the U.S. and $39 million to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning
with non-intrusive inspection capabilities, transforming a manual process that
relies on CBP officers to detect anomalies in cargo and vehicles to an
automated process that alerts CBP officers to the smuggling of illicit cargo
into the U.S. faster (reducing wait times) while improving security.Additionally, $90 million is for combatting
forced labor, including implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention
Act, $50 million for border security technology, continuing efforts to improve
situational awareness at our nation’s borders, and $20 million for the Unified
Immigration Portal, a government-wide capability that allows for the sharing of
information of noncitizens encountered at the border through which agencies
have improved visibility leading to more efficient processing and faster
decision-making, reducing delays and costs.  The bill also expands the
eligible uses for prior-year border barrier construction funding to include
technology at and between ports of entry and environmental mitigation
activities to address impacts of previous border wall construction to
communities along the border.  Further, the bill authorizes the transfer
to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture of up to
$200 million from those prior-year balances for environmental mitigation.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):  The bill includes
$8.13 billion, $119 million below the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for
ICE.  Funding for the average daily population (ADP) of immigration
detention beds in the bill is reduced from 34,000 to 25,000.  As a result,
when compared to fiscal year 2022 enacted, Custody Operations is reduced by
$485 million and Alternatives to Detention is reduced by $98 million.  At
the same time, the bill makes overdue and critical investments in ICE that
increase transparency, increase access to counsel, and improve Congress’
oversight.  For example, $6 million is provided to enhance inspections
related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, $16.6 million to update law libraries
and improve attorney-client access in ICE facilities, $50 million to ensure
that asylum seekers can be transported off the border to their final
destinations, and $18 million to assist immigrant children with case management
services and safe returns with services.  Lastly, $15 million is provided
for a case management pilot project for asylum seekers through the Department
of Health and Human Services, in lieu of ICE.Coast
Guard:  The bill provides $13.92 billion, $475.13 million above the fiscal
year 2022 enacted level, for the Coast Guard.  When mandatory funding is
excluded, the discretionary total is $11.885 billion, $394 million above the
fiscal year 2022 enacted level.  Coast Guard funding within the bill
supports maritime safety and security, including (but not limited to) search
and rescue, drug interdiction, environmental and marine life protection, and
aids to navigation.  The bill continues funding for the recapitalization
and modernization of the Service’s sea, air, and shore assets to ensure the men
and women of the Coast Guard are well-equipped to perform their mission. 
It invests $150 million for the purchase and operation of a
commercially-available polar class icebreaker in order to promote trade and
safety in the Arctic.  The bill includes $1.92 billion for major
acquisitions, including $1.33 billion for vessels, $238 million for aircraft,
and $255 million for construction of shore facilities.  It also includes
critical investments to support the Coast Guard workforce, such as child care,
recruiting and diversity, and tuition assistance.Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA):  The bill provides
$2.91 billion, $318 million and a 12 percent increase above the fiscal year
2022 enacted level, for CISA.  CISA’s programs help to detect and mitigate
the effects of cyber-attacks on Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) governments and the private sector; manage risks to critical
infrastructure, such as the power grid, fuel pipelines, and transportation; and
ensure the continuation of communications capabilities in times of emergency
for our leaders, first responders, and other key officials.  The bill
provides a total of $1.73 billion is for cybersecurity activities, including
protection of federal networks and information sharing with nonfederal
partners; $206 million for infrastructure security programs; and $197 million
for emergency communications. Federal
Emergency Management Administration (FEMA):  The bill includes
$3.87 billion for grants and training to state, local, tribal, and territorial
entities, $242 million above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level.  Fiscal
year 2023 highlights include $360 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant
Program, an increase of $110 million above fiscal year 2022, which provides
funds to nonprofits (including places of worship) to harden their facilities to
mitigate the risk of a terrorist attack and $740 million for fire safety grants
that equip, train, and otherwise support the nation’s firefighters.  Grant
programs are funded as follows: ·        
$510 million for State Homeland Security, of which $90 million is
for Operation Stonegarden and $15 million is for tribal security; ·        
$605 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative;·        
$360 million for Nonprofit Security; ·        
$105 million for Public Transportation Security, of which $10
million is for Amtrak and $2 million is for Bus Security; ·        
$100 million for Port Security; ·        
$740 million for Assistance to Firefighters and SAFER; ·        
$355 million for Emergency Management Performance; ·        
$275.5 million for Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk Analysis; ·        
$130 million for Emergency Food and Shelter—Traditional; ·        
$200 million for Emergency Food and Shelter—Humanitarian, of which
$50 million may be used for construction of new, and the expansion of existing,
shelter facilities;·        
$12 million for Regional Catastrophic Preparedness; ·        
$12 million for Rehabilitation of High Hazard Potential Dams; ·        
$40 million for the Next Generation Warning System;·        
$316 million for training, including $71 million for the Center
for Domestic Preparedness, $58 million for the U.S. Fire Administration, and
$31 million for the Emergency Management Institute; and ·        
$20 million (by transfer) for Targeted Violence and Terrorism
Prevention.Disaster
Relief:  The bill provides $19.94 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund
(DRF) pursuant to the Budget Control Act disaster relief cap adjustment. 
These funds bolster State and tribal resources to respond to and recover from
major disasters and emergency declarations, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and
pandemics.  In addition, the bill makes not less than $2 billion from the
DRF available for the BRIC Program to mitigate the effects of climate
change. ###

frozen assets to be used, ‘for the benefit of the Afghan people.’ But three
months later, we have not yet figured out what that international financing
mechanism is. It still hasn't been set up.”Murphy
continued: “And so what advice would you give the administration, what
advice would you suggest we give the administration as to how to push that $3.5
billion? Because it cannot be that we can't both save lives while also not
unjustly enriching the Taliban. There is a mechanism by which to get this money
as directly connected to the Afghan people as possible.”“In a world in
which we are starved for resources, here lies for the time being 3.5 billion
dollars that is ready to go…There are plenty of mechanisms that will allow us
to do both: save lives and make sure that this money doesn't end up in the
hands of the wrong people. And so, my hope is that this committee can work with
the administration to expedite a mechanism to get that money released,” Murphy
concluded.Earlier this
year, Murphy chaired
a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central
Asia and Counterterrorism hearing on the ongoing humanitarian crisis in
Afghanistan and the U.S. response.You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food
Programme and Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps:MURPHY: “Thank
you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here and for your
fantastic work.“I just wanted
to have you all take a few minutes to delve a little bit deeper into the crisis
in Afghanistan. This started as one of the world's poorest countries, and it
has descended into what is really now the world's worst humanitarian crisis.“And I'd like
you all to give us a little bit of advice as to how we best unlock the
significant amount of money that the United States currently has in its
possession and at its disposal to try to address this crisis.“In February,
President Biden authorized $3.5 billion, that's about half of Afghanistan's
frozen assets to be used, ‘for the benefit of the Afghan people.’ But three
months later, we have not yet figured out what that international financing
mechanism is. It still hasn't been set up.“And so what
advice would you give the administration, what advice would you suggest we give
the administration as to how to push that $3.5 billion? Because it cannot be that
we can't both save lives while also not unjustly enriching the Taliban. There is a mechanism by which to get this money as
directly connected to the Afghan people as possible.“So certainly,
start with you, Mr. Beasley but I'd love comments from all three of our
panelists.”BEASLEY: “Senator
Murphy, I mean, this is one of the things we've been talking about from the beginning because of
the lack of funds that we have globally and then when Afghanistan hit we were
already, right before Afghanistan, we were talking about the crisis that we're
facing around the world, and then Afghanistan hit - a nation have for over 40
million people - 23 million people are in [The Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification severity phases]  3, 4, 5. I mean, that's just unheard of. [8.7]
million are knocking on famine’s door.“So we were
like, look, we don't have enough money. So what we did with the World Bank,
because the World Bank couldn't give it to the Taliban, and so we actually sat
down with the Taliban said, ‘Look, no one's gonna give you money. Let it go
directly to us without your fingerprints being on it.’ They, I would say,
consented, but didn't matter. But it worked out, the money came directly to us.“The same
thing on these frozen assets. I don't think there's any question whether it's
us or UNICEF and others that we can work with teachers, health care providers,
and of course, us working with beneficiaries throughout the country is not
difficult to do.“We're
reaching about 14 million people right now. But because of lack of funding,
we're having to cut back, cut back, cut back and at least try to reach those
knocking on famine’s door. But we've got to unleash those funds, whatever it
takes, because otherwise, you either got to appropriate more dollars and if you
don't, you’re going to have famine, you have destabilization, which means we
have more migration coming out of Afghanistan, and you will have an
extraordinary amount of recruitment by extremist groups for terrorist training
activities.”MCKENNA: “Afghanistan
is actually our largest, our longest continuous country presence. We have been
operating in Afghanistan since the 1980s through multiple administrations. The
government needs to figure out a mechanism to program that money to partners
like us who are in those communities.“That economy
has collapsed. We've seen news accounts of family selling off young girls for
dowry money because there's just no money coming in. Opium production is
through the roof. We need to be able to start, we need to help save people from
starvation.”MURPHY: “But
money coming directly to your programming does not enrich the Taliban in any
way, shape, or form?”MCKENNA: “No,
and we've been working with Treasury to create different rules and such to that
we can program those funds.”MURPHY: “Well,
listen, this is long overdue. In a world in which we are starved for resources,
here lies for the time being 3.5  billion dollars that is ready to go. And
you have pointed out that the programming you're running on the ground right
now directly benefits the Afghan people without unjustly profiting the Taliban.“You are not
alone in that club. There are plenty of mechanisms that will allow us to do
both: save lives and make sure that this money doesn't end up in the hands of the
wrong people. And so, my hope is that this committee can work with the
administration to expedite a mechanism to get that money released.”###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-calls-out-republican-hypocrisy-on-abortion-limits-to-pro-life-argument,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Tuesday took to the U.S. Senate floor to call for
the passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act. Murphy also called out
Republicans’ hypocrisy and their efforts to distort the debate on abortion with
falsehoods.Murphy highlighted Republican
hypocrisy: “Frankly, it's always been really hard for me to square how
Republicans who so readily evangelize about small government, about the
importance of putting families and their decision making processes first, about
the evil of public sector overreach, are so enthusiastic about the government
micromanaging personal decisions about pregnancy or marriage or adoption. Small
government is great, I guess for corporations, but it's not so great when it
comes to the most intimate decisions the families make.”“And as I've said on this
floor before, it's also hard to take seriously, Republicans’ passionate pleas
for this body to defend the existence of an unborn fetus when they seem to care
so little about many of the existential threats that are posed to every
American after they are born. Today, this day, over 100 Americans are going to
die from gunshot wounds, from murders and suicides… It seems that after birth,
life matters a little bit less to some people in this body,” Murphy added.Murphy also called out
Republican lies about the Women’s Health Protection Act: “Today,
I heard Republican senators making a whole bunch of claims that are just so
ungrounded in truth as to diminish the quality of what should be a very
important debate on a very weighty subject…I heard one senator say that the
Women's Health Protection Act, for which I will proudly vote tomorrow, allows
for garage abortions. That's not true. That's just plainly not true. Every
state requires that abortions be performed in licensed health care facilities
and nothing in the bill changes it. Don't say that just because it makes a
better story.”A full transcript of his
remarks can be found below:“Madam president, I will probably
get in trouble with somebody for saying this, but the question of when
life begins, the deeper question of what defines life,
which biological entities are alive or possess independent
existence versus which biological entities are simply part of
something else that is alive. Man, those are really hard questions.“I heard my colleague
Senator Daines on the floor earlier tonight, talking passionately about his
belief that life begins at conception. And that humans have an obligation to
defend a day old fetus equally to our obligation to defend the life of someone
who has been born.“Now, I disagree. I believe
that life begins at birth. I believe that our legal obligation towards a born
human is different than our legal obligation toward an unborn fetus.“But on that narrow question
of when life begins, I don't cast any particular judgment on Senator Daines for
believing what he believes. His belief system is shared by millions of
Americans, not the majority of Americans, but a significant share.“This disagreement that he
and I have over when legally protected life begins though is as significant and
as important a disagreement as exists, right? Because it's about the most
foundational questions in human existence.“What is life? Who decides
whether a woman bears a child? Who has control over that woman's body? Who has
control over the most sacred and critical function of a human being, the act of
giving birth? It just doesn't get any more important than that set of questions.“And given this fundamental
disagreement, given the weightiness of these questions, given the large number
of Americans who sit on either side of these questions, I come to one simple
conclusion: no government, no group of politicians should make this decision
for anyone else.“This decision about whether
to abort a pregnancy, so morally complicated, so socially divisive, should and
must be left to individuals. In this case, to women to decide.“Over the course of history,
millions have died in fights over another weighty, moral issue: the question of
whether God exists and if a god exists, exactly what form that being takes and
what it requires of humans.“Disputes over religion has
eradicated entire civilizations. What does this have to do with Roe vs. Wade?
Well, our founding fathers decided that there were some topics that were so
personal, so subject to disagreement and controversy that government should
just be barred from registering judgment.“That's part of the reason
why our civilization has not been plagued by wars between religious groups, a
reality that continues to paralyze societies to this day in other parts of the
world because we keep government out of the question of which god is the right
god. That's up to every American to decide for themselves, even though many
Americans believe that the consequence of observing or following the wrong god
is serious, eternal damnation for some.  The stakes are huge when it comes
to religion, but government sits on the sidelines.“To me, that's an imperfect
but instructive corollary to the debate over choice and abortion. The decision
about whether to have an abortion is so personal. And the lack of consensus in
the country on the question is so unavoidable as to make government intervention
just as illegitimate as it would be if government tried to dictate to someone
which religion they should follow.“Now, that's not the exact
route that the Supreme Court traveled to get to the Roe decision. But it helps
me understand why from 1973 until today, the decision about whether or not to
have an abortion has been a constitutional right of the individual, not the
constitutional right of the government to decide.“Frankly, it's always been
really hard for me to square how Republicans who so readily evangelize about
small government, about the importance of putting families and their decision
making processes first, about the evil of public sector overreach, are so
enthusiastic about the government micromanaging personal decisions about
pregnancy or marriage or adoption. Small government is great, I guess for
corporations, but it's not so great when it comes to the most intimate
decisions the families make.“And as I've said on this
floor before, it's also hard to take seriously, Republicans’ passionate pleas
for this body to defend the existence of an unborn fetus when they seem to care
so little about many of the existential threats that are posed to every
American after they are born.“Today, this day, over 100
Americans are going to die from gunshot wounds, from murders and suicides. And
whether my Republican colleagues agree with me or not that stricter gun laws is
part of the solution to this uniquely American epidemic that plagues those that
are born, I don't know that I've ever heard a Republican speech dedicated to
this crisis on the floor of the Senate. I’ve heard dozens  dedicated to
the cause of those before. It seems that after birth, life matters a little bit
less to some people in this body.“So that's what I think, and
as I said, I'll probably get into some hot water for admitting that I
understand the arguments that people like Senator Daines make. I don't agree
with his views, but I understand them. And my hope is, is that as we begin this
debate over the future of reproductive choice and health in this country, as
this debate heats up, because it's not going away, we're taking the vote
tomorrow. But this is a debate that is going to consume this nation. If the
Alito opinion becomes law, which I believe it will.“My hope is that we're honest
about the complexity of this debate. But the Republicans are equally honest in
the claims that they make. And let me just briefly tell you what I mean.“Today, I heard Republican
senators making a whole bunch of claims that are just so ungrounded in truth as
to diminish the quality of what should be a very important debate on a very
weighty subject. For instance, I heard senators make the claim that the
protesters who were protesting outside or near Supreme Court justices homes
threatened violence against those justices. That was an explicit claim made by
people who came down to this floor who might have heard it on some unreputable
website, but it's not true.“You can object to
protesters, being outside of public officials’ homes - it's happened to all of
us, by the way - but don't make up threats of violence just because it makes
for a better story.“I heard one senator say that
the Women's Health Protection Act, for which I will proudly vote tomorrow,
allows for garage abortions. That's not true. That's just plainly not true.
Every state requires that abortions be performed in licensed health care facilities
and nothing in the bill changes it. Don't say that just because it makes a
better story.“Many Republicans claim that
the bill we're taking up tomorrow allow abortions up to the date of birth.
That's not true either. The Women's Health Protection Act, it does codify Roe
versus Wade, but Roe only protects a woman's right to have an abortion without
restriction until viability and then afterward protects for the woman's health
for risk of death. The bill simply does not expand the circumstances under
which an abortion can be performed beyond what currently exists in case law.“So I'm going to be honest
with my colleagues about the admitted complexities, the political, moral
complexities of this debate. But I expect opponents of the bill that we're
debating tomorrow to be equally honest in the arguments they make as well.“So I’ll have a lot more to
say about this topic as we begin what I think is a debate that will consume
this nation, rightfully, over the course of the coming weeks and months, but
today, I will leave it there.”

Murphy. “The gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis, and I’m glad
we’re finally treating it that way by investing in CDC research to better

gun crimes and that starts with confirming a director. The Senate must move

East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism, spoke on Tuesday at
a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing
on the importance of strengthening the U.S. Department of Defense’s efforts to
prevent civilian deaths in U.S. combat operations.Murphy pressed Elizabeth
Richard, nominee for the State Department’s Coordinator for Counterterrorism,
on her commitment to minimizing civilian harm: “You've served in Yemen, you
know the reports of pretty significant civilian casualties of our drone
operations. You've also probably seen research suggesting that in areas where
we have had the highest level of drone activity, often terrorist groups have
the highest level of recruitment success. I just want your commitment that
you're going to work with the Department of Defense to ensure that we minimize
civilian harm.”In March, Murphy sent
a letter urging the Pentagon to open new investigations into reports of
civilian harm from U.S. military operations in Yemen, following Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin III’s directive earlier this year to improve the way the
Department of Defense investigates and acknowledges claims of civilian harm in
U.S. combat operations. Murphy along with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) and U.S. Representative Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also led nine
other senators and 38 members of the House of Representatives in a letter to
President Biden expressing concern about the United States’ targeting criteria
for drone strikes that has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians, with
little accountability.You can read

Counterterrorism:MURPHY: “I
wanted to ask you a question about a January directive from Secretary Austin to
strengthen efforts to prevent civilian deaths and improve the way the DoD
investigates claims of civilian harm in U.S. combat operations, and this is
specifically relevant to drone strikes. You've served in Yemen, you know the
reports of pretty significant civilian casualties of our drone operations.
You've also probably seen research suggesting that in areas where we have had
the highest level of drone activity, often terrorist groups have the highest
level of recruitment success.“I just want
your commitment that you're going to work with the Department of Defense to
ensure that we minimize civilian harm. And also in a very short amount of time,
get your takeaways as to the upside and downside of our drone activities as a
mechanism to combat terrorism.”RICHARD:
“Thank you for that question. And it's as you know, an obviously very complex
and fraught issue. I have worked with my DoD colleagues very closely in every
assignment I've been in the last 15 years.“And I've seen
firsthand how hard this is, because there's the need to deal with an imminent
threat often against our own troops or our own American citizens, and the need
to balance the civilian casualties. And I have really welcomed DoD’s ability to look at it this, accept that there's a
problem and really get after trying to figure out how to do it better. And so
if I'm confirmed, I would really welcome working with them from the civilian
side of the house on how to do that.”

introduced legislation to reauthorize the historic federal mental health and
substance use disorder programs that were signed into law in 2016 as part of
their Mental Health Reform Act before they are set to expire in September. The Mental Health Reform
Reauthorization Act of 2022 also addresses COVID-19’s devastating impact on
the national mental health crisis, especially among children, by building upon
the 2016 legislation to improve and expand those programs.“The Mental Health Reform
Act made important strides toward getting people the mental health care they
need. But now, as we face a national mental health crisis exacerbated by two
years of the pandemic, the programs we created are set to expire. That’s why
our new bill goes further than just reauthorization – it doubles down on
strengthening parity protections and expanding access to pediatric mental
health. There’s no time to waste, and I look forward to working with the HELP
Committee to make sure it’s signed into law,” said Murphy.“We all have
loved ones affected by mental illness. The pandemic intensified our mental
health crisis, especially amongst our children,” said Cassidy. “Our bill preserves
and improves upon the resources that have been a lifeline to so many Americans
over the past five years.”Last fall, the senators solicited
feedback from patients, families, health care providers, advocacy
organizations, and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments on the
effectiveness of the programs created by the 2016 legislation and areas for
improvement to inform the drafting of this legislation. Specifically, the Mental

making sure the park is a fun, safe place for kids to get outside and play,” said Murphy.“This significant federal grant will help enhance and expand Stamford’s
Boccuzzi Park to become an even better place for Connecticut families to play,
gather and spend time outdoors. This is a vital investment for Stamford and its

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-leaked-scotus-decision-overturning-roe-republican-attacks-on-lgbtq-kids-and-student-debt-on-fox-news-sunday,"WASHINGTON–U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday joined Fox News Sunday with Bret Baier to
discuss the Supreme Court’s draft opinion to overturn Roe
v. Wade, Republican attacks on LGTBQ kids, and student loan debt.On Republicans’ focus on the
leak instead of the substance of the SCOTUS decision, Murphy said: “Well, I
don't like the way that this decision came out. But the outrage here should be
about what's going to happen to women and families in this country. The fact
that women and doctors are going to be sent to jail immediately when this
opinion becomes a reality if in the states with trigger laws all of a sudden,
abortion under any circumstances, even under rape and incest, becomes illegal
and criminalized. So I don’t love how the decision ultimately was made public
and I hope we figure out what happened, but I think it's interesting that many
of my Republican friends are putting their focus on the process here because
they really don't want to talk about the fact that abortion becoming
criminalized is something that a sort of small minority of the country
supports.”On the Senate’s upcoming vote
to codify Roe v. Wade into law next week and Republicans’ ultimate goal
of a nationwide abortion ban, Murphy said: “I think it's important that we
put senators on record, because let's be clear, Lindsey says this is about the
decisions being made at the state level –
that's not what's going to happen here. If Republicans get control of
the House and the Senate and the White House, which certainly could happen in
the next three years, they are absolutely going to pass a national ban on
abortion that will affect every single family, every single woman in this
country. And so it’s important right now that we get every senator on the record.
Do you support a woman's right to make decisions over their own body or do you
think that the government should be in charge?  Because this is soon not
going to be about state legislatures, pretty soon this is going to be an effort
to pass a federal ban everywhere on abortions in this country.”On the hateful, divisive
attacks Republicans have waged against LGBTQ kids, Murphy said: “I mean, I am very concerned about sort of very
quick, hateful, divisive turn that the Republican Party has taken. This effort
in Florida to target gay kids in schools I just think is mean spirited and
something that I had not seen from the Republican Party when I first
started out in politics 20 years ago.Murphy continued: “You
don’t think that those kids don't take a message from a ban on the discussion
of their identity suggests that they are not worthy of existence in that
school? Half of trans kids in this country have contemplated suicide, and
that's because of the effort to bully them for their identity by adults in this
country. So I absolutely do think that there's a message sent to these kids
when you suggest that a conversation about their identify is somehow
threatening the education of kids in our schools.”On student loan forgiveness
and the need for higher education accountability, Murphy said, “I'm one of
the few members of the Senate that still has student debt. I don't need my debt
forgiven. I also think that this focus on debt excuses the colleges for this
dramatic increase in tuition. I sometimes think that our party spends a little
bit too much time talking about the debt, and not enough time talking about the
cost of the degree, because that's where the real problem is. We're going to be
in a perpetual cycle of having to forgive debt if college continues to spiral
upwards to $100,000 a year, so I think the limited debt forgiveness proposal is
legal. I would support it, but I think it is a mistake to put all our eggs in
that basket.”Click here to

Representative Joe Courtney (D-Conn.-02) announced on Wednesday that the
Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) awarded a $493,000 Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program
grant to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.""It's just a
reality that access to high-speed internet is as much of a necessity to modern
life as electricity. It is unacceptable that tribal communities are often hurt
the most by the digital divide, and this federal funding will help provide
affordable international service to households in the Mashantucket Pequot
Tribal Nation. Internet is infrastructure, and this investment will fuel
economic development in our state,” said Murphy.“This funding will ensure that Mashantucket Pequot households are
connected to affordable, high-speed internet — an important and indispensable
necessity in this day and age.  The
COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated very starkly the importance to families of a strong
internet connection to work,  run their
businesses, complete schoolwork, and connect with loved ones.  The Mashantucket Pequot community will
benefit greatly from these funds and I will keep working with my colleagues to
ensure that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable broadband,”
said Blumenthal. “Any small business will tell you that high-speed internet is absolutely
essential to being successful in the 2022 marketplace, and so will every school,
hospital, police station and firehouse. High-speed internet is an essential
part of modern infrastructure, and we’ve got several tribal and rural
communities here in eastern Connecticut that have been waiting for years to see
serious investment put towards making their internet speeds and bandwidth
competitive with others,” said Courtney. “Now, as we keep working back
to full speed following the pandemic, hundreds of households, workforce skills
training staff, small businesses, and others in the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal
Nation are going to see increased internet access and speeds. This new federal
funding means lowering the digital divide for tribal communities, and a more
competitive eastern Connecticut.” This project will assist 163 Tribal households, workforce
development staff, and Tribal institutions in New London County, Connecticut,
in developing programs and resources to address COVID-19 challenges that have
impacted Tribal members. The project intends to provide affordable internet
service and equipment for Tribal members in addition to creating a workforce
development center that will assist the Tribe’s workforce development program
in training, readiness, and job placement.
The
Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program is a $980 million program directed to
tribal governments to be used for broadband deployment on tribal lands, as well
as for telehealth, distance learning, broadband affordability, and digital
inclusion.###"

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-chairs-hearing-with-secretary-mayorkas-on-department-of-homeland-security-fy23-budget-request,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security, on Wednesday held a subcommittee
hearing on President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2023
funding request for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Murphy
highlighted Republicans’ use of immigration as a political cudgel, the
importance of providing DHS with sufficient funding to respond to the eventual
lifting of Title 42, and the threat of domestic terrorism and disinformation to
our national security.  On the
politicization of the border, Murphy said: “I am constantly demoralized by the tone of our debate
about security, and in particular, the tone of our debate about our border.
Many of my Republican colleagues, and I frankly don't put the Ranking Member in
this category, simply see the issue of immigration as a political cudgel. They
see immigrants as political opportunities to be cast as threats. And they
constantly dumb down the debate about immigration, for instance, insisting that
the reason there are high numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at our
border right now is because of the name on the door at the White House. Let me
assure my colleagues, non-citizens arriving at
our Southwest border don't care who the President of the United States is. Why?
Because they come here for a complex set of reasons, most of which are
connected to life back in their home country. We only have to go back to 2019
to see the evidence under arguably the most restrictive policies and programs
in decades, policies that included separating little children from their
parents and sending thousands of vulnerable people to wait months for a chance
to seek asylum in conditions so dangerous that our own State Department issued
warnings. Our country saw the highest level of apprehensions at the border in
over a decade in 2019.”On
Title 42, Murphy said:
“Now we can have an argument about when to lift Title 42, but it cannot be
permanent, not unless Congress changes the law. And I find it ironic that there
are so many Republicans that are so confident that COVID is no longer a threat
to our country, except at the border. Title 42 is going to be lifted now or at
some point in the future and so we can play politics about this or we can be in
a constructive dialogue with you, Mr. Secretary, about funding a plan to allow
your Department to coordinate with other federal agencies and our neighbors to
the south in order to optimally respond to the expected challenges that are
going to result when inevitably this two-plus-year restriction on U.S. asylum laws is lifted.”On the
threat of domestic terrorism, Murphy said: “Right now, the greatest present threat we face as a
nation is domestic terrorism, and no one should forget how close we came in
this place to a mass atrocity over a year ago, and nobody should think that
this threat has suddenly vanished. So I look forward to hearing more today
about what the Department is going to do with new resources, with this new
budget to counter the threat from within our nation that is presented to our
democracy.”Murphy
highlighted the importance of DHS in combatting disinformation: “Frankly, I don't know why we would
spend billions of dollars protecting the homeland without the capacity to
protect our citizens from foreign actors and terrorist organizations who seek
to spread hateful and dangerous propaganda designed to tear apart our democracy.""A full
transcript of Murphy’s opening remarks can be found below:MURPHY: “Today,
we welcome the Secretary of Homeland Security, Ale Mayorkas. And before we get
started, Mr. Secretary, on behalf of the subcommittee I would like to once
again share our appreciation to you and to all of the Department’s employees
for your and their dedication to protect our nation’s security.  We are
mindful of the wide ranging responsibilities, sacrifices that are entailed in
upholding those responsibilities, and we are deeply grateful to you and your
team.“The
purpose, of course, of today’s hearing is to review the Department’s FY23
budget request. It’s a request that focuses on strengthening the nation’s cyber
defense, responding to   border management needs, promoting a humane
and efficient immigration system, improving operational readiness of the Coast
Guard, and continuing steps to advance climate response and resiliency. I
imagine much of today's discussion will cover border security, immigration
policies, and the CDC’s Title 42 authority.“Mr.
Secretary, I am constantly demoralized by the tone of our debate about
security, and in particular, the tone of our debate about our border. Many of
my Republican colleagues, and I frankly don't put the Ranking Member in this
category, simply see the issue of immigration as a political cudgel. They see
immigrants as political opportunities to be cast as threats. And they
constantly dumb down the debate about immigration, for instance, insisting that
the reason there are high numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at our
border right now is because of the name on the door at the White House.“Let me
assure my colleagues, non-citizens arriving at
our Southwest border don't care who the President of the United States is. Why?
Because they come here for a complex set of reasons, most of which are connected
to life back in their home country.“We only
have to go back to 2019 to see the evidence under arguably the most restrictive
policies and programs in decades, policies that included separating little
children from their parents and sending thousands of vulnerable people to wait
months for a chance to seek asylum in conditions so dangerous that our own
State Department issued warnings. Our country saw the highest level of
apprehensions at the border in over a decade in 2019.“And how
did Congress respond? Well, Congress stepped up and enacted a $4.6 billion
emergency supplemental in 2019 in order to provide resources to DHS and other
departments to manage the border requirements that year. Why did that happen?
Because at that time, there was a shared commitment to respond to the realities
at our border, to support the brave, dedicated men and women of CBP, ICE, and
countless others at the Department working every day on the border or
supporting those at the border. And that should be our mission today, as it was
in 2019.“Now we
can have an argument about when to lift Title 42, but it cannot be permanent,
not unless Congress changes the law. And I find it ironic that there are so
many Republicans that are so confident that COVID is no longer a threat to our
country, except at the border. Title 42 is going to be lifted now or at some
point in the future and so we can play politics about this or we can be in a
constructive dialogue with you, Mr. Secretary, about funding a plan to allow
your Department to coordinate with other federal agencies and our neighbors to
the south in order to optimally respond to the expected challenges that are
going to result when inevitably this two-plus-year restriction on U.S. asylum laws is lifted.“Today we
should also talk about the work the Department is doing to protect the homeland
from two other threats. I know there's a long list of threats, but at the top
of my list would be domestic terrorism and foreign propaganda.“Right
now, the greatest present threat we face as a nation is domestic terrorism, and
no one should forget how close we came in this place to a mass atrocity over a
year ago, and nobody should think that this threat has suddenly vanished. So I
look forward to hearing more today about what the Department is going to do
with new resources, with this new budget to counter the threat from within our
nation that is presented to our democracy.“And Mr.
Secretary, I know that you know that there has been a lot of misinformation
about your Department's work to combat misinformation. Frankly, I don't know
why we would spend billions of dollars protecting the homeland without the
capacity to protect our citizens from foreign actors and terrorist
organizations who seek to spread hateful and dangerous propaganda designed to
tear apart our democracy. But you should probably set the record straight about
what the goals of your efforts in this area are.“Earlier
this year, despite the odds, this subcommittee came together and we wrote a
bipartisan budget that overcame all of these political pitfalls that I've
identified surrounding this important set of investments in our nation's
security and that is in large part due to the tone set by Senator Capito and
the great staff work that is done on this subcommittee to find a way to come
together to protect our nation despite the politics that surround the
subcommittee's budget. I think that we can deliver again this year, and I'm
grateful to begin that work with this important hearing.“Thank you
Secretary Mayorkas for appearing before us today, and I will now turn it over
to the Ranking Member.”###

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and U.S. Senator Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Monday joined U.S.
Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker
(D-N.J.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) to introduce a Senate
Resolution condemning oil and gas companies profiteering off the ongoing
Russian invasion of Ukraine and urging a swift transition to a clean energy
economy as a core national security priority.“The oil
and gas industry doesn’t drill to be patriotic – they drill for profit. They
have reaped billions of dollars by taking advantage of Russia’s war on Ukraine
and crushing Americans at the pump,” said Murphy. “Investing in
renewables is the only way we achieve true energy independence. It’s time we
learn our lesson and make the transition to clean energy to strengthen our
national security, combat the climate crisis, and lower costs for everyone.”“Oil and
gas companies have been profiteering from Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine by
reprehensibly raising prices on Americans while raking in record profits,” said
Blumenthal. “Volatility in oil and gas prices exacerbated by the war and
Big Oil’s greed only reinforce the need to invest in more reliable domestic
green energy. A clean energy economy would ensure our energy independence while
protecting the climate—and lower costs for the American people.”“The war
in Ukraine has underscored how our dependence on oil fills the coffers of
tyrants and dictators like Putin, and that a rapid transition to clean and
renewable energy is not just necessary for our environment, but critical to our
economic and national security,” said Merkley. “We can achieve energy
independence by transitioning to cheaper, home-grown sources of renewable
energy, and we can’t waste any time in getting there. The best way to end our
dependence and that of our allies on foreign oil and gas is to end our reliance
on oil and gas, period.”“Putin’s
ruthless and unjustified invasion of Ukraine coupled with continued price
gouging by oil and gas companies have imperiled our country’s national security
and left Americans hurting from rising fuel prices,” said Booker. “As
this resolution lays out, the United States must immediately begin a transition
to a clean energy economy that will ensure our nation’s energy independence,
protect consumers, and help us reverse the devastating effects of climate
change.”“No one
should be profiteering from Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine, but that’s what Big
Oil is doing,” said Van Hollen. “We must be putting people over profits
and consumers over corporate greed. It’s clear that accelerating our transition
to a clean energy economy is necessary to reduce the price of energy,
strengthen our national security, and confront climate change.”The
Senators’ Resolution highlights how a clean energy economy is essential for
protecting the United States’ national security and American consumers. It
notes that authoritarian regimes such as Russia, which derives 40 percent of
its federal budget from oil and gas production, rely heavily on fossil fuel
revenue to maintain their grip on power and fund atrocities such as those
occurring in Ukraine, and that the Department of Defense recently reported that climate change
threatens American national security. The Resolution also highlights how
oil and gas companies have unjustly profited from charging American
consumers?sky-high gas prices even as the price of oil falls.  The
Resolution urges a rapid transition to renewable energy, which “can come online
more quickly and reliably than oil and gas production, which will ensure the
United States’ energy independence and help us maintain a safe and healthy
climate.” The
Resolution concludes, “Congress and the Biden Administration must stop price
gouging and excessive price increases by oil and gas companies; and help
consumers and small businesses that are being harmed by rising energy prices;
and the United States must transition to a clean energy economy as quickly as
possible to protect our national security.”“Americans
shouldn’t have to depend on foreign dictators to power our cars or heat our
homes, and it’s why today’s resolution from Senator Merkley calling for a clean
energy transition is so critical. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind
will help keep supply consistent during global conflict — and provide crucial
cost-savings to the American people,” said Marcela Mulholland, Political
Director at Data for Progress. The full
text of the Resolution can be found here.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.-05)
on Thursday introduced the Housatonic Wild and Scenic River Act of 2022,
which would create a U.S. National Park Service protective designation for 41
miles of the Housatonic River, running through Sharon, Canaan, Cornwall,
Salisbury, New Milford, Kent, and North Canaan. The designation would bring
federal resources to the towns along the river to support conservation efforts,
especially as recreation use has increased since the start of COVID-19. In
February, Murphy and Hayes held a roundtable in Kent with conservation leaders
and local stakeholders to discuss the importance of protecting the Housatonic
River and gather feedback on the legislation.“Protecting the Housatonic
River with a ‘wild and scenic’ designation will help us preserve the river’s
beauty, ecological diversity, and recreational opportunities for generations to
come. This has been a major priority for advocates and communities along the
river, and I’m proud to work with Representative Hayes in introducing our bill
that would unlock thousands in federal funds to support conservation efforts,” said Murphy.“The National Wild and Scenic designation for the Housatonic River
is over 40 years in the making. With the effects of climate change on the rise,
I am thrilled to build upon the extraordinary work of the community by
introducing this legislation with Senator Murphy. Moreover, the designation is
not just symbolic. It brings critical funding to protect the rich ecosystem
along the 41 miles of the river and support local recreation in the surrounding
towns. I remain committed to expanding and improving access to clean, healthy
outdoor spaces for all communities to enjoy,” said Hayes.“The Housatonic River is a national and local treasure that
attracts people from all over the country to communities like Kent. Wild and
Scenic River status will help support our community and neighboring towns to
protect this River's enduring legacy.  I am very grateful to Congresswoman
Jahana Hayes and Senator Chris Murphy for their leadership on our behalf to
make this dream a reality,” said Jean Speck, First Selectman, Town of Kent, CT.“People from this region have worked tirelessly for decades to
protect the Housatonic River and its exceptional beauty, wildlife, and accessibility. 
We applaud Senator Chris Murphy and Congresswoman Jahana Hayes for championing
Housatonic Wild and Scenic designation and helping protect the River we cherish
for generations to come,” said Lynn Werner Executive Director, Housatonic Valley Association .“Yes! This is exciting and
welcome news! The Housatonic River Commission is thrilled to receive notice
that H.R. 7551, Housatonic Wild and Scenic River Act of 2022 has been
introduced in Congress. Thank you Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Jahana
Hayes for your commitment to our natural resources and for your recognition of
the Housatonic River. Inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
Partnership Program is a huge step towards insuring our ability to
successfully manage recreational use and conserve the stunning physical
attributes of our River,” said
William R. Tingley, Chairman, Housatonic River Commission.Murphy’s Lower Farmington
River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Act was signed
into law in 2019, creating a U.S. National Park Service protective “Wild and

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday released the following statement on the
reported draft Supreme Court opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade:“If this draft reflects
the true opinion of the Court’s majority, it will be a devastating,
unprecedented attack on reproductive freedom for millions of Americans,
especially for those living in states with ‘trigger laws’ designed to ban
abortion as soon as Roe is overturned. This opinion robs women of the
right to make decisions about their own bodies and instead empowers extreme
politicians to make some of the most personal and consequential decisions for
them,” said Murphy. “Let’s be
clear: it was never hyperbole when Democrats started raising the alarm about
the Court’s politicization. When Republicans said they would nominate Supreme
Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, they weren’t lying – and
they won’t stop there. Their ultimate goal is a nationwide ban that will block
abortion access everywhere. But the fight is not over. It’s time to build upon
the movement to elect pro-choice candidates up and down the ballot to ensure
reproductive rights are protected at the local, state, and federal levels. We
won’t give up.”

announced that BioWave, based in Norwalk, has been named April’s “Innovator of
the Month.” BioWave is a patented smarter pain blocking technology that
provides relief from severe pain. BioWave devices deliver therapeutic deep
tissue electrical signals to prevent pain signals from reaching the brain,
helping to relieve chronic, acute or post-operative pain. Their technology has
helped professionals, college athletes, veterans, and others suffering from
chronic pain get closer to a pain-free life and return to daily activities
without the use of opioids.“The
team at BioWave is transforming pain care management for the millions of
Americans who suffer from chronic pain that interferes with their daily lives.
Their technology provides a safe, effective alternative to opioids that helps
ease persistent pain, and I’m proud to recognize their innovative work in
Connecticut,” said Murphy.“We are honored to be
recognized by Senator Murphy. One of the keys to innovation is having access to
capital as well as to high level resources that can
facilitate the ideation, design and development process. Being located in
Connecticut helps provide easier access to capital and to these key individuals
and core outside services. So for example, we were delighted to have the State of Connecticut’s venture capital arm, Connecticut
Innovations, participate in our most recent round of preferred equity financing
several years ago,” said Bradford
Siff, Founder and President of BioWave.BioWave
recently introduced a new patent pending product called BioWraps®, which are wearable compression electrode
garments that are paired with BioWave’s pain blocking neurostimulators.
BioWraps use a proprietary silver fabric technology that allows for treating up to five times the volume of
tissue as compared to conventional electrodes while simultaneously providing
compression and support.Murphy believes
entrepreneurship and innovation are the building blocks for a strong economy.
In the U.S. Senate, he has introduced two bipartisan pieces of legislation to
incentivize angel investors to put more money into startup companies—the Angel Tax Credit Act and the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act. Startup companies create an average of 2 million jobs each year.

Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Tuesday applauded President Biden’s nomination of
Sarah Merriam to fill a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. Consisting of thirteen judges, the Second Circuit is one of
thirteen appeals courts across the country and exercises appellate jurisdiction
within Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. “Judge Merriam is one of Connecticut's brightest
legal minds. As her friend, I’m thrilled
President Biden has nominated her to serve on the Second Circuit. Sarah brings a keen intellect and a passion of for justice
to her work as a federal judge, and I was proud to support her
confirmation to the U.S. District Court of Connecticut.
Having been recently confirmed by a bipartisan majority, I expect her to win
swift confirmation to the Second Circuit,” said Murphy.“Judge Merriam has demonstrated
deep legal insight, unflinching fairness and fidelity to justice,” said
Blumenthal. “She’s a great listener—taking seriously every legal claim, and
following the facts and law with care and intellect. She will bring to the
appellate court an unstinting commitment to the rule of law at a time when its
importance is paramount. Her values emphasize equity, and equal opportunity. As
a member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to championing her
nomination, which I expect to receive the same bipartisan support as did her
confirmation to the U.S. District Court.”
In October, Judge Sarah Merriam was confirmed in a bipartisan vote
to serve as a United States District Court Judge for the District of
Connecticut. Prior to that, Judge Merriam served as a United States Magistrate
Judge for the District of Connecticut, an Assistant Federal Defender in the
District of Connecticut from 2007 through 2015, and worked as a law clerk to
Judge Thomas Meskill of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit and to Judge Alvin Thompson of the United States District Court for the
District of Connecticut. Judge Merriam attended Georgetown University for her
undergraduate degree, and began her legal education at the University of
Connecticut School of Law before transferring to Yale Law School, from which
she received her Juris Doctor in 2000. "
https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-urges-biden-administration-to-further-its-support-for-lgbtq-youth-amid-nationwide-surge-in-anti-lgbtq-legislation,"WASHINGTON–U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday urged the Biden administration to do
more to support LGBTQ youth and their families, particularly in states that
have passed legislation targeting the rights of LGBTQ students. In a letter to
U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Assistant Secretary for Civil
Rights Catherine Lhamon, Murphy requested the Department of Education and the
Department of Justice’s Office for Civil Rights to publish resources for
educators, school support staff, students, and their families on their federal
rights pertaining to anti-LGBTQ legislation. Murphy also requested they hold
public events for students and families in states impacted by these laws and
provide regular updates on administration’s actions to promote safe learning
environments for LGBTQ students.“While I
commend the leadership of this administration in asserting the rights and
protections of LGBTQ people, and in particular, LGBTQ students via President
Biden’s March 2021 Executive Order and the Department’s subsequent work in
support of this order, I believe we must take further action to support LGBTQ
youth in the face of recent state laws censoring discussion of gender identity
and sexual orientation in public schools, transgender participation in
interscholastic sports, and related legislation aimed at punishing LGBTQ youth
for being who they are,” Murphy wrote.Murphy continued: “It is not hyperbole to state that Republican
legislators across dozens of states have wrongly and dangerously determined
that LGBTQ youth, and transgender children in particular, are the greatest
threat facing their constituents, as evidenced by the extraordinary amount of
legislative time and action they have devoted to restricting the rights and
opportunities of LGBTQ youth. Just this year, state legislators have introduced
more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills, with about two-thirds of these bills
specifically targeting transgender children. This continues a dangerous trend
as state legislators are introducing and passing an increasing number of
anti-LGBTQ bills every year.”“This
administration has led in standing up for the rights, protections, and
opportunities of LGBTQ youth. I deeply commend the broad work the Biden
administration has already taken, including the necessary actions taken by the
Department of Education to protect transgender students and their families, Murphy concluded.
“However, I believe the urgency and danger of this moment calls for further
action by the administration, particularly to address the most recent attacks
on LGBTQ students’ rights.”Murphy joined advocates in Connecticut on Monday to
highlight on the importance of protecting trans youth and young members of
the LGBTQ community amid the surge in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation
nationwide. Earlier this month, Murphy took to the Senate floor call out
Republicans’ politically-motivated attacks on transgender youth and
adults. Murphy is a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which prohibits
discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and the Safe Schools Improvement Act, which
requires states to direct school districts to establish anti-bullying and
harassment policies based on race, origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, disability, or religion.Full text of the
letter is available here and
below:Dear Secretary
Cardona and Assistant Secretary Lhamon:I write to call
your attention to the increasing targeting and harassment of transgender and
LGBTQ youth by state legislators and request additional steps by the U.S.
Department of Education and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to support and
protect these vulnerable students. While I commend the leadership of this
administration in asserting the rights and protections of LGBTQ people, and in

two-thirds of these bills specifically targeting transgender children. This
continues a dangerous trend as state legislators are introducing and passing an
increasing number of anti-LGBTQ bills every year. These bills run the gamut of
harmful policies – from banning public school teachers from discussing LGBTQ
people in the classroom, to requiring school counselors to “out” LGBTQ students
to their parents, to further restricting transgender youth participation in
sports and their ability to use the school locker room or bathroom that aligns
with their gender identity. Not only do these bills harm students and limit
educational opportunity, the discrimination they endorse is illegal.
Unfortunately, this trend seems likely to continue throughout this year, as at
least twenty states have introduced legislation similar to Florida’s law
censoring classroom instruction, with Alabama passing its version just earlier
this month.The cumulative
impact on LGBTQ youth by this hateful and bigoted legislation cannot be
understated. GLSEN’s 2019 National School Climate Survey found that more than
two-thirds of LGBTQ secondary students reported being verbally harassed because
of their sexual orientation and more than four in five transgender students
reported experiencing victimization because of their gender identity. Early
findings are showing the harmful impacts of hateful and bigoted legislation:
according to a poll by the Trevor Project, at least two-thirds of LGBTQ youth
said these legislative actions and debates have had a negative impact on their
mental health. This trauma rests on top of the heartbreaking status quo these
children already face. According to the Trevor Project, more than half of all
transgender and non-binary youth have reported attempting suicide at least
once. It is simply damning of the environment adults have created for these
kids that more than half of all transgender children have come to the conclusion,
at some point in their young lives, that they would be better off dead than
live in a world that believes they are threats to be marginalized or expunged.
We must do better.This
administration has led in standing up for the rights, protections, and
opportunities of LGBTQ youth. I deeply commend the broad work the Biden
administration has already taken, including the necessary actions taken by the
Department of Education to protect transgender students and their families. In
less than two years, this administration has recommitted the federal government
to guarantee educational environments free of sex discrimination, including
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,
initiated the process to amend Title IX regulations in ways that would protect
LGBTQ youth, affirmed that federal civil rights laws protect all students,
including transgender and other LGBTQ students, from discrimination, and
published a suite of resources for schools to use in support of LGBTQ youth.
These are all significant steps that will continue to help LGBTQ youth
throughout the country.However, I
believe the urgency and danger of this moment calls for further action by the
administration, particularly to address the most recent attacks on LGBTQ students’
rights. Therefore, I am requesting that the Department of Education and the
Office for Civil Rights:1.     
Publish resources for educators, school support staff, students
and their families specific to anti-LGBTQ laws pertaining to public schools in
order to inform them of their federal rights and, where applicable, steps they
can take to ensure educational environments free of discrimination within the
context of these laws. Students, families, educators, and communities should
know that bullying and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
identity are illegal and that they can always seek assistance from the Office
for Civil Rights. 2.     
Hold public events in states with anti-LGBTQ laws pertaining to
public schools to inform students and families of their federal rights and
protections within the context of these laws and remind schools of their
ongoing obligations to protect students from discrimination. Events like the
one held by the Secretary in Florida for Transgender Day of Visibility help
students, parents and educators understand this administration’s position in
protecting their rights and feel that they can turn to the Department to defend
these rights. 3.     
Provide Congress
with regular updates on ongoing actions the
administration is taking that would impact the educational opportunities and
safe learning environments of LGBTQ students.Thank you for
your work on this important issue. I look forward to working with you to defend
the rights of LGBTQ youth and ensure that all students learn in safe
environments that allow them to thrive.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-nuclear-agreement-with-iran-human-rights-concerns-in-egypt-us-balkans-policy-with-secretary-blinken,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing with Secretary of
State Antony Blinken on the State Department’s FY 2023 budget request. Murphy
pushed back on critics of the Iran deal and highlighted the failures of the
Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign. A
vocal
proponent of withholding security assistance on the basis of human rights concerns, Murphy questioned the State Department’s request
to delink human rights conditions from military aid to Egypt. After returning
from Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo this week, he also highlighted
strategic opportunities in the Balkans to reduce Russian influence in the
region.On securing a
new nuclear agreement with Iran, Murphy said: “I do not share my
colleagues’ skepticism of a renewed nuclear agreement with Iran, in part
because the whole world has watched how difficult it is to craft a Western
response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine given Russia's status as a nuclear
power. And I simply cannot imagine why we would wish for a policy that will
allow Iran to be weeks, maybe months away from a nuclear weapon given all of
their malevolent activity in the Middle East. What about the last two months
has been an advertisement that we will be better off if more of our adversaries
had nuclear weapons?”On the State
Department’s request to delink human rights conditions from military aid to
Egypt, Murphy said: “The assault on Ukrainian democracy, I think has
elevated the need for us to be incredibly consistent between our words and our
actions on supporting human rights and democracy. You and I have had a number
of conversations about the pace of reform in Egypt, a country that enjoys more
direct U.S. military support than almost any other in the world prior to the
war in Ukraine. Buried inside your budget request is a curious proposal that is
a proposal to delink human rights conditions from military aid to Egypt.”Murphy
continued: “I worry about the message that this would send to Sisi but
also the world. They have made tepid progress, even when presented with fairly
minimalist requests for reforms. And I wonder why this would be a moment that
the administration would be asking to separate the money we send to Egypt for
military support from our human rights requests, and our human rights work in
Egypt.”On his recent trip to the
Balkans, Murphy said:
“Senator Shaheen, Tillis, and I are just back from
a trip to the Balkans. I think Assistant Secretary Donfried is there this week.
 Tremendous opportunities [exist] in
the Balkans to try to shift alliances and allegiances there. Bosnia is a place
where there is a rapid deterioration of the security situation. We have to pay close attention there, but [there are]
many opportunities around Russia's periphery to convince folks that it's time
for them to stop sitting on two chairs.”Last week, Murphy and U.S.
Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) traveled to the Western Balkans and Brussels.
During their visit, the senators met with members of the respective countries’
governments, members of civil society and members of the press to address
numerous issues, including support for the region amid Russia’s unprovoked
invasion of Ukraine, anti-corruption efforts, democratic reforms, youth
engagement, safeguarding freedom of the press and more.You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with Secretary Blinken:MURPHY: “I do
not share my colleagues’ skepticism of a renewed nuclear agreement with Iran,
in part because the whole world has watched how difficult it is to craft a
Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine given Russia's status as a
nuclear power. And I simply cannot imagine why we would wish for a policy that
will allow Iran to be weeks, maybe months away from a nuclear weapon given all
of their malevolent activity in the Middle East.“What about
the last two months has been an advertisement that we will be better off if
more of our adversaries had nuclear weapons?“And I
appreciate the clarification you made to Senator Romney's question. Because it
is true, we have tried the alternative. We have indeed attempted to apply
significant costs on the Iranian economy and through President Trump's maximum
pressure campaign. And in fact, the result was not that Iran came to the table
on all of their other behaviors in the region. It was not that they held firm
on the commitments that they had made in the JCPOA. It was in fact that they
moved faster towards a potential nuclear weapon, they accelerated their
research program.“And so I want
to maybe ask you one more sort of question to level set where we are today. You
have stated, I think, very effectively, that the maximum pressure campaign did
not in fact, have the effect of constraining Iran's nuclear weapons program.
But for my colleagues that have significant concerns, rightly so, about Iran's
support for terrorist organizations, for regional proxies, money they put into
their ballistic missile program, is there any evidence that during the period
of time in which we have been out of the nuclear agreement, during the period
of time in which we have applied these significant sanctions, including
sanctions on the IRGC, that Iran has lessened their support for terrorist organizations
or proxy organizations or lessened the amount of money that they put into their
ballistic missile program?”BLINKEN:
“Senator, to the contrary. No. What we've seen is two things. First, during the
period of time when the original agreement was being negotiated, go back to
2012, through its entry into force, and the time when the Trump administration
pulled out 2018. 2012
to 2018, there were virtually no attacks on
American presence in the Middle East.“When we
pulled out of the agreement, when we imposed the Foreign Terrorist Organization
designation on the IRGC, and when Soleimani was killed, and no one is shedding
any tears for his demise, but I'm just stating the facts. When those things
happened, the attacks on our forces, on our personnel, on our people went up
dramatically. In fact, from 2019 to 2020, they went up 400%. So we've seen that
effect.“Similarly,
and it's an unfortunate fact of life that Iran is willing to dedicate what
resources it has to supporting its military, to supporting its various tools of
destabilization and terror, including the IRGC Quds Force, irrespective of what
its revenues are from other sources. And so we've seen sustained support for
those forces even during maximum pressure.“Again, we
share the same objectives. The question is, how do we most effectively reach
those objectives? That's what we're concerned with.”MURPHY: “Well,
thank you for that response. And I think you will find many of us on this
committee very supportive of your efforts to reenter that, that agreement.“Let me turn
to one other topic, and that is the topic of human rights. The assault on Ukrainian
democracy, I think has elevated the need for us to be incredibly consistent
between our words and our actions on supporting human rights and democracy.“You and I
have had a number of conversations about the pace of reform in Egypt, a country
that enjoys more direct U.S. military support than almost any other in the
world prior to the war in Ukraine. Buried inside your budget request is a
curious proposal that is a proposal to delink human rights conditions from
military aid to Egypt.“I worry about
the message that this would send to Sisi but also the world. They have made
tepid progress, even when presented with fairly minimalist requests for
reforms. And I wonder why this would be a moment that the administration would
be asking to separate the money we send to Egypt for military support from our
human rights requests, and our human rights work in Egypt.”BLINKEN:
“Senator first, I really appreciate your focus on human rights. Indeed, it's
central to President Biden's foreign policy. And that applies across the world,
including when it comes to Egypt. Let me just say quickly, a couple of things.“First, Egypt
is a vital partner for us. It's a vital partner in trying to sustain and
advance stability in the Middle East, to combat terrorism. It played a critical
role last year when tensions rose dramatically in Gaza. And it's played an
important role now in trying to keep things in check as well. So in many ways,
it's a vital partner. It's also an important economic partner for us.“At the same
time that does not divorce from our policy and our approach, the need to focus
on human rights and the concerns that we have about the Egyptian approach when
it comes to civil society, when it comes to freedom of expression, freedom of
assembly, political detentions, abuses etc.“I have
engaged President Al Sisi directly on this at some length, including the first
meeting that that we had. We continue to meet and engage with human rights
defenders, with civil society. Last year, we signed the Human Rights Council
statement at the UN expressing our grave concerns for the first time since
2014. And we reprogrammed some of the foreign military financing this past
year, because Egypt did not meet some of the objectives that we set out in
terms of making progress on human rights. And that will continue to be the case
going forward. It is however important to us to have maximum flexibility in
being able to deal with this and deal with this effectively.“I'd also say
that going back to the conversation on Russia and Ukraine. This is a critical
time too in the relationship with a number of countries, particularly countries
that may be reconsidering their own relationships and potential dependencies on
Russia.“They're
seeing how Russian military equipment is performing or not performing in
Ukraine. They're seeing growing challenges to Russia being able to sustain and
ultimately export its military equipment. They're making different decisions
about the future. That presents a strategic opportunity for us. One we want to
make sure that we also have flexibility to take advantage.“But I
completely share your focus on and concern about human rights, including in
Egypt. It is, it will remain a central part of our policy even as we work to
strengthen what is a vital partnership for us.”MURPHY: “Well,
very briefly, just count me amongst those who think it would be unwise at this
moment to delink our human rights conditions from military aid. This is a
country that still has more political arrests than Russia does. 60,000 people
have been arrested for political crimes in Egypt. That's a stunning number.“And as to
your point, finally, about countries that are rethinking their traditional
association with Russia, Senator Shaheen, Tillis, and I are just back from a
trip to the Balkans. I think Assistant Secretary Donfried is there this week.
Tremendous opportunities [exist] in the Balkans to try to shift alliances and
allegiances there. Bosnia is a place where there is a rapid deterioration of
the security situation. We have to pay close attention there, but [there are]
many opportunities around Russia's periphery to convince folks that it's time
for them to stop sitting on two chairs.”###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-shaheen-tillis-conclude-bipartisan-codel-to-serbia-bosnia-herzegovina-kosovo-belgium,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senators
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C), wrapped
up a bipartisan congressional delegation trip to the Western Balkans and
Brussels. During their visit, the senators met with members of the respective
countries’ governments, members of civil society and members of the press to
address numerous issues, including support for the region amid Russia’s
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, anti-corruption efforts, democratic reforms,
youth engagement, safeguarding freedom of the press and more.“Our bipartisan delegation
to the Balkans sent a strong, simple message: the time is now for the world’s
democracies to stand united against Putin’s war in Ukraine. If Serbia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina are serious about European integration, joining the United
States and Europe in our sanctions against Russia and advancing democratic
reforms are important steps toward that goal. We also emphasized the importance
of advancing the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue through the EU-facilitated talks.
The world may not be focused on the Balkans right now, but as Putin gets backed
into a corner in Ukraine, he will look to other countries to score a victory.
That’s why maintaining peace in the Balkans is so critical to European security
and why I was glad to return to the region to reconnect with leaders and
strengthen the long-standing ties between our countries. During this precarious
moment, NATO has never been more vital, and we concluded our trip in Brussels
to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to our transatlantic allies,” said Murphy.“Reaffirming U.S. support
for the Western Balkans has never been more important than amid Russia’s
indiscriminate war on Ukraine, which carries significant implications for the
security and prosperity of Europe. I’m pleased our delegation sent an
unwavering, bipartisan message to our partners that we stand with Western
Balkan nations during this pivotal moment in history, and we support their
continued path towards democracy and stronger Euro-Atlantic ties,” said Shaheen. “During
each stop, we met with government and civil society leaders to reiterate the
importance of strengthening institutions and rooting out corruption,
particularly amid Putin’s belligerence that threatens the stability of the
broader region. I was also pleased to meet with youth leaders in Kosovo and
Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are recipients of critical U.S. funding to build a
brighter, more democratic and prosperous future for their countries. Closing
the trip with a visit to Brussels, we reiterated our commitment to bolstering
U.S. coordination with our European partners to ensure the security and
prosperity of democracies across the globe. I appreciate Senators Murphy and
Tillis for their partnership this trip, and I will continue to support
democratic reforms and prosperity for the Western Balkans.”“Last week, I was proud to
visit Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Belgium with Senators Shaheen and
Murphy and deepen existing cooperation with our partners as Russia continues
its illegal war against Ukraine and threatens our NATO allies,” said Tillis. “The Balkans region is critical to
Europe’s security, and as co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, we made
it clear that the United States is committed to Europe’s sovereignty during
these uncertain times. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from leaders of
these countries and relay to our colleagues in Congress the importance of
supporting our partners.”
The senators kicked off their
trip in Serbia, where they encouraged Serbia to continue its transatlantic
journey toward E.U. membership amid Russian aggression against Ukraine. In
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the senators met with government officials and leaders
to discuss the deteriorating political situation and press for election reform
ahead of their October elections. They also attended a Youth Engagement
Reception with young leaders eager to build a better future for Bosnia and
Herzegovina. In Kosovo, the senators discussed securing peace, prosperity and
independence for the nation, and visited Camp Liya, which houses Afghan
refugees. The delegation concluded their trip with a visit to NATO headquarters
in Brussels to encourage NATO allies to prioritize peace and stability in the
Western Balkans and reaffirm support for a strong and robust NATO amid Russia’s
aggression.###"

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, on Wednesday joined CNN International’s Amanpour with
Christiane Amanpour from his trip
to the Balkans to discuss the United States’ continued support for Ukraine
and the implications of Russia’s war in Ukraine for European security and
stability. Murphy met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vu?i? and Prime
Minister Ana Brnabi? in Belgrade on Tuesday and the three members of the Bosnia
and Herzegovina (BiH) Presidency in Sarajevo on Wednesday.On his
meeting with the three members of the BiH presidency, Murphy said: “This is a very worrying time for
Bosnia. I know that the world's attention rightly is focused on Ukraine right
now. But as Putin gets backed into a corner, he is going to look for other
places to try to score victories, and one of them may be Bosnia. Bosnia today
is more fragile than it has been since the war…And so we did deliver a strong
message to, frankly, all of the political leadership [in Bosnia and
Herzegovina]. This is not the moment for them to just list their grievances to
the global community. This is a moment for them to sit down and find a path to
a workable federal state here. The world may not be paying attention to Bosnia
today, but I worry if things continue to slide in the direction that we've been
seeing over the past several weeks that the whole world could be focused on
this region if violence breaks out.”On his meeting with
Serbian President Vu?i?, Murphy said: “Our message to President Vu?i?,
someone I've known for a long time, was also a simple one. If Serbia really
wants to be part of Europe, then it can't be on the outside of the U.S.-Europe
sanctions against Russia. If it continues this outlier status of trying to play
a game of neutrality, there isn't going to be an invitation from Europe. So I
really do believe that President Vu?i? wants his legacy to be the integration
of Serbia into the European Union, but our message to him was, the only way
that happens is if Serbia joins us in our sanctions against Russia. And I can't
tell you if he made any commitments, but we had a really good candid dialogue.”On the potential for
Congress to authorize more aid to Ukraine, Murphy said: “I was glad to see the Biden administration step
forward with another nearly billion dollar aid package. I expect that Congress
will be ready to authorize additional aid when we return to Washington next
week. And I think this is the moment for the United States and Europe to
deliver to Ukraine what it needs to be able to win these key battles.”On the transfer of combat
aircraft, Murphy said: “That's a
complicated question because U.S. combat aircraft systems cannot be easily
transferred into Ukrainian hands. They simply aren't trained on our systems.
They need systems that other European partners have. And so that is a more
complicated dynamic that, frankly, involves more commitments from the Europeans
than it does from the United States. So I'm certainly willing to entertain that
kind of transfer. It ultimately is though a transfer more likely to come from a
European nation than it is from U.S.”Murphy highlighted the
Biden administration’s extraordinary efforts to support Ukraine and stand up to
Vladimir Putin: “Joe Biden doesn't
fear Vladimir Putin. He's going toe to toe with him with an extraordinary
commitment of military assets and assistance to the Ukrainians, backed up by
[the] American people who stand with Ukraine as well. Listen, this is a hinge
moment in world history. If Vladimir Putin gets away with the appropriation of
a neighboring country without a contest, without a fight, than it is a message
to other dictators and autocrats all around the world to try the same in their
neighborhoods. So I think Joe Biden has shown that he was the right president
for the moment, that he has had the mettle and the courage to stand up to
Vladimir Putin, and I think you'll continue to see remarkable commitments of
American resources to the Ukrainian fight.”Click here to view the entirety of Murphy’s interview.

nothing more than to see those divisions deepen. I’ve made several visits to
the Balkans during my time in the Senate and developed many close relationships

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-brown-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-increase-educator-tax-deductions-for-out-of-pocket-classroom-expenses,"WASHINGTON–U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, joined U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown
(D-Ohio) in introducing the Educators
Expense Deduction Modernization Act of 2022, legislation to quadruple
the amount educators can deduct from their taxes for out-of-pocket classroom
expenses. The current deduction for teachers is $250 – far less than most
teachers spend each year out of their own pocket on classroom supplies. The
legislation would increase that amount to $1,000 and index it to inflation
going forward.“Teachers go
the extra mile to give our kids the best education possible, and too often that
includes spending some of their own paycheck to provide basic school supplies
for their students. Especially after two tough years of teaching during a
pandemic, we need to do more to support educators. This bill would quadruple
the current deduction for out-of-pocket classroom expenses and get more of
those hard-earned dollars back in teachers’ pockets,” said Murphy.“Teachers work as hard as anyone – often harder – to support our
students, yet they aren’t paid nearly the salaries and benefits they deserve,
and they often spend hundreds of dollars of their hard-earned money on supplies
for their classrooms,” said Brown. “Ohio
educators shouldn’t have to dip into their too-small paychecks simply to do
their jobs. We need to allow teachers to deduct more of those costs from their
taxes, so they can focus on educating the next generation of Americans.”Educators
showed once again how indispensable they are to our communities throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Department of Education, 94 percent of
public-school teachers reportedly paid for classroom supplies without
reimbursement, with nearly 1 in 10 reportedly spending more than $1,000 each year. Teachers are paid
far too little -- on average 20 percent less than similarly-skilled
professionals – and are also too often asked to cover classroom expenses.State
spending on education has plummeted in recent decades. Increasing this
deduction recognizes the personal sacrifices so many educators make to ensure
our children have the tools to learn.The
Educators Expense Deduction Modernization Act of 2022 is endorsed by the
American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT),
National Education Association (NEA), Ohio Education Association (OEA), and the
National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).Original

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-statement-on-biden-administrations-crack-down-on-ghost-guns-nomination-of-steve-dettelbach-to-lead-atf,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Monday released the following statement after the
Justice Department issued
a final rule to rein in the proliferation of ghost guns and President Biden announced
the nomination of Steve Dettelbach to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives (ATF):“President Biden took two
big steps forward today to address the gun violence epidemic that is plaguing
our nation. Maybe people don’t pay as much attention when there aren’t
regular headline grabbing mass shootings, but gun deaths are way up across the
country since the pandemic began, and we can’t stand by and do nothing in the
face of this rising carnage. Ghost guns are increasingly the weapon of choice
for criminals in this country and this regulation will save lives. I also hope
the Senate will move Dettelbach’s nomination to head the ATF forward. It’s a
public safety nightmare that the ATF – the agency responsible for the
investigation and enforcement of federal gun laws, cracking down on illegal
guns, and going after gun trafficking criminals – has not had a
Senate-confirmed director in seven years. With Dettelbach at the helm, the ATF can help lead the way in keeping our
communities safe from gun violence.”Murphy continued, “It’s no
secret that great social change movements take time. Gun violence prevention
advocates have been met with obstacles and frustrations, but the people who are
a part of this grassroots movement won’t give up. Each day, each step brings us
closer to defeating the gun lobby and creating enough political headwinds to
finally end the scourge of gun violence across our country.”Murphy spoke on
the Senate floor last year highlighting the success of community violence
intervention programs in curbing gun violence and the importance of funding
these programs as rates of gun violence have surged during the pandemic.
Murphy, along with U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and U.S.
Representative David Cicilline (D-R.I.) led 45
lawmakers in introducing legislation to ban ghost guns.###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-transgender-youth-deserve-and-need-our-support-not-bullying-and-harassment-from-elected-leaders-trying-to-score-political-points,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Thursday took to the U.S. Senate floor
to call out Republicans’ politically-motivated attacks on transgender
youth and adults and the need to protect the transgender community.On the more
than 150 laws targeting transgender people introduced nationwide since the
start of 2022, Murphy said: “[T]he Trump wing of the Republican party has declared a war
against transgender kids, and these children have noticed. A recent survey of
transgender youth showed that half of them – 52% – had contemplated suicide
over the last year. Just think about that for a second, my colleagues – half of
all the kids who are transgender come to the conclusion, at some point in their
young lives, that they would be better off dead than live in a world that
believes they are threats to be marginalized or expunged.”Murphy called
out the faction of the Republican Party that has made attacking trans youth
their top priority: “And so here’s my message to the adults with power who have
decided to spend their days bullying these kids: Stop it. Grow up. So you’re
not ready to accept transgender people. Fine. I hope you’ll come around
someday. But these kids threaten no one. They are hurting no one.”On the
consequences of Republicans
targeting trans children to score political points, Murphy said: “Being a teenager today –
I know, I have one – with social media and the pandemic, it is hard enough. But
imagine being a teenager who wakes up every day knowing that they aren’t the
gender they were assigned by biology at birth…And then layer on top of that
some of the most powerful people in the world deciding to use their power not
to cure disease or end poverty or hunger, but instead use their power to target
those very scared, desperate kids, and to use their power to harass, bully, and
shame them. Imagine how small, how insecure, how weak a person must be to have
all that power, and use it to bully children.”“I tell you these
stories because they are the consequences of adults’ behavior. Donald Trump and
Marjorie Taylor Greene and their ilk, they aren’t murderers, but make no
mistake – there is a direct through line from the hateful words and policies of
leaders, and the misery that too many transgender, non-binary and gay kids are
going through today,” Murphy added.Murphy
concluded with a message to the trans community: “I want to make sure that
I finish by sending a message to transgender kids and adults that these hateful
people, this movement that is growing out there, to try to target you – it’s
not going to win. We are going to build a community of love and protection for
you. No matter how bad things may seem right now, they’re going to get better.
The world is going to get kinder. Adults are going to learn their lessons. And
if you don’t have it now, as you are struggling with your identity, you will
find a support structure that will nurture and support you. It’s out there for
you. You should be who you are. Don’t feel like you need to hide your true self
just because of these idiot adults who feel big by bullying people that are
different from them. Be who you are, and know that there’s a whole lot of us
who are going to work our tails off to support you, to love you, and to make
sure you get a chance to thrive. Because in the long run, the bullies never
win. They never do.”A full
transcript of his remarks can be found below:“Mr. President,
I’m one of the few parents of young children in the Senate, but almost every
one of us here is a parent. And so you know that one of the most spectacular
things your kid can do is to write you a letter.“Sometimes –
frankly, most of the time – when I’ve gotten those letters it’s because my kid
wants to protest something you’ve done. I’ve gotten a few of those where my
kids are so upset at a rule or a decision that we’ve made as parents that they
sit down and catalogue their grievances on paper.“Or maybe, if
you’re lucky, you get a nice letter. My in-laws still have one plastered up on
their wall from their youngest daughter, who wrote them a nice list when she
was young about the things she appreciated.“But those Dear
Mommy or Dear Daddy letter – that’s one of the rare joys of parenthood.“On March 6,
2018, Patricia Veerbeeck, awoke to find one of those letters for her, left by
her child Eric. It was laying on the pillow of his bed. She picked it up and
she read it to herself.“’Dear Mommy,’
her child wrote. Maybe her eyes twinkled, thinking of what sweet or funny
thoughts might come next.But this is what
the letter said.“’Dear Mommy, I
am sorry to do this to you, but I have killed myself by jumping off the top
floor – the 12th floor – of your building, at the nearest stair exit to the
elevators on that floor.“’I felt I could
no longer live my life as a lie, living as a boy instead of the girl I know I
could become. I am sorry I lied to you. I was losing hope in the world and
could not see my way out of the wrong body, and I decided it was time for my
life to end.’“As you might
imagine, Patricia didn’t get beyond that first line. Upon reading it, she
dropped the letter, and ran straight to her balcony. And below she saw the
vague outline of a body and police officers surrounding it.“I follow
President Trump’s family members on social media. I do it because I know how
influential they are. I know how many Americans – good, decent Americans –
admire them and listen to what they say.“And lately, the
posts from Trump’s family members have just been of one theme: America should
fear transgender children. The Trump family, and their network of supporters
and sycophants, have decided that Eric Veerbreck and other kids like them, are
the number one problem facing America today. And over the past year, this crowd
has orchestrated a relentless and unceasing campaign to marginalize, demonize,
and bully kids whose gender identity is different from their biological sex.“Mr. President,
this year alone, Republican state legislators across the country have
introduced 150 bills to deny rights to transgender Americans.“Today, the
Alabama legislature introduced legislation that is fast tracked, from what I
understand, to become law that makes it a felony, a felony, for a doctor to
provide health care to a transgender child.“In Texas, the
governor directed his child welfare agency to investigate parents like
Patricia, who are simply determined to support their children, if they help
them secure the gender-affirming treatment that they need. Criminalizing
parents of transgender children is just around the corner, in some states.“In Congress,
Trump’s allies spend more time talking about transgender kids than they spend talking
about health care or taxes or education.“Congresswoman
Marjorie Taylor Greene, perhaps Trump’s best ally in the House, had a sign
outside her office – calling the experience of trans people a fiction. Just to
bully her hallway neighbor, Representative Marie Newman, who has a transgender
daughter.“And in the
Supreme Court hearings here last month, at least one senator used their time on
the national stage to suggest that the entire idea of being transgender is a
left wing hoax.“All across America,
Republicans, not all Republicans, but the Trump wing of the Republican party
has declared a war against transgender kids, and these children have noticed.“A recent survey
of transgender youth showed that half of them – 52% – had contemplated suicide
over the last year. Just think about that for a second, my colleagues – half of
all the kids who are transgender come to the conclusion, at some point in their
young lives, that they would be better off dead than live in a world that
believes they are threats to be marginalized or expunged.“That’s a
national crisis – and we need to talk, honestly and candidly, about what has
led us to this moment.“We need to start
by acknowledging that this conversation is long overdue. This dialogue about
transgender children, it may feel new, but transgender kids aren’t, transgender
adults aren’t. The only difference between today, and say, fifty years ago, is
that today there is space for kids and adults to be open about who they truly
are.“We are all born
with a biological sex. And centuries of tightly controlled constructs about
what a man should be and what a man should act like, and what a woman should be
and what a woman should act like, they’ve sorted human beings into personality
and professional profiles based on that gender.“But there are
many of us, and this has been the case for human history, who do not associate
with the gender that biological chance ascribed to us. There are people who are
assigned male at birth, who feel – in their bones – that they are female.
That’s what Eric felt. That’s what Eric knew. And there are people who are
assigned female at birth, but know – they just know – that they are male.“And there’s
nothing wrong with that. That process, of figuring out which gender you
identify with, it poses no threat to anyone.“But Mr.
President, we do have to acknowledge how hard it is, given those centuries of
gender identity and stereotypes, for some Americans to understand what a kid
like Eric was going through.“For Americans,
for instance, who were born a male, and feel like a male, and are surrounded by
family and friends who associate with the gender that matches the sex they were
born into, the whole notion of a boy becoming a girl, or a girl becoming a boy,
I get it, it can be disconcerting. It can be difficult to understand.“But I also know
that this discomfort will pass, as more Americans learn what I’ve learned.
Transgender and non-binary children aren’t any different than any other kids.
You might not know a transgender or non-binary kid, but trust me, you do, you
know what these kids are like, because they are no different than any other
children.“My son has
transgender and non-binary friends. He has non-transgender friends, but when
they are all sitting around our kitchen after school, there’s no difference
between them, in terms of how they act, how they talk, what they’re like, what
they like, what they don’t like.“They are kids.
They are just kids.“And so here’s my
message to the adults with power who have decided to spend their days bullying
these kids: Stop it. Grow up.“So you’re not
ready to accept transgender people. Fine. I hope you’ll come around someday.
But these kids threaten no one. They are hurting no one.“And while there
are important conversations we need to have about how we include transgender
kids fully in sports, I could walk into a room of a thousand people in my
state, ask how many of them have had a child lose a sporting event to a
transgender girl, and not a single hand would raise.“‘Saving girls’
sports is not the reason why Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene and their
whole political movement has made bullying transgender kids their top priority.“No, it’s their
top priority because they know hate and fear of what some people don’t
understand has a habit of selling in this country. I wish that weren’t true,
but it’s always been true. There is always going to be a constituency in
America that will listen to an argument for why Black people or Mexicans or
Muslims or gay people or transgender people, are ruining America, why we should
fear them.“It’s not true.
It’s never been true. But demagogues and their movements tend not to have
actual ideas, things they are for. Demagogues normally just focus on what they
hate.“Let me say it
again: half of transgender children in the country have thought to themselves,
at some point that they would be better off dead than to live in a world where
so many people fear them. That is heartbreaking to know we are doing that, to
these kids.“Being a teenager
today – I know, I have one – with social media and the pandemic, it is hard
enough. But imagine being a teenager who wakes up every day knowing that they
aren’t the gender they were assigned by biology at birth. Imagine keeping your
feelings about that secret for years, worried, worried about what your parents
or your friends will say. Imagine the anguish of a scared twelve year old or
fourteen year old, sitting in bed, awake for hours each night, trying to
process all of that alone, with no help. Imagine the courage it then takes to have
that first conversation with a parent or friend.“And then layer
on top of that, some of the most powerful people in the world, deciding to use
their power not to cure disease or end poverty or hunger, but instead use their
power to target those very scared, desperate kids, and to use their power to
harass, bully, and shame them.“Imagine how
small, how insecure, how weak a person must be to have all that power, and use
it to bully children.“Seth Walsh was
gay, not transgender, but his experience was not much different than Eric’s.
Students at his school were systematic in their targeting of him, because of
his sexual orientation. They pushed him down the stairs, kicked him until he
was badly bruised. They screamed at him. Called him names. No doubt these
bullies took direction and inspiration from adults who paved the way, who
endorsed this kind of hateful behavior.“One day, after
one of these incidents, a frightened Seth called his mom and he said, “Mom, you
have to come get me right now.” His mother feel and hear the fear in his voice,
so she grabbed Seth’s little brother rushed to pick him up. His mom was so supportive.
That afternoon they sat and they talked. Seth took a shower to calm himself
down and afterward, he asked his mom for a pen and told her he was going to go
outside to play with the dogs.“Ten minutes
later, his mom went outside to continue this conversation with her son. But it
was too late. Seth had hung himself from a tree. The pen he asked for was for
his suicide note.“I tell you these
stories because they are the consequences of adults’ behavior. Donald Trump and
Marjorie Taylor Greene and their ilk, they aren’t murderers, but make no
mistake – there is a direct through line from the hateful words and policies of
leaders, and the misery that too many transgender, non-binary and gay kids are
going through today.“But I’m also
here to tell you that Trump and Taylor Greene, others like them, they are not
the majority. And I want to make sure that I finish by sending a message to
transgender kids and adults that these hateful people, this movement that is
growing out there, to try to target you – it’s not going to win. We are going
to build a community of love and protection for you. No matter how bad things
may seem right now, they’re going to get better.“The world is
going to get kinder. Adults are going to learn their lessons. And if you don’t
have it now, as you are struggling with your identity, you will find a support
structure that will nurture and support you. It’s out there for you.“You should be
who you are. Don’t feel like you need to hide your true self just because of
these idiot adults who feel big by bullying people that are different from them.“Be who you are,
and know that there’s a whole lot of us who are going to work our tails off to
support you, to love you, and to make sure you get a chance to thrive.“Because in the
long run, the bullies never win. They never do.“I yield the
floor.”###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-blumenthal-stabenow-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-extend-school-and-summer-meal-waivers-to-feed-children,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a
member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and
U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) joined U.S. Senator Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich.) in introducing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act,
which would extend USDA school meal waivers from June 30, 2022 to
September 30, 2023. These waivers have been crucial to helping schools and
organizations feed children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With
most schools still facing challenges as they return to normal operations,
the flexibilities the waivers provide give our
schools and summer meal programs much-needed support to deal with ongoing food
service issues and keep kids fed. The bill will also help schools transition
back to normal meal operations under the National School Lunch Program. USDA
requested this authority be extended in the omnibus.“School
meals have been a lifeline for millions of students throughout the pandemic,
and we can’t allow bureaucratic red tape to get in the way of providing free,
nutritious meals to our kids. Our bill would extend the USDA school meal flexibilities through this summer and the
next school year to make sure that no kid goes hungry while schools and
families continue recovering from COVID-19,” said Murphy.“For many students, school meals are their only
source for a nutritious meal. We need to remove barriers forcing so many kids
into hunger. This bill extends the lifeline that enables students to stay
healthy and grow intellectually and physically while providing sorely needed
relief to so many families struggling to make ends meet,” said Blumenthal. “We should make it easier for kids to get the meals they need
– not harder. Our bill cuts red tape and keeps the priority on giving children
the healthy meals they need and deserve,” said Stabenow. “As we come out
of this pandemic, schools are doing their best - but it takes time for them to
transition back to their operations before COVID. We can’t let hungry kids get
caught in the middle. Without this support, up to 30 million kids who get food
at school will see their essential breakfast and lunch meals disrupted. And
millions of hungry kids who rely on summer meals may have nowhere to go to get
food.”In
addition to Murphy and Stabenow, this legislation is cosponsored
by 50 members of Congress including U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska),
Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.),
Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina
Smith (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Cory Booker
(D-N.J.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin
(D-Ill.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Mazie Hirono
(D-Hawaii), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jack Reed
(D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.),
Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.),
Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Cslif.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Patty
Murray (D-Wash.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Cortez Masto
(D-Nev.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Gary Peters (D-Mich.),
Angus King (I-Maine), Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bob Menendez
(D-N.J.),Tim Kaine (D-Va.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse
(D-R.I.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.),
Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) Anti-hunger
and nutrition advocates reiterated the importance of these flexibilities and
applauded the senators’ bill to keep critical flexibilities for school
nutrition programs to feed children.“School meal programs, a crucial source of nutritional
support for millions of families nationwide, face tremendous immediate and
long-term challenges in the absence of these child nutrition waivers,” said
Beth Wallace, president of the School Nutrition Association. “Acute supply
chain disruptions, persistent labor shortages and escalating costs make it
impossible for these programs to return to normal operations next school
year. This legislation is absolutely critical to sustaining school
meal programs, ensuring children have access to nutritious school meals and
preventing substantial financial losses for schools nationwide.”“Without
Congressional action, the child nutrition waivers will end on June 30, 2022,
causing millions of children to face a hunger cliff when they lose access to
summer and school meals. Furthermore, schools and community-based organizations
that feed our nation’s children need time to recover from the impact of the
pandemic,” said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research &
Action Center. “We applaud Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this
issue and strongly endorse this bill which would extend waiver authority
through September 30, 2023. Hungry children can't wait."" ""As
our country continues to experience challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
including supply chain and labor shortages as well as increased food costs,
access to healthful school meals remains of the utmost importance,” said
Kevin L. Sauer, registered dietitian nutritionist and the 2021-2022
President of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Without crucial
waivers in place, more children will be at risk for food insecurity and schools
will no longer have flexibilities they badly need to operate successful,
financially solvent programs. The Academy thanks and supports Sen. Stabenow,
who is championing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, which would ensure
continued access to healthful meals for students.”“The sooner the USDA is authorized to extend child nutrition
waivers, the sooner schools and community organizations can plan meal programs
for summer and next school year,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice
president of Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign. “Schools and
community meal providers continue to face extreme pandemic-related challenges
like supply chain disruptions, rising food prices and staffing shortages.
Without waivers, they will have a difficult time responding to these challenges
in real-time, impacting their ability to safely and effectively reach kids with
the nutrition they need and stunting their ability to transition to normal
operations as those challenges subside.”“Nearly
12 million children struggle to know where their next meal will come from,
disrupting their ability to reach their full potential. Fortunately, child
nutrition waivers have helped provide year-round access to much-needed
nutrition. If the waivers aren’t extended, millions of children will lose that
access, with Black, Latino, and Native American children, and children in rural
areas, being hit hardest,” said Vince Hall, chief government
relations officer, Feeding America. “Because of the delay in extending the
waivers, some site sponsors will have to close summer and after-school meal
sites, translating to taking away meals that families are relying on to keep
their kids nourished. Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief
organization, applauds the introduction of this bill to extend child nutrition

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-cassidy-introduce-legislation-to-expand-childrens-access-to-mental-health-care,"WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator
Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.),
members of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced
the Supporting Children’s Mental Health Care Access Act, which would
reauthorize the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) program for another
five years to better promote the integration of behavioral health and primary
care for children. The PMHCA program supports state or regional networks of
pediatric mental health care teams to provide tele-consultation, training,
technical assistance, and care coordination for pediatricians and other
pediatric primary care providers to diagnose, treat, and refer children with
behavioral health conditions. The bill would also expand the types of providers
who can be part of the care team and add new sites where the program can
operate, such as emergency departments and schools.“As a parent of two young
kids, I know how tough the last two years have been, and there’s no doubt the
pandemic has worsened the children’s mental health crisis we’re facing. Parents
struggle to find the care their children desperately need because the health
care system is overwhelmed and underprepared. Congress needs to act, and
reauthorizing the PMHCA program would make sure more kids can access mental
health care by better integrating behavioral health with primary care at their
pediatrician’s office or even at school,” said Murphy.“Following
school closures and isolation, more young people than ever are suffering from
mental health issues,” said Cassidy. “The Pediatric Mental Health Care
Access program provides these children with the attention and support they
need.”“Pediatricians are witnessing
the escalating mental health crisis facing young people in our clinics,
practices and hospitals across the country. Tackling this crisis, which has
only been exacerbated by the pandemic, will require comprehensive action to
ensure all children can access mental health services where they are, including
schools and their pediatrician’s office. The Supporting Children’s Mental
Health Care Access Act will reauthorize the Pediatric Mental Health Care
Access Program and make needed progress toward reaching children and teens with
the care and services they need. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
applauds Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) for their
leadership on addressing youth mental health and calls on Congress to pass this
critical legislation without delay,” said AAP President Moira Szilagyi, MD,
PhD, FAAP.The PMHCA program was created
in bipartisan legislation authored in 2016 by Murphy and Cassidy in the bipartisan Mental
Health Reform Act in 2016, which was signed into law by
President Obama. Last fall, the senators solicited
wide stakeholder input as they draft legislation to reauthorize the
PMHCA and many other important mental health programs.This legislation is supported
by 30 national organizations: American Academy of Family Physicians, American
Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Mental Health Counselors

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee, on Tuesday applauded President Biden’s Executive
Order on Strengthening Access to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. Murphy
attended the signing ceremony at the White House.“Twelve years ago, the
Affordable Care Act transformed our health care system. Millions of Americans
gained health care coverage and the assurance they could never again be denied
coverage due to a pre-existing condition. In Connecticut, more than 112,000
people are currently enrolled through Access Health CT and 522,000 people with
pre-existing conditions are protected,” said
Murphy. “Despite the Republican Party’s relentless attacks and efforts to
repeal, the ACA is more popular than ever. I’m glad to see President Biden
continuing to build upon its success and expand access to affordable,
high-quality care. Our health care system is still far from perfect, and I’m
pushing in Congress to cut drug prices and lower premiums to make sure every
American gets the care they need and deserve.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-highlights-grotons-thayermahan-as-innovator-of-the-month,"HARTFORD–U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.) announced that ThayerMahan, based in Groton, has been named
March’s “Innovator of the Month.” ThayerMahan is a maritime technology company
which provides services and expertise to the maritime security, defense and
intelligence, subsea infrastructure, offshore energy, living marine resources,
and acoustic science sectors. Last year, they were selected by the U.S.
Department of Energy’s National Offshore Wind Research and Development
Consortium as one of fifteen projects to receive funding in support of the
Biden administration’s goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.“Over
the last five years, ThayerMahan has quickly become an important player in
Connecticut’s vibrant maritime economy. Their team is
pioneering technology that will prove invaluable to the state’s investment in
new offshore wind farms to ultimately help lower energy costs and reduce
emissions. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in the
state,” said
Murphy.“We are honored to be
recognized by Senator Murphy. Connecticut is a great place to start and operate
a maritime technology business. There is a highly skilled engineering work
force in Southeastern Connecticut and a very positive business climate. The
State of Connecticut helped us get started with loans from Connecticut
Innovations, the state’s ‘venture capital arm.’  Connecticut Small Business
Express Program was also vitally important in the early days. We’ve grown from
3 to 75 people. We are proud of our team of engineers and operators,” said Michael Connor, President and CEO of ThayerMahan.
“We need more people and offer interesting jobs to people who can help us
develop cutting edge technology in the fields of marine robotics, underwater
acoustics, software engineering and artificial intelligence. Our growth will
accelerate as the US offshore wind industry takes off in Southern New England
and New York. We also stand to benefit as the Department of Defense learns to
harness the efficiency of autonomous maritime vehicles and sensors. The
Connecticut Congressional Delegation understands the importance of sustainable
offshore energy and the need for a strong, efficient national defense.”Murphy believes
entrepreneurship and innovation are the building blocks for a strong economy.
In the U.S. Senate, he has introduced two bipartisan pieces of legislation to
incentivize angel investors to put more money into startup companies—the Angel Tax Credit Act and the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act. Startup companies create an average of 2 million jobs each year.

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-there-is-absolutely-no-reason-why-supreme-court-justices-shouldnt-be-subject-to-a-code-of-conduct-just-like-every-other-federal-judge,"WASHINGTON—Given
recent revelations regarding the political activities of Supreme Court justices
and their spouses, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) took to the U.S.
Senate floor to highlight the importance of holding Supreme Court justices to
the highest ethical standards. Murphy discussed his legislation, the Supreme
Court Ethics Act, which would require the Judicial Conference of the
United States to create a code of conduct that applies to all federal judges and justices—including
those on the Supreme Court.Murphy emphasized the absurdity that Supreme Court justices are
exempt from the code of ethics that applies to every other federal judge: “[E]very
federal judge — circuit judges, district judges,
Court of International Trade judges, Court of Federal Claims judges, bankruptcy
judges, magistrate judges — every federal judge is
bound by a code of ethics in order to safeguard the judiciary’s neutrality and
transparency. All
federal judges except for nine. The Supreme Court. And it’s not because the Supreme Court is so highly
regarded by the American people. In
fact, the opposite is true. Trust in the institution’s reputation is in rapid
decline right now.”On
the history of Supreme Court justices failing to uphold ethical standards,
Murphy said: “Recent revelations surrounding
Justice Thomas and his wife’s involvement in the events of January 6th have
finally brought attention that those standards we try to uphold during the
confirmation process quickly disappear upon confirmation. This isn’t some new
phenomenon. We’ve seen justices — both liberal and conservative — promote
political fundraisers, speak at partisan events, fail to recuse themselves from
cases with pretty clear conflicts of interest. And if the past is prologue,
this recent incident that has gained a lot of attention regarding Justice
Thomas’s family, it won’t be the last.”On
his legislation, the Supreme
Court Ethics Act, Murphy said: “I first
introduced a bill that would require the Supreme Court to adopt a code of
ethics ten years ago, and I’ve reintroduced a version of that bill in every
Congress since.  The majority of
Americans agree with me — there is absolutely no
reason why the Supreme Court shouldn’t be subject to a code of conduct just
like every other federal judge... And to be clear, I’m not talking about a
code of conduct that’s written
by Congress. Instead, my legislation would require the Judicial Conference to create a binding code of conduct that
applies to all federal judges and justices, including those on the Supreme
Court. It’s a
simple step that would improve transparency, enforce accountability, and
restore some lost faith in the institution.Murphy highlighted the danger of the public
losing trust in the Court: “And frankly, because of that diminishing faith,
it’s in the Court’s interest to do everything possible to help rebuild public
confidence. During Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, Justice Kagan put
it best. She said, ‘The court’s strength as an institution of American
governance depends on people believing it has a certain kind of legitimacy, on
people believing it’s not simply an extension of politics, that its
decision-making has a kind of integrity to it. If people don’t believe that,
they have no reason to accept what the court does.’ Justice Kagan said it well.
And right now, that belief is teetering dangerously close to the edge.”Murphy
concluded: “I think my Democratic
and Republican colleagues can agree on this: the American people deserve to
know that our Supreme Court justices are being held to the highest standards,
whether they be justices appointed by Democratic presidents or justices
appointed by Republican presidents. It’s not enough for us to just trust the
Court any longer to self-enforce a secret, internal code of ethics. The highest
court in the land cannot be exempt from the standards we hold every other
federal judge to.”A full transcript of his remarks can be found below:MURPHY: “The process of confirming a Supreme Court justice is
supposed to be lengthy, thoughtful, rigorous. I’m grateful to the presiding
officer and to Chairman Durbin for doing it right with
Judge Brown Jackson.“Judge Jackson has answered hours of questions about her judicial
philosophy, why she made certain decisions, why she represented certain
clients, how her background has shaped her worldview. Nearly every detail of
her professional and personal life has been and will continue to be
interrogated publicly as she goes through the final stages of this process.“But a strange thing is going to happen once Judge Jackson finally
takes her seat on the Supreme Court. She will, after all this review and
scrutiny, become effectively immune from ethics standards.“Why is that? Because every federal judge — circuit judges, district judges, Court of International
Trade judges, Court of Federal Claims judges, bankruptcy judges, magistrate
judges — every federal judge is bound by a code of ethics in order to safeguard the
judiciary’s neutrality and transparency. “All federal judges except for nine. The Supreme Court.“And it’s not because the Supreme Court is so highly regarded by
the American people.“In fact, the opposite is true. Trust in the institution’s
reputation is in rapid decline right now.“According to a recent C-SPAN poll, only about 37% of likely
voters believe that the Supreme Court acts in a ‘serious and constitutionally
sound manner.’“In a democracy that prides itself on a fair and independent
judiciary, that’s unacceptable. It’s worrying, but it’s not surprising. “Recent revelations surrounding Justice Thomas and his wife’s
involvement in the events of January 6th have finally brought attention that
those standards we try to uphold during the confirmation process quickly
disappear upon confirmation.“This isn’t some new phenomenon. We’ve seen justices — both liberal and conservative — promote political fundraisers, speak at partisan
events, fail to recuse themselves from cases with pretty clear conflicts of

a lot of attention regarding Justice Thomas’s family, it won’t be the
last. “I first introduced a bill that would require the Supreme Court to
adopt a code of ethics ten years ago, and I’ve reintroduced a version of that
bill in every Congress since. “The majority of Americans agree with me — there is absolutely no reason why the Supreme Court shouldn’t be
subject to a code of conduct just like every other federal judge.“But the Court disagrees. John Roberts said in 2011 when he was
asked about this ‘the Court has had no reason to
adopt the Code of Conduct as its definitive source of ethical guidance.’“Well, it has a reason now.“And to be clear, I’m not talking about a code
of conduct that’s written by Congress. Instead, my
legislation would require the Judicial Conference to create a binding code of conduct that applies to all federal
judges and justices, including those on the Supreme Court.“It’s a simple step that would improve
transparency, enforce accountability, and restore some lost faith in the
institution.“And frankly, because of that diminishing faith,
it’s in the Court’s interest to do everything possible to help rebuild public
confidence. “During Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation process,
Justice Kagan put it best. She said, ‘The court’s strength as an institution of

legitimacy, on people believing it’s not simply an extension of politics, that
its decision-making has a kind of integrity to it. If people don’t believe
that, they have no reason to accept what the court does.’ Justice Kagan said it
well.“And right now, that belief is teetering
dangerously close to the edge. The spouse of a Supreme Court justice was
involved in an effort to organize a coup — an
overthrow of the democratically elected President of the United States. That is
extraordinary. That is not normal. It should not be treated as just another
flavor of legitimate political action.“And the fact that there is no clear binding code
of conduct that addresses this kind of behavior, and no clear standards of
recusal for Supreme Court Justices that the American public can see and trust,
is just unacceptable.“I think my Democratic and Republican colleagues
can agree on this: the American people deserve to know that our Supreme Court
justices are being held to the highest standards, whether they be justices
appointed by Democratic presidents or justices appointed by Republican
presidents.“It’s not enough for us to just trust the Court
any longer to self-enforce a secret, internal code of ethics. The highest court
in the land cannot be exempt from the standards we hold every other federal
judge to.“I'm glad that this piece of legislation has
gained additional cosponsors just over the course of the last week. I hope that
it eventually becomes a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I'd urge my
colleagues to join me in holding the Court to account.”

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday hosted Madness, Inc., a live
virtual summit featuring three panels with current and former college athletes
and advocates to discuss the gross inequities in college sports and how we fix
them. Murphy moderated a panel with U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman, the
House sponsor of the College Athlete Right to Organize Act, Bart Sheard,
Legislative Representative with the AFL-CIO, and Kassidy Woods, a member
of the University of Northern Colorado football team, on empowering
college athletes.Murphy
highlighted that college sports are a multi-billion dollar industry where the
people doing the work make nothing, saying: “The college sports
industry has grown almost overnight from a $3 or $4 billion industry to a $15
billion-a-year industry, and the only thing that's different
about big-time college athletics versus professional athletics
is that the people doing the work aren't getting paid. That is a civil rights
issue. It's an economic rights issue. And if we don't fix it, we'll be worse
off as a nation, but frankly, college sports won't be around 10 or 20 years
[from now] because students are getting wise to this game, and as someone who's
a diehard college sports fan, I want students to have the ability to go to
school and play sports, but get fairly compensated for the amount of money that
they're making right now for everybody else in the college sports industry.”Woods
shared his story on how organizing as a college athlete during the pandemic
cost him his scholarship: “During the height of the pandemic, a lot of the
athletes, we didn't feel that our health and safety was taken into
consideration. And so along with myself and many other guys across the PAC 12,
we decided to do the #WeAreUnited movement to demand for health and safety
protections because we weren't seeing anything done throughout the summer and
up until fall camp. And so with them, I decided to call my coach and let him
know that just I didn't feel safe. I mean, I have sickle cell trait, so my
health was at risk with the virus and I just didn't feel safe playing.”Woods
continued: “And so as I proceeded to tell my coach about this, he said it’s
one thing to talk about, you know, being out for COVID and having sickle cell
trait, but it's another thing to start this movement called #WeAreUnited, which
demands for health and safety protection. So that's when he proceeded to cut
me. I lost all access to my facilities. I lost my scholarship. I didn't get fed
and as a full scholarship athlete actually you are supposed to get fed. And I
didn't receive those benefits. I was told to go home.”Bowman
highlighted how the labor rights issue in college sports is a microcosm of
American inequality: “Over the last several decades, wages have been
stagnant, labor has been under attack, and the cost of living has gone up,
right. So we have this level of inequality in our nation, and college sports
captures all of that. I mean talk about TV deals, ticket prices, apparel costs,
price of tuition at colleges have gone up substantially. Students choose
universities based on the popularity of the athletics departments. I mean,
that's a fact. So all of this money that’s generated – all this money that
coaches make, that presidents make, TV deals – people are getting wealthy,
while our athletes continue to struggle and not feel empowered to have a voice
in anything, let alone how much money they make.”On
the circular argument of amateurism in college sports, Sheard said:
“This myth of amateurism and student athletes is kind of the backbone of this
exploitation system that has gone on. The NCAA relies on revered tradition in a
way explaining of why athletes shouldn’t deserve compensation, but it's kind of
a circular, confusing argument, right. Like these workers, these college
athletes are amateurs because they don't get paid. And we can't pay them
because they're amateurs. It doesn't really make any sense.”On
the millions of dollars schools spend on coaches compared to scholarships,
Murphy said: “I think people need to understand the plight of
college athletes today. While their coaches are making multi-million dollar
salaries, all the athletes are getting is the scholarship. And now the NCAA
will say the scholarship is good enough, but let me just give you a point of
comparison. If you look at the Power 5 schools, there are about 4,500 coaches,
and there are about 45,000 athletes. The coaches are making more money in
salary than the total amount of scholarship for the 45,000 athletes.”Woods,
who is a current college athlete, shared his hope for the future:
“[W]e can revolutionize the NCAA. We can and we will by doing the work,
creating nonprofit and democratically-led players’ associations, creating labor unions to bargain
collectively for us to be employees at our respective universities and any
changes that we want to be made in the future. I really do believe that we can
do it. It's just cool to see how many athletes are speaking out because
 just because we are the exploited group within the system doesn't mean
that we can't use our voices to make change.”Murphy
along with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and U.S.
Representatives Lori Trahan (D-Mass.) and Jamaal Bowman
(D-N.Y.) introduced the College Athlete Right to Organize Act,
legislation to provide collective bargaining rights for college
athletes. Murphy and Trahan also wrote the College Athlete Economic Freedom Act, which
grants unrestricted rights to college athletes over the use of their name,
image, and likeness.Click

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/connecticut-leaders-announce-state-will-receive-50-million-to-make-homes-more-energy-efficient-and-lower-costs-this-year,"WASHINGTON–Connecticut
leaders on Wednesday announced that the state will receive $50 million for Fiscal
Year 2022 to help lower-income families lower their utility bills with energy
efficient upgrades. This expanded funding, which is enabled by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, will allow Connecticut to retrofit thousands of low-incomes
homes to make them healthier and more energy efficient while lowering utility
bills.The Weather Assistance
Program (WAP) retrofit funding is designed to address the “whole home”
including installing insulation, updating heating and cooling systems,
upgrading electrical appliances, and taking other common-sense actions that
will make homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer with less energy
usage.“High energy costs make it
more difficult for Connecticut families to keep their homes warm in the winter
and cool in the summer. This federal funding will help upgrade and retrofit
homes – making them more resilient to climate change while cutting monthly
energy costs. This is just one example of the sort of smart investments our
state will be able to make thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” said Murphy.“This funding will provide
welcome relief to many more Connecticut families who are struggling to heat
their homes. Last fall, I visited the home of an elderly Waterbury resident who
benefited from this weatherization program, saving her nearly $500 a year on
heating costs. Working families deserve this kind of relief. I am proud the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which we fought so hard for in Congress, will
help hundreds of Connecticut families to lower energy costs and keep more money
in their pockets,” said Blumenthal.“Energy costs have
skyrocketed recently, leaving many families choosing which necessity they will
pay for each month. This funding that we fought for in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law will help lower-income households lower their energy costs
in a cleaner way,” said Larson.“Fuel costs are rising
around the world right now, and my office has heard from many constituents
about the rising prices of things like home heating costs and electric bills,” said Courtney. “It’s important to know that help
is still available for many working families to offset these costs through
programs like Connecticut Energy Assistance, funded by the American Rescue
Plan, and that more is on the way now thanks to the new bipartisan
infrastructure law. This is going to help more families heat their homes, and
lower their bills for the long-term with cleaner, higher-efficiency energy
usage.”“The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law makes strategic investments in our energy efficiency that
will decrease monthly costs for families across the country,” said DeLauro. “Today’s announcement of an expanded
Weatherization Assistance Program is a commitment to energy reform, addresses
gas prices, and reduces the pollution that causes global warming. Through an
expanded Weatherization Assistance Program, we will increase the energy
efficiency and safety of America’s homes and give middle-class families more
breathing room every month on their energy bills. By investing in the largest
residential energy efficiency program in the nation, this puts our country on
the path to lower costs for families, create green jobs, and move us closer to
the energy efficient economy we need.”“As climate change makes
extreme weather more common, many Connecticut families face the impossible
choice of putting food on the table or heating their homes. This assistance
will help ease the burden of energy costs, providing warmth and safety in the
winter months,” said Himes.“The climate crisis and
rising energy costs hits vulnerable communities hardest. Expanding clean energy
programs will better support struggling Connecticut families by lowering energy
bills and preserving our environment in communities that are often overlooked,” said Hayes.“Thanks to our amazing
Congressional delegation, Connecticut has even more resources to help lower
energy costs and meet our statewide carbon reduction goals. The increase in
annual weatherization funding to our state is yet another example of the
bipartisan infrastructure law paying dividends for the people of Connecticut,” said Lamont.“This unprecedented level of funding to ensure that homes
are properly weatherized and energy efficient will help low-income Connecticut
residents and families in so many ways, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said.
Proper weatherization of homes means homes are livable and comfortable- warm in
the winter and cool in the summer. It also means less money spent to heat or
cool a home, less money and energy wasted, and as a result, less energy used.
This means less emissions going into our environment, which will help in our
efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change. I thank the Biden
administration and our Congressional delegation for securing this funding,
which prioritizes energy efficiency and clean energy uptake in historically
overlooked markets and addresses equity concerns in populations
disproportionately affected by climate change,” said Dykes “Home energy retrofits and
upgrades – like electrification, heat pumps, LED lighting, insulation, and
sealing up leaks — can slash monthly energy bills for families and improve the
air we breathe,” said Secretary of
Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Thanks to the transformative investments in
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we will be able to help
households in disadvantaged communities, create cleaner air, and generate
good-paying local jobs in every corner of America.”Since 1976, WAP
has served over seven million households and delivered an average of $372 in
annual energy savings for American families. Today’s funding announcement will transform
the WAP program by expanding weatherization services to ten times current
funding levels, creating jobs, and reestablishing economic opportunities in
communities that have been hit the hardest by economic, racial, and
environmental injustices. In
addition to creating more energy-efficient homes, weatherization investments
make homes more resilient to climate change, help create good-paying jobs,
reduce energy costs, and support cleaner air and public health.  ###

that the United States will welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians that have fled
their homeland as a result of Putin’s invasion.“I am glad to see the Biden administration announce today
that the U.S. will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians. This is a step in the right
direction, but we not only need to do more to make sure that Ukrainians fleeing
violence are safe and protected, we must also increase the number of refugees
we are admitting from all over the globe. Immigrants and refugees make our
community stronger. Connecticut stands ready to do our part to help these
refugees,” said U.S. Senator Chris
Murphy.“I applaud President Biden’s announcement that the United
States will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. Having recently visited the
Poland/Ukraine border with a number of colleagues on a bipartisan trip, I saw
women and children fleeing the horror and terror that Putin has caused. I
continue to support increased humanitarian aid and provision of lethal arms to
end this conflict as quickly as possible. The 3.5 million refugees that have
already fled Ukraine and have added to an already burgeoning refugee and
humanitarian crisis around the globe. Last year, 26 million refugees were
displaced from areas as diverse as Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan,
and Myanmar. I continue to call on the administration to enable more of our
at-risk Afghan allies to escape the Taliban. They helped Americans, our troops
and diplomats, and they remain under dire threat from the Taliban. We must
continue to bring them to safety as quickly as possible. Today’s announcement
is a positive step addressing the humanitarian catastrophe stemming from
Putin’s war in Ukraine, but there remains more to be done to help refugees
across the globe,” said U.S. Senator
Richard Blumenthal.“Connecticut has a proud history of welcoming those in
need, and we will welcome with open arms those Ukrainians seeking refuge from
the death and destruction caused by the unjustified and unprovoked Russian
invasion of Ukraine. We have welcomed those from Syria and Afghanistan in
recent years, and we will spare no effort in the preparation for the arrival of
those from Ukraine. We will do everything in our power in state government to
ensure the needs of families making their way to Connecticut from Ukraine have
the resources they need and the support necessary to provide for a smooth
transition,” said Lamont.“Putin’s horrific attacks against Ukraine have led to a
humanitarian and refugee crisis. More than 3.5 million Ukrainians have
fled and need help. That's why I voted for nearly $14 billion assistance
for Ukraine. I applaud President Biden’s announcement that the United
States is going to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees
and is allocating an additional $1 billion in humanitarian assistance. We in
Connecticut stand ready aid them,” said
U.S. Representative John B. Larson.“President Biden’s decision is welcome news for
Connecticut’s Second District which has a vibrant Ukrainian American populace
who, along with their neighbors, will welcome innocent civilians seeking safe
refuge from Putin’s war machine. Everyday since Russia’s criminal attack on
Ukraine I hear from constituents asking how they can help. The President’s
decision will create a meaningful opportunity for our region to provide care
and healing to a proud and heroic people,” said
U.S. Representative Joe Courtney.“I applaud President Biden for today’s announced plans
for the United States to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, as well as others
fleeing Russia’s malicious aggression. More than 3.5 million refugees have now
fled Ukraine since Russia’s unwarranted invasion—the largest number and fastest
since World War II. And according to recent reports, thousands of civilian
buildings, structures, and vehicles in Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed.
So, as Russia continues to deliberately target women, children, and other
innocent civilians, I want to be clear – I will continue to stand with the
Ukrainian people. The United States has a moral responsibility to do the right
thing and provide a safe haven for these families,” said U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro.“Each day Putin grows more savage in his attacks on
Ukraine. More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes as the Russians
indiscriminately attack innocents.  That is why President Biden’s decision
to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees comes with not a moment to spare. Speaking
with my constituents at rally after rally in solidarity with Ukraine, they are
resounding in their readiness to accept and support Ukrainian refugees in need.
Connecticut has been and will continue to be a place that accepts refugees
fleeing war and persecution with open arms,” said U.S. Representative Jim Himes.  “More than 3 million refugees have already fled their
homes in Ukraine, and 4 million more are expected to seek safety as the Russian
invasion continues. This is not Ukraine’s problem-this is a humanitarian crisis
that demands a global response. The actions of the United States and the
international community send a clear message of support,” said U.S. Representative Jahana Hayes.“We are glad that the United States of America will
welcome up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine.  We continue to pray for
peace and an end to the war,” said Myron
Kolinsky, Organizational Director of the Ukrainian National Home of Hartford.“Our heartfelt thanks to President Biden for this larger
than expected humanitarian gesture. These refugees are innocent victims of
Russia’s war on Ukraine and its people. The Allies must provide more weapons to
Ukraine in order to end this war,” said
Myron Melnyk, member of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America.“IRIS applauds the White House announcement to resettle
100,000 Ukrainian refugees. We urge the United States Government to extend a
similar offer of welcome to all those who have been forced to flee their home
countries regardless of nationality, religion, or race.  With the help of
our generous community, IRIS stands ready to welcome Ukrainians as we have
welcomed Afghans, Syrians, Congolese and others who have fled persecution and
war,” said Chris George, Executive
Director of IRIS – Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services.“We are heartened by President Biden’s commitment to
resettle 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. CIRI stands ready to welcome and assist
refugees fleeing war and persecution spurred by the unjustified invasion of
Ukraine. Our legal team is currently aiding Ukrainians residing in Connecticut,
and CIRI’s refugee resettlement and unaccompanied minor teams are prepared to
assist all seeking safety and support.  We urge the public to join us in
supporting our current and welcoming our new neighbors,” said Susan Schnitzer, President and CEO of Connecticut Institute for
Refugees and Immigrants.###"
https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-if-putin-lays-one-finger-on-a-nato-country-the-united-states-is-going-to-respond,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) joined Washington Post Live for an interview with Jonathan
Capehart on President Biden’s trip to Brussels and Poland, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine and the U.S. response, as well as a nuclear agreement with Iran.On President
Biden’s comments about removing Russia from the G20, Murphy said: “I think in
general Russia can’t remain as a member of the world community in good
standing. Of course, that's difficult to achieve in the G20 where you still
have a number of nations there that have continued good relations, economic
relations, security relations with Russia. But there have to be broader
consequences to Vladimir Putin as he changes strategy in Ukraine. He has given
up on the idea that he can take Kyiv or Kharkiv or Lviv by traditional military
ground invasion. He is now going to target civilians as a mechanism of
terrorism to try to drive Zelensky to the negotiating table.”On four new
NATO battle groups heading to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, Murphy
said: “I just don't
think we can rule out that he [Putin] is going to move troops into a NATO
country. I don’t think we can rule out that he might use missile strikes
against a NATO ally. And this has to be the moment where we beef up our
capabilities on the eastern flank of NATO. That's going to be expensive, but we
have a sacred obligation to defend NATO like NATO defended us when we were
attacked on September 11th. So I think this is a moment of great
uncertainty. We do not know what Putin is going to do next. We can't believe
that he is a rational actor, and thus we've got to be ready for what we thought
was unimaginable: a Russian attack on NATO soil.”On Russia’s
assumptions that they would quickly be able to conquer Ukraine, Murphy said: “I think it involves a constant underestimation
amongst think tanks and military planners about the impact of psychology on
warfare. I mean, we thought the United States was going to be able to come in,
invade Iraq and Afghanistan and within weeks or months be able to control and
pacify the country. We had no concept of the psychology in those nations, which
ultimately led to long term resistance based upon territorial defense of
people's homes. The same is happening in Ukraine today, and it is just another
sobering reminder of how difficult it is for foreign powers to move their
armies into lands they don't truly understand amidst hostile intent from local
citizenry.”On President
Biden’s upcoming trip to Poland and the message he should send, Murphy said: “[O]ur
commitment to NATO is total and absolute. If Putin
lays one finger on a NATO country, the United States is going to respond and
Putin needs to know that and the Polish people need to know that. Remember,
there's only one time in the history of NATO that Article 5 has been
exercised. That's the part of the NATO charter that says when one country is
attacked, everyone rises to defend that nation. That was after September 11th.
The Polish people sent troops to Afghanistan to
defend the United States and so we want to make clear that we will do the same
if Poland or any other NATO ally is attacked.”On the Biden
administration’s announcement to accept 100,000 Ukrainians, Murphy said: “Let’s take
more. 100,000 is a good start, but, you know, this is a hinge moment in world
history. As I mentioned before, we'll be judged as to whether we were big
enough, smart enough, strong enough, and generous enough to meet this
moment…Let's open our doors. I'm glad that President has made this big, early
commitment to take in 100,000 Ukrainians, but our country is big enough to be
able to do more.”On securing a new Iran
nuclear agreement with or without Russia, Murphy said: “I want a deal done with or without Russia because I've been
in Intel briefings that are absolutely bone-chilling. One,
because Iran is weeks away from having enough nuclear material to make a weapon
and two, there's no other available path to stop Iran from getting a nuclear
weapon besides diplomacy…So I know the administration is looking at different
options with Russia in, with Russia out, but the bottom line is no deal cannot
be an option. Because no deal is Iran on the brink of having a nuclear weapon
and a nuclear arms race being set off in the Middle East. Given everything that
we're dealing with in Ukraine right now, why on earth would we want that
problem too?”Click here to watch the full

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, on Thursday applauded Committee passage of the Diplomatic Support
and Security Act.“The United States faces
an increasing number of conflicts around the world that cannot be brought to an
end through military force alone, which is why we need experienced diplomats
deployed on the ground in fragile states and conflict zones. American troops
are highly capable and skilled, but nothing can replace the value of diplomacy,
especially in countries like Iraq and Yemen where the conflicts have
complicated political and economic roots. I’m glad the Committee passed this
bipartisan legislation to get the State Department out of its bunker mentality
and balance the inherent risks of expeditionary diplomacy with the potential
value to U.S. national security,” said
Murphy.Last March, Murphy introduced
the Expeditionary Diplomacy Act, legislation to ensure we have
sufficient diplomatic and political expertise on the ground in fragile states

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-urges-federal-government-to-do-more-to-enforce-mental-health-parity-laws-address-childrens-mental-health-crisis,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.) spoke on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing
about strengthening federal mental health programs. Murphy highlighted
his ongoing work and the federal government’s role in ensuring more health
insurance plans are compliant with mental health parity laws, as well as the
importance of increasing the number of pediatricians who can provide mental
health care.On the Murphy-Cassidy
Mental Health Parity Compliance Act of 2019, Murphy said: “The
latest piece of legislation we passed required the administration to do audits
of insurance plans to see if they were actually in compliance with federal
parity laws. What we know is that while your Statement of Benefits will often
tell you that you have access to mental health treatment, when you go to get
that treatment, you will face what we call non quantitative treatment
limitations…[T]he report we were given in January, essentially came to the
conclusion that not a single one of [the plans surveyed by the Department] was in compliance with parity laws.”On the
federal government’s role in expanding mental health parity compliance, Murphy
added: “[F]amilies ultimately are not going to be able to enforce this right
because the sort of details of obstruction of care are so byzantine often. It
really has to be regulators that do this job. And we definitely have more
opportunity at the federal level to enforce those laws.”On addressing
the pediatric mental health crisis and the importance of inclusive primary
care, Murphy said: “We talk about this problem we have with getting enough
practitioners, but we've got tens of thousands of pediatricians, who often,
frankly, don't have a lot of background in mental health. And it seems to me
one of the easy things we could do is just have a conversation with a
profession to make sure that either in the initial training or in some
postgraduate training opportunity, more pediatricians have a background in
mental health and substance abuse, but particularly in mental health.”Earlier
this month, Murphy introduced
the Closing
Health Coverage Gaps for Public Servants Act, legislation to close a
critical gap in health insurance coverage for mental health and substance use
disorders treatment for frontline workers. Last fall, Murphy and U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy,
M.D. (R-La.) released a request for stakeholder input on recommendations to
strengthen federal mental health and substance use disorder programs that were
included in their bipartisan Mental
Health Reform Act that was signed into law in 2016.You can read Murphy’s full exchange with Miriam E.
Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D, Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use
and Carole Johnson, Administrator for Health Resources and Services
Administration:MURPHY:
“Thank you very much. Thank you to all of you for your tremendous work. And for
your time before the committee today “Senator
Cassidy and I, along with Senator Murray's help, and others have been really
focused on this issue of mental health parity. We've passed several different
pieces of legislation through this committee, got signed by the president since
2016.“The latest
piece of legislation we passed required the administration to do audits of
insurance plans to see if they were actually in compliance with federal parity
laws. What we know is that while your Statement of Benefits will often tell you
that you have access to mental health treatment, when you go to get that
treatment, you will face what we call non quantitative treatment limitations,
all sorts of prior authorization, bureaucracy, red tape that stands in the way
of you getting that treatment.“I forget the
exact number that the Department surveyed,
but about 50 plans, and the report we were
given in January, essentially came to the conclusion that not a single one of
these plans was in compliance with parity laws.“And
interestingly, when they notified the plans that they had set up these
burdensome barriers to mental health care that they didn't have on the physical
health side, the plans fixed those issues. And all of a sudden, thousands of
people had access to mental health that they didn't have.“Secretary
Delphin-Rittmon, great to see you. I want to ask you a question. Because I
noticed that in the SAMHSA joint block grant application, there's some language
in there that says resources should be used to support not supplant services
that will be covered through the private, through private and public insurance.“And so you
kind of reference the fact that, you know, it's supposed to be insurance that's
on the frontlines here, and then we're gonna come in on the back end, but that
sentence also sort of suggests a knowledge that insurance is not actually
providing the kind of reimbursement that it should.“So can you
talk a little bit about how you approach this issue? I mean because we don't
want federal dollars to essentially be filling in what insurers should be
covering. And this report we got in January tells us that we just have massive
noncompliance in the insurance industry with existing parity laws.”DELPHIN-RITTMON:
“Thank you, Senator Murphy, and it's good to see you as well. And, you know,
parity is such an important issue for the American people in terms of health
care and ensuring that both primary care and behavioral health is appropriately
covered.“I mean, as
you know, SAMHSA has no regulatory authority here. But we do see ourselves as
a, in some instances, a convener or we help to give states information around
how they can advocate and even families. You know, we've convened policy
academies.“We feel that
it's important for individuals as well states and communities to know what the
parity laws are. And so those policy academies,
which we are looking to bring back, additional policy academies, are one
strategy for helping states have information around how to, you know, how to
work with providers, and to promote advocacy in this area.“And we have
resources as well for individuals and families. And we feel that's important as
well, because people need to know how to advocate if they're not having
coverage for services and support, which they feel that they should be
covered.”MURPHY: “I
think that's important, but insufficient, right? I mean, families ultimately
are not going to be able to enforce this right, because the sort of details of
obstruction of care are so byzantine often. It really is has to be regulators
that do this job. And we definitely have more opportunity at the federal level
to enforce those laws.“Just one
quick other topic for you, Ms. Johnson,
wanted to talk to you about the state of pediatric mental health. We talk about
this problem we have with getting enough practitioners, but we've got tens of
thousands of pediatricians, who often, frankly, don't have a lot of background
in mental health. And it seems to me one of the easy things we could do is just
have a conversation with the profession to
make sure that either in the initial training or in some postgraduate training
opportunity, more pediatricians have a background in mental health and
substance abuse, but particularly in mental health.”JOHNSON:
“Thank you for the question, Senator. I think that that is where we should be
headed in pediatric and all clinical training that clinicians across the board
need to have training and exposure to mental health and substance use disorder
needs and conditions. We need, in my view, we need primary care to be inclusive
of mental health.“And so that
is what we're working on at HRSA and what we're going to continue to push
forward on going forward. Thank you for your leadership on the pediatric Mental
Health Access Program. We really see that as an exciting model for how we can
continue to help clinicians who are in practice now get the kind of mental
health supports that they need to build up their capacity.“What we're
seeing anecdotally from that program is really people being able, clinicians
being able, to handle more and more mental
health conditions and refer fewer. So we're excited about continuing to grow
that program.”MURPHY: “And
just very quickly, I that program is a mechanism by which pediatricians can get
a phone or virtual consult with a mental health practitioner. I agree that
program, which is included in the 2016 Mental Health Reform Act, it has already
shown positive results, but that can be partnered with the pediatricians
themselves having a greater level of expertise and something that hopefully
this Committee will work on.”###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/mid-child-care-crisis-murphy-highlights-connecticuts-call-for-child-care-investment-and-barriers-to-finding-summer-child-care,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.) spoke on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing about the importance of child care and
preschool for working families. Murphy explained how the lack of affordable
child care hurts both families and employers, and highlighted the barriers
families face and sacrifices they often make to find child care during the summer. Last
week, child care workers held rallies across Connecticut calling for increased
funding.“When I'm in Connecticut, especially as the parent of
two school-aged kids myself, I know that nothing causes parents
to tear their hair out more than dealing with the increasingly unaffordable
cost of child care and the relative unavailability of quality child care
options today,” Murphy said.On
the impact of childcare on the labor force, Murphy said: “In Connecticut, we
have a lot of major companies that have you know, frankly, asked the state
legislature for a big public sector commitment to child care. Just a handful of
them that have testified recently in Connecticut: Bigelow Tea, General
Dynamics, Electric Boat, Boehringer, Hartford Healthcare. 124,000 parents of
young kids in Connecticut said in a recent survey that…their work has been
disrupted by child care issues. And employers see this too — their inability to recruit good talent
because of the lack of availability of childcare.”Murphy
added: “I remember meeting one young woman, a parent of two, who was out of
the workforce simply because she couldn't find care for her youngest child. And
of course, that story can be replicated literally millions of times over.
People who are out of the workforce, for one reason only — because they can't find child care. That
hurts them, but it also hurts employers too.”On
finding childcare during the summer, Murphy said: “I've spent a lot of time
on this committee talking about the importance of good summer programming for
kids. I thought it would have been a mistake to just send kids back to summer
school last year. I thought that they needed a little bit more sort of holistic
and comprehensive care. But parents will tell you that summer is the nightmare,
and the amount of time and energy they spend trying to get their kids in good
care and the amount of income that they forgo during the summer is really
extraordinary. A recent survey suggested that 57% of families said that at
least one parent made a sacrifice during the summer to care for kids that
involved a reduction of income. That's catastrophic for families that are
living paycheck to paycheck.”Last year, Murphy authored an op-ed in Hearst CT to make the case for
funding for summer enrichment programs.You can read Murphy’s full exchange with Julie Kashen,
Director of Women’s Economic Justice and Senior Fellow at the Century Foundation, and Rhian Evans Allvin, Chief
Executive Officer of the National Association for the Education of Young
Children (NAEYC):MURPHY:
“Thank you very much, Madam Chair. This is as important a hearing as we're
going to have. When I'm in Connecticut, especially as the parent of two school-aged
kids myself, I know that nothing causes parents to tear their hair out more
than dealing with the increasingly unaffordable cost of childcare and the
relative unavailability of quality childcare options today.“We
are a family that can afford care for our kids. And yet it frankly takes up
hours and hours every week just trying to arrange that care and make sure that
it's there.“So
let me just delve into two subjects that I wanted to touch on today. And I
thank you all for your tremendous testimony and work in this critical field.“First,
to you Ms. Kashen, I want to talk a little bit about the employers’
perspective on the investment that we are contemplating. In Connecticut, we
have a lot of major companies that have you know, frankly, asked to the state
legislature for a big public sector commitment to childcare. Just a handful of
them that have testified recently in Connecticut: Bigelow Tea, General
Dynamics, Electric Boat, Boehringer, Hartford Healthcare.“124,000
parents of young kids in Connecticut said in a recent survey that, we believe
that 124,000 parents have testified, that their work has been disrupted by
childcare issues. And employers see this too — their inability to
recruit good talent because of the lack of availability of childcare.“I
remember meeting one young woman, a parent of two, who was out of the workforce
simply because she couldn't find care for her youngest child. And of course,
that story can be replicated literally millions of times over. People who are
out of the workforce, for one reason only — because
they can't find childcare. That hurts them, but it also hurts employers too. So
what's employers’ take on the status of childcare affordability and how it
impacts their bottom lines?”KASHEN:
“Senator, that's exactly right. There is a huge push by business leaders to
invest, for Congress to invest in childcare. And that's because they know that
business disruptions cost a lot of money, you know, childcare related business
disruptions.“The
report that I just did with the Center for Economic Policy Research found that
across the nation we could gain $60 billion in economic activity by reducing
those childcare related business disruptions. So that's a lot of money.“The
other thing is it's just a very personal piece, too. I think about Jessica and
Jason Morrison in Pennsylvania, who Jessica works full time they have two kids.
Jason has been at home during the day taking care of their kids. And he works
for Uber and Lyft at night and on weekends. So basically, they are not really
seeing each other. He was offered a great job, he was very excited, the
employer was so excited to have him. They could not find or afford childcare.
They found waitlists, they found blocks every chance they got, and so he had to
say no to that job. And that's what's happening a lot around the country, for
dads, for moms who cannot do the work they want to do because they don't have
access to affordable childcare. “MURPHY:
“I think it's important to put it in that broader economic context. Second
question, wanted to drill down on a particular time of the year that's really
tough for parents. So I'll pose this question to Ms. Evans Allvin on behalf of
the industry, but I know others could answer as well.“As
Senator Murray knows, I've spent a lot of time on this committee talking about
the importance of good summer programming for kids. I thought it would have
been a mistake to just send kids back to summer school last year. I thought
that they needed a little bit more sort of holistic and comprehensive care.“But
parents will tell you that summer is the nightmare, and the amount of time and
energy they spend trying to get their kids in good care and the amount of
income that they forgo during the summer is really extraordinary. A recent
survey suggested that 57% of families said that at least one parent made a
sacrifice during the summer to care for kids that involved a reduction of
income.“That's
catastrophic for families that are living paycheck to paycheck. What's the
particular barriers that families face during the summer? And how can the
proposals that we're considering help?”EVANS
ALLVIN: “Senator, I can tell you from personal experience with three children
that the summer is a nightmare, and I get nervous as we every time we start
planning for what the activities will be in the summer and how we're going to
figure it out and wing it as most families do.“And
that is why the idea of full day, full year care, birth to five is really
important. We don't solve this problem with just a part day program or just a
small investment. We solve it when it's full day, full year care. And that is
the notion of both keeping kids safe while their parents work, which happens in
a full year, and maximizing on what we know the science of high quality early
childhood education.“You
really look at, Ellen might have mentioned this, but look at also how the field
has responded over the last two years with the pandemic. And other than a brief
shutdown at the beginning of the pandemic for public health reasons, childcare
has largely been open and childcare providers, early childhood educators have
made herculean efforts to ensure that children are safe, that it's a safe
environment, but still that it's a high quality early learning environment.“And
we've watched that happen. They've done it on shoestring budgets. And it's
just, that's not fair. It's not fair. And we send the wrong message to them
when we do that.“I
also just want to take a minute to address the question about costs to
families. I'm not sure where we're getting the statistics that this is going to
increase costs by $13,000 to families. And in fact, it's free for three and
four year olds. It’s pre-K that is free for three and four year olds. And what
I have seen, the cost estimates that I have seen, goes as far as for a family
earning $130,000 a year to drop costs by $13,000. So I just think we need to
get clear on kind of the impact that we'll have and make sure that we're
aligned on the math that we're using.” ###

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Chairman
of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia,
Central Asia and Counterterrorism, on Tuesday released the following statement
on the Houthi attacks in the United Arab Emirates and the retaliatory attacks
in Sana’a:“I
strongly condemn the Houthi drone attack on Abu Dhabi’s international airport,
which killed three civilian workers and damaged critical infrastructure. The
increase in Houthi cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE is deeply
concerning and a serious threat to the civilian population of neighboring
countries – including tens of thousands of American citizens. At the same time,
recent coalition airstrikes on Sana’a also killed a number of civilians,
including young children, and destroyed a water treatment facility in Saada,
which more than 120,000 Yemenis depend on. It is incumbent on all parties to
the conflict to avoid targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure,” said Murphy.
“Unfortunately, these incidents will likely continue as long as the war drags
on. The international community must do everything possible to bring the
fighting to an end, and it is incumbent on all parties to the conflict to
prevent further harm to civilians.”

UKRAINE–U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a
member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Rob Portman (R-Ohio)
Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and
Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) on Tuesday met with Ukraine President
Volodymyr Zelensky as part of their trip to Ukraine. During their meeting, the
senators expressed strong solidarity with Ukraine in the face of increased
Russian aggression, including further military buildup on the Ukraine/Russia
border as well as the ongoing conflict in Donbas and purported annexation of
Crimea. The
senators expressed their deep concern over the buildup of Russia's forces in
and around Ukraine, and pledged to continue to support funding for Ukraine's
defense in the U.S. Senate. Discussions touched further needs Ukraine has for
assistance to counter the Russian threat. The senators also discussed the need
for Ukraine to continue its democratic reforms in order to position the country
for membership in NATO.The
senators discussed increased funding for the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative that recently passed Congress as part of the Fiscal Year
(FY) 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. The initiative has been
extended through 2022 and its funding has been increased from $250 to $300
million per year, with at least $75 million specifically designated for lethal
assistance. The funds will be used to help train, equip, and provide support
for the Ukrainian government and armed forces in their effort to defend their
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity against Russian
aggression. “Russia’s
increasingly aggressive actions in and around Ukraine are deeply concerning,
and it’s critical that Putin understands the United States stands with the
Ukrainian people and their right to decide their own future. In our meeting
with President Zelensky, we expressed our unwavering bipartisan support for
Ukraine’s sovereignty and continued democratic reforms and reaffirmed our
commitment to ensuring they have the defensive weapons system necessary to
protect against a threatened Russian invasion,” said Murphy.“Vladimir
Putin has made the biggest mistake of his career in underestimating how
courageously the people of Ukraine will fight him if he invades. Vladimir
Putin’s plan is to divide, demoralize, and degrade democracy through a hybrid
war of cyber, military action, and misinformation. But there will be
consequences for this unprovoked aggression. America is bound to Ukraine by an
unshakable dedication to freedom, independence and democracy. We will continue
to stand with the people of Ukraine - unstintingly and unwaveringly – as they
fight this battle,” said Blumenthal.“This
is a critical time in Ukraine’s history and our delegation sent a message to
Russia and the people of Ukraine that the United States stands with Ukraine in
response to unwarranted and unprovoked Russian aggression,” said Portman. “As
a bipartisan delegation representing different parts of the country across the
political spectrum, we made it clear that the cause of freedom knows
no political boundary in the U.S. Congress. We expressed our solidarity with
the people of Ukraine in protecting their sovereignty and territorial
integrity.”“Our
bipartisan delegation concluded a comprehensive series of meetings with
President Zelenskyy and members of his administration, and throughout the day,
made clear that the United States is united across party lines in support of
Ukraine against Putin’s belligerence,” said Shaheen. “I’m proud to have
partnered with Senator Portman to lead this group of lawmakers to reaffirm our
nation’s resolve to stand with our democratic partners. I look forward to
sharing feedback with our Senate colleagues so we can swiftly get to work on a
path forward in Congress to respond to the political situation in Ukraine and
Eastern Europe that safeguards Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Europe’s energy
security and broader regional stability. Efforts are underway to enhance our
laws that will empower the Biden administration with tools to work with our
allies to prepare penalties for Putin amid his provocations, and increase aid
to Ukraine.""“In the face of Russian aggression, it is
incredibly important to have our bipartisan delegation come to Kyiv and
demonstrate Congress’ enduring support for Ukraine. We had an informative and
productive trip. There is strong unity in our respect and support for the
Ukrainian people and their independence,” said Cramer. “At a
moment of political division in Washington, we instead chose to travel to
Ukraine in unity. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine who have now lost
14,000 people at the hands of Russia,” said Klobuchar. “The U.S.
administration – from the Secretary of State to the President himself – has
pledged to help this country. Our message is that there will be consequences if
Vladimir Putin chooses to violate the sanctity of this democracy.”“Ukraine
is a vital U.S. partner who is standing resolute in the face of Vladimir
Putin’s shameful and illegal aggression,” said Wicker. “I appreciated
the opportunity to meet with President Zelenskyy to express our strong and
united support for Ukraine. It is imperative that the United States stay strong
in the face of Russian aggression and stand by our friends who are fighting for
freedom.”

to see that Republicans and Democrats are to stand together to defend Ukraine
in the face of a threatened Russian invasion. This will be my seventh trip to
Ukraine as a Senator, and I look forward to reconnecting with President
Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials to complement the administration’s
diplomatic work and protect U.S. national security interests,” said
Murphy. “I
am proud to join this bipartisan group of senators reaffirming the United
States’ unwavering, unstinting commitment to Ukraine. I look forward to meeting
directly with Ukraine’s President and senior leadership to learn firsthand the
state of their military preparedness in the face of Russian aggression – and to
understand what further support they may need to more decisively deter and
defend against Russian invasion. Russia’s recent cyberattacks show the need for
strong action now: greater military assistance, severe sanctions, and
cooperation with NATO allies. In this urgent, historic moment we must show,

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-statement-on-failure-of-cruz-proposal,"WASHINGTON—U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, on Thursday released the following statement after the
failure of a Republican measure that would have required the imposition of
sanctions waived by President Biden last year as part of a diplomatic campaign to
stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The bill required 60 votes to pass and failed by a vote of 55-44.“It
won’t shock people to learn that this bill was really about harming Joe Biden
politically, not strengthening U.S. and
Ukrainian security. This piece of legislation was designed to complicate
President Biden’s foreign policy, plain and simple, and would have done so by
tearing us apart from our European allies, right at a time that we’re working to
deter Russia from further invasion into Ukraine. I look forward to working with
my colleagues on Senator Menendez’s legislation that will complement—not
undermine—the administration’s sound diplomatic strategy to counter Putin and
protect our national security interests in the region,” said Murphy.
Earlier today, Murphy slammed
Senate Republicans on the U.S. Senate floor for their efforts to undermine U.S.
diplomatic efforts to deter further Russian aggression in Ukraine. Murphy
explained why Senator Cruz’s sanctions bill would not stop the completed Nord
Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational, and instead, how it would divide
us from our European partners and empower Russia. Murphy co-sponsored the Defending
Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, critical legislation to impose steep
costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine.###

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ct-congressional-delegation-announces-3325-million-grant-to-ctdot-for-covid-19-response,"HARTFORD– The Connecticut Congressional Delegation today announced that the U.S.
Department of Transportation has awarded a $332.5 million grant from American
Rescue Plan (ARP) funds to the Connecticut Department of Transportation
(CTDOT). American Rescue Plan transit funds are intended to help transit
agencies around the country maintain service and keep workers on the payroll as
communities continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This award comes at
a crucial moment as agencies nationwide are facing the challenge of a new
variant. “Connecticut’s transit service workers have kept our state running
throughout this pandemic. Whether it’s getting people to work, the grocery
store, or the doctor’s office, transit service workers have been among our
frontline heroes working day in and day out to get Connecticut residents where
they need to be. We are proud to have fought for this critical funding that
protects essential jobs and maintains safe and reliable transportation options
for Connecticut residents,” said members of the Connecticut Congressional
Delegation.     
“Thanks to President Biden and Connecticut’s Congressional delegation, American
Rescue Plan Act funds are supporting the recovery of our states’ public
transportation systems that suffered tremendous financial losses resulting from
the pandemic,” Governor Ned Lamont said. “A strong economy is dependent upon
having on a strong transportation system, and by making these investments we
are supporting the ability of thousands of people every day to get to their
jobs and earn a living.”
“These American Rescue Plan Act dollars are a lifeline for Connecticut’s public
transportation operations,” said CTDOT Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. “Public
transportation is about connecting communities and thanks to the support of the
Connecticut Congressional delegation, we can ensure the families and workers
that depend on us, our customers, continue to have the transportation services
they need in their daily lives.”
“Public transportation has helped people reach their jobs at hospitals, grocery
stores, ports, and more throughout this pandemic,” said U.S. Transportation
Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “This funding from President Biden’s American Rescue
Plan will help keep transit service running, protect transit employees from
layoffs, and ensure people can get where they need to go.”
The grant funds for CTDOT will help maintain and improve transit service for
Connecticut residents and visitors as the agency continues to address
pandemic-related challenges such as decreased ridership and staff shortages.
Connecticut’s diverse and robust public transportation network supports more
than 3.6 million residents. In 2019, CTDOT provided 11 million trips in total
across multiple modes of public transportation. Its bus service alone provided
10.4 million trips in 2019, making it one of the largest bus operators in the
Northeast.
This funding is part of more than $30 billion for public transportation in the
American Rescue Plan Act which was signed into law by President Biden last
March. The funding comes from the $26.6 billion allocated by statutory formulas
to urban and rural areas, Tribal governments, and for the enhanced mobility of
seniors and individuals with disabilities. The Act also included $2.2 billion
for additional transit pandemic-associated need, which will be awarded later
this year. No local share is required for this funding.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member
of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Thursday slammed Senate
Republicans on the U.S. Senate floor for their efforts to undermine U.S.
diplomatic efforts to deter further Russian aggression in Ukraine. Murphy
explained why Senator Cruz’s sanctions bill would not stop the completed Nord
Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational, and instead, how it would divide
us from our European partners and empower Russia.Murphy
criticized the ineffective sanctions in Senator Cruz’s Nord Stream 2 sanctions
bill: “The
sanctions in this bill are, unfortunately,
pretty feckless. They’re feckless because they can be undone
easily, within 30 to 60 days, by the Russian government. The
reality is if we don't convince our European partners to stop moving
forward with this project, there's no amount of U.S. sanction that
can be effective here. What we know is even if you were to sanction
this German-Swiss company, German board of directors, in a matter of
days, weeks, maybe a few months, the Russians could reengineer
the financing and the administration of the project to keep it
going.”Murphy continued: “[T]hink about this from the German
perspective. They finally said yes to the United States. And the
minute that they say yes is the minute that the United States Senate
decides to sanction German citizens. That's bad diplomacy…We need to
be sending a message to Vladimir Putin that the United States and
Europe are together and that we are going to deliver a crushing package
of sanctions if you enter Ukraine any further. This would be a gift
to Vladimir Putin because it's a signal of division at a moment when
we need to be standing together.On the Defending
Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, which he cosponsors, Murphy said: “Senator Menendez has proposed
a bill which I think can draw support from 90% of this
body that enacts a set of sanctions on Russia if Russia moves
any further into Ukraine, beyond where they are already
in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. That sends the right
signal. That's an effective message of consequence rather than
this proposal which apparently is a set of sanctions Republicans
are going to ask to be waived and divides us from our
partners at a moment when we need to be together.”Murphy also debunked
Senator Cruz’s argument that pipeline construction stopped after the previous
sanctions bill under former President Trump: “Senator Cruz says that the construction of the
pipeline stopped when Congress passed the Nord Stream sanctions and
didn't begin again until Joe Biden became president. I've seen
that repeated in the press. And it just isn't true. One company
that was laying the pipeline backed out of the project when the 2019
sanctions bill was passed, but then guess what happened? Russia
started retrofitting other ships to finish the job, and the minute
that they were permitted, construction began again. Not when Joe
Biden was president—when
Donald Trump was president. The ships were ready in May of 2020,
before Joe Biden was even nominated, and they started work a few
months later as soon as the Danish government permitted them.”Murphy
slammed Senate Republicans for their hypocrisy in holding up President Biden’s
State Department nominees over Nord Stream 2: “[I]n 2020, Senator Cruz didn't hold up any of
Donald Trump's State Department nominees when Trump was
refusing to implement sanctions, when the Russians sent ships that
started showing up to restart construction. Not even when construction restarted
in the fall of 2020. Nope, during this time all of Trump's State
Department nominees sailed through without a single Republican
objection or blockade.”“This bill isn't
going to help Ukraine. It's designed to hurt the President of the
United States, and, unfortunately, some—not all, not all—but
some of our Republican colleagues here have consistently put their
desire to politically harm President Biden ahead of their desire to
protect the nation,” Murphy concluded.This week,
Murphy co-sponsored the Defending
Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, critical legislation to impose steep
costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine.A full
transcript of his remarks can be found below:“First and foremost,
let me thank Senator Shaheen. She has been a leader in the Senate and
in our caucus on raising alarms about the danger of Nord stream 2 to
European security and Ukrainian security, and I’ve been so glad to
work with her over these past several years. And I'm here on the floor to
join her in our strong opposition to the legislation that is pending
on the floor as we speak.
“If this bill
passes, it won't make the Nord Stream pipeline any less
likely. It won't stop Russia from invading Ukraine. In fact, it will
do the exact opposite. It will make the completion of Nord
Stream more likely, and it will be a gift to Russia, dividing us from
our European allies right at the moment when we need to be in
solidarity with them in order to deter Russian aggression. “I'll try not to
repeat too much of what Senator Shaheen has said, but let me
just underscore the points she has made. First, the sanctions in
this bill are, unfortunately, pretty feckless. They’re feckless
because they can be undone easily, within 30 to 60 days, by the
Russian government. The reality is if we don't convince our
European partners to stop moving forward with this project, there's
no amount of U.S. sanction that can be effective here. What we
know is even if you were to sanction this German-Swiss company,
German board of directors, in a matter of days, weeks, maybe a few
months, the Russians could reengineer the financing and the
administration of the project to keep it going. “Even more
interesting to me is what Senator McConnell just said. Senator
McConnell just came to the floor and said while he supports Senator Cruz's
proposal, he expects that the Biden administration will waive
the sanctions. So then why are we engaging in this in the first
place if Republicans are going to support the waiving of the
sanctions? Because the sanctions would interrupt our negotiation
with Germany, why pass the bill in the first place? So
apparently many Republicans are supporting the Cruz bill but then are
going to be asking the Biden administration not to
implement it. That does not seem to make a lot of sense. “The primary impact
of this bill, as Senator Shaheen explained is to divide us
from Germany. Why is that? Because we know that the only way
to stop Nord Stream 2 is by convincing Germans and
other Europeans to stop the project. Now, we have for the first
time since we began talking to the Germans about this,
convinced them to press pause. First time the German government
has decided to press pause through their regulatory agencies, they
have stopped the certification of the pipeline which by the way
is built. It was
95% built when President Trump left office. He let it be constructed. 95%
built. It is now 100% built.“But the Germans
have, because of American diplomacy and because of the threat of
invasion of Ukraine from Russia, pressed pause on
its project. It can't start until the summer or the
fall. And, frankly, that time allows us to continue to engage
with the Germans and others to try to convince them that this
project is not in their interest. “So think about this
from the German perspective. They finally said yes to the United
States. And the minute that they say yes is the minute that the
United States Senate decides to sanction German citizens. That's
bad diplomacy. It's just bad diplomacy. And it's a moment at which
we have to be in lockstep with our European partners. We need to
be sending a message to Vladimir Putin that the United States and Europe
are together and that we are going to deliver a crushing package of
sanctions if you enter Ukraine any further. This would be a gift to
Vladimir Putin because it's a signal of division at a moment when
we need to be standing together.“Senator Menendez
has the right approach. Senator Menendez has proposed a bill
which I think can draw support from 90% of this body that
enacts a set of sanctions on Russia if Russia moves any further into
Ukraine, beyond where they are already in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. That
sends the right signal. That's an effective message of consequence
rather than this proposal which apparently is a set of sanctions
Republicans are going to ask to be waived and divides
us from our partners at a moment when we need to be together.“Lastly, I want to
address one particular point that I've heard Senator Cruz make over
and over and over again in defense of his proposal. Senator Cruz says
that the construction of the pipeline stopped when Congress passed the Nord
Stream sanctions and didn't begin again until Joe Biden became
president. I've seen that repeated in the press. And it just
isn't true. “One company that
was laying the pipeline backed out of the project when the 2019
sanctions bill was passed, but then guess what happened? Russia
started retrofitting other ships to finish the job, and the minute
that they were permitted, construction began again. Not when Joe
Biden was president—when
Donald Trump was president. The ships were ready in May of 2020,
before Joe Biden was even nominated, and they started work a few
months later as soon as the Danish government permitted them. “Now, Senator
Shaheen and Senator Cruz had passed a sanctions bill with all of our
support at the end of 2019. And during all of 2020 while the Russians
were retrofitting these ships, while they were sending them back
to Danish waters, while the permitting was happening,
Donald Trump didn't enact one sanction that was permitted by Congress.
Congress passed a law at the end of 2019. All of 2020 Donald Trump didn't
enact a single sanction. “This was the
critical moment. This was the time in which the meat of the pipeline
was being built, and President Trump did nothing and he paid
no consequence for it. You know why? Because in
2020, Senator Cruz didn't hold up any of Donald Trump's State
Department nominees when Trump was refusing to implement sanctions,
when the Russians sent ships that started showing up to
restart construction. Not even when construction restarted in
the fall of 2020. Nope, during this time all of Trump's State
Department nominees sailed through without a single Republican
objection or blockade. “On Trump's last day
in office, his last day, literally as he was packing up the Oval
Office, January 19, he sanctioned one ship and the company that
owned the ship. Essentially a signal of how little he
cared. On the day that he was leaving, he sanctioned one company and
the company that owned the ship, but by this time 95% of the
pipeline was complete. It was too late, and then he begrudgingly
hands over the keys to the Oval Office to Joe Biden and leaves
the incoming president with a mess. A pipeline 95% built that
Donald Trump could have stopped if he had used the sanctions that
he was given. “So you can
understand why some of us wonder what the motivation is behind
Senator Cruz's extraordinary tactics now when the pipeline is
already built. It seems that the difference between 2020 and 2021
is essentially that now there's a Democrat in the White
House. This bill isn't going to help Ukraine. It's designed to
hurt the President of the United States, and, unfortunately, some—not all, not all—but
some of our Republican colleagues here have consistently put their
desire to politically harm President Biden ahead of their desire to
protect the nation. Holding up the confirmation of President
Biden's nominees, it doesn't help the security of the nation. It just
increases the chances that the United States won't have the personnel
on hand to deal with a crisis somewhere around the world when it develops
and that that failure may hurt Joe Biden's
approval rating. Unfortunately, I think that's what's going on
here. Unfortunately, I think that's what's going on here, and I
hope that my colleagues see it.”

crisis in Afghanistan and called on Congress and the Biden administration to
take action to save the lives of the Afghan people facing famine and economic

leave. The American people–by a large margin–support that decision,” said Murphy. “But right now, we need to

nightmarish failed state—is a moral knot, almost impossible to untangle.”On the staggering humanitarian
crisis in Afghanistan, Murphy said:
“By this summer, 97% of Afghans will be living below the poverty line—trying to survive on less than two dollars a day. With
nine million people just one step away from famine, this humanitarian crisis
could kill more Afghans than the past 20 years of war.”Murphy laid out the arguments for and against
releasing Afghanistan’s frozen assets: “On one side is what sounds like a pretty clear
and convincing argument…To send billions to solve the humanitarian crisis they
caused would be to bail the Taliban out and incentivize other insurgent groups
to make similar rash decisions. But on the other hand is an equally clear and
convincing argument. We stood by the Afghan people for two decades, protecting
them, working with them…How could we let the Afghan people die, needlessly, if
we have the power to stop it?”“But what if these two
points—that the Taliban has to own this and we can’t stand by idly while people
die—what if they aren’t in 100 percent contrast? What if we could help the
Afghan people without directly empowering the Taliban? Wouldn’t that be the best
possible answer? The good news is that this middle road is possible. I’m going
to be honest. It’s not easy, but it is possible,” Murphy posed.Murphy stated: “Over the last twenty years, the U.S. has spent billions in our taxpayer
dollars to build schools, and health clinics, and a robust civil service. The
number of schools today for instance is five times higher in Afghanistan than
it was in 2001, and that’s because of American investment. We can, and we
should, find ways to pay the salaries of those who work at these nonpolitical
institutions through the UN and NGOs on the ground—going around the Taliban-led
government—to keep those essential services running and inject some much needed
money into the economy.”“Make no mistake, Madam
President—the Taliban, and frankly twenty years of corrupt Afghan
governments—they do own this debacle. The choices they made have led to this
day. But our hands aren’t clean. Our mismanaged occupation—it is part of the
story. And right now, as the Afghan economy collapses and families face
starvation, burying our heads in the sand is not a solution. We can find ways
to save lives without unreasonably empowering the Taliban,” Murphy
concluded.On
Tuesday, Murphy released
a statement on the administration’s decision to
send $308 million in humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. Murphy also defended
the Biden administration’s decision to end the
forever war in Afghanistan.A full transcript of his remarks can be found below:MURPHY: “President Biden’s decision to remove our remaining troops from
Afghanistan was the right one. No question about it. President Trump set the
Biden administration up for failure. Trump’s agreement with the Taliban
committed us to withdrawing all our troops, and had Biden torn up the
agreement, he would have had to send tens of thousands of troops into
Afghanistan to push back the Trump era Taliban gains. The American public would
not have supported another Afghanistan troop surge, and for good reason. The
overnight collapse of the Afghan army and the government was frankly proof that
twenty years of nation building had failed, and another twenty years wasn’t
going to result in a different outcome.“President Biden made the right decision to
leave. The American people—by a large margin—support that decision.“But right now, we need to be honest. The
question of what to do now—as Afghanistan crumbles into a nightmarish
failed state—is a moral knot, almost impossible to
untangle. And as Chair of the Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees
Afghanistan policy, I’ve thought a lot about this question, and I’ve come to a
few conclusions that I want to share quickly with my colleagues.“First, let’s just
take a minute to describe what it’s like to be living in Afghanistan right now.
It is a nightmare. Once the U.S. military occupation and all the foreign aid
that came with it disappeared, the Afghanistan economy collapsed predictably.
Today, winter is setting in, and more than half the population, 23
million people, don’t have enough food to eat. By this summer, 97% of Afghans
will be living below the poverty line—trying to survive on less than two dollars a
day. With nine million people just one step away from famine, this humanitarian
crisis could kill more Afghans than the past 20 years of war.“And herein lies the quandary. On one side is
what sounds like a pretty clear and convincing argument. Essentially, the
Taliban has to own this. We warned the Taliban that this collapse would occur
if they took the nation by force. That’s why
we sat at a table with them and tried to explain that it was in their best
interests, and the best interests of the nation, for the Taliban to share power
with the elected Afghan government. But the Taliban did not listen—they took Kabul and they should own the results.
To send billions to solve the humanitarian crisis they caused would be to bail
the Taliban out and incentivize other insurgent groups to make similar rash
decisions.“But on the other hand is an equally clear
and convincing argument. We stood by the Afghan people for two decades,
protecting them, working with them. We spent hundreds of billions of dollars
helping to raise up the future of millions of Afghan families, women and girls. And now, those same Afghans, those same
families—the ones that frankly have nothing to do with the Taliban—are dying,
potentially by the tens of thousands. And we have the power to do something
about it. How could we let the Afghan people die, needlessly, if we have
the power to stop it?“Now, we possess this power because it is
U.S. policy toward the Taliban government that is contributory toward this
crisis. It’s not the proximate cause, but it’s contributory. When Kabul fell
suddenly last August, the administration sensibly froze $7 billion of the
former Afghan government’s assets that are held at the Federal Reserve. We
didn’t want the Taliban to control it. But that money isn’t ours. It rightfully
belongs to the Afghan people. Further, our sanctions on the Taliban—completely justified because of the Taliban’s
embrace of terrorism—essentially handcuffs
the Afghan economy, and therefore contributes to the country’s economic
descent. So, we need to understand that our policies are contributing to the
humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.“But what if these two points—that the Taliban has to own this and we can’t
stand by idly while people die—what if they aren’t in 100 percent
contrast? What if we could help the Afghan people without directly empowering
the Taliban? Wouldn’t that be the best possible answer? The good news is that
this middle road is possible. I’m going to be honest. It’s not easy, but it is possible.“Over the last twenty
years, the U.S. has spent billions in our taxpayer dollars to build schools,
and health clinics, and a robust civil service. The number of schools today for
instance is five times higher in Afghanistan than it was in 2001, and that’s
because of American investment. We can, and we should, find ways to pay the
salaries of those who work at these nonpolitical institutions through the UN
and NGOs on the ground—going around the Taliban-led government—to keep those essential
services running and inject some much needed money into the economy. Again,
this isn’t easy to do, but it is worthwhile given the stakes.“We can also support the UN directly.
Yesterday, the UN asked
for $4.5 billion call in humanitarian aid to stave off catastrophe in
Afghanistan. This is the largest single country appeal in history, and that
should tell you about the scale of the crisis that we’re facing. It’s larger
than what we see in Syria, or Yemen, or Ethiopia. I support the
administration’s decision to dedicate an additional $308 million in
humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. That money’s going to help save lives, but
Congress should authorize more.“Make no mistake, Madam President—the Taliban, and frankly twenty years of corrupt
Afghan governments—they do own this debacle.
The choices they made have led to this day. But our hands aren’t clean. Our
mismanaged occupation—it is part of the
story. And right now, as the Afghan economy collapses and families face
starvation, burying our heads in the sand is not a solution. We can find ways
to save lives without unreasonably empowering the Taliban.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-threat-of-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-looms-murphy-blumenthal-senate-democrats-introduce-the-defending-ukraine-sovereignty-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a
member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee,
joined U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and 23 of their Senate Democratic colleagues
on Wednesday in introducing the Defending
Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, critical legislation to impose steep
costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine. As the Kremlin
continues to engage in an unjustified military build-up along Ukraine’s border,
the proposal by Senate Democrats to deter a military escalation sends a clear
message that the United States is prepared to impose devastating consequences
for Putin and the Russian economy if he goes down the path of re-invading
Ukraine.The Defending
Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022 would impose crippling sanctions on the
Russian banking sector and senior military and government officials if
President Putin escalates hostile action in or against Ukraine. The bill would
also prohibit transactions on Russia’s primary and secondary sovereign debt and
authorize sanctions on Russia’s extractive industries as well as on providers
of specialized financial messaging services (e.g., SWIFT). To help meet urgent
defense needs, the legislation calls upon the Departments of Defense and State
to expedite transfer of defense articles to bolster Ukraine’s defense
capabilities and authorizes $500 million in supplemental emergency security
assistance to Ukraine in the event of a re-invasion by Russia. Lastly, the bill
also expands U.S. efforts to counter Kremlin disinformation and strengthen ties
with key regional partners facing Kremlin aggression.“The
Senate has wasted a lot of time talking about proposals that will do nothing to
change Russia’s behavior. This bill offers real solutions intended to deter
Russia from further aggression, while also countering their misinformation
efforts throughout the region and increasing security assistance to Ukraine.
This is the best course for U.S. national security interests,” said
Murphy.“This
bill would impose crippling, crushing sanctions if Russia acts on its threats
to invade Ukraine. We cannot stand idly by while Russia threatens a sovereign
neighbor with military force. Strong, targeted measures to deter unprovoked
aggression must be taken,” said Blumenthal. “This
legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly
by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,” said Menendez.
“As the Biden administration seeks a diplomatic path forward this week in Europe
to avoid another bloody escalation in Ukraine, I find little reason to
believe that Putin is negotiating in good faith nor do I believe he has any
newfound respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is
precisely why we are coming together to send a clear message—Putin need not
collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own
people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe. Ultimately the most
effective sanction on Russia is a strong and unified Ukraine, and I look
forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues so that we can
provide the people of Ukraine the type of support they need to confront the
bully in Moscow.”Joining
Murphy, Blumenthal, and Menendez in introducing the legislation were U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Dick Durbin
(D-Ill.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Coons (D-Del.),
Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.),
Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tom
Carper (D-Del.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark
Warner (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tammy
Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Maggie
Hassan (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). “Today,
Vladimir Putin’s aggression is the greatest risk to the stability of Europe.
Whether it is in cyberspace or as Putin orders a massive military buildup on
the eastern border of Ukraine, the United States must make clear that an
invasion of Ukraine will have severe consequences. Chairman Menendez’s
comprehensive legislation serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and
forcefully imposing crippling sanctions on Vladimir Putin and the Russian
Federation government, any Russian actors determined to be responsible for an
invasion, and the corrupt infrastructure that props up Putin’s regime,” said
Schumer.“The
basic human desire to be free and democratically choose one’s leaders is
apparently too much for Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who is now threatening a
further massive military invasion of Ukraine.  It’s not enough that Putin
denies the Russian people their basic freedoms.  He’s determined to
eradicate similar aspirations on Russia’s border in a transparent scheme to
protect his own undemocratic regime,” said Durbin. “As such, I am
proud to join Senator Menendez’s legislation that would impose historic
sanctions if Russia further invades Ukraine.  The bill’s approach is
sweeping and clear. It also includes a notable provision to provide greater
economic and security support to the Baltic states, including as Lithuania
continues to face considerable economic and diplomatic coercion from China.”“We
need legislation that addresses the political situation we face today in
response to increasing Russian aggression – not last year or two years ago. The
dynamics changed and so must our strategy. That is what this bill would do,” said
Shaheen. “There is no question that there is a bipartisan determination in
the United States to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational
and used as a weapon by Putin against our European allies. This legislation
upholds that resolve without undermining the diplomatic progress being made.
Moreover, it would empower the administration with real teeth to inflict
punitive damage against the Kremlin, enhance regional partnerships and bolster
military aid for Ukraine to best defend itself. Putin’s escalatory behavior
against Ukraine and other American partners in Eastern Europe demands that we
evolve our response – we cannot use yesterday’s plans for crises we face
today.”“We
have a window of opportunity to use deterrence and diplomacy to help Ukraine
defend its sovereignty,” said Coons. “This bill would expedite
assistance to Ukraine, counter Russian disinformation, and impose punishing
sanctions should Russia choose to invade its neighbor. I look forward to
working with my colleagues to advance this important bill through the
legislative process.” “Ukraine
is a free and sovereign nation, and its people have the right to live without
fear of invasion and subjugation by regional bullies like Russia,” said
Kaine. “President Putin should know by now that the U.S., along with our
NATO and European allies, will always stand with our democratic partners. This
legislation provides the Biden administration additional tools and support to
check Russian aggression against Ukraine, and facilitate a peaceful
de-escalation of tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border.” “Russia
must see that there will be a strong and coordinated response to any further
aggression towards Ukraine,” said Markey. “While making clear the
consequences of blatant and unwarranted aggression by Russia, the United States
and our allies should continue to press for de-escalation in the region. This
legislation will work in concert with the actions the Biden administration has
already taken to demonstrate that we will continue to support Ukraine and its
sovereignty.”“Russia
must understand that any further aggression against Ukraine will be met by
severe penalties. The triggering of comprehensive and coordinated sanctions can
be an effective means of deterrence. This bill makes crystal clear in
advance that Putin and Russia will face punishing consequences if he makes the
drastic miscalculation to invade Ukraine and further infringe on its
sovereignty,” said Van Hollen.“As
Russia continues its aggression towards Ukraine, we must take action to show
our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and right to independence. I’m
proud to join Senator Menendez in introducing the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty
Act, which will hold Russia accountable with tough, comprehensive sanctions if
the Kremlin reinvades or escalates hostilities against our Ukrainian partners,”
said Carper.“The
bellicose actions and rhetoric that we have seen from Vladimir Putin in recent
months represent the latest in a long string of offensive actions by the
Russian President. Russia’s armed buildup around Ukraine – on top of their
continued occupation of eastern Ukraine and Crimea – represents a serious
threat not just to Ukraine, but to the broader peace and stability of Europe,
and of the world,” said Warner. “This bill reinforces the message that
the Biden administration must be conveying to Russia in face-to-face meetings
this week – that accelerated aggression towards Ukraine will only strengthen
U.S. assistance for our Ukrainian partners, reinvigorate NATO’s collective
defense posture, and bring about devastating consequences for the Russian
economy.“Putin’s
attempt to undermine Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty is unacceptable,” said
Bennet. “Our bill outlines comprehensive and severe consequences, including
crippling sanctions, for any further aggression. We must continue to strengthen
ties with our regional allies and partners to ensure freedom and stability in
Ukraine and across Europe, as well as support the Ukrainian people’s desire for
democracy.”""It's
critical to our national interest that the United States stands with its
friends and allies against authoritarian aggression. I am supporting this
legislation because it is necessary to address Russia’s continued
encroachment into Ukraine and hold them accountable. It sets clear
guidelines for broad sanctions while providing needed assistance to
Ukraine. I believe it is the right approach to strengthen U.S. ties with
key regional partners,” said Gillibrand.“Russian
aggression against Ukraine must be met with severe consequences. We also must
remain committed to our Transatlantic unity and stand united against Russian
threats to the security and sovereignty of Ukraine and the region. I am proud
to support this bill as it sends Russia a clear message: escalate hostilities
against Ukraine and face crippling sanctions on a wide range of sectors,
including the energy industry and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” said
Heinrich.""We
need to be clear-eyed about the threat Russia poses and this bill takes
meaningful steps to counter Russian aggression and stand with our partners in
Eastern Europe. As we continue to see tensions rise on the Ukrainian-Russian
border, the U.S. must make sure that Ukraine can defend itself and that we
stand against any threat of invasion by Russia,” said Hassan.Find

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-keeping-schools-open-safely-with-biden-health-officials,"WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on addressing the Omicron variant asked Dr.
Rochelle Walensky, Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and Dawn O’Connell, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and
Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), about best
practices for keeping students safely in the classroom and expanding access to
testing with at-home PCR tests.In a question
to Dr. Walensky on best practices for schools navigating Omicron, Murphy
empathized with parents and educators and stressed the importance of keeping
students and teachers safe in the classroom: “[P]art of what I think is
frustrating for a lot of parents is that the guidance they're getting from
their schools, it changes. I get it. Educators are sort of adjusting to the
variant changes as technology changes, but…has anything changed since the last
time you were here about what you are recommending for schools to stay open?”Murphy
continued: “I appreciate what you said in the last hearing is that
schools should be the first places to open and the last places to close. Man,
as the parent of two public school kids, I couldn't agree more. The trauma on
these kids during this pandemic has been significant. And the data tells us
that especially for poor kids and kids of color, distance learning just doesn't
work.”As the demand
for at-home tests increases, Murphy asked Ms. O’Connell about the potential for
at-home, affordable PCR tests. He also highlighted Detect, Inc., a
Guilford-based company that has developed an at-home, PCR-quality rapid test: “There are
some, you know, interesting research going on about the ability to make PCR
tests available at home. And there's companies all over the country, including
one in Connecticut, that you know, believe that with some additional investment
to bring those tests to scale, we could get PCR tests into families'
hands at home for a cost that is at or below what we're currently charging or
companies are currently charging for antigen tests. Is that a possibility?”Murphy also
defended Dr. Fauci from Republican’s baseless attacks on his character and work
at the National Institutes of Health (NIH): “On social media, I follow many of President
Trump's advisors and family members and they make a sport out of attacking you personally in some of the most
vicious, hateful, ugly ways that are possible. They do it because it gets
clicks. They don't do it because they're legitimately engaged in a honest
debate about the science revolving, surrounding COVID. Those people attack you
because it gains them political followers. And so I appreciate the fact that
you're willing to stand up for yourself and for your colleagues, who have been
dragged into the political muck…”You can read
Murphy’s full exchange with Walensky and O’Connell below:MURPHY: “Dr. Fauci,
thank you. Thank you, first of all for what you do. You shouldn't have to put
your life at risk. You shouldn't have put your family's life at risk to simply
stand up and do your job to try to protect my constituents from a pandemic
disease. And thank you for calling out this agenda for what it is: an attempt
to score political points to build a political power base around the denial of
science and around personal attacks on you and your family.“On social
media, I follow many of President Trump's advisors and family members and they
make a sport out of attacking you personally in some of the most vicious,
hateful, ugly ways that are possible. They do it because it gets clicks. They
don't do it because they're legitimately engaged in a honest debate about the
science revolving, surrounding COVID. Those people attack you because it gains
them political followers.“And so I
appreciate the fact that you're willing to stand up for yourself and for your
colleagues, who have been dragged into the political muck not because those
that follow President Trump are interested in a honest science-based debate
about how to attack COVID, but because they see political opportunity. So thank
you Dr. Fauci, for your work, for the panel's work and for sticking up for
yourself, which is not always easy.“Dr. Walensky,
I want to take my time to just do a little bit of an update on best practices
for schools. I know we talked about this a lot here. But you know, part of what
I think is frustrating for a lot of parents is that the guidance they're
getting from their schools, it changes. I get it. Educators are sort of
adjusting to the variant changes, as technology changes, but what has changed
since the last time, has anything changed since the last time you were here
about what you are recommending for schools to stay open?“I appreciate
what you said in the last hearing is that schools should be the first places to
open and the last places to close. Man, as the parent of two public school
kids, I couldn't agree more. The trauma on these kids during this pandemic has
been significant. And the data tells us that especially for poor kids and kids
of color, distance learning just doesn't work. So I'm grateful that I've got a
governor who's gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the federal
dollars are used to keep schools open, but anything new that you can share with
us about what you're recommending for schools to stay open for the rest of the
year?”WALENSKY:
“Thank you, Senator Murphy. And in fact that you took the words right out of my
mouth. Schools should be the first places to open and the last places to close.
We had a Delta surge in the fall and 99% of our schools were safely open. And
one of the things that's majorly different between September of 2021 and today
is we have pediatric vaccinations. We have vaccines that are available for
every child over the age of five, and the children who are in the hospital now
are largely those who are unvaccinated.“So first and
foremost, one of the most important things that's changed is we should be
getting our children and our teenagers vaccinated. And if our teenagers are
eligible, we have boosters available for our teenagers as well. So we saw
through the Delta surge that we were able to keep our children safely in school
before we had vaccines.“So now today,
what do we have for our children? We have vaccines, of course, that we can use.
We have school testing programs, we have new science that demonstrates test to
stay. This is where a child might be exposed in the classroom, but if they're
exposed, they don't have to stay home in quarantine. They can test every other
day or twice a week and stay in the classroom safely. And what that has
demonstrated is hundreds of thousands of person days, of children in school
rather than at home.“We have new
science that has demonstrated the value of masking. Three and a half times
increased risk of school outbreaks if you're unmasked in schools versus if
you're masking in schools. And just this week, we updated our K to 12 guidance
so that it's consistent with our isolation and quarantine guidance for the
general public so that people can come back to school after isolation after
five days.”MURPHY: “Thank
you, Dr. Walensky, for that and for your commitment to keeping our schools
open. Final quick question for you, Ms. O'Connell, talking about in home tests,
obviously a lot of focus on in home tests today. But these are antigen tests.
There are some, you know, interesting research going on about the ability to
make PCR tests available at home, and there's companies all over the country,
including one in Connecticut, that you know, believe that with some additional
investment to bring those tests to scale, we could get PCR tests into families'
hands at home for a cost that is at or below what we're currently charging or
companies are currently charging for antigen tests. Is that a possibility?”O’CONNELL:
“Senator Murphy, thank you. We share your interest of course in seeing as many
tests available for the American people as quickly as possible. And at BARDA
have worked very closely with several of the manufacturers that you mentioned
for these at home PCR tests. We've contracted with one of them and have reached
5 million per month manufacturing capacity in contract with them and continue
to look at the others in ways that we can support them.“I would also
like to say NIH colleagues in a program called RADx, the Rapid Acceleration of
Diagnostics, are working very closely with many of these companies as well as
they go through the development stages. So we remain very committed to the work
that these companies are doing and look forward to partnering with them as they
begin to bring these products forward.”

https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/connecticut-congressional-delegation-announces-historic-1599-million-in-liheap-funds-to-help-lower-energy-costs-this-winter,"WASHINGTON–The
Connecticut Congressional delegation on Tuesday announced the state has
received a
record $159.9 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP) to help families keep their homes warm and pay their energy bills this
winter. In addition to the annual appropriation of $65.8 million, the state
also received $94.1 million in funds from the American Rescue Plan. In 2021,
roughly one-third of Connecticut households struggled to pay their electric
bills.“LIHEAP
funds are a lifeline for so many families during these cold winter months. No
one should be forced to choose between paying their energy bill and putting
food on the table. Thanks to federal dollars we helped secure in the American
Rescue Plan, more Connecticut families than ever will have the support they
need to stay safe and warm this winter,” said members of the Connecticut congressional delegation.“The LIHEAP program helps keep families safe and healthy
through the cold winter months,” said Governor Ned Lamont. “The additional
resources now available through the American Rescue Plan Act will provide vital
assistance to families across Connecticut. I thank President Biden and
Connecticut’s Congressional delegation for securing these resources.”Last week,
Murphy, Blumenthal, and Hayes joined a letter
to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick urging
the agency to use its authority to protect consumers from unfairly high energy
costs. In October, Murphy and Blumenthal also urged
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to release funds for
LIHEAP as swiftly and at the highest level possible.
