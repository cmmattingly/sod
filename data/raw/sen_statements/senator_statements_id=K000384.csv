Now we can move on and fulfill our responsibility to fund the government.” ###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-vote-to-exempt-the-mountain-valley-pipeline-from-normal-permitting-rules,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine issued the following statement ahead of today’s Senate vote to proceed to a House bill that will be amended to become a continuing budget resolution funding the government through mid-December. The text of the continuing resolution was released at midnight last night and contains a provision exempting the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) from normal permitting processes, eliminating judicial review of key elements of the project, and stripping jurisdiction over any future litigation regarding the MVP away from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  “I strongly oppose the Mountain Valley Pipeline provision of this legislation, which would greenlight this pipeline without normal administrative and judicial review and ignore the voices of Virginians. The pipeline runs through Virginia for 100 miles and takes property from landowners, but I was not consulted as a deal was struck to approve it and thus not given an opportunity to share my constituents’ deep concerns. “The proposal is an effort by an energy consortium to rewrite rules of administrative and judicial process just for MVP because it is unhappy with the rulings of a single court. If the MVP owners are unhappy with a court ruling, they should do what other litigants do and appeal. Allowing them to fundamentally change federal law to achieve their goal would surely encourage other wealthy people and companies to try the same. I won’t participate in opening that door to abuse and even corruption.“I will vote against the motion to proceed to this deal and urge my colleagues to do the same. We should pass a continuing resolution that is free of the unprecedented and dangerous MVP deal.” ###"

They accept risks to their lives in service to the public. They are a check on the powerful and those that abuse their authority,” the senators wrote to Seccretary Blinken. “Protecting the freedom and safety of the press to carry on its vital work is a fundamental American value and worthy of promotion on the international stage.”According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 910 journalists have been killed over the last decade, with 488 reporters arbitrarily detained at the end of 2021.The full letter is available here.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-cosponsors-voter-registration-legislation-applauds-early-voting-in-virginia,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement on the first day of early voting in Virginia:“Early voting is easy and convenient, and I’m proud that Virginia makes it so simple for people to cast their ballots ahead of time and not worry about lines on Election Day. Voting should be fast, secure, and simple, regardless of who you are or who you’re voting for, and I hope that we can pass legislation at the federal level to ensure that’s true across the country.”The deadline to register to vote in Virginia is October 17, 2022. Those already registered may vote early in person beginning Friday, September 23, 2022, by bringing an accepted form of voter ID to their registrar’s office.Earlier this week, Kaine cosponsored two pieces of legislation to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and to know their registration status. The Same Day Voter Registration Act would require states to offer same day registration at polling locations on Election Day and during early voting. The Stop Automatically Voiding Eligible Voters Off Their Enlisted Rolls in States (SAVE VOTERS) Act would prohibit states from removing people from their voting rolls unless the state has obtained objective, reliable evidence that a voter is ineligible to vote and establishes notification requirements once a voter is removed. These bills were led by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).The Same Day Voter Registration Act would: The SAVE VOTERS Act would:Kaine, a former civil rights attorney, has long fought to protect voting rights and expand access to the ballot box. In September 2021, Kaine introduced the Freedom to Vote Act to improve access to the ballot for Americans, advance commonsense election integrity reforms, and protect our democracy from attacks. Kaine is also an original cosponsor of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, introduced in October 2021, which would restore safeguards against potential restrictive changes to voting rules after the Supreme Court gutted those protections in its Shelby County decision in 2013. He fought to pass key provisions of these bills in the consolidated Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which failed on the Senate floor in January.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-announce-over-42-million-in-federal-funding-to-help-virginians-access-affordable-housing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine announced $4,275,080 in federal funding to help more Virginians access affordable housing. The funding will be awarded to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across the Commonwealth through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Incremental Housing Choice Vouchers program.  “Rising rents and home prices are making it harder and harder for Virginians to find affordable housing options,” the senators said. “We’re glad this funding will help more Virginians across the Commonwealth find safe, affordable housing.”The funding is distributed as follows:Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) help low-income families, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities afford housing of their choice. These new vouchers are an additional allocation of HCVs and will allow a greater number of Virginians to access safe and decent housing across the Commonwealth.Warner and Kaine, a former fair housing attorney, have long supported efforts to expand affordable housing in the Commonwealth. Earlier this year, the senators announced nearly $115 million for affordable housing in Virginia. They’ve introduced legislation that would address rising home prices, assist first-generation homebuyers, and close widening wealth and homeownership gaps. Kaine has also introduced legislation that would protect veterans and low-income families who use HCVs from discrimination.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-applauds-senate-passage-of-his-bill-to-address-global-malnutrition,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), applauded unanimous Senate passage of his bipartisan bill to bolster federal efforts and increase coordination to address global malnutrition. The Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act will authorize the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to scale up programs and activities to prevent and treat malnutrition globally. After previously passing the House by a strong bipartisan vote, the bill now heads to President Biden for his signature. In addition to Kaine, the legislation was led by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and John Boozman (R-AR). The bill was led in the House of Representatives by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Ranking Member Mike McCaul (R-Texas).“The pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine have exacerbated global food insecurity, and the United States’ leadership is crucial to the reduction of world hunger,” said Senator Kaine. “The Senate’s unanimous passage of our bipartisan Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act will help keep starvation at bay for children and families in need across the globe. I urge President Biden to sign this bill into law as quickly as possible.”“The Senate’s passage of the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act demonstrates our bipartisan commitment to address malnutrition that leads to the suffering of millions of children across the globe,” said Senator Coons. “As the world recovers from COVID-19 and deals with escalating military conflicts, this bill will help the U.S. lead by example to improve the health of children, mothers, and families around the world. I am delighted that the Senate passed this bill unanimously and look forward to President Biden swiftly signing this bill into law.” “Malnutrition affects millions throughout the world, and it takes a heavy toll on children and expecting mothers,” Senator Wicker said. “The targeted reforms included in the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act will increase our ability to address this growing challenge and save lives.” “Passage of this legislation is an important and necessary step to fight global malnutrition and improve coordination with our partners around the world,” Senator Boozman said. “I urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law so we can get help to the children and families who need it most.”The Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act would:The bill is endorsed by 1,000 Days, Action Against Hunger, Alliance to End Hunger, Bread for the World, CARE, Farm Journal Foundation, Food for the Hungry, Global Health Council, HarvestPlus, Hellen Keller International, InterAction, ONE Campaign, RESULTS, Save the Children, UNICEF USA, and World Vision US.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-ban-us-recognition-of-any-ukrainian-territory-annexed-by-russia,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Dick Durbin (D-IL), as well as a bipartisan group of their colleagues, introduced the Non-Recognition of Russian Annexation of Ukrainian Territory Act, which would require U.S. policy to not recognize any Russian claim of sovereignty over any portion of the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine and prohibit any federal department or agency from taking any action or extending any assistance that implies recognition of Russian claims over Ukraine.The bill’s introduction comes after Vladimir Putin announced plans to hold referendums in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine with the goal of annexing these regions into the Russian Federation. Announcing annexation is intended to paint Ukrainian efforts to restore its territorial integrity as aggressive actions against the Russian Federation so as to depress the West’s assistance to Ukraine.“This bill underscores to the international community that the United States’ support for the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian territorial integrity remains unwavering and bipartisan. President Putin must recognize that Ukraine has the same rights as any other sovereign nation. These so-called ‘elections’ are clearly a sham, and are Putin’s most recent effort to erase Ukrainian sovereignty. They’re also yet another sign that Putin grossly underestimated Ukrainian resolve when he launched his invasion. There is only one end to this conflict – Putin must cease his war of aggression against Ukraine,” said Senator Kaine.In addition to Kaine, Rubio, and Durbin, the bill was also cosponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Cornyn (R-TX), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Angus King (I-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and John Hickenlooper (D-CO).###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-ahead-of-vote-on-legislation-to-ensure-transparency-in-us-elections,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement ahead of the Senate vote on the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act, legislation he has cosponsored which would improve transparency around political spending in federal elections:“The DISCLOSE Act is critical legislation to strengthen campaign finance laws to make sure the public knows who is spending money to influence federal elections. While additional reforms are needed to protect the voice of the American people in our democracy, including voting rights and good government measures, this legislation is a step in the right direction,” said Kaine. “The best way to fight dark money spending is with sunlight and full transparency, and the DISCLOSE Act would do so.”Outside group spending in federal elections has skyrocketed since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC. Many of the biggest spenders, such as certain corporations, special interests, and political groups, are not required under current law to disclose their donors, creating hurdles to transparency and making it difficult to understand how dark money is influencing elections.The DISCLOSE Act would improve current law to require organizations and lobbyists spending money in elections to disclose their large donors and certify that they are not using foreign money for election spending. Under current law, foreign nationals and foreign corporations are prohibited from engaging in any election spending, but domestic companies with significant foreign ownership are not subject to the same restrictions. The DISCLOSE Act would also close this loophole and prohibit domestic corporations with significant foreign control, ownership, or direction from spending money in U.S. elections.Senator Kaine has also cosponsored previous versions of this legislation.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-bill-text-that-would-exempt-the-mountain-valley-pipeline-from-normal-permitting-rules,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine issued the following statement regarding recently released legislative text containing an unprecedented provision to approve the Mountain Valley Pipeline and exempt it from normal administrative and judicial review:“We owe it to Virginians to ensure that any energy project that deeply affects their communities, even to the point of seizing their property, should only proceed following an orderly, fair, and transparent process overseen by energy and environmental agencies. That’s why I agree with the need to reform our broken process for permitting energy infrastructure.  I am receptive to many of the permitting reform provisions announced today, though I believe the reform could be significantly improved by including my Pipeline Fairness, Transparency, and Responsible Development Act to strengthen public input into the permitting process.“However, I cannot support the Mountain Valley Pipeline-related provisions in this legislative text. Over 100 miles of this pipeline are in Virginia, but I was not included in the discussions regarding the MVP provisions and therefore not given an opportunity to share Virginians’ concerns. In that sense, I stand in the same position as many of my constituents who have felt ignored along the way.“Green-lighting the MVP is contrary to the spirit of permitting reform. Such a deliberate action by Congress to put its thumb on the scale and simply approve this project while shutting down opportunities for full administrative or judicial review is at odds with the bipartisan desire to have a more transparent and workable permitting process.  It also contradicts a position I have publicly advocated for many years—that Congress should not be the decider of these projects, but should instead set up an effective administrative permitting system and allow it to work without legislative interference.“I also strongly object to the highly unusual provisions to eliminate any judicial review for key parts of the MVP process and strip jurisdiction away from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for cases involving the MVP.  The owners of the MVP may be dissatisfied with rulings of the Fourth Circuit; in my 18 years as a civil rights lawyer practicing in the Fourth Circuit, I wasn’t always happy with the Court’s rulings. But a litigant in federal court—rich or poor, individual or company—has appellate remedies if it disagrees with a court ruling. Allowing one party disappointed with the actions of a court to pick a different court, bypass normal administrative processes, and eliminate meaningful judicial review of its project would set a dangerous precedent that could easily lead to abuse and even corruption in the future.“I urge my colleagues to oppose the MVP provisions in the bill text that has been released today. We should enact meaningful permitting reform and then let decisions on the MVP be made on the merits by the agencies we entrust with that responsibility.”Last week, Kaine and Senator Mark R. Warner reintroduced their Pipeline Fairness, Transparency, and Responsible Development Act, legislation to strengthen the public’s ability to evaluate the impacts of and provide input on natural gas pipelines being considered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They first introduced a version of this legislation in 2017.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-passage-of-kigali-treaty,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement on Senate ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocols (Kigali Treaty), which would curb the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent greenhouse gases that contribute heavily to climate change:“I have long said that we don’t need to choose between fighting climate change and creating jobs—we can use American innovation to do both. I’m proud that, by ratifying the Kigali Treaty, we’re cementing the United States as a world leader on climate while strengthening our economic competitiveness with countries like China. We can boost American businesses and American manufacturing while also dramatically reducing environmental impacts.”The Kigali Treaty has been agreed to by over 100 countries around the world, and would help the U.S. phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are found in many common household appliances like air conditioners. HFCs are extremely damaging to the atmosphere, and the Kigali Treaty aims to reduce HFC consumption by over 80% by 2047. This would avoid up to 0.9°F (0.5°C) of warming by the end of the 21st century. This treaty would also promote investment and innovation by opening U.S. companies to markets for HFC alternatives overseas.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-bipartisan-group-of-colleagues-push-for-more-action-from-pentagon-to-address-pfas-exposure-at-military-installations,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Mike Rounds (R-SD), as well as a bipartisan group of their colleagues, sent a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House officials, urging additional action to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) testing and remediation and improvements to PFAS-related planning.  PFAS are manufactured substances linked to increased risk of cancers and other adverse health effects. PFAS are used in many everyday products like food packaging, non-stick cookware, water-resistant clothing, and firefighting foam. They are known as “forever chemicals” because they are difficult to break down and remain in the environment for a long time. Reports in recent years have found higher PFAS levels at military installations because of the use of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. The DoD is currently sampling for and cleaning up PFAS at over 700 military installations, including at NASA Wallops Island, Fentress Auxiliary Landing Field, Norfolk Naval Station, Oceana Naval Air Station, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, and others.“Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products,” said the Senators.They urged the Administration to put greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants, writing, “Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.” The Senators went on to detail the findings of a recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report that calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increase risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS. The Senators then continued to detail the robust amount of federal dollars provided by Congress to DoD to accelerate PFAS testing remediation and Congress’ continued willingness to provide additional resources to address the challenges the Department faces due to PFAS exposure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Kaine voted to pass, made significant investments into our nation’s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, providing $10 billion for PFAS remediation.In addition to Kaine, Shaheen, and Rounds, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mike Braun (R-IN), Angus King (I-ME), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Richard J.

Merkley (D-OR) and Edward J. Markey (D-MA).  The full text of the letter is available here and below:Dear Secretary Austin:We write with continued concern about the Department of Defense’s (DoD) efforts to address contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Nearly 700 military installations nationwide have known or suspected PFAS contamination, exposing service members and their families, and civilian communities near DoD installations to these toxic chemicals[1]. Given Congress’ continued commitment to provide funding to address PFAS contamination, we respectfully request that the Department similarly prioritize planning and programming for PFAS testing and remediation.  As you know, PFAS chemicals have emerged as widespread contaminants to the drinking water sources of military bases across the country largely due to their presence in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) used by the military. Members of the military, veterans and civilians who have served at military installations and/or live in the surrounding communities found to have been contaminated with PFAS face health risks related to exposure to PFAS chemicals, as these materials are found in AFFF, in personal protective equipment used by firefighters and in standard consumer products. The prevalence of PFAS allows for multiple pathways for exposure. The recently released National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report calls for expanded access to PFAS testing for Americans with a history of exposure to the chemicals and points to health risks such as high cholesterol, decreased fetal and infant growth and increased risks of kidney cancer for those exposed to PFAS[2]. These health concerns pose a significant hazard to the safety of our communities, and individuals either previously or currently exposed to toxic PFAS chemicals, underscoring the urgency of reducing exposure. Over the past six years, Congress has increased funding by $1 billion for the Department to accelerate PFAS testing and remediation, more than doubling the amount requested in the annual budget request during that time frame. As evidenced by the historic $517 million authorization for PFAS-related activities included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, Congress has indicated a willingness to provide even greater funding to address these challenges. We are, however, concerned that DoD has failed to adequately prepare for additional funding being made available. It is our understanding that one of the major obstacles in the way of Congress putting more resources toward this problem is a lack of planning by the Department on how to execute a higher funding level. Simply put, DoD is not sufficiently prioritizing PFAS testing, remediation and disposal as part of its annual budget process, nor is the Department adequately developing the appropriate plans to utilize even higher funding levels as provided by Congress. DoD has a responsibility to place greater emphasis on addressing these pollutants impacting service members, military families and defense communities. Therefore, we strongly urge the Department to match Congress’ urgency for addressing testing and remediation by developing requirements-based plans, policies, and programs and appropriately increasing DoD’s annual budget requests for PFAS-related activities, including for PFAS destruction. Further, we expect that, as a part of this analysis, the Department will address past planning and programming deficiencies that DoD has claimed limits their ability to execute higher levels of funding, and we request that DoD provide a plan to Congress no later than upon the release of the President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 on how the Department is prepared to execute increased funding levels for PFAS-related activities. Finally, we support DoD’s cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency on PFAS, including collaboration on research and testing efforts, and encourage the Department to continue investing in joint efforts to address PFAS. Our service members, military families, veterans and defense communities deserve the Department’s full attention to appropriately address the scope and severity of PFAS contamination. We ask you to honor that responsibility and take the steps necessary to prioritize this hazard impacting our communities.Sincerely,###"

Just days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria, the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history, Hurricane Fiona ravaged the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds.“Governor Pierluisi has formally requested a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to President Biden.“Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged,” the lawmakers added. “FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure.”In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the Trump Administration’s botched response. In 2020, following Hurricane Maria, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. The lawmakers also highlighted how institutions in charge of the electric grid have failed to repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread power outages.“These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need,” concluded the lawmakers.Joining Sens.

We strongly urge you to approve this request to ensure Puerto Rico has all the federal resources available to respond to this disaster.Hurricane Fiona devastated the island with catastrophic flash flooding, unprecedented rainfall, and high-speed winds. The hurricane caused an island-wide blackout, leaving over three million residents without power for over twenty-four hours. Furthermore, 750,000 homes remain without potable water. Bridges have collapsed, roads are blocked with debris, and schools are damaged. FEMA Public Assistance is urgently needed to begin restoring this vital infrastructure. In addition, Hurricane Fiona has caused significant flood damage to homes across the island. Many families are now seeking temporary shelter and will require significant aid in order to rebuild their homes. FEMA’s Individual Assistance is critical to assist with these housing costs and other recovery expenses. We thank you for swiftly approving Puerto Rico’s Emergency Declaration this past Sunday.In 2017, thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria due to the butchered government response by the Trump Administration. In 2020, the island faced destructive earthquakes, requiring more disaster recovery resources. Five years since Hurricane Maria, LUMA Energy and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) have yet to adequately repair the electrical system, resulting in continued frequent and widespread electrical outages. These events have left Puerto Rico’s critical infrastructure vulnerable to extreme weather. We urge you to help the people of Puerto Rico equitably recover from these multiple disasters and access the federal funding they urgently need. Given the damaged infrastructure, we urge you to promptly approve Governor Pierluisi’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico’s municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona.

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-bennet-issue-statements-on-report-on-medicare-x-choice-act,"New report notes that Medicare-X would reduce uninsured population by 1.1 million and save households $10.9 billion if phased in by 2023 WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Urban Institute issued a report indicating that U.S. Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Michael Bennet’s (D-CO) Medicare-X Choice Act, introduced in February 2021, would reduce the uninsured population by over a million Americans and save households, employers, and the government billions of dollars.According to the report, Medicare-X would reduce the number of uninsured people by 1.1 million, would save households $10.9 billion, and would save the federal government $20.3 billion if phased in by 2023, and would cut spending on health care by $456 billion over a ten year period.“I’m proud that this report confirms that Medicare-X would get a million more people insured and lower costs by hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade,” said Kaine. “The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced just how much we need to expand access to affordable, quality health care. This legislation will help so many Americans, particularly in rural areas, get the care they need at a price they can afford.”“Medicare-X will not only cover more Americans, but save them money on their health care. With the Inflation Reduction Act, we’ve built on the progress of the Affordable Care Act to cover more people and reduce the cost of prescription drugs,” said Bennet. “It’s time to finish what the ACA started, and help close the coverage gap in America through a public option.”The Medicare-X Choice Act would build on the Affordable Care Act by establishing a Medicare Exchange public option within the Medicare framework in every county in America, providing an additional, affordable option in all communities.The Medicare-X public option would initially be available on the Affordable Care Act exchange in areas where there is a shortage of insurers or higher health care costs, including rural communities in Virginia and Colorado. The Medicare Exchange plan would then expand to every ZIP code in the country and be added as another option on the Small Business Health Options Program Marketplace. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden last month, adopted two provisions of Kaine and Bennet’s Medicare-X Choice Act. The bill requires Medicare to negotiate drug prices, as well as extends expanded ACA premium tax credit for three years.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-kaine-colleagues-urge-biden-administration-to-strengthen-privacy-protections-for-women-seeking-reproductive-health-care,"As Republicans pass abortion bans and states investigate and punish women for seeking reproductive care, Senators are calling for HHS to take immediate action to protect women’s privacy under HIPAAWASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine—who serves on the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee—teamed up with 28 of their colleagues to call on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take immediate action to safeguard women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially get the health care they need. Specifically, the Senators urged the Biden Administration to strengthen federal privacy protections under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to broadly restrict providers from sharing patients’ reproductive health information without their explicit consent—particularly with law enforcement or in legal proceedings over accessing abortion care. Since the Dobbs decision, the new patchwork of state abortion bans has caused widespread confusion among health care providers over whether they are required to turn over patients’ health information to state and local law enforcement. As a result, patients may delay or avoid seeking the care they need out of fear their sensitive health information could be weaponized against them.In recent weeks, states have investigated and sought to punish patients and providers for seeking and providing abortion care. While abortion is not currently criminalized in Virginia, Governor Youngkin has said he would “happily and gleefully” sign “any bill” limiting reproductive freedom, and has tapped Virginia state legislators to introduce legislation to that effect in 2023. Should that legislation be signed into law, the Senators’ push could help prevent personal health data from being used against Virginia women in legal proceedings. This letter makes clear that additional privacy protections are needed to protect this data so it cannot be used by prosecutors or law enforcement seeking to enforce an abortion ban.“Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care,” wrote the Senators.In their letter to Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Senators urge HHS to take immediate action to strengthen federal privacy protections under HIPAA, bolster enforcement of the protections, educate providers about their obligations, and ensure patients understand their rights. Shortly after the Dobbs decision, Becerra pledged to work to protect patient and provider privacy.“To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information,” urged the Senators. “In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.”Joining Senators Warner and Kaine in sending the letter were Senators Murray (D-WA), Baldwin (D-WI), Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Brown (D-OH), Cantwell (D-WA), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (D-IL), Durbin (D-IL), Gillibrand (D-NY), Heinrich (D-NM), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Hirono (D-HI), Klobuchar (D-MN), Luján (D-NM), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Padilla (D-CA), Reed (D-RI), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (I-VT), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Stabenow (D-MI), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), and Wyden (D-OR).The Senators’ full letter is available HERE and below:Dear Secretary Becerra:Since the Supreme Court’s decision to strip away the constitutional right to abortion, patients across the country have lost access to reproductive health care, and providers have scrambled to adapt to the immense confusion, fear, and upheaval this ruling has caused. In some states, legislators and prosecutors have already sought to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. To protect patients, and their providers, from having their health information weaponized against them, we urge you to take immediate action to strengthen education on and enforcement of federal health privacy protections, and to initiate the rulemaking process to augment privacy protections under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.Every day, health care personnel across this nation care for patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant. This care may include anything from an annual check-up to obstetrical visits to emergency care. In order for patients to feel comfortable seeking care, and for health care personnel to provide this care, patients and providers must know that their personal health information, including information about their medical decisions, will be protected. Recognizing this critical need, in 1996, Congress passed HIPAA, which directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue privacy regulations for personal health information. HHS issued corresponding privacy regulations (the “HIPAA Privacy Rule”) in 2000, with several subsequent updates over the years.The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has caused widespread confusion among health care providers on health privacy protections, and whether they are required to turn over health information to state and local law enforcement. Stakeholders have told us about providers who have felt uncertain about whether they must turn over personal health information to state and law enforcement officials, including cases where providers believed they had to turn over information when doing so is only permitted—but not required—under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In other cases, providers did not know that certain disclosures are actually impermissible. Stakeholders have even described clashes between providers and health care system administrators on whether certain information must be shared. Many of these issues seem to arise from misunderstandings of what the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires of regulated entities and their employees.This confusion is likely to grow as state lawmakers continue to implement a patchwork of laws restricting access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. Already, some states have laws in effect criminalizing abortion providers, and some states have enacted laws that penalize anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion, potentially exposing everyone from a referring provider to a receptionist to legal liability. Some state legislators have even proposed to bar women from traveling to another state for abortion care. And even before Dobbs, states had already prosecuted women following their abortions or miscarriages. In many cases, these laws have been used to disproportionately criminalize or surveil women of color for their pregnancy loss.Actions to prohibit abortion access and undermine health privacy are likely to have devastating consequences for women’s health. Out of concern that their reproductive health information may be used against them, women may delay or avoid disclosing a pregnancy or obtaining prenatal care. They may fear initiating treatments for conditions like cancer or arthritis, where treatment could impact a pregnancy, even as health care providers may hesitate to provide them. And women who experience complications from a pregnancy or abortion may avoid seeking desperately needed emergency care, risking devastating health consequences and even death. These concerns are not without justification – in recent years, numerous medical providers have reported women to law enforcement for seeking care following an abortion, a miscarriage, or other pregnancy-related medical issue.HHS has the tools to protect patients and health care providers, even in the wake of this devastating decision. For over twenty years, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has protected the privacy of individuals’ health information, laying out when health information may or may not be shared without a patient’s explicit consent. In addition, the HIPAA Privacy Rule has long recognized that stronger protections may be needed for particularly sensitive health information, such as psychotherapy notes. We commend you for the actions the Department has already taken to clarify privacy protections in the wake of the Dobbs decision, including the issuance of additional guidance on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, given the growing likelihood that women’s personal health information may be used against them, HHS must also take proactive steps to strengthen patient privacy protections.To safeguard the privacy of women’s personal health care decisions and ensure patients feel safe seeking medical care, including reproductive health care, we urge you to quickly initiate the rulemaking process to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive health information. In particular, HHS should update the HIPAA Privacy Rule to broadly restrict regulated entities from sharing individuals’ reproductive health information without explicit consent, particularly for law enforcement, civil, or criminal proceedings premised on the provision of abortion care.In addition, while HHS moves forward with the rulemaking process, the Department should take the following steps to improve awareness and enforcement of current privacy protections in the HIPAA Privacy Rule:Our nation faces a crisis in access to reproductive health services, and some states have already begun to investigate and punish women seeking abortion care. It is critical that HHS take all available action to fully protect women’s privacy and their ability to safely and confidentially seek medical care. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely,###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-colleagues-applaud-house-passage-of-bill-to-protect-merit-based-federal-workforce-system-federal-workers-rights,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), along with Senators Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), applauded House passage of the Preventing a Patronage System Act, legislation led by Kaine to prevent any position in the federal civil service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the express consent of Congress. The bill would secure the civil service system and safeguard tens of thousands of federal employees from losing job protections and due process rights. “From protecting our national security to administering Social Security benefits, our civil servants are invaluable to keeping our government running and providing critical services to Americans,” said the senators. “We’re glad to see the House of Representatives pass our bill to protect the merit-based hiring system for our federal workforce, and we’ll be pushing to follow suit in the Senate.”Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA-11). It passed out of the House Committee on Rules on September 13 and passed the full House by a 225-204 vote.The federal workforce is comprised of roughly 2 million federal employees hired on the basis of their acumen. They work each day for the American people — serving in a myriad of capacities to improve this nation and America’s posture abroad, including researching vaccines, helping families in the wake of hurricanes and deadly fires, and inspecting our food to ensure it is safe to eat.On October 21, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F in the excepted government service. The excepted government service is any federal or civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service. This executive order, had it not been repealed by President Biden in January 2021, would have allowed agency heads to reclassify “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” positions to a newly created Schedule F category of federal employees that would remove their due process rights and civil service protections. This would have undermined the merit system principles of our federal workforce, by making it easier for any administration to hire political loyalists and fire qualified nonpartisan experts. According to press reports, the Office of Management and Budget under Trump planned to reclassify 88% of its workforce under Schedule F. Trump reportedly plans to reinstate Schedule F immediately if reelected to the presidency, which would allow him to fire up to 50,000 federal workers and replace them with political hires. Currently, new presidents can make about 4,000 political appointments, approximately 1,200 of which must be confirmed by the Senate. Trump’s move could increase the number of political appointments from 4,000 to approximately 50,000.The Preventing a Patronage System Act would prevent any position in the competitive service from being reclassified to Schedule F pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order signed on October 21, 2020. This would prevent future administrations from creating new employee classifications in order to hire more political loyalists and fire nonpartisan experts. ###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-reintroduce-bill-to-make-ferc-pipeline-permitting-process-more-transparent-and-fair,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine reintroduced the Pipeline Fairness, Transparency, and Responsible Development Act, legislation to strengthen the public’s ability to evaluate the impacts of and provide input on natural gas pipelines being considered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).“Communities and landowners who would be impacted by an energy project deserve to have their concerns heard—especially if a green light from FERC means their land would be taken away,” said the senators. “Our bill would improve the way FERC gathers public input to make sure the public can weigh in on decisions that would literally run through their backyards.”Congress has given FERC the authority to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks to energy infrastructure proposals. The senators’ legislation would make it easier for the public to offer FERC input and would clarify the circumstances under which eminent domain may be used. The bill would also require public comment meetings to be held in every locality through which a pipeline would pass at every stage of the review process, in order to minimize situations where individuals are forced to commute long distances with very little time to comment.Additionally, the legislation would strengthen local landowners’ rights by improving the process by which landowners are notified of a pipeline application and bolstering their ability to ensure any concerns about their property are given fair consideration.Specifically, the legislation would:""The Appalachian Trail Conservancy applauds Senators Kaine and Warner for their efforts to protect our National Scenic Trails,” said Sandra Marra, President and CEO of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. “The Pipeline Fairness Act requires regulators like FERC to examine the large and lasting impacts proposed developments could have on our irreplaceable public lands. We look forward to continuing our work with the Senators and other elected officials on behalf of all National Scenic Trails, ensuring that they continue to benefit millions of visitors, thousands of volunteers, and hundreds of trailside communities.""“Originally passed in 1938, the Natural Gas Act is long overdue for a rebalancing of landowner interests with those of natural gas development,” said David Bookbinder, Chief Counsel of the Niskanen Center. “By strengthening landowner rights and requiring more transparency in FERC's approval process, Senators Kaine and Warner's bill will is a major step forward in preventing the capricious loss of private property.” Full text of the legislation is available here.###"

The bill also included critical provisions of Kaine’s legislation to improve oversight of non-career U.S. ambassadors:“Now more than ever, the United States needs to lean into our diplomatic relationships around the world. That means making sure that our commitment to NATO cannot be casually dissolved by any president, and that our diplomatic workforce, including those holding leadership positions, is meeting expectations and reaching its full potential in advancing American interests overseas. I’m glad I was able to secure legislation in this year’s State Department Authorization bill to help us achieve those goals. I also supported the Committee’s bipartisan approval of the Taiwan Policy Act, which underscores the United States’ firm commitment to Taiwan’s security and to stability in the Taiwan Strait, particularly in the face of increased hostility by Beijing against Taipei.”Today’s announcement follows years of work by Kaine to prevent any president from unilaterally withdrawing the United States from NATO. In 2018, remarks by former President Trump attacking American allies at a NATO summit prompted Kaine to work with Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and former Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO) and John McCain (R-AZ) to introduce legislation to require any president to seek the advice and consent of the Senate to modify or terminate U.S. membership in NATO. This year will mark the 73rd anniversary of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, which established NATO.The State Department Authorization bill also includes a provision to increase oversight of non-career ambassadors, which was first included in Kaine’s Ambassador Oversight and Transparency Act. This provision would encourage the nomination of more qualified non-career nominees by increasing oversight of their performance. Specifically, it would enable U.S. citizen embassy staff to voluntarily complete an anonymous annual survey that assesses the leadership of the post, and authorize the Director General of the Foreign Service to refer deficiencies in performance to the Inspector General.The next step for the legislation is consideration before the full Senate, which is expected later this year.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/09/14/2022/kaine-introduces-legislation-to-support-survivors-of-sexual-assault-on-college-campuses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee, introduced legislation to support survivors of sexual assault on college campuses. The Survivor Outreach and Support on Campus Act, or S.O.S. Campus Act, would require every college and university that receives federal funding to have an independent advocate dedicated to campus sexual assault prevention and response.“As students across Virginia and the country head back to school, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to prevent sexual assault on campuses and provide support to survivors,” said Senator Kaine. “This bill is critical to ensuring that students who bravely speak out are connected with the medical treatment, counseling, and legal information they need.”Sexual violence on college campus is largely underreported. A 2020 report published by the Association for American Universities (AAU) found that 13% of graduate and undergraduate students have experienced rape or sexual assault. Among undergraduate students, AAU found that 26.4% of females and 6.8% percent of males experienced rape or sexual assault. Previous studies have shown that more than 50% of college sexual assaults occur between August and November.The S.O.S. Campus Act would require the independent advocate to conduct public information campaigns on sexual assault prevention and ensure survivors of sexual assault have access to:Local rape crisis centers and other community-based organizations are currently providing many of these services in communities and on campuses around the nation. The legislation recognizes the importance of these partnerships by requiring that universities either consult with or partner with these organizations to ensure that survivors get the services they need.In 2015, Kaine introduced the Teach Safe Relationships Act following a conversation with University of Virginia students. Key provisions from Kaine’s Teach Safe Relationships Act, including allowing Title IV funding to be used for instruction and training on safe relationship behavior among students in elementary and secondary schools, were signed into law by President Obama as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act.The S.O.S. Campus Act is cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI).Full text of the legislation is available here.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-secure-nearly-135-million-for-virginia-in-senate-fy2023-budget-bills,"Funding would support health, safety, and local economies throughout VirginiaWASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine announced that they successfully secured nearly $135 million in federal funding for Virginia in pending government funding bills for Fiscal Year 2023, as the latest text of the bills was recently unveiled by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The next step for the legislation is a markup and advancement by the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is expected later this year, followed by Senate floor consideration.“I’m proud to have worked to secure these investments for communities all throughout Virginia,” said Warner. “By propelling impactful local projects, these dedicated federal dollars will further build on the progress we’ve made through the bipartisan infrastructure law and the many rounds of COVID-19 relief funding authorized by Congress. I look forward to seeing these diverse projects generate jobs, support Virginia’s tourism economy, make neighborhoods safer, and bring communities together.”“The annual budget is always an important opportunity to fight for Virginia priorities and America’s leadership around the world—and I’m pleased with how that effort is shaping up for the upcoming Fiscal Year,” said Kaine. “I will keep fighting to keep the many critical components of these bills intact as we get this budget across the finish line—from keeping Virginia communities safe from gun violence, COVID, and future health crises; to addressing food insecurity and the root causes of migration.”As part of last year’s budget process, the Senate revived a process that allows members of Congress to make Congressionally Directed Spending requests, otherwise known as earmarks, in a manner that promotes transparency and accountability. This process allows Congress to dedicate federal funding for specific projects. Through strong advocacy, the senators secured—and will fight to keep—Congressionally Directed Spending dollars in the funding bills for the following projects in Virginia:In addition, should they be passed as-is, the budget bills include funding for the following Warner and Kaine priorities:Boosting Local Economies: Includes $200 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission and $7 million for the Southwest Crescent Regional Commission to support their work to build economic partnerships, create opportunity, and foster economic development.Strengthening Transportation and Recreation Infrastructure: Provides $150 million for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and $25 million for the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program, which supports multi-purpose trails.Making Our Communities Safer: Provides $50 million for Community Violence Prevention grants to support communities in developing comprehensive, evidence-based violence intervention and prevention programs, including efforts to address gang and gun violence, based on partnerships between community residents, law enforcement, local government agencies, and other community stakeholders.  Support for Missing Persons Program: Includes $1 million to help with the nationwide implementation of the Ashanti Alert system. In 2018, Warner secured unanimous Senate passage of the Ashanti Alert Act, legislation that created a new federal alert system for missing or endangered adults between the ages of 18-64. The bill was signed into law on December 31, 2018.Addressing Gun Violence:  Provides $100 million for new violence intervention programs to prevent mass casualty or gang-related gun violence. Additionally, provides $60 million—a $30 million increase compared to Fiscal Year 2022—to support research into effective ways to prevent firearm related injuries.Fighting Hunger: Includes over $2 billion to combat global hunger and malnutrition, following Kaine’s emphasis on the threat Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses to food security around the world and Warner's successful efforts to support non-governmental organizations responding to the food crisis.Fighting COVID: Includes $16 billion in funding for the procurement of additional COVID vaccines and therapeutics and to support the development of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics that could better protect Virginians against new COVID variants.Addressing Americans’ Long COVID Needs: Includes $15 million for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to provide the research needed to ensure those experiencing long COVID have access to the patient-centered, coordinated care they need; address disparities in diagnosis and treatment of long COVID; and identify treatments for the condition. Also provides the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with $25 million to continue studying long COVID. Both of these efforts were first outlined in Senator Kaine’s CARE for Long COVID Act.Supporting Health Care Providers: Includes $30 million to further implement the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Act, legislation Kaine wrote and named in honor of Dr. Lorna Breen, a physician from Charlottesville who was working on the front lines of the pandemic in New York and died by suicide in the spring of 2020. The resources will go toward comprehensive and evidence-based support to prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among health care providers. Kaine led a bipartisan push to include this funding in the Fiscal Year 2023 budget.Addressing the Maternal Mortality Crisis: Includes $496 million—an increase of $304 million above Fiscal Year 2022 funding—for the Maternal Mortality Initiative, following a bipartisan push led by Kaine for funding to prevent maternal deaths, eliminate inequities in maternal health outcomes, and improve maternal health.Pandemic Preparedness: Includes $10.5 billion in non-emergency funding for global health—a $680 million increase compared to Fiscal Year 2022—and $5 billion to support national COVID vaccination campaigns in countries with low vaccination rates. This funding is critical to protecting Americans from the impacts of disease outbreaks around the world.Modernizing America’s Health Data Infrastructure: Includes $200 million—an increase of $100 million compared to Fiscal Year 2022—to modernize the public health data systems that help support healthy communities throughout America. Kaine, who pushed for this funding, also crafted the Improving Data Accessibility Through Advancements (DATA) in Public Health Act, legislation to increase timely and accurate information sharing between local, state, and federal public health departments to improve our preparedness and response to emerging public health threats.Increasing Funding for Pediatric Research: Provides $12.6 million to further fund the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act—legislation championed by Warner and Kaine and named after a child from Loudoun County who died from a brain tumor in 2013.Reducing Tobacco Use: Includes $20 million in funding to support the CDC, states, and territories’ continued efforts to reduce tobacco use among disparate populations and regions with high tobacco prevalence and mortality and to expand the highly successful and cost-effective Tips from Former Smokers media campaign. The investment follows a successful bipartisan push by Kaine to raise the tobacco age from 18 to 21 and a push to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration could regulate synthetic nicotine.Addressing the Root Causes of Migration: Provides resources for a diverse array of programs to help improve the conditions that drive migration from Central America, including programs focused on counter-narcotics efforts and economic development.Expanding High-Speed Internet Access: Includes $400 million for the USDA’s ReConnect Program to expand access to high-speed broadband to remote underserved areas. Warner and Kaine have been vocal advocates for expanding broadband. As Governors and Senators, Warner and Kaine have long supported expanding broadband access in Virginia. During the pandemic, they secured significant funding for broadband through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Warner and Kaine also joined a bipartisan letter to Senate leadership requesting this funding earlier this year. Warner also personally secured billions of dollars for broadband expansion in both the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.Increasing Military Pay and Compensation: Includes $1.5 billion to fully fund a 4.6 percent pay raise for servicemembers. Also, includes roughly $1.5 billion in additional funding for compensation to help with rising costs as well as $373 million towards a number of military family support programs. Warner, who pushed for this funding, has long stressed the need for increased support for servicemembers through legislation such as the Military Hunger Prevention Act that helps low-income military families put food on the table.Economic Support for Underserved Communities: Provides $324 million for the U.S. Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institution Fund. Warner, who requested this funding, has led efforts in Congress to support CDFIs through legislation including the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act and the creation of the bipartisan Senate Community Development Finance Caucus.Addressing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Delays and Customer Service Issues: Incudes $310 Million for the IRS, which will enable IRS to continue to update ancient computer systems, improve customer service, and reduce wait times for refunds and other services. Warner and Kaine have consistently pushed the IRS to address poor customer service and severe delays within the department.  Support for Miners: Includes $11.845 million for Black Lung Clinics. Warner and Kaine have actively worked to secure benefits for miners and their families suffering from black lung disease. In August, the Inflation Reduction Act, supported by both Warner and Kaine, permanently extended the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund excise tax at a higher rate, providing more certainty for miners, miner retirees, and their families who rely on the fund to access benefits.In addition to battling for these priorities, the Senators will work to ensure that funds obtained by Virginia House members also remain in the ultimate budget package.###"

Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (D-VA) along with Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA-09) wrote a letter to President Biden, formally requesting the approval of the Commonwealth of Virginia’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration and federal assistance for individuals affected by the extreme and devastating rainfall event that occurred on July 13, 2022. This request includes Individual and Public Assistance for Buchanan County, Public Assistance for Tazewell County, and Hazard Mitigation for the Commonwealth of Virginia.“This extreme storm event dropped seven inches of rain on eastern Buchanan County and northwestern Tazewell County within several hours, which resulted in flash flooding that damaged waterlines, transmission lines, roads, bridges, homes, and businesses. The joint preliminary damage assessment found that this severe storm event destroyed 37 homes and caused significant damage to 54 other properties in Buchanan County,” wrote the lawmakers. “This major storm event comes less than a year after the community of Hurley, Virginia – located in Buchanan County – experienced a devastating rainfall event that resulted in heavy flooding, landslides, and mudslides that destroyed 31 homes and resulted in major damage to 27 other properties, along with extensive damage to other public and private infrastructure.”“Our constituents in Buchanan County are still grappling with the aftermath of this devastating storm event, which resulted in a Major Disaster Declaration, and are now forced to respond to this debilitating storm event. Many residents in Buchanan County remain displaced from last year’s extreme rainfall event and are already facing another uprooting of their lives,” they continued. “The impact of these two natural disasters within a calendar year has severely stressed the resources and capabilities of the Commonwealth of Virginia and Buchanan County. We hope you consider this cumulative impact on this community as you review the Commonwealth’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration.”In their letter, the lawmakers noted the particular need for Individual Assistance for Buchanan County and its residents, who have withstood multiple natural disasters within a year. The Administration’s approval of a Major Disaster Declaration would provide a surge of federal resources and support, allowing Virginia to more quickly respond to and recover from the direct and indirect consequences caused by July’s storm.  Sens. Warner and Kaine and Rep. Griffith have been pushing for federal assistance since the devastating floods of August 2021. In October 2021, they sent a bipartisan letter to President Biden to express their strong support for former Virginia Governor Ralph S. Northam's September 30th request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the Commonwealth of Virginia and Buchanan County. Later that month, the President approved Virginia’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration, which provided Public Assistance for Buchanan County and Hazard Mitigation for the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, on October 29, the Administration issued a formal denial of Governor Northam’s request for Individual Assistance for Buchanan County. In December 2021, Sens. Warner and Kaine and Rep. Griffith sent a letter to President Biden asking his administration to approve an appeal that would grant federal assistance to individual residents in and around Hurley, Virginia. Despite these efforts, Virginia’s appeal was ultimately denied in January 2022.Today’s letter comes after Sen. Warner visited Buchanan County on August 22 and Sen. Kaine and Rep. Griffith visited Buchanan County on August 26 – all to see the impacts of the flooding and hear from impacted Virginians.A copy of the letter can be found here and below.Dear President Biden:We write today to express our strong support for Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the Commonwealth of Virginia, including the counties of Buchanan and Tazewell, following the extreme and devastating rainfall event that occurred on July 13, 2022. The Governor has requested Individual and Public Assistance for Buchanan County, Public Assistance for Tazewell County, and Hazard Mitigation for the Commonwealth of Virginia.On July 13, 2022, Governor Youngkin declared a state of emergency in the Commonwealth following severe flooding that occurred that morning. This extreme storm event dropped seven inches of rain on eastern Buchanan County and northwestern Tazewell County within several hours, which resulted in flash flooding that damaged waterlines, transmission lines, roads, bridges, homes, and businesses. The joint preliminary damage assessment found that this severe storm event destroyed 37 homes and caused significant damage to 54 other properties in Buchanan County.This major storm event comes less than a year after the community of Hurley, Virginia – located in Buchanan County – experienced a devastating rainfall event that resulted in heavy flooding, landslides, and mudslides that destroyed 31 homes and resulted in major damage to 27 other properties, along with extensive damage to other public and private infrastructure. Our constituents in Buchanan County are still grappling with the aftermath of this devastating storm event, which resulted in a Major Disaster Declaration, and are now forced to respond to this debilitating storm event. Many residents in Buchanan County remain displaced from last year’s extreme rainfall event and are already facing another uprooting of their lives. The impact of these two natural disasters within a calendar year has severely stressed the resources and capabilities of the Commonwealth of Virginia and Buchanan County. We hope you consider this cumulative impact on this community as you review the Commonwealth’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration.A Major Disaster Declaration would ensure the full availability of federal resources to support the Commonwealth’s efforts to guarantee public safety and rapid recovery from the direct and indirect effects of this significant storm event. Federal assistance – particularly the issuance of Individual Assistance – is needed in Buchanan County to help our constituents recover and rebuild following multiple natural disasters.We thank you for your consideration of Governor Youngkin’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration. We look forward to working with you, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other relevant federal agencies to ensure the Commonwealth of Virginia has the resources available to support our constituents following this tragic event.Sincerely,###"

These sacrifices are why I’m so committed to supporting our nation’s servicemembers, military families, and veterans. We owe it to them to help minimize the risk of a conflict erupting and ensure the United States will prevail decisively in any conflict we must fight.” Kaine has been a leading voice in Congress on the need to repeal outdated Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to prevent future misuse. Kaine has introduced legislation with Senator Todd Young (R-IN) to repeal the 1991 and 2002 war authorizations that could be subject to misuse by future presidents and reassert Congress’ role in decisions as important as whether or not to send our troops in harm’s way. In 2018, he introduced legislation with Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) to update the 2001 AUMF and repeal the 2002 AUMF.###"

A 2016 GAO study reported that rates of violence against health care workers are up to twelve times higher than rates for the overall workforce, and 70% of nonfatal workplace assaults in 2016 occurred in the health care and social assistance sectors.The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue a standard requiring health care and social service employers to write and implement a workplace violence prevention plan to prevent and protect their employees from violent incidents. It would ensure that health care and social service workplaces adopt proven prevention techniques and are prepared to respond in the tragic event of a violent incident.The bill is cosponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tina Smith (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Edward J.

Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-VA) celebrated $52.9 million in funding from the federal government for the Petersburg/Richmond region to support job creation and increase American independence from foreign drug manufacturers.This funding was recently awarded through the Economic Development Administration and funded by the American Rescue Plan, which was supported by the three lawmakers and passed through the Senate by a vote of 50 – 49 and the House by a vote of 220 – 211.“The American Rescue Plan is the gift that keeps on giving – this time with $52.9 million that will go towards establishing Central Virginia as a hub for pharmaceutical manufacturing. This unparalleled federal investment will help boost American production of essential drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients while creating 21st century jobs for Virginians and tackling our nation’s dangerous overreliance on foreign supply chains for medicines,” said the lawmakers. The Virginia Advanced Pharma Manufacturing (APM) and R&D Cluster  –  led by the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority–  is one of 21 winners of the $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge – the most impactful regional economic development competition in decades. The projects funded as part of this award include expanding a nascent pharmaceutical manufacturing corridor in Central Virginia through investment in new wet lab space, development of critical infrastructure to sustain industrial capacity in Petersburg, and engagement with local business to enhance the regional pharmaceutical supply chain. The project will also catalyze a new partnership between Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia State University to create new pathways for underserved residents to high-quality training and jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.The Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) is an unprecedented competitive federal grant program that provides each regional coalition with significant investments to tackle a wide variety of projects – including entrepreneurial support, workforce development, infrastructure, and innovation – to drive inclusive economic growth. Each coalition’s collection of projects aims to develop and strengthen regional industry clusters – all while embracing economic equity, creating good-paying jobs, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness globally. Projects span 24 states and include $87 million to two primarily Tribal coalitions and over $150 million for projects serving communities impacted by the declining use of coal.Sen. Warner helped negotiate portions of the American Rescue Plan and directly advocated for this project. In March, he sat down with the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority and other pharmaceutical industry professionals for a roundtable discussion on the need to manufacture more prescription drugs in Virginia.While on Richmond City Council, Sen. Kaine played a major role in the formation and growth of the Virginia Biotechnology Research Partnership Authority, served on its board when he was Mayor of Richmond, and appointed board members while he was Governor. In addition to advocating for the American Rescue Plan, which provided the funding for the EDA Build Back Better Regional Challenge, Sen. Kaine specifically advocated for this project to win this grant. He also visited the project’s facilities in Richmond and Petersburg in April of this year.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-sanders-and-colleagues-mark-brazils-independence-day-with-resolution-in-support-of-brazilian-democracy-urging-free-fair-and-peaceful-elections-in-october,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) teamed up with Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to unveil a resolution supporting democratic institutions in Brazil. The introduction comes on the Independence Day of Brazil and amid efforts by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to preemptively reject Brazil’s national election results and sow mistrust and spread misinformation regarding next month’s presidential election in the country, where current polls project he will lose re-election.The resolution is being led in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives Jamie Raskin (MD-08), Raúl M. Grijalva (AZ-03), Sara Jacobs (CA-53), Hank Johnson (GA-04), and Susan Wild (PA-07).“The United States and Brazil are two of the largest democracies in the Western Hemisphere. At a time when democracy is under attack in Brazil, America, and in countries around the world, we have a duty to stand up for peoples’ fundamental right to shape their futures by having a voice in their government, without fear of political violence or retribution,” said Senator Kaine. “This resolution sends a powerful message that Congress is committed to linking arms with the people of Brazil in that effort and that we will not be silent in the face of any attempts to undermine Brazil’s electoral system.”“It is absolutely imperative that the U.S. Senate make it clear through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil,” said Senator Sanders. “It would be unacceptable for the United States to recognize a government that came to power undemocratically, and it would send a horrific message to the entire world. The United States should make it clear that we support the democratic process, and it’s important for the people of Brazil to know we’re on their side, on the side of democracy.”“A peaceful transfer of power is integral to a strong democracy,” said Senator Merkley. “But Brazil’s Independence Day celebrations today, amid tension and polarization, underscore just how fragile democracy is and the sustained efforts that are required to preserve it. The U.S. must condemn any and all attempts to incite political violence and intimidation to ensure Brazil’s electoral processes remain free and fair.”“This resolution recognizes the importance of strengthening democracy in Brazil. Our measure is a call to action to preserve Brazil’s democratic institutions,” said Senator Blumenthal.    “The fate of Brazil’s democracy, which is under daily attack by President Bolsonaro, and of U.S. relations with Brazil, will be decided in the upcoming election.  The Biden Administration must make it unequivocally clear that the costs of subverting a free and fair election will be immediate and severe,” said Senator Leahy.“As the people of Brazil prepare to vote this fall, right-wing forces are trying to undermine the integrity of the electoral system and poison the process with authoritarian rhetoric that echoes the violent incitement we heard in America before January 6,” said Congressman Raskin. “This bicameral resolution insists that the upcoming elections in Brazil be free and fair, transparent and peaceful. Democracy is under attack around the world, and we must vigorously defend it everywhere against autocracy, insurrection and disinformation.”“As Brazil’s elections approach, we continue to call on all individuals seeking office to uphold the values of democracy and endorse free, fair, credible, transparent and peaceful elections. Anything less is unacceptable,” said Congressman Grijalva.  “The United States is stronger and safer when our values align with our support to foreign governments,” said Congresswoman Jacobs. “I’ve been increasingly alarmed by the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., Brazil, and around the world that threatens human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. With Brazilians heading to the polls in less than a month to elect their new president, there are legitimate fears that President Jair Bolsonaro may refuse to step down if he loses. This bicameral resolution is critical and draws an important line: the United States should not formally recognize or provide military aid to an illegitimate government.”Brazilians have sounded the alarm over troubling signs of democratic backsliding in the country, including attacks from government officials on the country’s democratic institutions and rule of law; the kidnapping and murder of advocates and journalists; unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system; and a dramatic increase in violence directed at Brazilian political leaders.In response, the resolution urges the Government of Brazil to ensure that the upcoming presidential election is conducted in a free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful manner that enables all citizens of Brazil to exercise the right to vote. Additionally, the resolution calls for the United States Government to continue to speak out against efforts to incite political violence and undermine the electoral process in Brazil, and to review and reconsider its relationship with any government that comes to power in Brazil through undemocratic means.Full text of the resolution is available here.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-un-report-detailing-human-rights-violations-against-uyghur-muslims-in-china,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, who serves as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee focused on democracy and human rights, issued the following statement after the United Nations released a report confirming that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims in China:“I’m horrified by the UN Human Rights Office’s long overdue report on the plight of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, who have been victims of state sponsored genocide, torture, sexual violence and rape, and arbitrary detention by the Chinese government. While I’m disappointed the report does not go further by calling these atrocities a genocide, it’s nonetheless an important step in documenting the Chinese government’s appalling and systematic human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. On behalf of Virginia’s Uyghur community, I call on the international community and United States to hold China accountable by implementing the report’s recommendations, including the immediate release of all individuals arbitrarily deprived of their liberty. The U.S. government should encourage international partners to also adopt similar legislation as the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which I cosponsored, to ensure that goods made with Uyghur forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) do not enter their markets.”Kaine has been outspoken against the CCP’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. In February 2022, Kaine sent a letter urging the Biden Administration to press the Chinese government to halt the harassment of his constituents and seek the release of their Uyghur family members who have been forcibly and wrongfully detained in China’s Xinjiang region. Last year, Kaine held a joint hearing to highlight China’s atrocities against the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province and discuss additional ways to pressure China to end this horrific genocide.In June 2021, Kaine’s bipartisan amendment, co-sponsored by Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), to diplomatically boycott the Beijing Olympics as a way to highlight human rights issues in Hong Kong and with China’s Uyghur population was passed by the Senate as part of the bipartisan Endless Frontiers Act. Following Kaine and Romney’s urging, the Biden Administration announced a diplomatic boycott in November.In March 2021, Kaine helped introduce a bipartisan Senate resolution condemning China’s human right abuses against the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and calling for an international investigation into the abuses and crimes committed there. In January 2021, Senator Mark R. Warner and Kaine co-sponsored the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, legislation to ensure that goods made with Uyghur forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) do not enter the United States. A version of this legislation was ultimately unanimously passed through the Senate and signed into law by President Biden in December 2021.###"

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-biden-administration-decision-to-provide-targeted-student-loan-forgiveness,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after President Biden announced his decision to provide targeted student loan forgiveness to millions of Americans. His plan would cancel up to $20,000 of student loan debt for Pell Grant borrowers and $10,000 of student loan debt for non-Pell Grant borrowers—a move Kaine has called for previously:“Getting the education you need to achieve your dreams or provide for your family shouldn’t be a one-way ticket to a mountain of debt. I’m glad to see President Biden provide targeted student loan forgiveness to help millions of Americans. This will make a big difference for so many Virginians and Americans. I’m going to keep working to ease the burden of student loan debt and make post-secondary education more affordable.”President Biden’s plan would apply to Americans with incomes under $125,000 per year or $250,000 per year for married couples who file their taxes jointly. The President also extended the moratorium on federal student loan payments until December 31, 2022.Studies have shown that borrowers with less than $10,000 of debt tend to have the hardest time paying off their loans because they might not have finished their degree, or may have entered a less lucrative field. The vast majority of these borrowers are people of color.Kaine has long supported efforts to lower student loan debt and make post-secondary education more affordable by increasing Pell Grant awards, expanding Pell Grant eligibility to job training programs, expanding access to public service loan forgiveness, providing financial counseling to students and their families on the front-end, expanding early college high school programs, and making it easier to transfer from community colleges to four-year schools.###"

Extending the waiver would help ensure more public servants are able to benefit from the historic waiver that has already resulted in over $9 billion in forgiveness for more than 146,000 public servants and more than 1 million borrowers receiving, on average, one additional year of credit toward PSLF. The extension would also help the agency minimize confusion among borrowers while it conducts a one-time account adjustment later this year and finalizes its proposed PSLF rule.“The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to ‘overhaul’ the PSLF program and ‘make it live up to its promise’ by allowing ‘all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan,’” wrote the lawmakers to Secretary Cardona. “To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.”The lawmakers pointed out that data makes it clear that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the current waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balances, compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year who could potentially be eligible for PSLF.“For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs,” added the lawmakers. “…For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.”The lawmakers highlighted how extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the PSLF program. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit – maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.“[W]e also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers,” concluded the lawmakers.Joining Sens. Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand in the Senate in signing the letter are: Sens.

But it is just that—temporary—and it leaves borrowers in limbo as we wait for new regulations to take effect next year,” said Randi Weingarten, President of American Federation of Teachers. “Let’s be clear, everyone who received the debt relief was promised it. This waiver was a critical step toward healing a broken student loan system that has pauperized a generation. We need to take it one step further and extend it. The people who are benefiting from this moment of relief are the same people who carried us through a pandemic—we need to honor their commitment and extend the deadline for the PSLF waiver.” “No matter what we look like, where we live, or what’s in our bank accounts, all of us should be able to pursue our dreams at an affordable college or university. But for too long, the cost of college has forced many students and families to forego their education goals or be trapped in a lifetime of debt. When educators are unable to repay their student debt, it means fewer educators in the profession, and more disruptions for their students,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “We are overwhelmingly grateful for the waiver that has allowed thousands of educators to receive the promise of PSLF, but there are simply too many educators who have been left out to end the waiver now. We implore the Biden Administration to keep the promise of PSLF and extend the waiver deadline.”“Public service workers make incredible sacrifices every day to strengthen their communities – and never more so than during the last two and a half years of this pandemic. The least we can do is ease their overwhelming student debt burden, much of which they have incurred while getting the skills and education they need to be better at their essential jobs,” said President Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME. “So many AFSCME members have benefitted from the Biden administration’s temporary waiver that expanded eligibility for loan forgiveness. But we are only scratching the surface of the need. It is time to extend the deadline and give more public service workers the time to learn about the program, apply for loan forgiveness and get the relief they need.”“The Administration's overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is just hitting its stride--delivering debt relief to educators and healthcare workers who are still reeling from the pandemic and its aftermath,” said Mike Pierce, Executive Director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “We strongly urge President Biden to listen to Senators Menendez, Murray, Kaine, and Gillibrand, Representatives Sarbanes, Courtney, Hayes, Manning, and more than 100 of their colleagues: keep your promise to cancel student debt for every public service worker who is eligible, no matter how long it takes.” This effort is supported by 74 outside organizations, including: The School Superintendents Association (AASA), AccessLex Institute, Accountable.us, Alaska Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), American Alliance of Museums, American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW), American Association of University Women (AAUW), American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), American Council on Education (ACE), American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), American Psychological Association (APA), Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance , Association of Young Americans (AYA), Association of Oncology Social Work (AOSW), Center for American Progress (CAP), Center for Economic Integrity, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW), Civil Service Bar Association, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU), Communication Workers of America Union (CWA), Community Service Society of New York, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America (CFA), Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), Equal Justice Works (EJW), Fosterus, Hispanic Federation, Housing and Economic Rights Advocates (HERA), International Association of Firefighters, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Jewish Federations of North America, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Legal Aid at Work, Loan Assistance Repayment Program of Minnesota, Maine Center for Economic Policy, Maryland Center for Collegiate Financial Wellness, National Action Network Washington Bureau, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), National Association of Social Workers, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Association of Deans and Directors of Social Work, National Council of Nonprofits, National Education Association (NEA), National Employment Law Project (NELP), National Military Family Association, National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), National Women's Law Center (NWLC), Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, New America, New Jersey Citizen Action, New Leaders, New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), Nonprofit Professional Employees Union (NPEU)—IFPTE Local 70, OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates, ParentsTogether, People's Parity Party, Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), Public Law Center, Social Current, Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC), Student Debt Crisis Center, The Arc of the United States, The Debt Collective, The Education Trust, The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), UnidosUS, Virginia Poverty Law Center, Voices for National Service, and Zero Debt Massachusetts.Find a copy of the letter HERE and below.Dear Secretary Cardona: Thank you for your continued efforts to improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. As you know, the limited PSLF waiver announced last year has already improved the lives of more than 164,0001 public servants who have had their student loans forgiven and 1 million2 who have received an average of one additional year of PSLF credit. Yet, we write today, as we believe that additional action is needed to ensure public servants—who have been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery—can access the PSLF waiver. Currently, only an estimated 15 percent of the 9 million public service workers with student debt have filed paperwork to track their qualifying payments under PSLF.3 The Department of Education (Department) will not begin its one-time review of accounts with extended forbearances and incorrectly recorded deferments, which could help borrowers make more progress toward PSLF relief, until later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022. In addition, the Department recently unveiled its sweeping proposed regulations for improving student loan programs, including PSLF—which are currently on track to take effect on July 1, 2023. Thus, we request the Department extend the PSLF waiver deadline until at least July 1, 2023, in order to align with new changes under forthcoming rules and minimize confusion among borrowers. The PSLF waiver announced by the Department last October was designed to “overhaul” the PSLF program and “make it live up to its promise” by allowing “all payments by student borrowers to count toward PSLF, regardless of loan program or payment plan.”4 To date, the waiver has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing barriers for borrowers to receive PSLF relief—accounting for almost all (89%) of the borrowers who have received forgiveness through the PSLF program through June 30, 2022.5 Moreover, the limited waiver is also a lifeline for Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) borrowers who, for the first time, have seen their payments acknowledged in the PSLF program. Last summer the Department called the treatment of public servants with FFEL loans “a matter of equity,”6 but a single year of flexibility has not been enough to overcome years of “inaccurate information about eligibility for PSLF or Direct Consolidation Loans, resulting in deceptive acts or practices.”7 Data indicates that only a fraction of the public servants who are eligible for PSLF have utilized the waiver. As of the end of June, the Department only has information from 1.3 million “cumulative PSLF borrowers with eligible employment and positive loan balance[s],” compared to the 9 million public service workers that the Student Borrower Protection Center identified earlier this year that could potentially be eligible for PSLF.8 As the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond warns, this could leave millions of public servants at risk of missing out on the benefits of the PSLF waiver and its associated loan forgiveness.9  As more than 20 state attorneys general have pointed out, public service workers—particularly those in healthcare and education—continue to face challenges such as burnout and personal sacrifice to keep our nation safe during the pandemic and recovery.10 For many borrowers, the Department’s one-time review to fix forbearance and deferment failures, scheduled for later this year—potentially after October 31, 2022—may be the first time that they learn that certain periods of deferment and forbearance could count toward both income-driven repayment (IDR) and PSLF programs. These borrowers may qualify for immediate forgiveness—especially given the PSLF waiver—or, at minimum, advance their progress towards PSLF relief. For many public servants, losing access to the PSLF waiver before they are able to benefit from the IDR payment adjustment could prevent them from being able to pursue forgiveness under PSLF.  Importantly, extending the PSLF waiver will also allow more military service members and federal employees to make progress towards PSLF. According to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office, 200,000 active-duty military service members have federal student loans—about half of whom have balances over $13,000.11 Reporting shows that military service members face troubling administrative hurdles in certifying their employment for the purposes of PSLF.12 The Department is currently working to ensure that all federal agencies or departments “automatically [provide] credit toward PSLF for military service members and federal employees.”13 These data matches are critical to ensuring that the agency can identify which borrowers are eligible for PSLF and provide them automatic relief. By extending the PSLF waiver, more military service members and federal employees can benefit—maximizing the promise of the PSLF waiver.  Since the deadline of October 31, 2022 to qualify for PSLF under the waiver program is rapidly approaching, we ask that the Department extend this deadline in order to ensure that all public servants with federal student loans are able to benefit from this historic waiver. Given the issues stated above, we also ask that the Department increase its outreach to public servants and borrowers to ensure that they are aware of the waiver and understand eligibility requirements, and correct any misinformation about the waiver being communicated by student loan servicers. Sincerely,###"

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-push-to-clear-irs-backlogs-and-resolve-customer-service-issues,"This comes following months of outreach from the lawmakers calling on the IRS to address ongoing delaysWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) joined a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in a letter to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig reiterating concerns regarding persistent customer services issues within the agency, and urging the IRS to eliminate the ongoing processing delays, improve customer service, extend the suspension of automated notices and collections, and continue making maximum use of overtime and surge teams.“Since last year, numerous Members of Congress in the House and Senate have sent several letters regarding customer service issues, processing delays, and the outstanding backlog of returns,” wrote the bicameral group of lawmakers to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. “Yet, we are writing again to urge the IRS to extend the suspension of automated collections, continue the pause on automated notices, keep its surge teams in place until hiring challenges and processing backlogs are adequately addressed.”The lawmakers continued, “[W]e believe that the IRS must take additional steps to improve customer service issues, decrease processing delays, and work-down the backlog of paper returns and correspondence by continuing the maximum use of overtime and surge teams, as well as the continued suspension of automated notices and collections—which have been critical in reducing pandemic-related tax return and correspondence backlogs.”The letter came just before the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act — legislation Sens. Warner and Kaine helped pass in the Senate—which provides funding to modernize IRS systems and improve customer service when paying taxes. This will help ensure the IRS has the resources it needs to process tax returns quickly, get rebates to taxpayers faster, and address challenges Americans have when filing taxes.Sen. Warner has been pressing the IRS to address pandemic-related processing delays for the last two years. Sen. Warner first raised concerns over backlogs at the IRS in February 2021, as millions of Americans waited for delayed stimulus payments and processing of their tax returns. In January 2022, as the tax filing season opened, Sen. Warner again called on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commissioner Rettig to quickly address reports of unprocessed tax returns for the 2020 filing season. Later that month, Sens. Warner and Kaine called on the IRS to provide relief for taxpayers amidst the backlog – a request they again reiterated in a bipartisan and bicameral March letter.  In April of this year Sen. Warner questioned Commissioner Rettig during a Senate Finance Committee hearing about IRS-backlog related issues regarding Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Additionally, in a separate hearing of the Committee, Sen. Warner questioned IRS National Taxpayer Advocate Erin M. Collins about the backlogs and about the measures being taken to address the situation, and joined colleagues in another letter to Commissioner Rettig urging immediate action to reduce backlogs and improve customer service during the 2022 filing season.A copy of the letter is available here and below.Dear Commissioner Rettig:Thank you for your continued work to eliminate the unprecedented backlog at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Since last year, numerous Members of Congress in the House and Senate have sent several letters regarding customer service issues, processing delays, and the outstanding backlog of returns. Several Members of Congress have urged you to provide penalty relief for taxpayers, have continually pressed the agency to pursue maximum overtime options for staff who are working on the backlog and on surge teams, and have asked the agency to deploy additional surge teams and other resources in an effective manner to reduce the backlog. Yet, we are writing again to urge the IRS to extend the suspension of automated collections, continue the pause on automated notices, keep its surge teams in place until hiring challenges and processing backlogs are adequately addressed.In a Senate Finance Committee Hearing on April 7, 2022, you estimated that the IRS would return to a “healthy state” by the end of 2022 and that the IRS expected to hire 10,000 customer service representatives between this year and next year. Yet, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), the paper return backlog has actually increased by 1.3 million from the same point as last year and that the IRS was only able to meet 12 percent of its hiring goals for processing center employees earlier this year. NTA also noted that the IRS has not met its 5,000 employee hiring goal for submission processing positions—falling short by 3,417 employees, and that while historically the IRS has paid refunds from paper returns in four to six weeks, refunds are currently taking six months or longer.Accordingly, we believe that the IRS must take additional steps to improve customer service issues, decrease processing delays, and work-down the backlog of paper returns and correspondence by continuing the maximum use of overtime and surge teams, as well as the continued suspension of automated notices and collections—which have been critical in reducing pandemic-related tax return and correspondence backlogs. Additionally, the IRS must improve its recruitment and retention efforts to adequately address the backlog and increase levels of taxpayer service.In order to gauge the extent of hiring and processing challenges still facing the Agency, we ask that you provide answers to the following questions no later than August 19, 2022:Processing Backlogs:Hiring Challenges:We appreciate your consideration of these requests and attention to these issues.Sincerely,### "

Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA), Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty (both R-TN). “In the words of then-Attorney General, William Barr, Appalachia has suffered the consequences of the opioid epidemic ‘more, perhaps, than any other region.’ In 2018, the overdose mortality rate for individuals ages 25-43 was 43 percent higher in Appalachia than the rest of the country. It is a region that needs the assistance that the HIDTA program was designed to provide.”Since its creation in 1988, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) grant assistance program has provided for greater coordination and information sharing among federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies. These additional federal resources, allocated to areas deemed as critical drug trafficking regions, are essential in eliminating drug trafficking and its harmful consequences. ONDCP has the statutory authority to create new HIDTAs and add new counties to existing HIDTAs once it has received a formal petition from a coalition of law enforcement agencies.Despite the enormous need, historically the Appalachian HIDTA has only gained approval for approximately 30 percent of petitions submitted. In the most recent round of designations, no counties within the Appalachian HIDTA – which encompasses Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Southwest Virginia – received the sought-after designation.“This fact, juxtaposed with the region’s manifest need, suggests strongly that the process of awarding needs to be revisited,” the senators wrote in their letter to ONDCP. “Counties in the Appalachian HIDTA would benefit from the expansion of this program into their communities and it would be of immense help to the law enforcement agencies serving them and surrounding areas. As ONDCP reviews HIDTA designation petitions from Appalachia, we ask that you consider the devastating impacts of illegal drugs in the region in order to effectively disrupt and dismantle trafficking organizations and reduce drug-related crime.”Concluded the senators, “We urge ONDCP to review its criteria to ensure that hard-hit regions like Appalachia remain competitive for HIDTA designations. We further request a written response describing the results of this review be provided in a timely manner.”A copy of the letter is available below.Dear Dr. Gupta:We write today regarding the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s (ONDCP) High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program and certain deficiencies in the designation process for counties in the Appalachian region.Since its creation in 1988, the HIDTA grant assistance program has provided for greater coordination and information sharing among federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies.

HIDTA designation is determined by four criteria, which include an evidence based description detailing the extent of illegal drug activity, the impact on the area and the United States, existing efforts to curtail it, and the increased need for federal resources to respond adequately to the area’s drug-related activities.In Appalachia, law enforcement struggles to stem the tide of substance abuse.

This historic legislation will help lower Virginians’ prescription drug and energy costs, help them access health care, and tackle climate change, which has had a devastating toll on communities all across the Commonwealth,” said the senators. “We were proud to vote for this bill and urge the House of Representatives to pass it and get it to President Biden’s desk ASAP.”Lower Prescription Drug Costs:Affordable Health Care:Black Lung Benefits:Clean Energy and Climate Provisions:Tax Fairness:###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-cosponsors-bill-to-provide-financial-stability-for-college-students-faced-with-unexpected-emergencies,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine cosponsored legislation to help ensure college students are able to stay in school in the face of unexpected emergencies. For many students, paying for college requires carefully balancing student loan debts, jobs, and studies, which can be easily derailed by an unexpected costly event. The Emergency Grant Aid for College Students Act, led by Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), would provide financial stability for students struggling to manage a sudden death in the family, car repair, medical bill, or other financial emergencies that too often force students to drop out of school.“No student should have to drop out of school when faced with unexpected financial costs,” said Senator Kaine. “This legislation would help provide support to students in need and ensure they can continue pursuing higher education.”   When the COVID-19 pandemic forced campuses to close, resulting in millions of college students facing unexpected costs, Congress provided funding for higher education institutions to provide emergency grants to give students the resources they needed to stay enrolled. Yet college students face emergencies all the time, not just during the pandemic, and the consequences of these disruptions are significant. Data shows these events are particularly disruptive for Black, Latino, Native, and low-income students. The Emergency Grant Aid for College Students Act would authorize a grant program for institutions of higher education to provide emergency grants to college students to help them get through unanticipated emergencies. These grants would be administered by individual campuses and, unlike student loans, would not need to be repaid.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-statement-on-bipartisan-bill-to-expand-benefits-for-toxic-exposed-veterans-becoming-law,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine released the following statement after President Biden signed the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 into law. This legislation will expand health care and benefits for toxic-exposed veterans under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and authorize a new community-based outpatient clinic in Hampton Roads:“Our nation’s veterans have made immense sacrifices in defense of our freedom, and Congress has a responsibility to ensure we’re providing them with the benefits they deserve. This bipartisan legislation signed by President Biden today will ensure millions of veterans, who were exposed to toxins and burn pits during their service, have access to the health care and resources they need. We’re also glad the bill will provide funding for a new outpatient clinic in Hampton Roads, helping to reduce wait times and improve care for Virginia’s veterans.”Warner and Kaine voted to pass the Honoring Our PACT Act on June 16 and again on July 27.The bill is named in honor of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, who died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service in Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard.Specifically, the Honoring Our PACT Act will:Virginia is home to more than 700,000 veterans. Warner and Kaine have long supported expanding health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and burn pits during their service. The Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Warner and Kaine voted to pass, included provisions to expand the VA’s list of medical conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. Warner and Kaine also cosponsored legislation that was signed into law in 2019 to extend VA coverage to veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange while stationed off the coast of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The bill also extended these benefits to servicemembers exposed to herbicides while serving in the Korean Demilitarized Zone and to children of servicemembers stationed in Thailand who were born with spina bifida.In 2015, confronted with wait times in Hampton Roads that were three times the national average, Warner successfully urged the VA to send down a team of experts to address the problem. He also succeeded in getting the Northern Virginia Technology Council to issue a free report detailing how to reduce wait times. Most recently, in October 2020, Warner successfully saw through the signing of his legislation to expand veterans’ access to mental health services and reduce the alarming rate of veteran suicide. He’s also previously met with senior leadership at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center and Hampton VA Medical Center to discuss wait time reduction at their facilities and suicide prevention efforts. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), Kaine has introduced the bipartisan Vet Support Act to provide better identification, intervention, and care to veterans coping with mental health issues in underserved areas. He also cosponsored legislation to allow doctors at the VA to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in states like Virginia that have established medical marijuana programs.###"

Warner and Tim Kaine announced $1,768,500 in federal funding for health centers across Virginia to advance health equity through better data collection and reporting. The funding will support data modernization efforts aimed at better identifying and responding to needs of patients and communities through improved data quality; advancing COVID-19 response, mitigation, and recovery efforts; and helping prepare for future public health emergencies. The funding was made available by the American Rescue Plan, which Warner and Kaine helped pass last year. The funding was awarded through the Health Resources & Services Administration. “During the pandemic, we saw how outdated public health data systems hampered efforts to provide care to people across Virginia and our country, especially to our most vulnerable communities,” said the senators. “This funding will help ensure community health centers have the resources needed to continue serving their communities.”Each of the following health centers will receive $65,500 in funding:The Community Access Network, Inc. in Lynchburg, a Health Center Program Look-Alike (L2C), will receive $65,500 in funding. L2Cs are community-based health care providers that do not receive Health Center Program funding but are eligible to apply for some federal benefit programs.As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee, Kaine has long supported efforts to modernize public health data systems. Earlier this year, Kaine introduced legislation to modernize our nation’s public health data infrastructure. Provisions from Kaine’s bill were included in the PREVENT Pandemics Act, which passed out of HELP in March.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-signing-of-law-to-boost-domestic-chips-manufacturing,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after President Biden signed legislation to incentivize private investment in domestic chips manufacturing and provide a combined $157 billion of support for chips production and science research in America:“This historic legislation is critical to helping us strengthen our national security, lower costs, create jobs, and outcompete China. I’m glad to have helped pass this bill in the Senate so it could be signed into law today, and look forward to building on this progress with more legislation to improve our economic competitiveness and lower costs for Virginians.”America currently only produces 12 percent of the global supply of chips, which are required by everything from cars, computers, and phones to televisions, LED lightbulbs, and washing machines. Meanwhile, East Asia—where other governments incentivize their own domestic chip manufacturing that make it significantly cheaper to produce chips than in America—has become the production point for 75 percent of the world’s chips.COVID-related chip supply strains have hindered American manufacturing output, resulting in decreased supply and higher prices for cars and other goods. Today’s shortages indicate how catastrophic future chip shortages could be for America’s economy, technological competitiveness, and military capabilities.Today’s legislation aims to create a resurgence in American chips manufacturing to protect America from the threat of future chip shortages by offering private companies a tax credit for investments in domestic chips manufacturing facilities and making $52 billion in funding available for chips researchers and manufacturers so they can make more chips in America.Kaine has been a consistent advocate for the need to onshore chip production and has emphasized the important role Virginia can play in strengthening chip supply and creating chip manufacturing jobs. Virginia is already home to some of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers, which will be able to apply for funding from today’s legislation.In addition to investments in and incentives for chips manufacturing, the legislation will help support the science research America’s economy needs to be competitive in the 21st century, by including:###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-statement-on-senate-passage-of-the-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine voted in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, historic legislation to reduce inflation, lower costs, and fight climate change:“This bill will lower the price of prescription drugs and healthcare, reduce the deficit, and invest in American energy to both address climate change and bring down energy bills. And in another big win for Virginia, it will help ensure that miners suffering from black lung and their families get the help they need,” said the senators. “While we will continue to look for ways to support the health and well-being of our communities, decrease inflation, and lower costs for Virginians, we’re proud that today we took a major step forward in addressing those challenges.”The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will fight inflation, reduce the deficit, invest in domestic energy production and manufacturing, and reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, according to multiple independent assessments. Another survey found that the bill will save the average household hundreds of dollars annually on their energy costs. The Inflation Reduction Act will also lower health care bills by finally allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and extend the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years, through 2025. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act will permanently extend the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund excise tax at a higher rate, providing certainty for miners, miner retirees, and their families who rely on the fund to access benefits.The legislation will also take steps to make sure that the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes, without increasing taxes on small businesses or families making less than $400,000 a year. According to a recent analysis, the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to create nearly 1 million jobs per year.The House of Representatives is now expected to take up the legislation next week before sending it to President Biden’s desk for signature.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/video-kaine-delivers-speech-on-senate-floor-on-black-lung-benefits-in-inflation-reduction-act,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine delivered a speech on the U.S. Senate floor to discuss black lung benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation would permanently extend the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund excise tax at a higher rate, providing certainty for miners, miner retirees, and their families who rely on the fund to access benefits. In Virginia, thousands of miners and their families have received benefits through the trust since it was established, including approximately 2,600 Virginians last year alone.Broadcast-quality video of the Senator’s speech is available here.During his remarks, Kaine said, “It’s a tough job. It’s a scary job. It’s a dangerous job. But these miners do it every day because the nation needs power, because our steel mills need steel to build aircraft carriers and submarines and skyscrapers … and many of them have done it for generations.”Kaine also spoke about his longtime commitment to helping Virginia’s miners. “We have made promises to our miners that we’ll protect their health insurance, that we’ll protect their pensions, and that we’ll have a fully funded black lung benefit program to help the many miners—about one in five in Central Appalachia—whose day-in and day-out job inhaling coal dust and silica dust exposes them to a horrible pulmonary disease,” said Kaine. “…We’ve told them we will have a program for them to take care of the need should they come down with black lung.”“Well, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act … we can meet all the promises that we’ve made to these miners and their families by fixing the black lung benefit program,” Kaine continued. “…to meet the promise that we made to these hardworking people. This will provide permanent, sufficient funding to maintain the solvency of the fund, and our miners can be assured that the program will be—as they’re going underground every day and doing that tough job—they can be assured that the program will be there for them should they get black lung disease.”He concluded by thanking the many Virginia coal miners, “I want to thank Virginia’s coal miners for their friendship, for their patriotism, for their determination, and for never giving up, including never giving up on us.”In 1972, Congress passed the Black Lung Benefits Act and established the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide monthly payments and medical benefits to disabled coal miners who developed black lung disease while working. The benefits are paid for through excise taxes on coal, which were raised in the 1980s in order to pay for the trust fund’s expenses. This level of excise tax expired on December 31, 2021, cutting this funding source by more than 50%.Kaine, a strong advocate for Virginia’s miners, introduced legislation last year to extend the excise tax until 2031. Earlier this year, Kaine joined his colleagues in introducing the Black Lung Benefits Improvement Act, legislation to help miners with black lung disease and their survivors access benefits. In 2019, Kaine successfully pushed to include a fix for miners’ health care and pensions.  In 2018, Kaine also secured passage of provisions to improve early detection and treatment of black lung disease.###"

Today is the start, not the finish. We cannot stand idly by as the Supreme Court threatens to overturn decades of precedent to deny women the right to make their own health decisions.

I’m a proud cosponsor of the Women’s Health Protection Act and will vote in favor of this legislation to codify Roe v. Wade today.”Overturning Roe v. Wade would upend decades of precedent upholding women’s reproductive rights and result in an immediate ban on all abortions in several states.

Among other provisions, the bipartisan bill also amends the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act with the aim of ensuring that the commitment and progress of countries toward implementing effective counter-trafficking measures are factors when determining recipients of U.S. development assistance.“Despite our great strides in recent years, human trafficking remains a horrific reality for countless millions of people around the world. Today, as millions of Ukrainian women and children fleeing Putin’s brutal invasion are among those at the greatest risk of being trafficked, we are reminded that traffickers seize any opportunity to exploit people in desperate circumstances, particularly victims of war and conflict,” said Chairman Menendez. “This legislation will strengthen the United States’ ability to prevent and fight human trafficking in all its forms including by expanding prevention efforts at the USAID and increasing the tools available to hold governments to account if they do not take steps to combat human trafficking. I welcome the support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and look forward to working with them to secure swift passage of this legislation so we can ensure renewed U.S. leadership to combat the scourge of human trafficking in every corner of the world.”“Human trafficking is a despicable crime that plagues the most vulnerable around the world. This reauthorization provides the State Department, through the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, important tools to continue to investigate and prosecute traffickers, help prevent further trafficking, and protect victims,” said Ranking Member Risch. “This legislation also includes important reforms that will increase oversight over U.S. anti-trafficking programs. I am proud of the leadership the United States has shown with our efforts to combat and eliminate human trafficking globally.”“Human traffickers victimize millions of people each day. We should make every possible effort to eliminate the scourge of human trafficking in the U.S. and abroad,” said Senator Kaine. “This legislation is necessary to ensure the U.S. has the resources to combat human trafficking, including prosecuting traffickers, improving prevention efforts, and ensuring support for survivors.”“Human trafficking is an urgent global crisis that has caused horrific suffering for millions worldwide,” Senator Rubio said. “This bill will provide the tools to better combat the scourge of human trafficking and hold perpetrators accountable so that women and men around the world can live safely and freely.”Find a copy of the bill summary HERE.

Warner and Tim Kaine applauded President Biden’s announcement of new efforts to lower high-speed internet costs for Virginians and all Americans, including commitments from 20 internet providers to either increase speeds or cut prices to no more than $30/month for Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)-eligible households. Warner and Kaine helped create the ACP, which was established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Warner negotiated and they both voted to pass. 1,908,000 or 23% of people in Virginia will be eligible for the ACP.  “We’ve made great progress in expanding broadband in Virginia, but too many Virginians still face challenges in accessing internet due to high costs. These steps to lower internet costs for families are critical to address that gap. We’re glad the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help more families stay connected with friends and loved ones, access telehealth services, and find job and educational opportunities online,” said Senators Warner and Kaine.Specifically, the ACP program provides a $30 per month discount, or $75 per month for households on tribal lands, for low-income families to use toward any internet service of their choosing. Today’s commitments from the 20 internet providers will mean tens of millions of ACP-eligible households will receive high-speed internet at no cost. Households can also receive a one-time $100 discount for a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet. Eligible households must have an income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or have a family member that meets at least one of these criteria outlined by the Federal Communications Commission. Virginians can go to GetInternet.gov to sign up for the ACP and find participating providers in their area.As Governors and Senators, Warner and Kaine have long supported expanding broadband access in Virginia. During the pandemic, they secured significant funding for broadband through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the December 2020 government funding bill, which included COVID relief, and the American Rescue Plan. They also introduced legislation to help students access the internet at home. The Fiscal Year 2022 government funding bill supported by Warner and Kaine included $550 million to expand access to broadband and $450 million for the ReConnect program to help rural communities access the internet.###"

While the SCRC was created in 2008, it has lacked the funding authorizations from Congress it needs to effectively direct resources toward communities.“The SCRC is an independent federal agency dedicated to promoting economic development in the Southeastern United States – specifically Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Established in the model of other regional commissions, such as the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and Delta Regional Authority, the SCRC, if appropriately funded, will serve as a significant federal resource for jobs and businesses, particularly in distressed and underserved communities,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and John Kennedy (R-LA), the Chairwoman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over SCRC funding.“Commission investments to grow business and job development opportunities include basic public infrastructure, workforce training, and telecommunications, among other key assets… Additional federal resources will be critical to promote sustainable economies, job and business development, and improved quality of life throughout the Southeast United States,” they continued.All Virginia counties east of those in the Appalachian region of Virginia—which are already part of the Appalachian Regional Commission—are included in the SCRC, and are given an economic status assessment based on how they compare to national averages of various economic measures. Counties that are the most severely and persistently economically distressed and underdeveloped, as well as those who have recently suffered from high rates of poverty, unemployment, or outmigration, are more likely to be eligible for funding.

Any death too soon is a tragedy, and there is something especially cruel about a virus that has robbed countless families of the rituals we often need to say goodbye, like visiting in person or attending a funeral. My heart goes out to the grieving, and I pray that you find peace.“I’ve also been thinking a lot about how the pandemic’s long shadow includes not only our collective grief, but two other lasting challenges. First, it’s estimated that up to 30 percent of the tens of millions of Americans who have had COVID will experience long COVID symptoms, which can be debilitating. Second are the mental health impacts, including sharp increases in depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. As we reflect today on the lasting impacts of this crisis, let’s recommit ourselves to looking out for one another—especially communities of color and low-income Americans, who have been hit the hardest over the past two years—and to working together to put more resources within reach for the countless people who are struggling right now.”Throughout the pandemic, Kaine has consistently worked to secure relief for Americans dealing with the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, his bipartisan legislation named in honor of Dr. Lorna Breen, a physician from Charlottesville, Virginia who was working on the front lines of the pandemic in New York and died by suicide in the Spring of 2020, was signed into law. The legislation is designed to help reduce and prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among health care professionals.Last month, Kaine introduced the Comprehensive Access to Resources an Education (CARE) for Long COVID Act—legislation to improve research on long COVID and provide resources for people with long COVID.

This critical relief comes after Restaurant Associates, the contractor, announced a series of layoffs a few weeks ago, just as the Senate is taking steps to reopen to the public. After these dedicated employees faced down a violent insurrection at the Capitol and continued to serve through more than two years of a pandemic, layoffs should never have been on the table. We understand that the ongoing public health crisis and security measures have led to financial challenges in Senate restaurants. While steps to reopen the Capitol are already underway and additional measures are being considered subject to the approval of the Capitol Police Board, foot traffic in the Senate cafeteria has been a fraction of what it was pre-pandemic and catering operations have ceased. The timing of the announced layoffs was also concerning. The announcement was made after Senate food service workers obtained union recognition—represented by UNITE HERE Local 23 following a majority card count and voluntary recognition—but before they entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Restaurant Associates. Dozens of workers were scheduled to lose their jobs before they were protected by a collective bargaining agreement and just as the Capitol Complex was beginning to reopen, which will undoubtedly increase revenue for Senate restaurants.  The current pay and benefits available to Senate cafeteria workers are already shameful. Of all cafeteria workers in federal buildings around Washington, D.C., Senate cafeteria workers are the least likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance or retirement—only 18 percent have employer-sponsored health insurance and none are enrolled in employer-sponsored pension benefits. For these workers to be laid off after serving this body throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in these conditions would be a stain on our institution. On January 13, 2022, the Senate unanimously passed Resolution 490 honoring Capitol custodial and service workers for their bravery and service in the face of an attack by violent insurrectionists. The resolution specifically references Restaurant Associates and Sodexo staff in its findings and expresses gratitude for and provides support to Capitol personnel. The resolution also reaffirms a commitment to achieving “higher pay, collective bargaining rights, paid sick and vacation leave, and comprehensive health insurance with mental health resources” for personnel. We urge you to prioritize the needs of the essential workers of the United States Senate in line with the criteria set forth by the resolution. Now that the immediate threat of layoffs is behind us, we encourage the Architect of the Capitol to work with all stakeholders, including Restaurant Associates and UNITE HERE, to ensure that the Senate food services contract reflects a commitment to a collective bargaining agreement with quality pay and benefits for all workers. We thank you for working to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Sincerely,###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/northern-virginia-congressional-delegation-writes-gsa-in-support-of-springfield-fbi-location,"FAIRFAX, VA – Today, members of the Northern Virginia congressional delegation sent GSA Administrator Carnahan a letter in support of relocating the FBI Headquarters to the Springfield location. The letter was signed by Sens. Warner and Kaine and Reps. Connolly, Beyer, and Wexton. “The Springfield, Virginia site, which the federal government already owns and underutilizes, is the best option for a new consolidated FBI headquarters,” the members wrote.  “As you know, Northern Virginia is home to the FBI Academy at Marine Corps Base Quantico and the Central Records Complex in Winchester. Additionally, the region boasts the highest concentration of suburban-located Intelligence Community (IC) agency headquarters in the country. Proximity to FBI assets and longstanding IC partners is a key competitive advantage for the site. The Springfield site is at the transportation nexus of Interstate 495 and Interstate 95, the Washington Metro system, the Virginia Railway Express – which has direct service to Quantico – and other transit services. The suburban location also offers a level of security for the Bureau and its employees that cannot be replicated in an urban location in downtown Washington, D.C.” “Since the previous Administration derailed this procurement in 2017, the credentials of the Springfield site have only improved,” the members added. “We welcome your continued consultation with the Northern Virginia congressional delegation, the Commonwealth of Virginia, area local governments and communities, and private sector stakeholders, all of whom are united behind bringing the FBI headquarters to Springfield.”Full text of the letter follows and is available here.Dear Administrator Carnahan, We write today to convey, in the strongest terms possible, our full support for building a consolidated headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Springfield, Virginia. The Springfield, Virginia site, which the federal government already owns and underutilizes, is the best option for a new consolidated FBI headquarters. As you know, Northern Virginia is home to the FBI Academy at Marine Corps Base Quantico and the Central Records Complex in Winchester. Additionally, the region boasts the highest concentration of suburban-located Intelligence Community (IC) agency headquarters in the country.

The suburban location also offers a level of security for the Bureau and its employees that cannot be replicated in an urban location in downtown Washington, D.C.  Since the previous Administration derailed this procurement in 2017, the credentials of the Springfield site have only improved. Transportation capacity at the site is expanding rapidly with additional investments in access to bus services and the Springfield Metro station. Federal, state, and local investments are creating new capacity along the transit and commuter rail corridors that connect Springfield with direct routes to Washington, D.C. and Quantico.Finally, the federal government has made investments in and around the site, including the new headquarters of the Transportation Security Administration, which make the site ideal for new and additional federal tenants.   We welcome your continued consultation with the Northern Virginia congressional delegation, the Commonwealth of Virginia, area local governments and communities, and private sector stakeholders, all of whom are united behind bringing the FBI headquarters to Springfield. Thank you for your steadfast support for building a new consolidated headquarters for the FBI. We are fully behind the proposed site in Springfield as a leading contender for this procurement and welcome the General Services Administration’s strong consideration of Springfield as the future home to the FBI headquarters. Sincerely, ###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/bicameral-delegation-urges-justice-department-to-reconsider-ghaisar-case,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (D-VA), Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Representatives Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) and Gerry Connolly, and House Natural Resources Committee Chair Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ) today wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging that the U.S. Department of Justice reconsider the case of two U.S. Park Police officers who shot and killed Northern Virginian Bijan Ghaisar in 2017. Their request followed the recent decision by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares to drop an appeal in the case.They wrote:“We write today regarding the 2017 fatal shooting of 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar by two United States Park Police (USPP) officers. Nearly five years after the fatal shooting of Bijan, it remains unclear to the Ghaisar family, to us, and to the broader community of the National Capital Region, how a traffic stop escalated to a fatal shooting. While the Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to pursue federal charges under the previous administration, we believe another look is warranted. Therefore, we respectfully request that DOJ reopen its investigation, pursue a vigorous analysis of the facts and law, and determine whether federal charges are merited.”“As you know, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated this shooting in detail, interviewing more than 150 individuals (including law enforcement, civilian, and medical witnesses), analyzing evidence at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, and amassing an investigative file of some 10,000 documents. The focus of the Department’s investigation was to determine whether the officers had violated federal laws, in particular federal criminal civil rights statute 18 U.S.C. § 242. There is precedent for charges in a case like this, as DOJ’s Civil Rights Division pursued similar charges in the George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery cases.“What’s more, we understand that Bijan Ghaisar’s family, through counsel, has requested that the Civil Rights Division revisit its decision declining to prosecute the officers who shot and killed him. We further understand that the Department is now in possession of sworn deposition testimony taken from briefs submitted in a civil action, which includes testimony from a senior U.S. Park Police officer and a Fairfax County Police officer that may cast new light on the events of that tragic evening.“The decision to escalate to deadly force must be explained – it is unconscionable to think such a low-level offense could justify being shot to death by police. Bijan’s family, and the public, are entitled to due process and an explanation of why their son is dead that reflects full scrutiny of this situation at all levels of the justice system. We hope you will use all resources and personnel at your disposal to give this case a fair, honest look and decide what the proper form of justice for this tragedy should be.”Text of their letter follows below and a signed copy of the letter is available here.Dear Attorney General Garland:We write today regarding the 2017 fatal shooting of 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar by two United States Park Police (USPP) officers. Nearly five years after the fatal shooting of Bijan, it remains unclear to the Ghaisar family, to us, and to the broader community of the National Capital Region, how a traffic stop escalated to a fatal shooting. While the Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to pursue federal charges under the previous administration, we believe another look is warranted. Therefore, we respectfully request that DOJ reopen its investigation, pursue a vigorous analysis of the facts and law, and determine whether federal charges are merited.In November 2019, DOJ’s Civil Rights Division informed the Ghaisar family that the Department would not pursue a federal indictment against the officers under 18 U.S.C. § 242. In October 2020, a grand jury convened in the Fairfax County Circuit Court returned criminal indictments against the USPP officers on state charges of involuntary manslaughter and reckless use of a firearm. The officers’ attorneys asked for a change of venue from the Fairfax County Circuit Court to the Alexandria Division of the Eastern District of Virginia. The request was granted by a federal district judge, and then, in October 2021, the same judge granted a motion to dismiss the case. The dismissal was made on the grounds of Supremacy Clause immunity, meaning the district court did not engage in fact finding or an analysis of whether Bijan’s rights under the U.S. Constitution were violated. Then-Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring and Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano appealed the decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unfortunately, Virginia’s new Attorney General has chosen to drop the Commonwealth’s appeal, leaving this question unsettled. As Attorney General, you have rescinded memos that hampered the ability of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division to investigate police departments accused of misconduct, and, where appropriate, hold them accountable. You have worked to restore public trust after reports of political interference with investigations during the previous administration, which reportedly included cases under investigation by the Civil Rights Division. You authorized Justice Department and FBI personnel to cooperate with the Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney investigation, which returned state criminal indictments against the USPP officers, after such cooperation was denied by the previous administration. These actions are commendable, and we hope you will extend this improved oversight to the Ghaisar case.To summarize, the following major decisions were made without sufficient explanation: DOJ declining to file federal charges in 2019; DOJ declining to share physical evidence or the conclusions of its personnel with local attorneys; the federal district court’s dismissal of the case; and the Virginia Attorney General’s withdrawal from the appeal of the dismissal. Taken together, these decisions mean that Ghaisar’s family cannot be confident that the circumstances of Bijan’s death have received the rigorous legal scrutiny they deserve. As you know, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated this shooting in detail, interviewing more than 150 individuals (including law enforcement, civilian, and medical witnesses), analyzing evidence at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, and amassing an investigative file of some 10,000 documents. The focus of the Department’s investigation was to determine whether the officers had violated federal laws, in particular federal criminal civil rights statute 18 U.S.C. § 242. There is precedent for charges in a case like this, as DOJ’s Civil Rights Division pursued similar charges in the George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery cases.What’s more, we understand that Bijan Ghaisar’s family, through counsel, has requested that the Civil Rights Division revisit its decision declining to prosecute the officers who shot and killed him. We further understand that the Department is now in possession of sworn deposition testimony taken from briefs submitted in a civil action, which includes testimony from a senior U.S. Park Police officer and a Fairfax County Police officer that may cast new light on the events of that tragic evening. We want to be clear that we do not seek to pressure you to arrive at a decision that the evidence does not support. Rather, we simply seek an impartial review of the facts, including the newly adduced evidence from the civil proceeding. This case was only dismissed at the district level because of Supremacy Clause immunity, an issue that does not apply if the case is brought by the federal government. Supremacy Clause immunity would also not apply in other cases involving state, not federal, officers, which makes this case unique and not a pathway to reopen every case the DOJ may have declined to consider under prior administrations.  The decision to escalate to deadly force must be explained – it is unconscionable to think such a low-level offense could justify being shot to death by police. Bijan’s family, and the public, are entitled to due process and an explanation of why their son is dead that reflects full scrutiny of this situation at all levels of the justice system. We hope you will use all resources and personnel at your disposal to give this case a fair, honest look and decide what the proper form of justice for this tragedy should be.Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.Sincerely,###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-and-cornyn-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-document-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine,"Legislation Passed House Nearly Unanimously Last MonthWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), joined Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and a bipartisan group of his Senate colleagues today in introducing the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, which would ensure the U.S. is undertaking coordinated efforts to collect and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“Since Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine began, there has been overwhelming evidence that Russia has been committing serious war crimes, including indiscriminately targeting civilians,” said Senator Kaine. “This bipartisan bill is a necessary step to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. We must send a strong message to Putin and authoritarians around the world that these crimes will not be tolerated.”“The reports of Russian war crimes coming out of Ukraine are sickening, and we must ensure these atrocities are properly documented,” said Sen. Cornyn. “The House of Representatives passed this legislation nearly unanimously, and it is imperative that the Senate quickly do the same so we can prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law.”  The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act would establish that it is the policy of the United States to collect, analyze, and maintain evidence of war crimes and atrocities as defined in the U.S. Code committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and require the President to send a report to Congress within 90 days that provides details on U.S. government efforts to collect, analyze, and maintain that evidence. The report would also include information on steps the U.S. government is taking to make Russian commanders, troops, and leaders aware of efforts to collect evidence and identify those committing these atrocities. The bill focuses on the development and maintenance of evidence and does not specify any specific prosecution venue in which such evidence may be used.The House version of the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act was passed by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously, and later adopted by the full House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 418-7 on April 6, 2022.Kaine was one of the first members of Congress to call for a war crimes investigation, and applauded International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan’s announcement that he will launch an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Kaine and his colleagues also sent a letter urging U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (UN) Linda Thomas-Greenfield to introduce a resolution at the UN to remove Russia from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). The UN General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UNHRC on April 7.In addition to Kaine and Cornyn, the legislation was also introduced by Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rick Scott (R-FL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Angus King (I-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Gary Peters (D-MI), John Boozman (R-AR), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-resolution-to-commemorate-world-press-freedom-day,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), joined SFRC Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), and his Senate colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution to commemorate World Press Freedom Day and to recognize growing threats to press freedom and free expression worldwide. The bipartisan resolution reaffirms the vital role that a free and independent press plays in combatting the growing threat of authoritarianism, countering misinformation and disinformation, documenting human rights abuses, informing local and international audiences about public health crises, and furthering discourse and debate to advance healthy democracies.“This resolution sends the important message that press freedom remains essential and attempts to threaten the rights of journalists represent a serious affront to universal human rights,” said Senator Kaine. “Those principles must stay top-of-mind not only on World Press Freedom Day, but every day.” “This World Press Freedom Day, I am proud to once again be joined by my colleagues in recognizing the immense strength of an informed public and the importance of free press as a foundational pillar of democracy,” Chairman Menendez said. “As we witness more governments and malign actors across the world desperately try to muzzle the press to prevent the facts from reaching their own people, our support for the brave journalists risking everything to advance truth, transparency and accountability has never been more critical.  From Moscow to Washington D.C., free expression and a free and independent press are not only central to the health of a society, but are at the forefront of our efforts to protect and advance human rights and good governance worldwide.”“Journalists provide crucial insights into human suffering, corruption, and unrest worldwide,” Senator Rubio said. “Sadly, authoritarians such as those in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and Nicaragua are fiercely determined to censure any voice that challenges their own twisted narratives. I am proud to introduce this resolution and lend my unwavering support to the cause of press freedom worldwide.”Joining Kaine, Menendez, and Rubio in introducing the bill are Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jim Moran (R-KS), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and John Cornyn (R-TX).“On this World Press Freedom Day, we are confronted by the very real dangers facing professional journalists every day in war zones like Ukraine and repressive, autocratic regimes like Russia. The men and women who continue to report despite the hardships and risks, are guardians of the truth and democracy,” said Senator Cardin. “The United States is not immune from efforts to limit open reporting and spread disinformation, even violence against members of the media. We must continue to support journalists as they carry out their work to report the truth here at home and around the world.”“Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine is just the most recent reminder of how important it is to have a free press that can report on the truth and hold leaders accountable so the world can know the unvarnished facts on the ground,” Senator Coons said. “On World Press Freedom Day, we must recommit ourselves to standing up to autocrats who clamp down on independent journalists, working to ensure reporters around the world can do their jobs without fearing for their personal safety, and vigilantly defending first amendment rights here at home.”“A free press serves as a check on tyranny and authoritarianism around the globe. But recent attacks on the media and journalists have put this freedom under great threat. We must stand in solidarity with all those who report the truth and especially those who do so in the face of repressive regimes. No one should ever have their rights threatened for telling the facts,” said Senator Van Hollen.“Journalists in Ukraine risk their lives to help pull back the curtain on the atrocities being committed by the Russian military against civilians,” said Senator Moran. “While freedom of the press is enshrined in our Constitution, members of the press in many places around the world do not enjoy the same protections. We must do our part to cultivate freedom for the press around the globe.”“Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are both vital to democracy and we should do everything we can to protect it,” said Senator Tillis. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan resolution to raise awareness around this universal freedom and to recognize those journalists who deliver the truth to the people every day, especially those who lost their lives doing so.”Find a copy of the resolution HERE.###"

As the Senate debates additional legislation to support small businesses, Kaine will continue to make the case about why more support for Virginia small businesses is necessary.“Despite facing difficult challenges throughout COVID-19, small businesses have adapted to the pandemic, kept workers employed, and continued to support their communities,” said Senator Kaine. “Our small businesses are the backbone of our communities. I’m glad I’m able to share some examples of resilient small businesses across Virginia, many of which have used federal COVID relief to keep the lights on during the pandemic.”On April 20, Kaine announced his initiative to highlight small businesses, and Virginians nominated small businesses through an online portal. Below are some examples of small businesses across Virginia that Senator Kaine received via the portal:Since the onset of the pandemic, Senator Kaine has successfully pushed to pass legislation to help small businesses and nonprofits, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the December 2020 government funding bill, which included COVID-19 relief, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP). Virginia small businesses and nonprofits have received significant federal support including:Senator Kaine also pushed for permanent authorization of the Minority Business Development Administration, including his Reaching America’s Rural Minority Business Act, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.President Biden recently announced new steps to help small businesses, including increasing access to capital, expanding support for minority-owned small businesses, and investing in the Small Business Administration’s Community Navigator Program.###"

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-booker-beatty-introduce-legislation-to-increase-diversity-in-asset-management-strengthen-americans-retirement-security,"Legislation Would Promote Diversity Among Asset Management Firms That Invest Retirement AccountsWASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions (HELP) Committee, and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Too Narrow to Succeed Act, legislation to increase diversity in the asset management sector. The bill would instruct the Department of Labor (DOL) to conduct a survey of best practices for increasing the diversity of the asset management firms that invest American workers’ retirement plan funds. This legislation would enable public- and private-sector retirement funds to increase opportunities for women and people of color operating asset management firms and incorporate a greater range of perspectives when managing money, which would help mitigate financial risks. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, is introducing companion legislation in the House.""The most basic financial advice given to people is this—diversify your portfolio.  Diversification mitigates risk and improves long term returns,” said Senator Kaine. “But so often, our financial firms are not diverse in who is making investment decisions. If you have too narrow a perspective, you endanger the financial success of your clients.  This commonsense legislation will help ensure a safer financial future for workers and their families.”“Studies show that asset management firms run by women and people of color manage only a tiny fraction of investments,” said Senator Booker. “This gap is unacceptable and is not only a disservice to the fund managers, but to all the American workers and retirees whose savings would benefit from their expertise. This bicameral legislation will increase opportunities for women and minority-led firms to manage the retirement funds of American workers. At the same time, the bill will also ensure that we have a stronger, fairer, and more resilient financial system by diversifying which firms manage funds and mitigating financial risk.”“As chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, I have been examining the stark lack of diversity in the multitrillion-dollar asset management industry,” said Congresswoman Beatty. “The unfortunate reality is that wealth is still concentrated in the hands of a few financial asset managers and very little opportunity is given to minority- and women-owned firms, even though they perform as well or better than other firms. That is why I’m proud to join with Senator Tim Kaine to introduce the Too Narrow to Succeed Act in the House to shine a light on this diversity desert and expand opportunities for MWO asset management firms.”Women- and minority-owned firms are significantly underrepresented in asset management. A 2019 report found that minority and women-owned firms managed just 1.3 percent of the sector’s $70 trillion in assets under management. This severe underrepresentation also extends to employment within the industry. This is not due to a lack of diverse talent; multiple studies have shown that diverse-owned asset management firms have similar or better performance on returns as other firms. In fact, diverse-owned firms are overrepresented among top-performing firms.Specifically, the Too Narrow to Succeed Act would:In addition to Kaine and Booker, the legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Mark Warner (D-VA), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in the Senate.Supporting organizations include: the New America Alliance, the Diverse Asset Managers Initiative, the National Association of Investment Companies, the National Association of Securities Professionals, and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-kaine-applaud-congressional-passage-of-bipartisan-bill-to-commemorate-brown-v-board-of-education-sites-across-multiple-states-including-virginia,"The bill now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into lawWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine applauded House passage of their bipartisan legislation to commemorate historic sites that catalyzed litigation leading to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The bill, which unanimously passed the Senate earlier this month, now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The legislation will expand the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Kansas and designate National Park Service (NPS) Affiliated Areas in Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Specifically, it will recognize the Moton Museum, formerly the Robert Russa Moton High School, in Farmville, Virginia, where Barbara Johns led a protest against school segregation and demanded better conditions for Black students. This designation would help protect the site.The 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka transformed the United States, overruling Plessy v. Ferguson and striking down school segregation as unconstitutional. The Brown decision was a major catalyst of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.“Seventy-one years after Barbara Johns led a protest against school segregation at Moton High School in Farmville, we’re thrilled that our legislation to commemorate the Moton Museum and other historic sites associated with Brown v. Board of Education is headed to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law,” said Senators Warner and Kaine. “We’re proud to help preserve this history and recognize stories of courageous Americans who fought for justice and equality.”The creation of NPS Affiliated Areas in Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia for sites associated with the Brown v. Board of Education case and an expansion of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site to include the related sites in South Carolina provides an opportunity for these sites to tell their own under-recognized histories of the Brown v. Board of Education case.In collaboration with local partners and other stakeholders, the National Trust will continue its work to bring recognition to communities that fought for school integration and make connections between communities engaged in the fight for educational equity, past and present.The legislation was crafted in partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the Senate, the bill was led by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and supported by U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Tom Carper (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Roger Marshall (R-KS).Senators Warner and Kaine were also proud to secure $500,000 in dedicated funding for critical facility upgrades at the Moton Museum in Farmville through the Fiscal Year 2022 budget, and supported efforts to honor Barbara Johns as one of Virginia’s two statues in the United States Capitol.The bill text is available here.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-statement-on-virginias-decision-to-end-prosecution-of-us-park-police-officers-who-fatally-shot-bijan-ghaisar,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) released the following statement today after a federal judge dismissed all charges against the two U.S. Park Police officers involved in the November 2017 shooting of Bijan Ghaisar: “Our hearts go out to Bijan Ghaisar’s loved ones, who have spent more than four years searching for closure following the fatal shooting of Bijan by two U.S. Park Police officers. We are deeply disappointed by this decision by Attorney General Miyares to end Virginia’s pursuit of justice for Bijan and his family. This decision only stands to cause further harm to the Fairfax County community while preventing a heartbroken family from reaching the closure they desperately need. We will continue to support the Ghaisar family’s pursuit of justice for Bijan.”In January of 2018, Sens. Warner and Kaine, and Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), pushed the FBI for an update on the status of its investigation into the fatal 2017 shooting. In October of that year, Sen. Warner sent a letter to the head of the National Park Service (NPS) regarding the circumstances under which U.S. Park Police officers engaged with Bijan.In June of 2019, Sen. Warner along with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) decried the opaque and drawn-out nature of the review in letters to both the FBI and NPS. Two months later, the FBI provided a brief response, leaving many questions unanswered. In October, NPS provided a partial response, which prompted a follow-up letter from the Senators seeking more information.In November 2019, Sens. Warner and Grassley pledged to seek greater transparency and formally requested an FBI briefing on its investigation into the shooting – shortly after the FBI concluded its lengthy investigation without fully explain its findings, including why the two officers opened fire on Ghaisar. In February 2020, Sen. Warner voted against the nomination of Katharine MacGregor to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior, and in May, announced that he would place a hold on future Department of the Interior nominees until he receives adequate responses to his questions surrounding the Park Service’s handling of the shooting. Later that July, Sen. Warner pressed NPS for answers regarding its internal affairs investigation into the killing of Bijan, and the following month, he joined Sen.

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/statement-of-us-sens-warner-and-kaine-on-biden-administrations-decision-to-issue-tps-designation-for-cameroon,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) issued the following statement on the Biden administration’s decision to issue a Temporary Protected Status designation for Cameroon: “We are pleased to see the Biden administration recognize the humanitarian crisis threatening the people of Cameroon. This TPS designation will ensure that Cameroonians already living in the U.S. are not forced to return to a nation torn by unrelenting violence.” Sens. Warner and Kaine have been strong advocates for the TPS program. In November, they joined a number of their colleagues in calling on the administration to provide protections to Cameroonians fleeing violence. Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.  ###"

Early Head Start programs serve infants, toddlers under 3 years old, and pregnant women.Last week, Kaine, Hassan, and their Senate colleagues sent a letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urging the Administration to expand eligibility for Head Start programs to include families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Click here to read the letter.Kaine, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, has long advocated for increasing access to affordable child care and early childhood education programs. The American Rescue Plan, which Kaine and Senate Democrats passed in 2021, included $1 billion for Head Start, Early Head Start, and Early Head Start-Child Care programs. Kaine recently sent a letter to President Biden urging significant investments in child care, pre-kindergarten, and early childhood education.###"

Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced $2,642,519 in federal funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for the Virginia State Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS). This funding will go towards improving call and text response rates at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.“In the last two years of the pandemic, we have seen an increased demand for mental health services,” the senators said. “We are pleased that this funding will allow the Commonwealth to provide more timely assistance to those who are in crisis and in need of help.”Currently in Virginia, the DBHDS has an in-state answer rate of 83 percent. The goal of this funding is to increase answer rates at call centers to 90 percent by the end of the grant period. In addition, SAMSHA has a stated goal of answering 90 percent of calls within 15 seconds and 95 percent of calls within 20 seconds by the end of the grant period.This funding comes ahead of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s July transition from the current 10-digit number to a three-digit, 988, dialing code. With the switch, SAMHSA is expecting an increase in calls. In February of last year, Sens. Warner and Kaine announced funding for the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority to help expand access to and improve the quality of mental health and substance use disorder programs.This funding was provided through the American Rescue Plan which was supported by both Sens. Warner and Kaine.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/ahead-of-national-small-business-week-kaine-announces-initiative-to-highlight-virginia-small-business-success-stories,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine announced that his office is launching an initiative to highlight small business success stories from across the Commonwealth during National Small Business Week (May 1-7), a week dedicated to supporting small businesses across the United States.“Amid COVID-19, many small businesses have faced difficult challenges, and Congress responded by providing them with federal support,” said Senator Kaine. “As I’ve traveled around Virginia, I’ve heard from many small business owners about how federal COVID relief has helped them get through the pandemic – including restaurants that expanded outdoor seating or retail shops that expanded to e-commerce. As we approach National Small Business Week in May, I want to share more positive stories about the resilience of small businesses that have adapted to the pandemic, kept workers employed, and supported their communities. I encourage Virginians to nominate a small business to be featured on my website during National Small Business Week to shine a spotlight on Virginia success stories and highlight the importance of supporting our small businesses.”The ‘Virginia Small Business COVID Success Stories’ portal is now open and Virginians can nominate a small business to be highlighted here. Senator Kaine will share these success stories on his website on National Small Business Week.  Since the onset of the pandemic, Senator Kaine has successfully pushed to pass legislation to help small businesses, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the December 2020 government funding bill, which included COVID-19 relief, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP).Thanks to these COVID relief bills, around 155,000 Virginia small businesses and nonprofits received at least one Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan, totaling more than $18 billion, to keep workers on the payroll, and more than 78,000 Virginia small businesses received more than $7.6 billion in Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans. Through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, 378 Virginia businesses received over $200 million in funding. Through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, more than 2,700 Virginia businesses received over $650 million in funding. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) also created the Community Navigator Pilot Program to improve access to federal support for underserved small businesses. Senator Kaine also pushed for permanent authorization of the Minority Business Development Administration, including his Reaching America’s Rural Minority Businesses Act, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.The ARP that Kaine helped pass in March 2021 also included $7.2 billion for state and local governments in Virginia. This flexible funding is being used by many localities to support small businesses as well.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-calls-on-administration-to-expand-access-to-affordable-child-care,"Letter Urges HHS to Expand Head Start Programs to Lower-Income FamiliesWASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Tim Kaine joined Maggie Hassan and his colleagues in calling on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand eligibility for the Head Start Program to help ensure that more families in Virginia and across the country can access affordable, high-quality child care and preschool services.“We write to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education by using your existing authority to ensure that more young children and families are eligible for Head Start programs,” the Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.  The Senators continued, “For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible.”The Senators are specifically urging Secretary Becerra to expand eligibility for the program to include families that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).“It is clear that the eligibility criteria have become increasingly detached from the needs of children and families across the nation. Adding SNAP and WIC to the categorical eligibility list is a simple and swift action we can take to mitigate the increasing barriers that children and families face,"" said National Head Start Association Executive Director Yasmina Vinci.The letter was also signed by Senators Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Ben Ray Lujan (D-CA), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).The full text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Secretary Becerra, We write to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to expand access to affordable, high-quality early childhood education by using your existing authority to ensure that more young children and families are eligible for Head Start programs. For more than 55 years, Head Start programs across the country have provided vital early childhood education to children from low-income households. Additionally, Head Start programs provide wraparound support to parents and entire families, including health, wellness, and nutrition services. However, many families who could benefit from Head Start’s vital services earn slightly above the federal poverty level (FPL) and may be ineligible. Currently, families are eligible for Head Start programs when they meet up to 100 percent of the Department FPL, and 35 percent of slots can be designated for children and families earning up to 130 percent of the FPL. The FPL is equivalent to $27,750 for a family of four. Additionally, Section 645 [42 U.S.C. 9840] of the Head Start Act makes children eligible when their families receive certain public assistance, as defined by the Department. Under current Head Start requirements, this so-called “categorical eligibility” applies to families that receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), but does not include other public assistance programs used by some of our country’s most high-need families.We ask the Department to expand Head Start’s public assistance categorical eligibility to include children in families that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Adding SNAP and WIC will also underscore the critical links between nutrition support and early childhood education, and help connect pregnant WIC recipients to Early Head Start services at a critical and vulnerable juncture in their lives. We hope that the Department will make this change so that more high-need families and their young children can more easily access critical Head Start programs across the country. Thank you for your consideration.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/video-kaine-statement-ahead-of-15th-anniversary-of-virginia-tech-shooting,"Video remarks are available hereWASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Tim Kaine issued the following statement today ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Virginia Tech shooting, which killed 32 people and left 17 more injured on April 16, 2007:“Today, I'm thinking about the beautiful members of the Virginia Tech community whose lives were tragically cut short 15 years ago. These Virginians had so many dreams left to accomplish, and so much life ahead of them. I’m holding their loved ones in my heart.“I’m also thinking about how Virginia Tech has shown again and again that we have it in our power to band together during tough times and support one another. I’m still inspired by the Hokie Nation’s spirit that I saw in the wake of this horrific tragedy.“At the time, the Virginia Tech shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States. Since then, the Las Vegas and Orlando shootings have taken even more lives too soon. Enough is enough. We must take commonsense steps to prevent the heartbreak caused by horrific acts of gun violence.”Kaine has long advocated for expanding access to mental health services and establishing universal background checks to make communities safer. In 2020, he introduced the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence Act, a bill to federally enact a series of commonsense gun violence prevention measures adopted by Virginia, including universal background checks. ###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-colleagues-push-for-urgent-investments-in-child-care,"Approximately 460,000 families are without reliable child care; 1 in 9 child care jobs have been lost since the start of the pandemicWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, has teamed up with more than 150 of his congressional colleagues to push for legislation to lower the cost of child care for families, expand access to pre-kindergarten, and invest in early childhood education.Citing the impacts of child care on the economy and the long-term success of children, the lawmakers voiced support for passing President Biden’s plan to reduce child care costs for families to seven percent of their annual income and provide universal pre-kindergarten to all 3- and 4-year-olds.“Addressing our nation’s child care crisis remains essential to boosting labor force participation among mothers, helping lower everyday expenses for families and child care providers who are facing higher costs due to inflation, and ensuring all children access the benefits of quality child care that support positive physical and brain development,” wrote the lawmakers in their letter to President Biden. “As you know, the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care are challenges facing too many families across the country.”“Now is the time to make additional comprehensive, long-term investments in affordable, high-quality child care to build on the critical but largely short-term investments made through the American Rescue Plan. It is clear that child care and early learning investments are an integral part of our nation’s strategy for supporting a robust economy, lowering costs for families, and ensuring the long-term success of our children. With your leadership and support, we are ready to make these investments a reality,” they continued.Kaine has long used his position on the HELP Committee to advocate for lowering the cost of child care and expanding access to early childhood education. Kaine has also worked with U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) to introduce the Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act, legislation that would strengthen access to affordable child care for military families.Full text of the letter follows below.###Dear President Biden:We write to thank you for your commitment to cutting the cost and increasing the supply of high-quality child care for families across the country. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate shortages, with parents unable to find child care and businesses struggling to find workers, contributing to supply chain bottlenecks and inflation. Addressing our nation’s child care crisis remains essential to boosting labor force participation among mothers, helping lower everyday expenses for families and child care providers who are facing higher costs due to inflation, and ensuring all children access the benefits of quality child care that support positive physical and brain development. We stand ready to work with you to enact legislation through reconciliation that ensures middle-class and working families do not spend more than 7 percent of their income on child care, expands access to pre-K, and invests in the early childhood workforce and infrastructure.As you know, the high costs of child care and the difficulty of finding quality, affordable child care are challenges facing too many families across the country. The annual price of center-based child care for an infant exceeds the annual cost of in-state tuition at a public four-year university in every region of the country.  In addition to overwhelming costs, approximately 460,000 families are without reliable child care because the child care sector has lost nearly 1 in 9 jobs since the start of the pandemic.  Low industry wages are driving these challenges, with the average child care worker earning a median hourly wage of $12.24, and nearly 25 percent of child care workers requiring another job just to afford basic needs.  Now is the time to make additional comprehensive, long-term investments in affordable, high-quality child care to build on the critical but largely short-term investments made through the American Rescue Plan. Relief funding has served as a critical tool for stabilizing child care programs and preventing widespread permanent program closures during the pandemic. However, a recent survey of early childhood educators found that 75 percent of respondents expect that the end of stabilization grants will have a negative effect on their programs.  Notably, 89 percent of respondents familiar with the House-passed provisions to ensure that working families do not spend more than 7 percent of their income on child care and that child care workers earn a living wage believe those investments will secure the future of their programs, while experts predict that families stand to save thousands of dollars a year.It is clear that child care and early learning investments are an integral part of our nation’s strategy for supporting a robust economy, lowering costs for families, and ensuring the long-term success of our children.  Lowering the cost of child care will allow working families to allocate money to other pressing family needs. Increasing child care industry wages and access to training will help with the recruitment and retention of child care professionals, creating and supporting millions of jobs for women, especially women of color.   Improving access to child care will help working parents rejoin the workforce. One study found that, as of May 2021, the pandemic forced more than 1 in 3 female caregivers to reduce their hours or leave the workforce, which the majority of women said they could not afford to do.  Experts predict that approximately 1 million more workers would be in the labor force today if the labor participation rate of mothers with young children could be raised to match the participation rate of women with school-age children.  With your leadership and support, we are ready to make these investments a reality.Thank you for your attention to this matter and we look forward to working together to enact legislation that supports America’s children, economy, and early learning and child care programs.Sincerely,"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-duckworth-markey-introduce-treat-long-covid-act-to-expand-access-to-treatment,"Legislation will expand access to long COVID clinics to treat patients in their own communitiesWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, Tammy Duckworth, and Edward J. Markey introduced the Targeting Resources for Equitable Access to Treatment for Long COVID (TREAT Long COVID) Act to increase access to medical care and treatment for individuals struggling with long COVID. The first-of-its-kind bill will fund the expansion of long COVID clinics and empower health care providers—including community health centers and local public health departments—to treat long COVID patients in their own communities. Companion legislation was introduced by Congressman Don Beyer and Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley and Lisa Blunt Rochester in the U.S. House of Representatives.“After talking to Virginians living with long COVID and meeting with medical providers across the Commonwealth, it’s clear we must do more to help people dealing with the long-term impacts of the virus,” said Senator Kaine. “I’m proud to support the TREAT Long COVID Act to ensure long COVID clinics have access to critical resources.”“Even if COVID-19 disappeared tomorrow, millions of Americans who contracted this disease—including people of color who continue to bear the brunt of this pandemic—would continue to suffer from long COVID, with symptoms ranging from heart palpitations to brain fog,” said Senator Duckworth. “A holistic approach to treatment is absolutely necessary, particularly for those communities who face the harshest barriers to obtaining healthcare. That’s one of the reasons why, as Democrats continue our work to make sure people have access to tests, vaccines and therapeutics, I’m proud to introduce the TREAT Long COVID Act with Senators Markey and Kaine and Congresswoman Pressley. It would help all those living with long COVID gain better access to medical care and treatment options in their communities so we can help save lives and make sure no one is left behind on the road to recovery.”“As we’ve learned, COVID-19 presents itself differently in different patients - some are asymptomatic, and others have serious and even fatal complications. This wide range of health impacts from COVID-19 is also true for patients dealing with Long COVID,” said Senator Markey. “There is no one-size-fits all approach to Long COVID treatment, which is why we must expand access to comprehensive, individualized care. The TREAT Long COVID Act provides funding for multidisciplinary Long COVID clinics, helping ensure patients are at the center of our approach to this illness that impacts so many.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with long COVID may experience a combination of symptoms, ranging from extreme fatigue and cognitive dysfunction or “brain fog,” to muscle pain and gastrointestinal issues, to difficulty breathing, insomnia, and heart palpitations. Although there is no official count of people suffering from long COVID, a conservative estimate of only ten percent of documented COVID-19 survivors could mean nearly 8 million people are impacted across the United States. Currently, there is no federal program focused on expanding treatment options for this unique and growing population. The absence of specialized support contributes to patients experiencing greater physical and mental anguish, disruption in employment and education, and reduced quality of life.The TREAT Long COVID Act would expand treatment for long COVID nationwide by:The TREAT Long COVID Act has been endorsed by the COVID-19 Longhauler Advocacy Project, Body Politic, Patient-Led Research Collaborative, Utah COVID-19 Long Haulers, Access Living, National Health Council, American Physical Therapy Association, Massachusetts ME/CFS & FM Association, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mbadika, Solve M.E., American Association on Health and Disability, and Lakeshore Foundation.In March 2022, Kaine introduced the Comprehensive Access to Resources and Education (CARE) for Long COVID Act – legislation to improve research on long COVID and provide resources for people with long COVID. A key provision of the bill passed out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee in March. The Biden Administration recently announced new efforts to advance progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment for people with long COVID, which includes provisions from Kaine’s bill.Full text of the legislation can be found here.

Warner and Tim Kaine applauded unanimous Senate passage of their bipartisan legislation to commemorate the historic sites that catalyzed litigation leading to the 1954 landmark Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The bill will expand the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Kansas and designate National Park Service (NPS) Affiliated Areas in Delaware, South Carolina, Kansas, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Specifically, the legislation would recognize the Moton Museum, formerly the Robert Russa Moton High School, in Farmville, Virginia, where Barbara Johns led a protest against school segregation and demanded better conditions for Black students.The 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka transformed the United States, striking down the separate-but-equal doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The Brown decision ended the practice of legalized segregation in educational facilities and was a major catalyst of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.“Seventy years ago, 16-year-old Barbara Johns led a walkout to protest school segregation alongside all 450 of her fellow Black classmates at the Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. Ms. Johns’ student-led demonstration spurred one of the five cases that would eventually head to the Supreme Court under the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit,” said Senator Warner. “As we honor Barbara Johns’ legacy in the halls of Congress with her statue, I’m proud to join this effort to commemorate the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site and further recognize the vital role played by the R.R. Moton School in Farmville in ending school segregation.”“In April 1951, Barbara Johns led her classmates in a protest to demand better conditions for Black students at the segregated Moton School in Farmville, Virginia. I’m proud the Senate passed our bipartisan bill to honor the Moton Museum and other historic sites connected to Brown v. Board of Education,” said Senator Kaine. “As we approach the 68th anniversary of this landmark ruling, we must continue to tell inspiring stories of Americans fighting for equality and recommit ourselves to upholding the principle of equal protection under the law.”The legislation was crafted in partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the Senate, the bill was led by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and supported by U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Tom Carper (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Roger Marshall (R-KS).“With the passage of the Brown v. Board National Historic Site Expansion Act to designate all of the sites associated with this monumental Supreme Court case, history is not just memorialized but also made whole,” said Paul Edmondson, President and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. “At the National Trust, we have been diligently working to reveal and amplify a more complete view of our national history and we’re pleased to have partnered with Senator Coons and Congressman Clyburn in this important work. The heroism of the communities, parents and schoolchildren who dared to demand equal access to education can now be properly celebrated through these historic places.”“This preservation process reveals how all history is truly made,” said Brent Leggs, Executive Director of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund. “So often it takes more than one great man, woman or even a single community to create change, despite the way the stories of history are often recounted. Actually, it requires many ‘ordinary people with extraordinary vision’ to move a society forward. We applaud those courageous attorneys, families, and activists, some known and others unknown, who put so much at risk to secure educational equality for all Americans. Thanks to our preservation partners, the full history of this landmark case will forever be memorialized and interpreted to inspire the next generation of social justice leaders.”“The Robert R. Moton Museum is excited to join with communities involved in the historic Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision. In seeking to become an affiliated area of the National Park Service, we know this affiliation will allow us the opportunity to better collaborate with other communities involved in the historic Brown decision as we work to ensure that countless individuals have the opportunity to know of the courage and sacrifice that citizens made towards equality in education,” said Mr. Cameron D. Patterson, Executive Director of the Robert R. Moton Museum in Farmville, Virginia. “The Moton Museum Board of Trustees, Moton Museum Community Council, and our partner institution Longwood University in offering their support towards this effort, recognize that the resources and benefits offered from this affiliation with the National Park Service will only strengthen our ability to fulfill our mission as a museum.”The creation of NPS Affiliated Areas in Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia for sites associated with the Brown v. Board of Education case and an expansion of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site to include the related sites in South Carolina provides an opportunity for these sites to tell their own uplifting, under-recognized stories of students, parents, and their allies who helped shape American society. Enactment of this legislation has the potential to appropriately recognize the sites associated with the other four court cases and help them to combine current uses with preservation and public education.  In collaboration with local partners and other stakeholders, the National Trust will continue their collective work to bring recognition to communities that fought for school integration, helping these sites to tell their own history of the Brown v. Board of Education case and make connections to other communities engaged in the fight for educational equity, past and present.On Wednesday, the bipartisan bill unanimously passed in the House Committee on Natural Resources. The House will soon consider the bill, and then it will go to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.  The bill text is available here.###"

In their letter, the Senators also push the Biden Administration to outline detailed steps the U.S. agency will take to support anticorruption efforts in Honduras.“As the Department of State plans for a U.S.-Honduras Strategic Dialogue, we write to express our support for U.S. efforts to engage with President Xiomara Castro’s administration on the importance of tackling endemic corruption in Honduras,” the Senators wrote. “In particular, we urge you to press the new Honduran government to take the concrete steps needed to restore Hondurans’ faith in their government.”Transparency International ranked Honduras 157 out of 180 countries on its 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index. For years, corruption in Honduras has led to increased irregular migration to the U.S. and a weakened economic environment that stalls the country’s potential for growth. In February 2022, President Xiomara Castro requested United Nations (UN) assistance to create the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH), an independent entity to combat corruption in Honduras — but more must be done.“In particular, we ask that the Department of State urge the Castro Administration, the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and the Honduran Congress to ensure the Commission has a strong mandate to root out corruption and impunity, receives the necessary funding to achieve its mission, endures beyond the current administration, and sufficiently consults with Honduran civil society organizations, who are key stakeholders in fighting corruption,” the Senators continued. “We also request your advocacy with the Honduran government to ensure the selection of an independent and well-qualified Commissioner. While President Castro’s request to the UN is an overall positive step, we recognize that significant and sustained efforts by her administration and the Honduran Congress will be critical to standing up the Commission and ensuring its long-term success.”As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Kaine has been deeply committed to cooperating with allies in Latin America to uphold the rule of law, address the root causes of migration, and enhance our partnerships in the region. In November 2021, Chairman Kaine held a SFRC subcommittee hearing on providing vaccines to Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the importance of U.S. engagement in the region. Additionally, Chairman Kaine and Ranking Member Rubio urged the Biden Administration to strongly advocate for a free, fair, and peaceful electoral process ahead of Honduras’ general election.The full text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Secretary Blinken: As the Department of State plans for a U.S.-Honduras Strategic Dialogue, we write to express our support for U.S. efforts to engage with President Xiomara Castro’s administration on the importance of tackling endemic corruption in Honduras. In particular, we urge you to press the new Honduran government to take the concrete steps needed to restore Hondurans’ faith in their government. Transparency International recently ranked Honduras 157th out of 180 countries on its Corruption Perceptions Index. Corruption in Honduras has led to increased irregular migration to the United States, lack of accountability for violence committed against ordinary Hondurans, and a weakened economic environment that stalls Honduras’ potential for growth. Congress continues to provide robust assistance for Central America, including for anticorruption efforts, and we are pleased that the Biden Administration is prioritizing this issue with President Castro. Vice President Harris’s January visit to Honduras was President Castro’s first meeting with a foreign leader following her inauguration, and the Biden Administration’s announcement of over $1 billion in private sector investment in Honduras and the Central America region demonstrates U.S. commitment to the Honduran people. We welcome President Castro’s formal request to the United Nations in February 2022 calling for assistance to create the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (CICIH). We also recognize the Honduran Congress’s March 1 repeal of the Ley de Secretos, or State Secrets Law, which is an important step to promoting transparency within the Honduran government. We also applaud the Honduran government’s separate arrests of ex-President Juan Orlando Hernandez and former police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares for extradition to face drug trafficking charges here in the U.S. As you are well aware, strengthening the rule of law in Honduras, including by supporting an independent judiciary free from political influence, is important to ensuring that citizens have confidence in their government and that businesses can compete on a level playing field.We strongly urge you to work closely with the Castro Administration to ensure the incorporation of lessons learned from prior commissions. In particular, we ask that the Department of State urge the Castro Administration, the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and the Honduran Congress to ensure the Commission has a strong mandate to root out corruption and impunity, receives the necessary funding to achieve its mission, endures beyond the current administration, and sufficiently consults with Honduran civil society organizations, who are key stakeholders in fighting corruption. We also request your advocacy with the Honduran government to ensure the selection of an independent and well-qualified Commissioner. While President Castro’s request to the UN is an overall positive step, we recognize that significant and sustained efforts by her administration and the Honduran Congress will be critical to standing up the Commission and ensuring its long-term success. Establishing the necessary legislative framework to create and sustain the Commission and protecting the independence of key Honduran investigators, prosecutors, and judges will not be easy. Nonetheless, these steps are vital to empowering the Commission to confront the entrenched interests of corrupt actors backed by drug traffickers and criminal organizations. Given that the Commission’s activities are likely to elicit backlash and retribution, our collective support is imperative, especially when the Commission begins making substantive progress. Given the importance of these efforts, we request that the Department provide our offices with a briefing regarding specific actions the Biden Administration will take to sustain anticorruption efforts in Honduras following the Strategic Dialogue. Over the years, the United States has supported efforts to mitigate factors driving irregular migration from Honduras to the U.S., including through predecessor organizations such as the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, whose work led to the indictment of over 100 corrupt officials and the creation of anti-corruption courts that have strengthened the rule of law in Honduras. Today, we express our support for this new entity and urge the Department to help ensure that critical foundational steps are taken to guarantee its independence and effectiveness, especially ahead of next year’s Supreme Court and Attorney General selection processes. Each of these will be fundamental to promoting the rule of law and helping Honduran citizens find safety and opportunity in Honduras. Rampant corruption has been a longtime scourge in Honduras, holding back the dynamism of the Honduran people and impeding the country’s social, economic, and political development. We must seize this window of opportunity to make overdue progress on this critical issue.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-applauding-senate-confirmation-of-supreme-court-justice-ketanji-brown-jackson,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after voting to confirm Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court:“I am so glad to have helped confirm Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court and to now be able to call her Justice Jackson. Justice Jackson’s dedication to liberty and justice for all, her impressive list of achievements, and her excellent legal expertise will be of great value to the Court.“Justice Jackson will also be the first African American woman on the Court, and she will bring a Court that had never had a woman member when I started law school to a Court where four of the nine members are women. Her confirmation is powerful evidence of the capacity we have as a nation to come closer and closer to the ideal of equality articulated as our moral North Star in the opening phrase of the Declaration of Independence and engraved over the Court’s entrance as ‘equal justice under law.’“Justice Jackson is superbly qualified for this important post, and I believe that her knowledge, skills, and background – especially her work as a trial judge – will be invaluable in deciding cases that have an immense impact on all Virginians and Americans.”Kaine practiced as a civil rights lawyer for 17 years with cases in state and federal trial and appellate courts, including the United States Supreme Court. He also taught constitutional law and legal ethics at the University of Richmond Law School.###"

Warner (D-VA), as well as the Virginia congressional delegation, today in calling on the U.S. Department of Commerce to consider Virginia for future locations of major semiconductor production and research facilities — as efforts to fund the CHIPS for America Act continue.In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, the lawmakers urged the Department to recognize the role Virginia can play in strengthening the American semiconductor industry and creating new jobs in this key sector. Specifically, they called on Secretary Raimondo to consider Virginia as the site for the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) and National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP) — two initiatives established by the CHIPS for America Act that would be funded by legislation currently under consideration by Congress. In their letter, the Virginia Members also outlined Virginia’s longstanding leadership in the semiconductor industry, as well as the reasons why Virginia’s economy would be best suited for these new centers.“Thank you for your work to strengthen American semiconductor manufacturing, and the Department of Commerce’s efforts with Congress to pass the CHIPS for America Act. As Congress works to fully fund the important programs authorized by the law, we write to express our strong support for considering Virginia for sites to establish the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), and other federal investments in semiconductor research and manufacturing,” said the lawmakers.The members continued, “Virginia’s leading technology workforce and semiconductor manufacturing presence make the Commonwealth an ideal location for future federal investments in semiconductor research and manufacturing. Virginia has the second highest concentration of technology workers in the US, and net technology employment in Virginia grew by more than 27,000 jobs between 2010 and 2019. Virginia also has strong education infrastructure, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) degrees and credentials. In 2019-20, Virginia’s public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,869 degrees and certificates in areas such as health care, business, education, information technology and other demand fields.”Virginia is already home to multiple shovel-ready sites that are ready to support new semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development. This preparation was outlined by the Henrico Economic Development Authority and the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors backing this Spanberger-Warner effort to secure these sites.“We are ready. Thanks to the hard work of Rep. Spanberger and Sen. Warner to move the CHIPS Act forward, Henrico and the Commonwealth of Virginia are poised for semiconductor investment.  We have a long history of innovation in the semiconductor industry, and with our robust infrastructure, shovel ready sites, and talented workforce we are ready to meet the needs of the semiconductor industry,” said Anthony J. Romanello, Executive Director, Henrico Economic Development Authority.“Securing advanced manufacturing is critical to growing local, regional and state economies, which is why Chesterfield has taken a strategic approach to be ready when opportunities knock. This expands into our prepared and ready workforce and streamlined planning and permitting processes, which make it easy to do business in Chesterfield. We’ve worked with our economic and community development professionals to determine what’s needed and where, and we’re positioning Chesterfield to be a desired and leading location in attracting technology and other advanced manufacturing to the Commonwealth. We appreciate Sen. Warner and Rep. Spanberger for supporting this effort in Virginia,” said Chris Winslow, Chairman, Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors.The letter was also signed by U.S. Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA-08), Ben Cline (R-VA-06), Gerry Connolly (D-VA-11), Bob Good (R-VA-05), Morgan Griffith (R-VA-09), Elaine Luria (D-VA-02), A. Donald McEachin (D-VA-04), Bobby Scott, (D-VA-03), Jennifer Wexton (D-VA-10), and Rob Wittman (R-VA-01).The letter can be found here and below.Dear Secretary Raimondo,Thank you for your work to strengthen American semiconductor manufacturing, and the Department of Commerce’s efforts with Congress to pass the CHIPS for America Act. As Congress works to fully fund the important programs authorized by the law, we write to express our strong support for considering Virginia for sites to establish the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), and other federal investments in semiconductor research and manufacturing.We appreciate the Department of Commerce’s leadership in convening business leaders and government officials to address supply chain disruptions and semiconductor chip shortages. These issues are at the heart of rising prices that are impacting Americans’ pocketbooks. Additionally, investing in domestic semiconductor manufacturing is crucial for US global competitiveness and national security. As such, we strongly support robust funding for the CHIPS Act, and believe Virginia is uniquely positioned to effectively leverage federal investments to strengthen domestic manufacturing.Virginia’s leading technology workforce and semiconductor manufacturing presence make the Commonwealth an ideal location for future federal investments in semiconductor research and manufacturing. Virginia has the second highest concentration of technology workers in the US, and net technology employment in Virginia grew by more than 27,000 jobs between 2010 and 2019.

In 2019-20, Virginia’s public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,869 degrees and certificates in areas such as health care, business, education, information technology and other demand fields.In addition to the Commonwealth’s highly prepared workforce, there are several shovel-ready sites in Virginia that are eager to support new manufacturing, research, and development. Multiple leading semiconductor manufacturing companies, such as Micron Technology and GeneSiC, have already chosen Virginia for large investments, such as for new semiconductor manufacturing plants, or expanding operations. Virginia has been named the “Top State for Business” five times since CNBC began ranking states for doing business in 2007, most recently ranking first in 2021. For these reasons, Virginia is strongly suited to be a responsible steward of federal investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, and promote U.S. global competitiveness in this key sector.We continue to strongly support the Department’s work in promoting domestic semiconductor production and research, and we urge you to consider Virginia for the NSTC, NAPMP, and other investments as the Department implements the CHIPS for America Act. Thank you for your full and fair consideration of this request, consistent with applicable agency guidelines. ###"

The Ambassador Oversight and Transparency Act would require the President to detail how a nominee’s language skills, foreign policy expertise, and experience have prepared that nominee to effectively lead U.S. diplomatic efforts in the specific country in which they are nominated to serve, and require increased disclosures of a nominee’s contributions to political campaigns.“Our ambassadors are critical to building and maintaining the relationships we need to protect not only our own safety and security, but that of our allies around the world,” said Senator Kaine. “While we have had excellent ambassadors from outside the Foreign Service, I remain concerned by the growing trend of presidents nominating campaign donors who may not have the expertise necessary for these positions. Requiring presidents to justify their nominations and be more transparent about a nominee’s political campaign contributions will ensure that the men and women of the State Department are led by ambassadors of outstanding integrity and ability.”  “Ambassadors are crucial to American diplomacy, dedicating their service to protecting the interests and security of the United States,” said Senator Booker. “Given the importance of their role, we must increase oversight and transparency within our nomination process and ensure that those nominated for these positions are adequately qualified to serve and represent our country abroad.”More specifically, the legislation would:The Biden Administration has said it plans to restore the historic balance of about 70 percent of ambassador positions allocated to career diplomats with the remainder offered to political appointees, which is in line with historic averages.The bill is endorsed by the American Foreign Service Association.Full text of the legislation is available here.###"

Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) announced the designation of $232,426,060 in federal funds for Virginia transit systems. This largest-ever investment in Virginia transit was authorized by the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act negotiated by Sen. Warner and supported by Sen. Kaine. The funding will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration formula programs and distributed to transit systems throughout the Commonwealth.“Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Virginia continues to receive funding for much-needed transportation upgrades,” the senators said. “This investment in the Commonwealth’s public transit will make lives easier for every Virginian who relies on public transportation while creating good-paying jobs for workers.”  Because of this record investment in transit, Virginia is set to receive a 28.7 percent increase in funds over last year’s total apportionment.In addition to the $232 million guaranteed for Virginia, the Commonwealth is expected to receive a portion of the $280,270,139 in funding designated to the D.C. Metro Area, which includes Northern Virginia, D.C., and Maryland. This funding will be divided across transit agencies and localities within the area.###"

She'll be the first African American woman on the court. And she'll move a court that had never had a woman member when I started [law school] to a court where four of the nine members are women,”  Kaine said during his remarks. “What powerful evidence of the capacity we have as a nation to come closer and closer to the equality ideal that was articulated as our moral North Star in the opening phrase of the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a Virginian in 1776. So, I celebrate the history-making nature of this appointment, but it's not the reason for my support.”“I support Judge Jackson's nomination because of her stellar academic credentials, her prestigious judicial clerkships, her dedicated service as an attorney and member of the United States Sentencing Commission, her well-respected tenure as a federal trial and apellate judge, and the multiple attestations that she has received attributing to her fairness and to her character,” Kaine continued.Senator Kaine met with Judge Jackson on April 4. Kaine and a bipartisan group of his colleagues previously voted to confirm Judge Jackson to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2021.Judge Jackson has also served as a Judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

Circuit, to the Supreme Court:“Given the gravity of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, my practice is to withhold any decision on a nominee — regardless of my previous positions on that nominee for other judgeships — until I carefully review their qualifications, observe their appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and personally meet with them.“I have done so and now offer my unqualified support for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.“Judge Jackson’s qualifications speak for themselves: stellar academic credentials, prestigious judicial clerkships, a strong track record as a federal public defender, distinguished service as a federal trial and appellate judge, and multiple attestations to her character and fairness. She would make history as the first African-American woman to serve on the nation’s highest court.“I take particular note of the fact that her confirmation would lead to a Court with four women justices. When I started law school, there had never been a woman justice. The fact that such a positive change has occurred during my professional career gives me hope about our progress toward the ideal of equality that is our nation’s moral North Star.“I am particularly drawn to two attributes that Judge Jackson will bring to the Court.“She will be the first public defender to serve on the Supreme Court. Other current justices have served as state or federal prosecutors. That expertise is needed. But in a nine-member body that so often grapples with questions at the heart of our criminal justice system, a former public defender will have much to add to the collegial search for the best resolution of cases that come before the Court. “She will also join Justice Sotomayor as the second trial judge on the Court. A significant portion of the Court’s caseload concerns how trials should be conducted to maximize fair results and public confidence in the judicial system itself. Trial judges have a unique set of responsibilities — empaneling and instructing jurors, ruling on evidentiary questions, determining whether to grant preliminary injunctions, making witness credibility calls, considering dispositive motions, handling discovery disputes, rendering judgment, imposing sentences.  These are weighty matters and many underestimate how difficult their work is.“As Governor of Virginia, I had the opportunity to appoint three appellate judges to the Virginia Supreme Court and Virginia Court of Appeals. As someone who tried many cases in state and federal courts over the course of my 17-year career as a practicing lawyer, I always chose someone who had been a respected trial judge because of the skills and knowledge that trial judges bring to the appellate bench.“In our interview, Judge Jackson told me that her work in the district court would help her make Supreme Court pronouncements ‘workable’ for the lower court judges who will put those rulings into effect. It’s a humble word. It’s also a compelling one.“Good trial judges know how to administer justice. I am confident that Judge Jackson will use that experience to help administer justice from the Supreme Court.”In addition to practicing as a civil rights lawyer for 17 years, including before the United States Supreme Court, Kaine also taught constitutional law and legal ethics at the University of Richmond Law School.Photos of Kaine’s meeting with Judge Brown Jackson yesterday are available here.###"

Warner and Tim Kaine joined Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow and a bipartisan group of their colleagues in introducing the Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, which would grant the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) additional flexibility so that schools and summer meal sites can stay open and improve access to free, healthy meals for children. The additional flexibility would mean less red tape and more options for families, including by allowing families to pick up a week’s worth of meals or having meals delivered to their home on the school bus. These flexibilities have been crucial to feeding students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With 90% of schools still facing many challenges as they return to normal operations, these flexibilities would give schools much-needed support to keep kids fed.“Every child, regardless of where they live, deserves nutritious meals,” said Senators Warner and Kaine. “Ensuring that school districts have the flexibility and federal resources they need to keep feeding their students is essential to our fight to end childhood hunger in America. This legislation will help us do that.”“We should make it easier for kids to get the meals they need – not harder. Our bill cuts red tape and keeps the priority on giving children the healthy meals they need and deserve,” said Senator Stabenow. “As we come out of this pandemic, schools are doing their best - but it takes time for them to transition back to their operations before COVID. We can’t let hungry kids get caught in the middle. Without this support, up to 30 million kids who get food at school will see their essential breakfast and lunch meals disrupted. And millions of hungry kids who rely on summer meals may have nowhere to go to get food.”More specifically, the bipartisan Support Kids Not Red Tape Act would:Since the pandemic began, Warner and Kaine have secured federal funding to expand access to food assistance for students, including successfully pushing USDA to make food distribution policies more flexible for Virginia’s families. They also helped secure Virginia’s request to operate a Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program to ensure children have access to healthy food while at home. In March 2022, Warner and Kaine sent a letter urging USDA to issue guidance to better address the growing food insecurity crisis among college students.Kaine has also introduced bipartisan legislation, including his Assisting Community Colleges in Educating Skilled Students (ACCESS) to Careers Act and Geteway to Careers Act, that would address food insecurity at community colleges.In addition to Warner, Kaine, and Stabenow, this legislation was also cosponsored by 49 members of the Senate, including: Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Richard J.

Warner and Tim Kaine announced $65,591,635 in federal funding for Virginia to make homes more energy efficient and help lower utility costs. The funding will be awarded through the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which was expanded under the bipartisan infrastructure law‘s historic federal investments in upgrading our power infrastructure and reducing carbon emissions.Eligible organizations will be able to apply for funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law in the coming weeks. This federal funding will allow the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) to partner with organizations across the Commonwealth who provide weatherization services to make homes more energy efficient. The program will save an average of $372 in annual energy savings for American families. It will also help low-income families—who spend an average of 13.9% of their income on energy costs—save money.“Virginia continues to benefit from the bipartisan infrastructure law,” said the Senators. “We’re glad this funding will be used to make homes more energy efficient, help Virginia families save money by lowering their utility costs, and improve the health and safety of communities.”This funding can be used for a variety of mechanical, building, electric and water, health and safety, and education measures, such as upgrading heating or cooling systems, installing energy efficient light sources, and installing insulation. 8,487 Virginia homes have been weatherized since 2010.In addition to the $3.5 billion in funding for states across the country from the infrastructure law, the FY 2022 government funding bill included $313 million across the country for WAP. For information on how to apply, click here.

In response, the UN has released an appeal to international donors for $4.4 billion to meet the humanitarian needs in Afghanistan - the largest single country appeal in history. In advance of the high-level pledging event for the country scheduled for March 31, we urge the administration to work closely with our international partners to generously commit and rapidly deliver funds that will help save lives in Afghanistan,” the senators wrote.The senators continued: “As the economy craters, the suffering of the Afghan people deepens. Today, 95% of households in Afghanistan don’t have enough food to eat. By this summer, 97% of Afghans will be living below the poverty line—trying to survive on less than two dollars a day. With nine million people just one step away from famine, this humanitarian crisis could kill more Afghans than the past 20 years of war.”“We understand that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is driving unprecedented levels of suffering of the Afghan people, and urge robust oversight to ensure that all assistance gets to the people of Afghanistan. Without the full participation of female humanitarian staff in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all humanitarian services, aid will not be delivered in a manner that upholds humanitarian principles, and will be unable to reach the most vulnerable Afghan women and girls in the hardest to reach areas. The Taliban must allow unhindered humanitarian access, safe conditions for humanitarians, independent provision of assistance to all vulnerable people, and freedom of movement for aid workers of all genders,” the senators wrote.The senators concluded: “Amid crises in Yemen, Ukraine, Ethiopia, Syria, and elsewhere, the international community must not lose focus on Afghanistan. We encourage you to press key international donors to make up the current $3.8 billion funding deficit for humanitarian programs and to expediently deliver such funds. These include countries in the region and members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as likeminded partners who have generously supported Afghanistan in years past. Finally, we encourage you to work closely with our allies in the region to ease any restrictions on humanitarian access in Afghanistan to enable humanitarian partners to reach people in need.”U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Edward Markey (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) also signed the letter.Full text of the letter is available here and below.Dear Secretary Blinken and Administrator Power,The humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is deepening, with more than half the population - 23 million people - in need of assistance. In response, the UN has released an appeal to international donors for $4.4 billion to meet the humanitarian needs in Afghanistan - the largest single country appeal in history. In advance of the high-level pledging event for the country scheduled for March 31, we urge the administration to work closely with our international partners to generously commit and rapidly deliver funds that will help save lives in Afghanistan.Even prior to the Taliban’s takeover, Afghanistan’s economy suffered from longstanding structural problems. The country was highly dependent on external aid, which financed 75% of public expenditures and were equal to about 40% of the country’s GDP. The Taliban’s takeover caused a pullback in foreign aid and strained the liquidity and solvency of Afghanistan’s financial sector. The IMF estimates that the country’s economy will contract up to 30% this year, and many of the senior officials and technical experts needed to provide sound economic management have fled the country. While humanitarian aid is critical to saving lives in the short-term, it cannot replace a functioning economy in Afghanistan. These underlying structural economic problems will take years to solve.As the economy craters, the suffering of the Afghan people deepens. Today, 95% of households in Afghanistan don’t have enough food to eat. By this summer, 97% of Afghans will be living below the poverty line—trying to survive on less than two dollars a day. With nine million people just one step away from famine, this humanitarian crisis could kill more Afghans than the past 20 years of war.Robust international commitments to support humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan are more critical now than ever. Last year, Afghanistan faced a 40% loss of wheat production due to drought and economic deterioration related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past month, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further raised the price of wheat in the global food market. The World Food Programme had previously depended on Russia and Ukraine for more than half of the wheat it provides to countries such as Afghanistan.We understand that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is driving unprecedented levels of suffering of the Afghan people, and urge robust oversight to ensure that all assistance gets to the people of Afghanistan. Without the full participation of female humanitarian staff in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all humanitarian services, aid will not be delivered in a manner that upholds humanitarian principles, and will be unable to reach the most vulnerable Afghan women and girls in the hardest to reach areas. The Taliban must allow unhindered humanitarian access, safe conditions for humanitarians, independent provision of assistance to all vulnerable people, and freedom of movement for aid workers of all genders.In the immediate aftermath of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, Congress passed a supplemental appropriations bill that included $915 million in humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. With that funding, Congress sent a strong signal that the United States must lead a robust response by the international community to the ongoing humanitarian crisis. We support the administration’s initial 2022 contribution of more than $308 million in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan on January 11th. At the upcoming pledging event on March 31st, we urge the administration to commit additional, substantial funding to the Afghanistan response as soon as possible to ensure vital assistance programs are not reduced or cancelled. A significant U.S. pledge is vital to encourage other countries to follow suit. Generous and timely investments, delivered to the right agencies on the front lines, are instrumental to saving lives and staving off famine in Afghanistan.Amid crises in Yemen, Ukraine, Ethiopia, Syria, and elsewhere, the international community must not lose focus on Afghanistan. We encourage you to press key international donors to make up the current $3.8 billion funding deficit for humanitarian programs and to expediently deliver such funds. These include countries in the region and members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as likeminded partners who have generously supported Afghanistan in years past. Finally, we encourage you to work closely with our allies in the region to ease any restrictions on humanitarian access in Afghanistan to enable humanitarian partners to reach people in need.Thank you for your urgent attention to this crisis, as the people of Afghanistan deserve our unwavering support.Sincerely,###"

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-senate-beginning-voting-rights-debate,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement after Senate Democrats successfully used current Senate procedure to begin debate on critical voting rights legislation after months of obstruction by Senate Republicans:“As a Senator sworn to protect and defend the Constitution who has lived through an attack on our constitutional form of government on January 6 and seen efforts to restrict voting rights across the country, I have concluded that debating and passing legislation that will protect the integrity of our electoral processes is of paramount importance to prevent any future assault on our democracy. The floor debate should be vigorous with an opportunity for colleagues to offer amendments to the bill.“The provisions in the voting rights bill are popular with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Virginia has made many of these changes and we have seen voter turnout increase, and that increased turnout led to the recent election of a Republican Governor. These changes wouldn’t harm either party, but they will benefit and safeguard our democracy.”Senate Democratic leadership opened debate on two major voting rights bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which have been incorporated into one bill as the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. Opening debate has not required any changes in Senate rules.Kaine, a former civil rights attorney, has long fought to protect voting rights and expand access to the ballot box.In September 2021, Kaine introduced the Freedom to Vote Act to improve access to the ballot for Americans, advance commonsense election integrity reforms, and protect our democracy from attacks. The Freedom to Vote Act contains provisions expanding voting by mail, early voting, and taking other steps to make voting easier and safer.Kaine is also an original cosponsor of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, introduced in October 2021. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore safeguards against potential restrictive changes to voting rules after the Supreme Court gutted those protections in its Shelby County decision in 2013.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-applaud-more-than-2-million-in-federal-funding-for-virginia-tribes-to-address-covid-19,"WASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, U.S. Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine applauded $2,008,250 in federal funding awarded to the Chickahominy Eastern Division and Nansemond Indian Nation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, which was extended under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, legislation Senators Warner and Kaine voted for in March 2021. The American Rescue Plan allocated more than $31 billion to Native American communities across the country, including funding which will benefit Virginia’s federally recognized tribes.“As the Omicron variant continues to create challenges for people across the Commonwealth, we’re glad to see that these federal dollars will provide critical relief for communities hit hard by the pandemic,” said the Senators. “This funding will help provide these tribes with services necessary to protect their health and safety.”The funding will be awarded as follows:In 2017, Senators Kaine and Warner led legislation to grant federal recognition to six Virginia tribes, including the Chickahominy and Nansemond tribes. After centuries of being denied federal recognition, the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act was signed into law on January 30, 2018, making it possible for these tribes to receive federal funding.In April 2021, Senator Kaine visited Nansemond Indian Nation to hold a roundtable with tribal members to discuss the challenges that the community has faced throughout the pandemic and encourage vaccinations.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-announce-virginia-to-receive-5368-million-for-bridge-repair,"Largest-ever investment in Virginia’s bridges is the result of the bipartisan infrastructure lawWASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) today announced the largest-ever federal investment in Virginia’s bridges, made possible by the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law negotiated by Sen. Warner and supported by Sen. Kaine. Virginia will receive $536.8 million over five years to address highway bridge needs, which include 577 bridges across the Commonwealth that are currently rated as being in “poor” condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.“We’re thrilled to announce this record amount of funding to fix aging bridges across Virginia,” said the senators. “Modernizing bridges will improve safety and support economic growth in every corner of the Commonwealth. Today’s announcement is one more reason we were proud to support the once-in-a-generation infrastructure investment that is improving lives and livelihoods across the country.”In July 2021, Sen. Warner joined Richmond officials for a tour of the Mayo Bridge, which was constructed in 1913 to cross the James River and is one of the hundreds of bridges across Virginia that are currently considered structurally deficient and expected to benefit from the investment announced today. Photos from that visit are available here.In December 2021, Sen. Kaine joined U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in Richmond and Henrico County to discuss how the $7.7 billion in federal funds Virginia expects to receive from the infrastructure bill will be used to repair and replace roads and bridges and improve public transportation.###"
https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-joins-senate-democrats-in-introducing-the-defending-ukraine-sovereignty-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine joined U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 24 of his Senate Democratic colleagues in introducing the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022, critical legislation to impose steep costs in the event of a renewed Kremlin invasion of Ukraine. As the Kremlin continues to engage in an unjustified military build-up along Ukraine’s border, the proposal by Senate Democrats to deter a military escalation sends a clear message that the United States is prepared to impose devastating consequences for Putin and the Russian economy if he goes down the path of re-invading Ukraine.Joining Chairman Menendez in introducing the legislation were Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 2022 would impose crippling sanctions on the Russian banking sector and senior military and government officials if President Putin escalates hostile action in or against Ukraine. The bill would also prohibit transactions on Russia’s primary and secondary sovereign debt and authorize sanctions on Russia’s extractive industries as well as on providers of specialized financial messaging services (e.g., SWIFT). To help meet urgent defense needs, the legislation calls upon the Departments of Defense and State to expedite transfer of defense articles to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities and authorizes $500 million in supplemental emergency security assistance to Ukraine in the event of a re-invasion by Russia. Lastly, the bill also expands U.S. efforts to counter Kremlin disinformation and strengthen ties with key regional partners facing Kremlin aggression.“Ukraine is a free and sovereign nation, and its people have the right to live without fear of invasion and subjugation by regional bullies like Russia,” said Senator Kaine. “President Putin should know by now that the U.S., along with our NATO and European allies, will always stand with our democratic partners. This legislation provides the Biden administration additional tools and support to check Russian aggression against Ukraine, and facilitate a peaceful de-escalation of tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border.” “This legislation makes it absolutely clear that the U.S. Senate will not stand idly by as the Kremlin threatens a re-invasion of Ukraine,” said Chairman Menendez. “As the Biden administration seeks a diplomatic path forward this week in Europe to avoid another bloody escalation in Ukraine, I find little reason to believe that Putin is negotiating in good faith nor do I believe he has any newfound respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is precisely why we are coming together to send a clear message—Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe. Ultimately the most effective sanction on Russia is a strong and unified Ukraine, and I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues so that we can provide the people of Ukraine the type of support they need to confront the bully in Moscow.”“Today, Vladimir Putin’s aggression is the greatest risk to the stability of Europe. Whether it is in cyberspace or as Putin orders a massive military buildup on the eastern border of Ukraine, the United States must make clear that an invasion of Ukraine will have severe consequences. Chairman Menendez’s comprehensive legislation serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and forcefully imposing crippling sanctions on Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation government, any Russian actors determined to be responsible for an invasion, and the corrupt infrastructure that props up Putin’s regime,” said Senate Majority Leader Schumer.“The basic human desire to be free and democratically choose one’s leaders is apparently too much for Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who is now threatening a further massive military invasion of Ukraine.  It’s not enough that Putin denies the Russian people their basic freedoms.  He’s determined to eradicate similar aspirations on Russia’s border in a transparent scheme to protect his own undemocratic regime,” said Senator Durbin. “As such, I am proud to join Senator Menendez’s legislation that would impose historic sanctions if Russia further invades Ukraine.  The bill’s approach is sweeping and clear. It also includes a notable provision to provide greater economic and security support to the Baltic states, including as Lithuania continues to face considerable economic and diplomatic coercion from China.”“We need legislation that addresses the political situation we face today in response to increasing Russian aggression – not last year or two years ago. The dynamics changed and so must our strategy. That is what this bill would do,” said Senator Shaheen. “There is no question that there is a bipartisan determination in the United States to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from becoming operational and used as a weapon by Putin against our European allies. This legislation upholds that resolve without undermining the diplomatic progress being made. Moreover, it would empower the administration with real teeth to inflict punitive damage against the Kremlin, enhance regional partnerships and bolster military aid for Ukraine to best defend itself. Putin’s escalatory behavior against Ukraine and other American partners in Eastern Europe demands that we evolve our response – we cannot use yesterday’s plans for crises we face today.”“We have a window of opportunity to use deterrence and diplomacy to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty,” said Senator Coons. “This bill would expedite assistance to Ukraine, counter Russian disinformation, and impose punishing sanctions should Russia choose to invade its neighbor. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important bill through the legislative process.” “The Senate has wasted a lot of time talking about proposals that will do nothing to change Russia’s behavior. This bill offers real solutions intended to deter Russia from further aggression, while also countering their misinformation efforts throughout the region and increasing security assistance to Ukraine. This is the best course for U.S. national security interests,” said Senator Murphy.“Russia must see that there will be a strong and coordinated response to any further aggression towards Ukraine,” said Senator Markey. “While making clear the consequences of blatant and unwarranted aggression by Russia, the United States and our allies should continue to press for de-escalation in the region. This legislation will work in concert with the actions the Biden administration has already taken to demonstrate that we will continue to support Ukraine and its sovereignty.”“Russia must understand that any further aggression against Ukraine will be met by severe penalties. The triggering of comprehensive and coordinated sanctions can be an effective means of deterrence. This bill makes crystal clear in advance that Putin and Russia will face punishing consequences if he makes the drastic miscalculation to invade Ukraine and further infringe on its sovereignty,” said Senator Van Hollen.“As Russia continues its aggression towards Ukraine, we must take action to show our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and right to independence. I’m proud to join Senator Menendez in introducing the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act, which will hold Russia accountable with tough, comprehensive sanctions if the Kremlin reinvades or escalates hostilities against our Ukrainian partners,” said Senator Carper.“The bellicose actions and rhetoric that we have seen from Vladimir Putin in recent months represent the latest in a long string of offensive actions by the Russian President. Russia’s armed buildup around Ukraine – on top of their continued occupation of eastern Ukraine and Crimea – represents a serious threat not just to Ukraine, but to the broader peace and stability of Europe, and of the world,” said Senator Warner. “This bill reinforces the message that the Biden administration must be conveying to Russia in face-to-face meetings this week – that accelerated aggression towards Ukraine will only strengthen U.S. assistance for our Ukrainian partners, reinvigorate NATO’s collective defense posture, and bring about devastating consequences for the Russian economy.“Putin’s attempt to undermine Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty is unacceptable,” said Senator Bennet. “Our bill outlines comprehensive and severe consequences, including crippling sanctions, for any further aggression. We must continue to strengthen ties with our regional allies and partners to ensure freedom and stability in Ukraine and across Europe, as well as support the Ukrainian people’s desire for democracy.”""It's critical to our national interest that the United States stands with its friends and allies against authoritarian aggression. I am supporting this legislation because it is necessary to address Russia’s continued encroachment into Ukraine and hold them accountable. It sets clear guidelines for broad sanctions while providing needed assistance to Ukraine. I believe it is the right approach to strengthen U.S. ties with key regional partners,” said Senator Gillibrand.“This bill would impose crippling, crushing sanctions if Russia acts on its threats to invade Ukraine. We cannot stand idly by while Russia threatens a sovereign neighbor with military force. Strong, targeted measures to deter unprovoked aggression must be taken,” said Senator Blumenthal. “Russian aggression against Ukraine must be met with severe consequences. We also must remain committed to our Transatlantic unity and stand united against Russian threats to the security and sovereignty of Ukraine and the region. I am proud to support this bill as it sends Russia a clear message: escalate hostilities against Ukraine and face crippling sanctions on a wide range of sectors, including the energy industry and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” said Senator Heinrich.""We need to be clear-eyed about the threat Russia poses and this bill takes meaningful steps to counter Russian aggression and stand with our partners in Eastern Europe. As we continue to see tensions rise on the Ukrainian-Russian border, the U.S. must make sure that Ukraine can defend itself and that we stand against any threat of invasion by Russia,” said Senator Hassan.Find a copy of the bill text HERE.The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty ActMandatory and Additional Sanctions in the Event of Renewed Invasion: If an affirmative determination made by the president that Russia has engaged in a renewed invasion or escalation of hostilities, the Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act triggers a cascade of mandatory sanctions on Russia’s political and military leadership, financial institutions, extractive industries, and Nord Stream 2, outlined below.Expediting Security Assistance to UkraineCountering Kremlin Aggression against Ukraine and Eastern European Allies###"

Warner and Tim Kaine (both D-VA) today announced $500,000 in federal funds for the Town of Dungannon to go towards improvements to its water distribution system.The improvements include the installation of 13,840 linear feet of waterline at scattered locations to improve water service for 42 households and 25 businesses. The new waterline will also increase water accountability and create hydraulic efficiencies in the distribution system.“This project is vital for the Town of Dungannon and will provide businesses and households access to reliable and safe water,” the senators said. “These funds will help to finally replace a system that has dangerously allowed for leaks and line breaks to contaminate public water.”The funds come from the Appalachian Regional Commission and will be combined with $883,563 in state funding allocated to the project.Replacement of the waterlines will reduce system-wide water loss, replace inoperable valves, lower maintenance costs, and increase pressure. Additionally, households and businesses in the project service area will have access to a more reliable water infrastructure capable of supporting new opportunities for economic development.###"

Dr. Fauci told Kaine that there is a 17 times greater chance an unvaccinated individual will be hospitalized and a 20 times greater chance that an unvaccinated individual will lose their life to COVID, compared with a vaccinated individual.Kaine also pressed Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about what the CDC is doing to provide greater access to free COVID tests. Kaine asked Dr. Walensky, “I’d like to ask you a question about access to testing and in particular, what is the CDC doing to make sure that testing capacity is robust in rural America and also among community health centers in disadvantaged parts of the country?” Dr. Walensky talked about the CDC’s work with FEMA to increase the number of federal testing sites, as well as expanding testing at pharmacies in vulnerable communities, community centers, and at schools. This comes as Governor Northam has announced new Virginia Department of Health testing sites in Charlottesville, Chesterfield, Fairfax, Fredericksburg, Newport News, Norfolk, Prince William, Richmond and Roanoke. More information on the sites can be found here.Kaine also asked Dr. Fauci for an update on NIH’s research to better understand the symptoms and treatment for long COVID. Dr. Fauci gave Senator Kaine an update on NIH’s efforts to expand understanding of the lingering effects of COVID.As a member of the Senate HELP Committee, Senator Kaine continues to focus on making free at-home COVID tests more accessible, the growing number of people experiencing long COVID, and the importance of vaccination.Last week, Senator Kaine, alongside Senators Tina Smith and Tammy Baldwin, led a letter urging the Biden Administration to ensure easy access to rapid COVID-19 tests for Americans across the country.###"

One of the ways we’ve tried to protect against mistakes is broadening those who could participate… A functioning democracy gives you the ability to correct mistakes. Shrinking who can participate, putting burdens and obstacles in folks’ way – it’s not only harmful to those individuals whose rights are being taken away, but it dramatically weakens the ability of a functioning electorate to correct mistakes and change courses. And that is what is going on in these jurisdictions all over the country.”Kaine also spoke about the record turnout during November’s gubernatorial election in Virginia, a 25% increase since the last governor’s race, in part thanks to reforms passed by the state legislature to make voting more convenient. He said, “The provisions of these bills are popular, but also just go to Virginia history. In November of 2019, Democrats took both houses of the Virginia legislature and one of the first things they did was dramatically expand the right of people to participate in Virginia elections … And we just had a Governor’s race and the turnout increased 25% from the 2017 Governor’s race to 2021, and a Republican won. That was not my candidate, that was not my preferred outcome, but it was a win for democracy because having made it easier for people to participate, guess what they did? That was the second greatest jump in gubernatorial turnout in Virginia history… You make it easier for people to vote and you pull obstacles out of their way and a whole lot more people vote and guess what? It can be good for Republicans … It can be good for Democrats …  It’s good for democracy and that’s why we need to do this.”Kaine, a former civil rights attorney, has long fought to protect voting rights and expand access to the ballot box.In September 2021, Kaine introduced the Freedom to Vote Act to improve access to the ballot for Americans, advance commonsense election integrity reforms, and protect our democracy from attacks.

https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-call-for-tps-designations-for-el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-nicaragua,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere (both D-VA), joined 30 of their Senate Democratic colleagues in formally requesting that the Biden administration grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) re-designations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a new TPS designation for Guatemala.In a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the senators expressed their concern with the worsening humanitarian conditions across Central America being compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple devastating natural disasters, all of which have contributed to an uptick in outmigration from the region.“The crisis in Central America is urgent. ... TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration,” the senators wrote. “It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration.”Established by the U.S. Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS is a temporary, renewable program that provides relief from deportation and access to a work permit for foreign nationals from certain countries who are unable to return safely to their home country due to natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary conditions.“Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. … Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media,” the senators continued. “The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region.”Sens. Warner and Kaine have been strong advocates for the TPS program and in 2020 wrote a letter urging the incoming Biden Administration to protect TPS recipients in Virginia and throughout the country.Joining Sens. Warner and Kaine in signing the letter were Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.)A copy of the letter is available here and below. Dear Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken,We write to express our concerns about ongoing humanitarian needs in Central America and to appeal for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) redesignations for El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and a new TPS designation for Guatemala. It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the Administration. The Guatemalan government has requested a TPS designation, and U.S. Embassies have issued disaster declarations for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in recognition of the urgent needs. TPS designations and redesignations would provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration. Lastly, such designations would be consistent with the Administration’s commitments to address climate migration.The crisis in Central America is urgent. In the past year, the region has experienced extreme weather events, including two hurricanes followed by a months-long drought. According to the World Food Program (WFP), farmers in the region face the worst dry farming season in 35 years. Hunger in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua has increased almost fourfold over the past two years, according to WFP, from 2.2 million people in 2018 to close to 8 million people in 2021. Eight in ten households are resorting to crisis coping measures, selling their lands, tools, and livestock, and missing meals or eating less nutritious meals. It will take years to repair damage to roads, schools, bridges, wells, and other physical infrastructure caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which continue to impede citizens’ livelihoods. The pressures have led to an uptick in outmigration from the region. In January, 15 percent of people surveyed by WFP said they were making concrete plans to migrate — double the number two years ago. Media report that the region’s citizens are having to choose between migrating or facing hunger. Despite U.S. Embassies’ disaster declarations, which activated the delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance, 8.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in July 2021, including 5.5 million who were in desperate need of food as of September 2021, according to the Famine Early Warning System Network.The International Monetary Fund says that remittances initially supported the region’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but tropical storms Eta and Iota interrupted progress, damaging crops and halting manufacturing. In 2020, Honduras’ GDP dropped nine percent, El Salvador’s GDP dropped nearly eight percent, Nicaragua’s dropped two percent, and Guatemala’s by 1.8 percent. The IMF supported the region with emergency financing to cope with these shocks. However, the enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging vaccination campaigns, especially in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, will prolong the region’s economic recovery.Combined, the effects of the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly exacerbated food insecurity, violence, and led to rising social tensions. Forced displacement continues to plague the region. Over one million Central Americans have been displaced by violence and insecurity. Gender-based violence continues to be a major driver of displacement, with rates increasing dramatically throughout 2020. On November 3, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights named El Salvador the most dangerous Latin American country for women. Additionally, countries in the region have suffered severe democratic backsliding and political persecution is on the rise, including through the consolidation of a dictatorship in Nicaragua, the dismantling of independent judiciaries, and efforts to intimidate and silence civil society and independent media. TPS is a humanitarian tool used by both Democratic and Republican administrations to provide relief for individuals who are unable to return to countries facing extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration must act and provide certainty for eligible individuals from Central America during this challenging moment. These temporary designations would give the U.S. government more time to partner with governments and civil society to ensure that the return of a large number of individuals to Central America does not create further instability and volatility in the region. They would also provide immediate and tangible humanitarian benefits to new status holders and help mitigate the factors driving dangerous outmigration by securing life-saving remittances.It is our view that El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua meet the standards for TPS. We look forward to working closely with and supporting the Biden administration as it take this important step to uphold humanitarian protections, safeguard U.S. national security interests, and defend American families. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.Sincerely,###"
