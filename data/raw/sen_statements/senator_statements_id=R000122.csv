https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/as-home-heating-costs-surge-reed-seeks-to-help-riers-save-on-their-energy-bills,"JOHNSTON, RI -- Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is having a chilling effect in Rhode Island and across the globe: it’s causing the cost of heating homes worldwide to spike this winter.  And the problem is exacerbated by broken supply chains recovering from the shock of the pandemic; above average hot summer temperatures that had more people cranking up their air conditioning this past summer; and more exports of U.S. natural gas that caused natural gas prices to surge.  As a result, the National Energy Assistant Directors Association (NEADA) is forecasting that Americans will have to pay a lot more to heat their homes this winter.  NEADA says the average American household will have to spend $177 more to heat their home compared to last winter’s prices, with many New England households facing even steeper increases.  While the Inflation Reduction Act will significantly help tame these sorts of price spikes in the future, U.S. Senator Jack Reed says Congress has an opportunity to deliver immediate relief to those in need, but Washington Republicans are opposing legislation that would help millions of people lower their home energy bills.  As Congress debates a spending bill to keep the federal government funded, Reed successfully included an extra $1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), despite objections from Congressional Republicans.  The U.S. Senate is scheduled to begin voting on the package later today.“LIHEAP is one of the most critical programs we have to provide heating assistance to seniors and low-income families,” said Senator Reed. “With the increase in heating costs, we’re going to need more resources to provide the ability for these families and seniors to make it through the winter.”Today, Senator Reed joined Tri-County Community Action Agency, LIHEAP customers, North Providence Mayor Charles A. Lombardi, and local home oil dealers to discuss efforts to help Rhode Islanders save on their energy bills and stretch their home-heating dollars.Last year, between annual appropriations, the American Rescue Plan Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Senator Reed led successful efforts to provide a total of $8 billion for LIHEAP nationwide, resulting in $56 million for Rhode Island.Nearly 26,000 Rhode Island households benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $570 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders.  Over 3,360 Rhode Island households also received LIHEAP crisis grants, which assist LIHEAP recipients when they have experienced a utility disconnection or are low on deliverable fuel and can’t afford to get another delivery.Consumer groups note that to save on home heating bills this winter, people should plan and budget ahead and understand their fuel heating contracts: some customers may access discounts by pre-paying, spreading out payments over 12 months, or, if they use home heating oil delivery services, locking in a lower price and automatic delivery.Outside energy experts say another way households can help lower energy bills is by unplugging electronics and appliances when they’re not in use.  The U.S. Department of Energy reports that so-called ‘standby power’ accounts for 5 to 10 percent of residential energy use.  And technology reviewer CNET reports that unplugging devices when not in use could save the average household up to $100 per year.  CNET cites a 2015 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council which found that reducing the load from always-on devices would save consumers a total of $8 billion annually and avoid using 64 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.But even the most frugal and energy conscious households will still feel the impact of surging home energy prices and Senator Reed says it is key that the federal government do its part to help keep people safe and blunt the impact of energy price shocks stemming from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.“LIHEAP is a lifeline and we’ve got to ensure it’s there for people who need it.  I commend Tri-County Community Action Agency and others for connecting people to these critical resources.  We’ve got to help our neighbors in need and I will continue working to boost LIHEAP assistance so it keeps up with demand,” said Senator Reed. Joseph R. DeSantis, President & CEO of Tri-County Community Action Agency, stated: “In this time of economic insecurity, it is critical that people get an application for LIHEAP submitted as soon as possible, so that we can ensure people receive this important benefit.”LIHEAP is administered by states and accessed through local Community Action Agencies.  Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources.Rhode Islanders can apply for LIHEAP by contacting their local Community Action Agency, or going to the Department of Human Services LIHEAP Resource Page."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-helps-include-1-billion-for-liheap-in-proposed-stopgap-funding-bill,"WASHINGTON, DC – Early this morning, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) unveiled a short-term appropriations bill, often referred to as a continuing resolution (CR), to keep the federal government funded at current levels until after the midterm elections as lawmakers work out a long-term government spending agreement for fiscal 2023.  The CR includes $1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a member of the Appropriations Committee and the leading Congressional champion of LIHEAP, helped include this funding.  He says this additional emergency home heating aid is critical to help states like Rhode Island assist vulnerable residents this winter.Reed stated:“This $1 billion in LIHEAP aid is a lifeline that will help low-income families and vulnerable seniors safe and warm during the cold winter months. “With home heating prices forecast to rise, it’s important for Congress to deliver this aid to states now so they can distribute it to those in need.  States have flexibility to use these funds and effective systems already in place to target them to people who are disproportionately impacted by energy insecurity.“Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has disrupted worldwide energy markets, raising prices everywhere.“Energy is a basic need, and without LIHEAP assistance, low-income families and seniors face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities, such as prescription drugs, housing, and food.  This emergency supplemental doesn’t cover the full cost, but every cent is desperately needed and will make a huge difference for people.“This is a public health issue and Congress must act with a sense of urgency and bipartisanship to get these funds to those in need.”Senator Reed, along with U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), has led a bipartisan call for greater LIHEAP funding to be included in the CR. Annual federal LIHEAP funding levels are currently set to reach about $4 billion in fiscal year 2023.  However, more is needed as cost increases have decreased the purchasing power of LIHEAP dollars with the price of home heating oil nearly doubling in the past year and the forecast for electricity and natural gas projected to rise significantly.LIHEAP is administered by states and accessed through local Community Action Agencies.  Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources.Nearly 26,000 Rhode Island households benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $570 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders.  Over 3,360 Rhode Island households also received LIHEAP crisis grants, which assist LIHEAP recipients when they have experienced a utility disconnection or are low on deliverable fuel and can’t afford to get another delivery.Last year, Senator Reed delivered nearly $56 million to Rhode Island to help residents save on their home energy bills."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/after-delivering-14m-in-federal-funds-reed-and-whitehouse-help-break-ground-on-east-bay-bike-path-bridge-replacement,"BARRINGTON, RI – The once-busy bicycle bridges that cyclists and pedestrians relied upon to cross the Barrington River and Palmer River as they traversed the popular East Bay Bike Path will soon be restored thanks to new federal funding secured by U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse.Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee, and Whitehouse, who serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee, secured a $5 million earmark in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law and also helped free up another $9 million in additional federal funding this summer to fund the project, which is estimated to cost a total of $24 million.After the old bicycle bridges were forced to close due to safety concerns in the fall of 2019, bike path users have had to detour a hundred yards to Route 114, negotiate two busy intersections, and cross the river beside car traffic. Now that $24 million in financing is in place -- including a dedicated stream of $14 million in federal funds -- Senators Reed and Whitehouse today joined Governor Dan McKee and officials from RIDOT and the U.S. DOT’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for a groundbreaking ceremony.“The East Bay Bike Path turned 30 this year. It’s a tremendous community asset and I’m proud to help deliver over $14 million in federal funds to help replace these bridge sections and make it stronger and safer for the next thirty years and beyond,” said Senator Reed.  “The bike path gets so much use and when this section closed down it became a real safety issue.  Replacing the bridges is a major capital investment that will pay off for generations.  I’m proud to have worked at the federal level to help make it happen.  And I’m looking forward to the day when we can return to this spot and bike across this new, smooth, accessible and sustainable section of the East Bay Bike Path.”“The East Bay Bike Path is a Rhode Island gem, and the bridges spanning the Barrington and Palmer Rivers are two of its highlights,” said Senator Whitehouse. “I'm very pleased to join Senator Reed in securing funding to replace both bridges, which had been closed for several years.”The selected design-build team of Aetna Bridge/VHB will start work on the project once the necessary environmental permits are in place and will demolish the old wood structures.  The commencement of work in the field is contingent on the permit process. The 14.5 mile East Bay Bike Path connects Bristol to Providence.  Construction began in 1987 and was completed in the spring of 1992.  It was the state’s first major multi-town bike path.In the fall of 2019, the two aging wooden trestle bridges that carry the East Bay Bike Path across the Barrington and Palmer rivers were found to be structurally deficient.  According to RIDOT: In fall of 2019, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) closed the two aging wooden trestle bridges that cross the Barrington and Palmer Rivers because of severe deterioration which made them unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians. Known as the East Bay Bike Path Bridges, they were built in the 1880s as railroad bridges and were converted to bike paths in the 1980s.   "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/with-overdoses-rising-reed-and-whitehouse-seek-to-help-codac-and-first-responders-save-lives,"PROVIDENCE, RI – As drug overdose rates spike and a growing number of people seek treatment services for substance use disorder, CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, the largest non-profit, outpatient provider for opioid treatment in Rhode Island, is expanding its operations with the help of federal funds secured by U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse.Today, Reed and Whitehouse joined Linda Hurley, President and CEO of CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, to discuss a new $750,000 earmark for CODAC to support the renovation and modernization of a new flagship facility at 45 Royal Little Drive in Providence.  CODAC’s new headquarters will offer medical and administration services at this new, consolidated site which will allow for medical expansion due to necessity and patient need.  CODAC, which serves about 5,000 people, has outgrown its current 14,000-square foot site on Huntington Avenue forcing some staff having to create work spaces out of closets.Reed and Whitehouse also announced a new $800,000 First Responders-Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Support Services Act Grant.  This federal funding, which will be administered by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), trains and equips first responders -- such as police, firefighters, paramedics and other volunteer organizations -- on how to respond to overdose-related incidents, including how to administer overdose reversal medication naloxone (commonly known by the brand name Narcan).  Between February 2020 and November 2021, RIDOH and its community partners distributed 10,000 doses of naloxone.  Getting additional naloxone kits into the hands of first responders and community members will prevent fatal overdoses and save more lives.“We are in the midst of an opioid overdose surge.  It is a community-wide problem and a nationwide problem that requires both a community and national response.  We need urgent action to stem the tide and save lives,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.  “We need a surge resources, treatment, and outreach to effectively respond.  That is what CODAC is doing here in Rhode Island.  That is what Senator Whitehouse and I are doing in the United States Senate.  We’re making sure treatment and recovery programs are available, accessible, and affordable.  We are working to remove the stigma surrounding addiction and overdoses.  We are supporting law enforcement in their efforts to crack down on drug trafficking and ensure first responders can administer life-saving medicine that reverses an opioid overdose.  This will help save lives and get more people the help they need, when they need it.”“The disease of addiction has touched far too many families from every walk of life.  It’s so important that convenient high-quality care is available for people seeking help, and that's where CODAC comes in.  CODAC is doing lifesaving work on the front lines of the opioid crisis, and I'm very pleased to join Senator Reed to deliver this funding to expand its services to more people on the long, noble road of recovery,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “The expertise of Linda Hurley and her dedicated staff was instrumental in helping me craft the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which continues to guide the federal response to the opioid epidemic.”“As opioid deaths continue to climb, CODAC is committed to providing comprehensive and competent care. Senators Reed and Whitehouse have historically supported our mission, and now with this procurement are supporting our most recent effort to provide, cutting-edge, integrated care for those who come to us for services.  The new building is not only much more conducive service provision, it is also a statement – that we respect those we serve with professionalism and compassion.  Thanks so very much to our Senate delegation for all of their support,” said Linda Hurley, President and CEO of CODAC Behavioral Healthcare.Last year, 435 Rhode Island residents died of accidental overdoses, according to RIDOH.  Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported more than 107,000 overdose deaths in the United States between December 2020 to December 2021, a 15 percent increase from the number of overdose deaths in 2020.  Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid -- which, in its legal form is often used to relieve pain during and after surgeries, but is prevalent on the illicit market because it’s cheap to manufacture -- played a role in about 75 percent of all overdose deaths in Rhode Island, according to RIDOH, and 66 percent of all overdose deaths nationally, according to the CDC.September is National Recovery Month and this week the federal delegation secured $7.4 million in federal State Opioid Response Grant funding to enhance statewide opioid addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery support services.Founded in 1971, CODAC Behavioral Healthcare is Rhode Island’s oldest and largest non-profit, outpatient provider of treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.  CODAC offers services at seven community-based locations, as well as programming at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections.  CODAC also operates a 27-foot mobile treatment unit, a converted RV vehicle that has a dispensary examination and treatment room, as well as a counseling room, to treat people who want to stop using drugs.Residents searching for substance treatment, peer recovery services, and treatment options like medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and other services may visit: https://preventoverdoseri.org"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-announces-113m-to-combat-opioid-epidemic-and-improve-mental-health,"WASHINGTON, DC -- In an effort to connect Rhode Islanders struggling with mental health issues, opioid use disorder, and other behavioral health issues to treatment, recovery and prevention services, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced $11,371,485 in new federal grants for Rhode Island.  Over $7.4 million in federal State Opioid Response Grant funding will enhance statewide opioid addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery support services.  Federal grants will also invest in local Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), which provide access to quality mental health care to residents across the state.“A lot of people are struggling these days with mental health and addiction issues.  Help is available and we need to connect people in need to proper care and treatment.  This federal funding will save lives.  It will expand access to mental health and addiction care,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Labor-Health and Human Services (L-HHS), who helped include $1.525 billion for State Opioid Response Grants in the 2022 appropriations law. “This increased support for mental and substance use treatment offers a critical lifeline to residents across the state and strengthens our communities.”“Too many Rhode Island families from all walks of life have been touched by the disease of addiction,” said Senator Whitehouse, who authored the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the law guiding the federal response to the opioid crisis.  “This funding will help get more people onto the long, noble path to recovery and provide reinforcement to the health care and public safety personnel doing the important work on the front lines of the opioid crisis.”“As our state continues to recover from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must take extra care to combat the concerning rise in accidental overdoses and opioid addiction in Rhode Island,” said Congressman Langevin. “I’m glad that these federal dollars will be used to expand access to mental health and addiction recovery resources, so that Rhode Islanders struggling with substance use disorders can receive the help they need.”“Far too many Rhode Islanders have fallen victim to our nation’s opioid epidemic and we need to do all we can to not only support those in recovery, but to also boost addiction prevention programing,” said Congressman Cicilline, who fought for adequate funding for the State Opioid Response Grants Program in the 2022 appropriations law. “We need to make sure that our neighbors who are struggling with their mental health or with substance use disorder not only know that help is available, but can access that care without undue barriers or stigma. The State Opioid Response Grants Program has been saving lives since its inception, which is why I continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that we are providing enough funding to keep these grants flowing to communities like ours.”The Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities, and Hospitals (BHDDH) will receive $7,443,492 to help prevent opioid addiction statewide, reduce the number of prescription drug/opioid overdoses, increase access to treatment and reduce unmet needs through prevention, treatment, and gather data on addiction treatment and recovery resources.Newport County Community Mental Health; Gateway Healthcare, Inc.; and Thrive Behavioral Health, Inc. will each receive $1 million federal grants to improve community behavioral health services.Comprehensive Community Action Program (CCAP) will receive $928,000 to treat adults with opioid use disorder and provide behavioral health counseling services.Last year, 435 Rhode Island residents died of accidental overdoses, according to RIDOH.  Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported more than 107,000 overdose deaths in the United States between December 2020 to December 2021, a 15 percent increase from the number of overdose deaths in 2020.  Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid -- which, in its legal form is often used to relieve pain during and after surgeries, but is prevalent on the illicit market because it’s cheap to manufacture -- played a role in about 75 percent of all overdose deaths in Rhode Island, according to RIDOH, and 66 percent of all overdose deaths nationally, according to the CDC. The ballpark cost of the opioid epidemic is now more than $1.3 trillion and rising, according to a Forbes estimate using the same approach as economists from the CDC.No city or town in Rhode Island has been spared the pain of this overdose epidemic.One piece of good news is that new AMA data released this month shows opioid prescriptions have dropped in every state over the last decade, plummeting nearly 50 percent nationally."

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-delivers-27-million-to-support-local-fire-departments,"WASHINGTON, DC -- In an effort to help local fire departments improve operations and safety, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced $2,713,266 to help the fire departments in Cranston, Middletown, and Providence purchase new trucks and equipment. The federal funds are being awarded through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program.  These federal grants are designed to enhance local fire departments’ abilities to comply with response, equipment, and operational standards established by the National Fire Protection Association. Cranston Fire Department: $1,000,000 in AFG for a new aerial ladder truck.Middletown Fire Department: $383,810 for state-of-the-art communications equipment, including new radios – base, portable, and mobile repeaters.Providence Fire Department: $1,089,416 for firefighter training and specialized washer and dryer machines to clean carcinogens and chemicals from firefighter turnout gear.  Providence is also receiving a separate $240,040 AFG award to purchase a new state-of-the-art ambulance.“When there is an accident or emergency, our firefighters and first responders can mean the difference between life and death for the people who need their services.  These federal funds will help purchase vehicles and communications equipment to ensure our firefighters are well equipped,” said Senator Reed.  “I commend all these communities and fire departments for putting together strong applications.  I will continue doing everything I can at the federal level to help our dedicated firefighters protect our communities and improve emergency response capabilities.”“Our firefighters put their lives on the line every day for Rhode Islanders, and they deserve the very best tools to their jobs safely and effectively,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “Congratulations to the Providence, Cranston, and Middletown Fire Departments on winning these federal funds to protect the public’s safety.” “Every day, Rhode Island’s firefighters put themselves at risk to protect our communities,” said Congressman Langevin. “I’m proud to deliver the funding to ensure that the Cranston, Middletown, and Providence Fire Departments have the personnel, training, and equipment that they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.”“Our neighbors too often see firefighters and first responders on the worst days of their lives, but these heroes’ dedication to service and our community help keep those bad days from becoming catastrophic,” said Congressman Cicilline. “Each year, I work with my colleagues to ensure we are doing our part in Congress to help our local fire departments meet community needs through grant programs like AFG. These federal funds can and do save lives, and I will continue to work to make sure our firefighters are receiving the equipment, resources, and training they need to keep themselves and the public safe.”“It is critical that our firefighters have access to modern equipment, training and tools that help them to do their life-saving work effectively,” said Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza. “I thank our federal delegation for their steadfast support of the members of the Providence Fire Department.”Cranston Mayor Ken Hopkins stated: “Funding for this apparatus will help ensure that the women and men of Cranston’s fire department continue to be provided with the finest fire safety equipment as possible.  With a new, state of the art ladder truck, the safety and protection of our residents will be enhanced.  Our superb Fire Chief Jim Warren worked diligently and intelligently to articulate the needs for this vehicle.  I am grateful for his efforts along with those advocated by Senator Jack Reed and his staff to secure this much appreciated funding.”“Over the years, our Congressional delegation has been extremely supportive of the Town of Middletown and our emergency service providers,” said Middletown’s Town Administrator Shawn J. Brown. “This latest grant will help our firefighters to do their job better and communicate with our neighboring communities, which is so important when minutes count.”Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation helped include a total of $720 million for AFG firefighter equipment grants ($360 million) and for SAFER firefighter hiring and retention grants ($360 million) in the 2022 Appropriations law.Over the last twenty years, Rhode Island fire departments and other first responders across the state have received over $120 million in AFG and SAFER awards."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-gets-244k-to-improve-sex-offender-registry-management-and-keep-communities-safe-and-informed,"PROVIDENCE, RI -- When predatory and violent sex offenders are released from prison or move to Rhode Island, the community has a right to know.In an effort to enhance public safety, U.S. Senator Jack Reed announced $244,540 in federal funding for the Rhode Island Sex Offender Registry (RISOR) to hire personnel, enhance sex offender registration compliance, and digitize old records to ensure each sex offender’s record is accurate and can be seamlessly shared among law enforcement agencies.“I am committed to enhancing public safety and holding offenders accountable. This federal funding will help ensure state and local law enforcement have an accurate, unified system to identify and track convicted sex offenders, keep the public informed, and prevent repeat offenses.  Rhode Island must be proactive, collaborative, and effective when it comes to offender management.  This federal funding will help the State Police achieve that goal,” said Senator Reed, a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS), which oversees federal funding for the U.S. Department of Justice.The federal funds are administered by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART Office), through the Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program.  Under the terms of the grant, Rhode Island may use the federal funds for support personnel to maintain the Sex Offender Registry; digitize all existing hard copy sex offender records to ensure Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) compliance; and pay annual subscription fees for specialized computer software called OffenderWatch.Offender Watch is used by more than 4,000 law enforcement agencies across the country in 39 states. The program enables police departments to collaborate on investigations and share important information on sex offender cases with each other, as well as organizations such as the U.S. Marshals and Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program.SORNA is part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which Congress passed in 2006 to require that a registered sex offender notify law enforcement of a change of address. The law made it a federal crime for a registered sex offender to move from one state to another state without re-registering with the new home state and strengthened the nationwide network of sex offender registration and notification programs.Senator Reed voted for the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and helped reauthorize it in 2016. The law is named for the abducted and slain son of Americas Most Wanted host John Walsh.According to RISOR, there are currently 1,391 sex offenders in the state of Rhode Island, including those who are currently incarcerated and eligible for parole.RISOR offers searches by the offender’s name or by using a specific address to show an interactive map of offenders in the area.  Each offender’s profile displays a photograph, a current address and other known addresses, history of conviction for sex crimes, along with a risk level (level 1 assessed as a low risk of re-offense, level 2 assessed as a moderate risk of re-offense, and level 3 assessed as a high risk of re-offense).Federal law requires that each offender be classified as level 1 through 3 by a specially appointed Sex Offender Registration Review Board.  The classification system helps local law enforcement focus on monitoring those sex offenders who pose the highest risk of re-offending."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/wheels-of-progress-turning-along-the-woonasquatucket-reed-mckee-celebrate-66m-in-new-federal-funds-to-improve-bike-paths-and-connect-residents-and-neighborhoods-to-transportation-options-and-outdoor-recreation,"PROVIDENCE, RI – The wheels of progress are starting to turn and bike path improvements that have been in the works for years can now move ahead thanks to new federal funding secured by U.S. Senator Jack Reed.Today, Senator Reed joined Governor Daniel J. McKee, Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr. and officials from the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council (WRWC) to tour the Woonasquatucket River Greenway and discuss $6.6 million in new federal funding to upgrade the Greenway and the Washington Secondary Bike Path.  The federal funds will help enhance bike and pedestrian travel and connect the bikeways to more neighborhoods.“The long and winding road is about to get a bit longer, smother, safer, and more connected thanks to these federal funds and the tireless advocacy of the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council.  The bike path is for everyone and it promotes healthy living.  Whether you are a cyclist commuting to work or a pedestrian out for a stroll, we want to ensure our bike paths serve the community and are integrated into the state’s plans for an efficient multi-modal transportation system and future growth.  The Watershed Council has worked for years to bring the community together and lay the groundwork for these projects and I am pleased to support their efforts with this federal funding,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, who secured the funding for these bike path projects as part of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law. “These important bike paths improvements will not only make these paths longer and stronger, but they will also help to better connect communities and protect our environment by providing alternative transportation options,” said Governor Dan McKee. “Thank you to Senator Reed for securing these funds so that we can continue to improve our infrastructure across Rhode Island.”The Greenway offers 7 miles of off-road and on-road bike path connecting parks and open space from Waterplace Park in downtown Providence to Lyman Avenue in Johnston.  The scenic trail features over 35 different art installations along the path.  Since 2007 the downtown section of the Greenway, from Eagle Square through Providence Place, has consisted of only on-road bike lanes, creating an uninviting atmosphere for potential users.  Now, this $3.4 million in federal funding will be used to support the design and build of a dedicated off-road, shared-use path in this section of the greenway.  Among other amenities, this section of the Greenway will include a canoe and kayak launch and park areas to provide new opportunities for residents and visitors alike to take advantage of the Woonasquatucket wildlife corridor.  These federal funds will help cover engineering costs, new lighting and safety features, and other public amenities for this section of the Greenway.The Washington Secondary Bike Path is a ‘rail trail’ that stretches 19 miles from Cranston to western Coventry. The new $3.2 million in federal funding will allow RIDOT to accelerate the design and construction of the final 1-mile stretch of trail needed to connect Providence to the existing bike path in Cranston.   This project will help fill a “missing link” between the city and the Cranston portion of the existing path, allowing cyclists and pedestrians to travel safely from Providence to western Coventry.  Design engineering is underway to determine permitting needs, and RIDOT has received support from the City of Providence, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, and Pawtuxet River Authority to help expedite this project.“RIDOT will continue to make a strong commitment to bike and pedestrian infrastructure. Each year we invest about $20 million toward these improvements and in the nearby Route 6/10 Interchange project alone we are investing $10 million toward construction of 1.1 miles of shared use path and two pedestrian bridges over Amtrak. Thanks to the additional funds provided by Senator Reed, we can move forward with these projects that ultimately will fill in the missing gaps in our bike network,” RIDOT Director Peter Alviti, Jr. said. “We look forward to continued collaborations with communities and groups like the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council to improve bike and pedestrian connections across Rhode Island.”“The Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council is so grateful for Senator Reed and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation’s long time support to create the Woonaquatucket River Greenway. The current and planned Greenway -- amazing assets for the City of Providence and the state of Rhode Island -- are the product of over $20 million in investment. We are proud of this incredible system of trails and parks that: highlights the wildlife corridor of the Woonasquatucket River; offers recreation and transportation benefits to parts of Providence in greatest need; and creates opportunities for cleaner water, healthy wildlife habitat, community engagement, education, health and so much more,” said WRWC Executive Director Alicia Lehrer.  “Thanks to our successes, this trail system is poised to connect through Johnston, Smithfield, North Smithfield, and beyond as well as to the Washington Secondary Trail. The Statewide Bike Mobility Plan, when implemented, will make our trail part of an active transportation and recreation network statewide. We could not be more excited.The funding for both projects announced today will help provide safe, alternative transportation options and recreational opportunities that connect bicyclists and pedestrians to urban centers.In addition to this $6.6 million in federal funds for bike paths, Rhode Island is also getting $5 million in federal funds for the construction of new East Bay Bike Path bridges over the Barrington and Palmer rivers, thanks to an earmark Senator Reed delivered in the 2022 appropriations law along with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.  And this spring Rhode Island got a $4.8 million federal grant for construction of the Blackstone River Bikeway that was funded by the American Rescue Plan (Public Law No. 117-2).Additionally, RIDOT received $48.5 million in additional federal funding for transportation infrastructure upgrades this year through the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) annual August redistribution.  The additional federal spending authority will help RIDOT advance shovel-ready projects in the coming weeks, including the East Bay Bike Path, while providing the state with enhanced flexibility to allocate state transportation funds to other road and bridge improvement projects. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-announces-major-825-million-grant-to-upgrade-iconic-pell-bridge,"PROVIDENCE, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced an $82.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s INFRA Grant Program to upgrade the iconic Pell Bridge that connects Newport and Jamestown.  Planned improvements to the deck, suspension system, and towers will extend the life of New England’s longest suspension bridge by an additional 50 to 75 years.“The Newport Pell Bridge is a critical asset that gets a lot of wear and tear from traffic and the elements.  We must take proper care of it and that means proactive planning and maintenance.  I was pleased to help kick-start the bridge ramp realignment project with a $20 million federal grant in 2018.  This new INFRA grant will support RITBA’s efforts to properly maintain the bridge, improve safety, and extend its lifespan,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) who worked with his colleagues to include $7.25 billion for competitive INFRA grants and $7.5 billion for competitive Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.“I helped create the INFRA program to meet the need for major, once-in-a-generation investments like rebuilding the Pell Bridge,” said Senator Whitehouse, who authored the INFRA Program in 2015 to help meet Rhode Island’s need for large-scale infrastructure investments.  “The Pell Bridge is the Ocean State’s most iconic landmark, and we will be able to keep it that way for at least an additional half century thanks to this enormous federal grant.  There is much to be done to bring the bridge into the twenty-first century.” “The Pell Bridge is one of Rhode Island’s most iconic landmarks, and it’s also an integral piece of our infrastructure. Connecting Aquidneck and Conanicut Islands, the bridge carries tens of thousands of passengers over Narragansett Bay each day.  It’s critical that Rhode Islanders and tourists alike can make that journey safely and efficiently,” said Congressman Langevin.  “I am thrilled that funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will allow us to keep the Pell Bridge in pristine condition.”“The Pell Bridge isn’t just critical infrastructure for Rhode Islanders, it’s an icon that has earned its place on the National Register of Historic Places,” said Congressman Cicilline.  “To ensure that this resource is available to Rhode Islanders and visitors for years to come, we need to invest in and modernize the bridge now so that we can return it to a state of good repair while reducing long-term costs and improving safety.  The Pell Bridge is a prime example of the types of projects that the bipartisan infrastructure law was designed to support and fund.  I’m looking forward to an extended, long life for this Rhode Island icon.”The project will include a partial depth replacement and rehabilitation of the bridge deck in the main suspended and west approach spans.  Climate change has led to more severe storms and more frequent use of salt and other treatments to make the road safe for travel, accelerating the loss of pavement quality.  The new pavement will be made of a denser material that is more resistant to the effects of chemical deterioration.Increased humidity from climate change is also accelerating the need to repair the main cables, suspenders, and other elements of the suspension system.  While the cables and suspenders are currently safe, inspection data points to an accelerating pace of deterioration.  The funding will be used to install a de-humidification system to reduce moisture levels within the cables and anchorages, and halt the corrosion process.  The suspender ropes and other elements will be replaced when needed, helping preserve the main cable for an additional 75 years of useful life.Funding will also be used to repair the tower elevators, replace the finger joints that accommodate movement in the bridge, and repaint the towers.  Acoustic monitoring will provide data on the bridge’s condition and additional cameras and sensors will provide greater physical security.“The Newport Pell Bridge serves as a vital connector for health care services, education, mutual aid among public safety departments, access to jobs, work sites and housing, and as a connector for commuters between the Greater Providence area and Newport County,” said Governor Dan McKee.  “This critical grant will help us protect the iconic Newport Pell Bridge from climate change while the completion of the bridge decking and painting of the towers will return the bridge to a state of good repair – bettering the lives of Rhode Islanders and the industries that support our state.  I thank our Congressional Delegation for securing this funding from the Biden Administration.”The Pell Bridge opened in 1969 and was dedicated in honor of the late U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell.  The bridge, which carries four lanes of traffic across Narragansett Bay, is operated by the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority. “Governor McKee and his administration have coordinated the state’s approach to infrastructure, which puts Rhode Island in a strong place to compete for significant federal grants like this INFRA grant.  Our Congressional Delegation has shown once again that Rhode Island punches well above its weight,” said Lori Caron Silveira, Executive Director of the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority.  “This investment from the U.S. Department of Transportation will accelerate and expand planned maintenance and extend the life of the iconic Newport Pell Bridge by an additional 50 to 75 years.  With collaboration across state government, leadership from our federal team, and support from private sector partners and organized labor, we are confident that this is only the beginning.”In 2018, the delegation secured $20 million in federal funding to upgrade the ramps leading from Aquidneck Island to the Pell Bridge.The bipartisan infrastructure law passed late last year included $7.25 billion for the INFRA program over five years.  First authorized in 2015 as the FASTLANE grant program, the INFRA discretionary grant program provides funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation for large-scale highway and multimodal projects that might otherwise stall without additional federal support.  Rhode Island previously received a $60.3 million INFRA grant to rebuild the Northbound Providence Viaduct and a $65 million INFRA grant to overhaul Route 146. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/with-reed-and-whitehouses-backing-us-senate-confirms-lara-montecalvo-for-1st-circuit-court-of-appeals,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate confirmed Lara E. Montecalvo’s nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit by a bipartisan vote of 52-47. Montecalvo, who has led the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender since 2020, was nominated by President Joe Biden in April to fill the vacancy created by Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announcing her plan to assume “senior status,” which means she will soon begin hearing cases on a more limited basis. Montecalvo’s nomination received strong backing from U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, who advocated for her confirmation on the Senate floor.“As the state’s public defender, Lara Montecalvo served the people of Rhode Island well.  I am confident she will continue to do so on the federal bench.  She has dedicated her legal career to public service and we are fortunate to have a judge with her expertise and background on one of our nation’s most important courts,” said Senator Reed.“Congratulations to soon-to-be Judge Montecalvo on earning bipartisan approval from the Senate.   She is extremely well-respected in Rhode Island’s legal and law enforcement communities.  I know she will be a strong voice for justice and fairness on the First Circuit,” said Senator Whitehouse, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is based in Boston.  Judges have court chambers in different states and Montecalvo’s chambers will be in Providence, Rhode Island.  The First Circuit hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  The First Circuit is one of thirteen federal appellate courts that sit one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court. Montecalvo has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal level.  A Swarthmore College graduate who went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice for almost four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Before being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.Now that Montecalvo has been confirmed by the full U.S. Senate, she must be sworn in and take the oath of office before she can begin hearing cases.  Once she is sworn in, she will become the First Circuit’s tenth judge, and third Rhode Islander – joining both Bruce M. Selya, who assumed senior status in 2006, and O. Rogeriee Thompson. The other judges on the First Circuit are: David J. Barron (chief judge), Norman H. Stahl, Sandra L. Lynch, Kermit V. Lipez, Jeffrey R. Howard, William J. Kayatta, Jr., and Gustavo A. Gelpí."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/us-senate-poised-to-confirm-ris-montecalvo-to-seat-on-influential-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-first-circuit,"WASHINGTON, DC – Lara E. Montecalvo’s nomination to serve on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit cleared a key Senate hurdle today.  In a Senate procedure known as a ‘cloture vote,’ which is a preliminary vote necessary to end debate before final confirmation, Montecalvo received the backing of a majority of the U.S. Senate.Now, Montecalvo, who currently leads the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender, is slated to get confirmed this week to serve as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  The First Circuit, based in Boston, hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  The First Circuit is one of thirteen federal appellate courts that sit one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, who strongly backed President Biden’s nomination of Lara Montecalvo, say she is expected to get a final confirmation vote by the full U.S. Senate this week and expect her to be confirmed.“Lara Montecalvo is an extremely talented public servant and she will be an outstanding, fair-minded judge.  She has practiced law in every court in Rhode Island and earned high marks for her sound judgement and legal expertise.  She deserves to be confirmed because she is exceptionally well-qualified and will strengthen the court by bringing a diversity of experience to the First Circuit,” said Reed and Whitehouse in a joint statement.Montecalvo has extensive trial and appellate experience handling criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts.Montecalvo, who moved to Rhode Island with her family when she was in the fourth grade, currently serves as the state’s chief public defender and is tasked with providing high-quality legal representation for Rhode Islanders who cannot afford to hire an attorney in criminal, juvenile, and parental rights cases.  Montecalvo has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal level.  She and her husband, Craig, have a son.Montecalvo earned a bachelor of arts degree from Swarthmore College and went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000.After graduating from law school, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC for four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Before being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.If confirmed by the full U.S. Senate, Montecalvo will fill the vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that was created by Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announcing her plan to take senior status.  Once a successor is confirmed, Judge Thompson will continue hearing cases, but on a more limited basis.So far during the Biden Administration and the 117th Congress, the U.S. Senate has confirmed 81 federal judges, including 22 circuit court nominees, 59 district court nominees, and the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court.  When it comes to increasing diversity on the federal bench, the Biden Administration has nominated and the Senate has confirmed the most diverse slate of judges of any U.S. Congress in history, including a record number of nominees with experience serving not only as prosecutors, but also as public defenders, voting rights experts, and civil rights attorneys.  Of the 22 circuit judges confirmed by the U.S. Senate Democrats, 17 are women and 14 are people of color.  Of the 59 district judges, 43 are women.Now that cloture has been invoked on Montecalvo’s nomination, it sets up a period of up to 30 hours of post-cloture debate followed by a final vote on confirmation, which requires a simple majority of the U.S. Senate.  A vote on final confirmation is expected as soon as tomorrow, depending on other U.S. Senate business."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-and-langevin-deliver-1-million-to-help-uri-researchers-turn-the-tide-on-plastics-pollution,"KINGSTON, RI – The United States has made real progress in reducing pollution and cleaning up waterways.  But the proliferation of plastics pollution, while largely invisible to the human eye, is becoming alarmingly worse.Microplastics and nanoplastics -- tiny polymer fragments -- are turning up everywhere: in waterways, fish, birds, wildlife, and in people.  Plastic is the number one type of trash found at sea and one of the most urgent environmental and health challenges of our time.  According to the Associated Press: “Half the plastic that has ever existed on Earth was made in the last 20 years. Only 9 percent of the plastic sold every year in the United States is recycled, according to the U.S. EPA. Up to 13 million metric tons of it ends up in the world’s oceans each year the equivalent of a garbage truck-full being dumped into the sea every minute where it kills fish, birds, sea turtles, whales and dolphins that eat it or become entangled by it.”Not all plastic that ends up in the ocean comes from plastic bags or water bottles.  Tiny plastic fragments, primarily from clothing and textiles, get released from washing machines and then into wastewater treatment plants.  These fragments and films come from the breakdown of larger, harder plastics, as well as from things like flexible plastic packaging and other discarded plastic that finds its way into waterways through storm-water systems.Now, researchers at the University of Rhode Island (URI) are getting a $1 million boost to better understand the flow of plastic particles through the environment and develop new solutions to stop plastic waste and pollution.Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed and Congressman Jim Langevin joined URI President Marc B. Parlange and faculty members and students to announce a $1 million federal earmark for URI to increase the understanding of the impact plastics have on human and environmental health and coastal ecosystems and develop new sustainable materials and advance innovation in recycling and pollutant capture.The lawmakers say that URI’s promising, evidence-based research is critical to raising awareness, increasing scientific understanding, and helping lawmakers develop effective policies to tackle marine plastics and stem the tide of plastics pollution.“In the grand scheme of things, microplastics are a relatively new pollutant and there is a lot we still don’t know, which is one of the reasons URI’s research is so important.  We do know plastics pollution is becoming more pervasive and poses a serious environmental threat and public health problem.  Microplastics are increasingly present in the clothes we wear, the water we drink, and the food chain as well.  Getting plastic pollution out of our waters and off the menu requires a sea change in the ways that individuals, businesses, and society treat the use and ownership of plastics throughout the entire life cycle of these products, from packaging to clothes to single use items.  URI is developing promising strategies to turn the tide on plastic waste and marine pollution.  This federal earmark will help expand their reach and URI’s findings and recommendations will help form future actions to improve water quality and reduce pollution,” said Senator Jack Reed.“Unchecked plastics pollution is a threat to our health, our environment, and our economy, which is why I am so proud that URI has decided to step up to the plate and tackle this challenge head-on,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “It’s an honor to partner with URI on reducing plastics pollution by delivering this $1 million federal investment to support URI’s cutting-edge plastics research program.”“With the support of Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin, this $1 million earmark demonstrates that an investment in the University of Rhode Island is truly an investment in the state and its people. As the public flagship research institution, URI is conducting important research in all areas of the Blue Economy, including this plastics pollution initiative, which is improving the lives of Rhode Islanders and fueling economic growth for the state. This November, with the help of voters, we have an opportunity to continue to fuel this growth through a $100 million bond referendum, which will start the transformation of URI’s Narragansett Bay Campus as we build a more prosperous and sustainable Blue Economy,” said URI President Marc B. Parlange.To help confront plastic pollution, URI launched Plastics: Land to Sea, a web-based research network to communicate, collaborate, and accelerate ideas and strategies that inform society, public policy, & reduce land-to-sea plastic pollutants.  “Plastics: Land to Sea” initiative is a “co-laboratory” or laboratory without walls that now involves nearly 50 faculty at URI, across most all of it colleges, and in partnership with state agencies (RIDEM, RIDOT), with non-profit partners and NGOs, and with universities internationally.This new federal earmark, which Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin jointly secured for URI in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law, will be used to support research projects and initiatives focused on reducing plastic pollution locally, statewide, and on a national and global scale. The federal funding will also support outreach and partnership with industry on new, more sustainable materials or plastic substitutes.In 2015, Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin helped pass a law to ban companies from making and selling personal care products that contain microbeads, tiny pieces of plastic that were used as exfoliates in cosmetic consumer products.This month, California became the first state in the nation to begin requiring water agencies to test for the microplastic contaminants."

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-passing-of-queen-elizabeth-ii,"WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) issued the following statement on the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, 96, the longest serving monarch in British history: “When she was crowned Queen Elizabeth II, she declared to her people that her whole life would be devoted to their service.  She certainly kept that promise and never wavered in her duty, earning well-deserved accolades over a lifetime of principled service. “As a monarch, Queen Elizabeth was an adept leader who changed with the times, yet still managed to be timeless.  Now she belongs to history and the ages. “We join her countrymen and people across the globe in mourning her passing and celebrating her life.  “As the sovereign, she took on great responsibility at a young age and in an age when there weren’t many female heads of state.  Her skill, poise, and boundless devotion to duty and her countrymen was exemplary.  “When she ascended to the throne at the age of twenty-five, she was the right person to meet the moment and went on to play a remarkable role in British and world history and became a unifying force for many.  “A steady presence through changing eras, she was a source of wisdom, strength, grace, and resilience.  The very embodiment of tradition and that enduring British sentiment of 'keep calm and carry on.' “Queen Elizabeth’s reign has ended but her example endures.  Our deepest condolences to the royal family and her many loyal subjects and fans throughout the world.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reeds-successful-push-for-fema-cost-share-reimbursement-pays-off-for-ri,"WASHINGTON, DC -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending Rhode Island a $13,356,528 check this month to reimburse the state for the costs of protecting the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.  With this latest reimbursement, FEMA has now provided Rhode Island $543,795,428 in federal funding for emergency COVID-19 response costs.  And thanks to U.S. Senator Jack Reed’s leadership, Rhode Island taxpayers have saved $135,948,857 in costs that otherwise would have been incurred by the state.  Senator Reed successfully advocated for the federal government to provide a 100 percent cost share, instead of requiring the state to foot 25 percent of the tab.FEMA awarded the latest reimbursement funds to the Rhode Island Department of Health for emergency protective measure to cover the cost of providing COVID-19 test kits, sample collection services, and lab processing of tests at no cost to the public.  To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the Rhode Island Department of Health used contracted services to establish a temporary facility to operate a case investigation center for the identification and investigation of patients with confirmed and probable diagnoses of COVID-19.  The state provided temporary staff including doctors, nurses, case investigators, and epidemiologists to support case investigation, community mitigation, data analytics and modeling, the COVID-19 hotline and inbound call center, and epidemiology operations.In 2020, then-President Trump issued a disaster declaration to free up federal aid to help state agencies and municipalities defray the cost of fighting COVID-19.  Under this declaration, FEMA reimbursed up to 75 percent of approved emergency costs for pandemic response public services. But despite repeated requests from Congress and from Governors of both parties, Trump refused to provide cost-share relief.After President Biden was elected, Senator Reed helped successfully advocate for the federal government to pick up the full tab.  President Biden directed FEMA to raise its reimbursement rate for states, territories, and localities for emergency COVID-19 costs from 75 percent to 100 percent to help better manage the pandemic response and defray the mounting bills for states.“When the pandemic hit, Rhode Islanders worked together to keep each other safe and I did everything I could at the federal level to ensure Rhode Island had the resources to effectively respond to this crisis, recover from it, and cover the emergency costs,” said Senator Reed.  “The Biden Administration rightly answered the call to waive FEMA’s cost share requirement and ensure Rhode Island had needed resources for testing and vaccine distribution.   That proved to be a major boost to the health and safety of our residents and has saved Rhode Island $136 million and counting in costs.”The President’s authorized provision of FEMA Public Assistance at 100 percent federal funding expired on July 1, 2022.  States must now provide a 10 percent match for emergency COVID-19 response costs incurred after July 2, 2022."

Biden, Jr.The White House Washington D.C. 20500  Dear Mr. President:  Earlier today, Rhode Island experienced an intense burst of rainfall and damaging flooding, which overwhelmed storm water systems and forced the closure of Interstate 95 and other major thoroughfares and local roadways.  At least one building collapsed in the torrent. While the full extent of damage will not be known until the water subsides, I urge you to provide any assistance that may be requested by the State in support of its recovery efforts. Thank you for your assistance and leadership. Sincerely, Jack Reed"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-lauds-bidens-request-for-extra-500-million-for-liheap-to-help-with-home-heating-needs,"WASHINGTON, DC – Nobody wants to think about home heating fuel prices in September when temperatures still feel like it’s mid-summer.  But with winter approaching and home heating bills forecast to spike this winter due to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) says now is the time for Congress to make additional emergency home heating aid available so states can prepare and help vulnerable residents stay safe this winter.Reed, the leading Congressional champion of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps over 5.3 million households nationwide afford their energy bills, has been leading the push for emergency LIHEAP funding ahead of the winter heating season.   The White House, anticipating that Congress will not complete its work on a comprehensive spending package for fiscal 2023 before the September 30 deadline, today outlined its request for a ‘continuing resolution’ (CR).  This stop-gap spending bill would keep the federal government funded while Congress completes its work and includes $500 million in emergency funding for LIHEAP, as well as funding for aid to Ukraine, natural disaster relief, COVID-19 response, and monkeypox assistance.A CR would keep the government funded at current levels for a limited time until a full year spending plan is agreed upon.  It will be up to Congress to determine the duration of the CR and whether any additional funding for emergencies and exigencies should be included.  Senator Reed is a member of the Appropriations Committee.“Despite today’s heat, winter is around the corner and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is sending home heating costs higher across the globe.  I commend President Biden for including $500 million for LIHEAP in this request and will continue to push for more.  Congress needs to do its part to keep people safe this winter by providing LIHEAP home heating assistance to vulnerable seniors and families,” said Senator Reed, who urged appropriators to include emergency supplemental funding for LIHEAP in the coming CR.  “We know that rising home energy costs disproportionately impact low-income families, and we know that LIHEAP is an effective lifeline that helps people in all fifty states afford their energy bills.  President Biden gets it, and he’s given us a good start in this proposal.  Congress needs to build on his request and make this assistance available as soon as possible so people aren’t left out in the cold.”Senator Reed, along with U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), has led a bipartisan call for greater LIHEAP funding to be included in the CR.  Annual federal LIHEAP funding levels are currently set to reach about $4 billion in fiscal year 2023.  However, more is needed as cost increases have decreased the purchasing power of LIHEAP dollars with the price of home heating oil nearly doubling in the past year and the forecast for electricity and natural gas projected to rise significantly.LIHEAP is administered by states and accessed through local Community Action Agencies.  Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources.Nearly 26,000 Rhode Island households benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $570 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders.  Over 3,360 Rhode Island households also received LIHEAP crisis grants, which assist LIHEAP recipients when they have experienced a utility disconnection or are low on deliverable fuel and can’t afford to get another delivery.Last year, Senator Reed delivered nearly $56 million to Rhode Island to help residents save on their home energy bills."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-and-langevin-deliver-1-million-to-help-ccri-boost-enrollment-improve-communications_enhance-community-engagement,"WARWICK, RI — As students return to classrooms this fall, the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) is steadily rebuilding its enrollment, which fell during the pandemic. To help CCRI attract, retain, and effectively engage with students and enhance the learning experience and post-graduate job networking opportunities for alumni, U.S. Senator Jack Reed and Congressman Jim Langevin today joined CCRI President Meghan Hughes and students to deliver a $1,060,000 federal earmark for CCRI to acquire a customer relations management (CRM) system.The CRM is meant to integrate communication tools like emails, text messages, and phone calls to reach potential students and also assist communications with current CCRI students and alumni to improve their learning experience and help with things like job searches and career networking.This includes tracking student applications, sending out acceptance letters, managing financial aid, tracking students after graduation, and updating contact information over time.  Currently, CCRI is the state’s only public higher education institution without such a system in place.Reed and Langevin say it is essential for CCRI to be current with technologies and have all the tools necessary to reach and support prospective students and alumni because CCRI graduates are pillars of Rhode Island’s workforce.  Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin jointly secured the federal earmark for CCRI in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law. “CCRI is an essential engine of education and opportunity.  The school really focuses on helping students succeed and their success is integral to the state’s success,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.  “This new centralized customer relations management software will help CCRI reach, recruit, and retain more students by improving outreach and engagement and boosting enrollment.  It’s a powerful new communications tool to help CCRI effectively reach a wide range of prospective students and engage with students and alums through personalized messages using the methods and platforms that they prefer.  Ultimately, this federal funding will help build a stronger campus community and help CCRI build stronger communities across the state.”“In today’s day and age, CRM software is a necessity for any large institution of higher education, not to mention the largest community college in New England,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “Every day, CCRI provides Rhode Island students with the post-secondary education and training necessary to compete in the 21st century economy. I am so proud to deliver this $1 million investment, so that CCRI can continue to build upon its phenomenal work.”“With this federal earmark, CCRI will be able to better serve Rhode Islanders from the moment they first express an interest in the college to when they graduate and become part of the alumni family. The CRM will be an efficient, effective, and consistent tool to enroll and support students as they achieve their educational and professional goals,” said Meghan Hughes, president of CCRI. “We are so grateful to Senator Reed and Congressman Langevin for their unwavering support of our college and our students.”CCRI, New England’s largest community college, enrolls nearly 18,000 students in credit-bearing degree and certificate programs and an additional 8,500 individuals in workforce development programs and adult education courses annually. With a passionate commitment to student success and closing equity gaps, CCRI provides Rhode Islanders with an outstanding college education that leads to strong learning outcomes, successful degree attainment and robust labor market outcomes. With four campuses across Rhode Island, CCRI offers, online, hybrid and in-person options for students, meeting them where they are and helping them achieve their educational and career goals. CCRI was named the 2019 Two-Year College of the Year by Education Dive magazine."

L. 115-334), or more commonly referred to as the 2018 Farm Bill, is set to expire on Sept. 30, 2023.Rhode Island’s agriculture industry supports over 2,500 direct agricultural jobs and more than 2,000 additional jobs from agricultural support industries.  Rhode Island’s agriculture industry generates gross sales of approximately $240 million per year."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-announces-270000-to-help-grow-ris-specialty-crop-sector-and-food-economy,"CRANSTON, RI – In an effort to help Rhode Island farmers, food producers, and the state’s agricultural sector grow and develop a healthy, sustainable future, U.S. Senator Jack Reed today announced $270,000 in Specialty Crop Block Grants.  Administered at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), these federal funds will be awarded to several projects designed to grow Rhode Island’s ‘specialty crop’ sector, which include fruits, vegetables, and horticulture and nursery crops.The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and a half dozen non-profits will harness the federal USDA funds to expand the availability of fresh, locally-grown produce, strengthen the state’s specialty crop industry, and promote Rhode Island grown produce to a broader audience. “This has been a tough time for Rhode Island farmers and small-scale food producers.  It’s imperative that the federal government do its part to support local farmers and food networks.  This federal funding will help promote buy-local initiatives and enhance the competitiveness and marketing of Rhode Island grown produce.  It will also help develop distribution channels for specialty crops, and support sustainable farming methods, training, and best practices,” said Senator Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee.In order to qualify for the competitive USDA specialty crop grants, projects had to demonstrate a benefit to the industry as a whole, rather than one product, individual, or organization.The specialty crop grants being awarded this year in Rhode Island include:$38,559 for Southside Community Land Trust (SCLT) to provide outreach and education to 31 farmers in order to enhance the competitiveness of up to four specialty crops in low-income Rhode Island communities.  The project will identify crops where there is significant consumer demand but low supply.  SCLT will work with farmers to develop demonstration plots to successfully grow the new crops.  SCLT will provide field tours and training resources to encourage 12 farmers to begin production of at least one new crop during the term of the grant and projects 2,400 consumers to benefit from access to these new, high demand crops.$37,089 for Farm Fresh Rhode Island to use farmer, chef, and classroom-based training to connect culinary students with the skills and resources necessary to become local food advocates in their schools and future careers.  These trainings will provide educational experiences that bring more local food into schools and empower the next generation with the skills they need to purchase, prepare, and cook specialty crops.$32,541 for the RI Farm Incubator to disseminate and share new and cutting-edge integrated cropping techniques appropriate for use by small scale, organic, and beginning growers in the region.  The Incubator will create and facilitate a collaborative regional information network across small farms in Rhode Island to increase efficacy of and adoption of integrated cropping methods.  Methods like stale bed preparation including the use of cover crops are critical to move carbon to the soil, decrease erosion, decrease nuisance plants, mitigate the effects of drought as well as reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer required to grow specialty vegetables.$29,987 to the Rhode Island Food Policy Council (RIFPC) to help build a more equitable, accessible, economically vibrant, and environmentally sustainable food system in Rhode Island.  RIFPC’s efforts are focused on ensuring all Rhode Island residents have access to culturally appropriate, affordable food by addressing the most pressing needs across farming, fishing, food processing, distribution, consumption, and waste management.$22,260 for the Rhode Island Fruit Growers Association (RIFGA) to install and maintain four weather stations throughout Rhode Island which will be linked to Cornell’s Network for Environment and Weather Applications (NEWA), allowing Rhode Island specialty crop growers to make timely and accurate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) decisions based on real time, on-the-ground conditions, accurate to the area of management.Additionally, DEM will use $59,413 to support RI Grown, DEM’s marketing toolkit which seeks to help get more home-grown food on the table.  And DEM will direct an additional $28,042 to its Specialty Crop Block Grant “Enhancing Market Access” projects.  DEM says the need for new markets and assistance in joining those new markets is at an all-time high due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As new local markets are on the rise in Rhode Island, technical assistance like this project will be used to allow Rhode Island farmers access to those newly formed market opportunities.Lastly, the Rhode Island Division of Agriculture will use $28,042 in order to ensure compliance with the law.Last year Senator Reed helped appropriate $375,000 in stimulus funds for Rhode Island specialty crop grants in response to the pandemic’s impact on the food system.  DEM announced a process for distributing a portion of these funds and priority is given to projects responding to problems caused by the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions.Earlier this month, DEM began accepting applications from farmers and small-scale producers whose operations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to award specialty crop ‘mini-grants’ ranging in size from $2,500 to $10,000.  DEM will award these federal dollars to support Rhode Island farmers and food businesses, with DEM noting that mini-grants must fit within one of three funding areas:Applicants may apply for mini-grants now through the end of the year at: https://dem.ri.gov/programs/agriculture/grants-specialty-crop.php"

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-backs-bidens-plan-to-lighten-student-debt-burden-and-pause-student-loan-repayments-through-2022,"PROVIDENCE, RI – Today, the White House announced a targeted plan to offer up to $20,000 in student loan debt relief for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 in student loan debt relief for individuals who earn less than $125,000, and extend the pause on federal student loan payments through the end of 2022.U.S. Senator Jack Reed praised President Biden’s move to offer working families some financial breathing room as regular student loan repayments start in the new year, saying it will benefit not only students, but businesses, communities, and the nation.Currently, about 44 million borrowers owe a collective $1.7 trillion in federal student loan debt, up from $250 billion in 2004.  To focus this assistance on the middle class, the White House estimates that nearly 90 percent of this student debt relief will go to people earning less than $75,000.Reed, who earlier this week joined U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in headlining a celebration of Pell Grants at Salve Regina University’s Pell Center, says Biden’s student debt relief initiative is a positive step, but more work is needed to reduce long-term student loan burdens.  Reed noted that making college more affordable has a broader societal impact that helps young adults afford to start a family, buy a home, save for their future, and fully participate in the economy.“President Biden is keeping his word and delivering targeted student debt relief to lighten the load for borrowers with the highest economic need.  This is a lifeline for students drowning in debt.  It will help them make ends meet and keep economic recovery going.  While it alleviates the problem, it doesn’t solve it.  Bipartisan action is needed to reform the regulations and student loan servicing systems that have contributed to skyrocketing student loan debt.  The President’s latest move will help borrowers who were harmed the most under the old rules.  Reducing the burden of student debt helps individuals pay for college and participate in the economy.  Businesses need a well-educated workforce, young adults need to be able to afford to start families of their own, and communities benefit from increased economic productivity,” said Reed.  “Rising student debt has limited opportunities for recent generations.  This student debt relief will make a big difference for young people and expand economic opportunity.  It delivers a stronger return on investment than Trump tax giveaways which only benefited the extremely wealthy.  We need to work together on long-term reforms so future generations of students aren’t also buried under a mountain of debt.  Republicans should work with us to make college more affordable, including doubling Pell Grants and incentivizing states and universities to do their share to bring down costs.”  Senator Reed is a cosponsor of the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act (S. 2081), legislation that would double the Pell Grant award -- which has eroded in purchasing power over the years -- index it to inflation, and make other changes to expand the award for working students and families.“Millions of Americans have been asked to mortgage their future in order to pay for their education.  That’s not fair.  We need to address college affordability now and help future generations avoid this student debt burden by restoring the power of Pell Grants and making college more affordable.  Ensuring that everyone has a shot to reach their full potential regardless of their economic means is how we grow our economy, strengthen  the middle-class, and build our democracy,” said Reed.Under both the Trump and Biden Administrations, borrowers with federal student loans haven’t been required to make a payment in more than two years: the payments on federal student loans have been frozen since March of 2020, near the outset of the pandemic. During this pause -- which was slated to end on August 31, but has now been extended through the end of 2022 -- borrowers have not been required to make payments on their loans and interest rates were set to zero.  The Department of Education also stopped collections on defaulted loans during this time.  This reprieve provided millions of federal student loan borrowers with critical financial flexibility, and allowed many to pay down the principal on their debt.Federal student loan interest rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury note and determined using a formula set by federal law.  So different student borrowers have different rates, depending on when they took out the loan.Senator Reed says that borrowers should be aware that federal student loan interest rates will be the same as before the pause.  Federal student loan borrowers who need information on their loans, help on a repayment plan or assistance finding their loan servicer should go to studentaid.gov.To date, the Biden administration has now approved $32 billion in student loan forgiveness.  This includes nearly $10 billion under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program which offers loan relief for those working in public service after they've made a set number of payments on their qualifying loans."

Cardona headlined a special program today at Salve Regina University’s Pell Center with President Dr. Kelli J. Armstrong and other featured guests, including U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and U.S. Representative David Cicilline (RI-01), and urged federal action to double Pell Grants and ensure the doors of higher education remain open to students for the next fifty years.The event was co-led by the Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA) and the Rhode Island Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (RIASFAA) and featured panel discussions with Rhode Islanders who are direct beneficiaries of Pell Grants, and who were able to pursue opportunities and afford college, thanks to federal financial aid.“Senator Pell understood that talented students with limited means have unlimited potential.  He refused to let driven students be priced out of the opportunity to earn their degree.  So he created these grants as a tool for upward economic mobility.  Pell Grants empower students to uplift themselves, their families, communities, and the nation.  It was a generational change that helped millions of young people become the first in their family to go to college and punch their ticket to the middle-class,” said Senator Reed, who succeeded Pell in the U.S. Senate. “The Pell Grant is about expanding opportunity through higher education.  It is about helping hardworking students afford to pay for college and building for the future.  Fifty years in, it’s time to double down on that success by doubling the power of Pell grants to uplift future generations and ensure they too can afford to pay for college, reach their potential, and strengthen our communities and the economy.”“Pell grants represent the promise of America. It’s the promise that it shouldn’t matter what race or gender you are, what zip code you grew up in, or where your family came from…if you work hard, you can achieve your dreams. It’s up to all of us to keep the promise of Pell and the promise of America alive for generations to come,” said Secretary Cardona.In its 2023 fiscal year budget proposal, the Biden Administration proposed boosting financial aid relief for students across higher education and doubling the maximum Pell Grant award to $13,000 by 2029, with an immediate lift of $1,775 for students in the 2023-24 school year, which would bring the maximum Pell Grant to $8,670.Reed, Whitehouse, and Cicilline are all cosponsors of the bicameral Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, which would double the Pell Grant award, index the award to inflation, and make other changes to expand the award for working students and families.“For 50 years now, Rhode Islanders have been able to achieve their dreams of pursuing a higher education because of Pell Grants — the noble legacy of our own Senator Pell.  I’m glad to mark this occasion by redoubling our efforts to strengthen this landmark program,” said Senator Whitehouse.“Pell Grants have helped millions of students to pursue higher education. To keep the power of this program and use it to help even more students, we need to double the Pell Grant and index it to inflation so that these opportunities are available for generations to come,” said Congressman Cicilline. “Higher education cannot be a privilege for only the wealthiest students, but accessible to everyone who has the drive, the ability, and vision to pursue their goals. Access to higher education is one of the single greatest predictors of success later in life. Among millennials, someone with a college degree, as opposed to a high school diploma, will be paid 63 percent more in annual income, will be three times more likely to have a job, and will be four times less likely to live in poverty. To create a truly equitable economy and country, we need to ensure that everyone can pursue a college degree should they want to.”Nationwide, about 34 percent of undergraduate students receive a Pell Grant, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.   And today, about 68 percent of Pell Grant funds go toward paying tuition at public schools.“Senator Pell’s legislation to establish the Pell Grant was revolutionary and changed the landscape of higher education. By moving funding from institutions to individuals, Pell Grants ensured that low-income students received much-needed resources to help pay for a college education,” said Dr. Kelli Armstrong, President of Salve Regina University.Originally known as the ‘Basic Educational Opportunity Grant,’ the award was renamed in 1980 in honor of Senator Pell.  Today, it is the largest federal grant program offered by the U.S. Department of Education to undergraduate students.Reed noted that in 1972, before the Pell Grant, less than half of high school graduates immediately enrolled in college.  Today, two-thirds make that transition, resulting in a more educated citizenry and workforce than America had without the Pell grant."

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-calls-for-additional-support-for-local-restaurants,"PROVIDENCE, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline are calling on the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide additional support to Rhode Island restaurants that are still dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been shut out of the Restaurant Revitalization Program.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund still has $180 million in unobligated funds, which the four members of Rhode Island’s delegation contend should be distributed in another funding round that would prioritize Ocean State establishments.“While we are disappointed that congressional Republicans have prevented Congress from sufficiently funding RRF, we understand SBA still has $180 million in unobligated program funds.  Even with some set aside for litigation or required to be sent to the Department of the Treasury, awards on that scale could make a transformative difference for the numerous restaurants still struggling with aftershocks from the pandemic’s economic crash,” wrote Rhode Island’s congressional delegation.In a letter to SBA Administrator Isabella Guzman, the delegation requested that the SBA use those remaining program dollars to prioritize restaurants in states with the lowest percentage of funded eligible applicants to ensure program funds are distributed in a geographically equitable manner, which would provide significant relief to eligible Rhode Island food businesses.Only 30 percent of Rhode Island restaurants that applied to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund received relief – the lowest rate in the country and more than 10 percentage points lower than any other New England state.  Applications were considered on a first-come, first-served basis and many smaller restaurants with fewer resources were not able to file fast enough.Democrats created the Restaurant Revitalization Fund through the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law in March 2021.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund provided grants to restaurants dealing with COVID-19 for payroll, mortgage and rent payments, business debt service, utilities, maintenance, outdoor seating, business supplies, food and beverage costs, certain supplier costs, and other operating expenses.  A total of 446 Rhode Island restaurant operators received over $106 million in aid from the program.Senate Republicans blocked bipartisan legislation in May that would have appropriated an additional $40 billion for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund—enough to provide all RRF applicants that had not received any assistance with full grants.  The bill failed to receive the necessary 60 votes after all but five Republicans voted against considering the measure.Full text of the letter is available here. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-welcomes-two-new-coast-guard-cutters-to-ri,"NEWPORT, RI – Two Famous-class U.S. Coast Guard vessels are trading New Hampshire for a new berth in Newport, Rhode Island and U.S. Senator Jack Reed says the transition will have a positive impact for the Ocean State and the Coast Guard.Today, Senator Reed, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, joined Admiral Linda Fagan, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, and other dignitaries for a special homeport welcoming ceremony for the two 270-foot Coast Guard medium-endurance cutters. The USCGC Tahoma (WMEC-908) and USCGC Campbell (WMEC 909) are now based out of Naval Station Newport, each with a crew of 100, and will bring a shore-based maintenance support team as well.“The Coast Guard plays an essential role in safeguarding our nation and I am pleased the Coast Guard is bringing more assets home to the Ocean State,” said Senator Reed, who helped include $11.5 billion in discretionary funding for the Coast Guard in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law.  “The homeporting of these cutters in Newport is good news for Rhode Island.  From a strategic, operational, and cost-benefit perspective, moving these cutters to Newport makes sense.  Naval Station Newport offers an ideal location for the Coast Guard to homeport these vessels and their crews.  It offers the benefits and amenities of a secure naval facility and an outstanding quality of life for crewmembers and their families.”The USCGC Tahoma and USCGC Campbell are two of the Coast Guard’s fleet of twenty-nine medium-endurance cutters in service.  They came to Rhode Island from their previous homeport at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New Hampshire. Last summer, the Coast Guard deployed both Campbell and Tahoma in the North Atlantic region to participate in joint military and search and rescue exercises.  Both vessels will continue conducting missions pertaining to maritime law enforcement, homeland security, and search and rescue missions in support of Coast Guard operations throughout the Western Hemisphere.Senator Reed successfully advocated that Newport should be the home of additional federal Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) assets, and delivered federal funds to make pier improvements and infrastructure upgrades at NAVSTA Newport.  He previously worked to secure $30 million in federal funding to build a new facility for the Coast Guard’s three Rhode Island-based buoy tenders and has secured an additional $100 million for infrastructure upgrades for the Coast Guard that are in the pipeline for the base.“We have invested considerable federal assets in upgrading Naval Station Newport’s waterfront and I am making it my mission to help Rhode Island gain more ships and personnel,” said Senator Reed.These 270-foot medium-endurance cutters are part of the Famous-class of vessels that began service in the late 1980s.  These are multi-mission capital assets that globally deploy for approximately 90 days at a time. While primarily under the command of Coast Guard Atlantic Area, they support District commanders, including Coast Guard District one, conducting search and rescue and fisheries enforcement off the coast of New England. They also support the Coast Guard’s drug interdiction and migrant interdiction missions in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific Oceans.Both cutters are equipped with sophisticated communication and navigation equipment and are armed with a 76mm deck gun and deploy with an embarked MH-65 Dolphin helicopter.  Specifications include beam of 38 feet, draft of 14.5 feet, displacement of 1,800 tons and speed of 19.5 knots cruising.  Propulsion is by twin turbo-charged ALCO V-18 diesel engines.This will be a homecoming of sorts for both vessels, whose keels were laid at the now defunct Derecktor shipyard in Middletown, Rhode Island in 1983 (Tahoma) and 1984 (Campbell).With 41,700 active-duty personnel and 8,300 civilian employees, the Coast Guard has many responsibilities for protecting our nation, enforcing our laws, supporting commerce, and saving lives at sea.The Coast Guard has a considerable presence in Rhode Island, with about 300 active-duty personnel, 50 Reservists, and another 45 civilian employees.  The Coast Guard is responsible for patrolling over 384 miles of Ocean State shoreline and has an annual operating budget in the state of about $58 million.“Saving lives, stopping drug smugglers, supporting national security missions overseas, and keeping commerce flowing across the waves are all in a day’s work for the Coast Guard, and we are grateful for the unwavering dedication and professionalism of our Coast Guard members,” said Senator Reed.  “The Coast Guard has an active presence here in Rhode Island, and we’re pleased to see it grow even stronger.  We’ve made key federal investments and Rhode Island’s central location makes it an ideal place for Coast Guard resources.”Currently, Newport is home to Coast Guard Cutters: CGC Oak, CGC Sycamore, and CGC Ida Lewis.  In several years, these vessels will be joined by two brand new state of the art 360-foot Heritage-class vessels that are currently under construction in Florida.  These multi-mission assets service aids-to-navigation, conduct search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, ports and waterways security, living marine resources, and defense and homeland security missions.In addition to the Coast Guard, the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Agency (NOAA) also homeports several research vessels in Rhode Island, and Senator Reed says he wants to bring more federal assets to the Ocean State."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-seeks-to-help-ri-businesses-compete-in-overseas-markets-at-roundtable-with-exim-vice-chair-pryor,"PROVIDENCE, RI -- In an effort to support Rhode Island businesses and workers and strengthen U.S. supply chain resiliency, U.S. Senator Jack Reed hosted Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) First Vice President and Vice Chair Judith Pryor this week for a panel discussion about how local companies can reach foreign markets.  Ms. Pryor helps lead the nation’s official export credit agency, which assists American companies that export products to overseas markets by providing loans, loan guarantees, and other financing to encourage foreign purchases of American-made goods. The roundtable discussion was also attended by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse; U.S. Representatives Jim Langevin and David Cicilline; Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce president Laurie White; Ryan Clark, President and CEO of The Town Dock; and a variety of Rhode Island business leaders, including members from the Rhode Island Manufacturers Association; RI Black Business Association; Hope & Main, the Rhode Island Society of CPAs; and other business organizations. “I’m always seeking opportunities to help Rhode Island businesses compete, grow, and find new customers, and in today’s economy, there’s a renewed focus on strengthening supply chains at home and selling products abroad.  But how do local companies find those opportunities?  The Export-Import Bank is an excellent resource for local exporters.  This roundtable will help more Rhode Island businesses navigate complex, dynamic markets and leverage EXIM tools and services to expand their businesses,” said Senator Reed. The discussion focused on how Rhode Island companies can utilize EXIM’s services, as well as U.S. manufacturing, international trade, and helping American companies of all sizes compete for sales overseas.  Speakers also highlighted support for reshoring U.S. manufacturing jobs through EXIM’s Make More in America Initiative, which offers a new funding option for U.S. manufacturers that support U.S. exporters in critical areas such as renewable energy, energy storage, and sectors critical to national security. “On behalf of everyone at the Export-Import Bank of the United States, I thank Senator Reed and the Rhode Island delegation for facilitating a great discussion on supporting U.S. exports. Working with our federal, state, and local partners, EXIM is committed to helping more Rhode Island small businesses access financing solutions that enhance their competitiveness in the global marketplace,” said EXIM Vice Chair Judith Pryor. “With the help of EXIM, local Rhode Island businesses have an improved chance to secure sales from other countries which were not previously accessible,” said Ryan Clark, President and CEO of The Town Dock, a Rhode Island foodservice and retail calamari company. “For The Town Dock, using EXIM was extremely beneficial in being able to provide insurance for select international export sales.” During the roundtable, Vice Chair Pryor fielded questions relating to exports and financing from attendees and explained how EXIM can assist Rhode Island companies. Since 2014, EXIM has supported approximately $64 million in authorizations in Rhode Island.  Authorization are the dollar amount that EXIM has agreed to insure or finance (through an insurance policy, loan guarantee, or direct loan).  The top export destinations for these EXIM supported sales were Canada, Turkey, and Mexico. As an independent federal agency, EXIM contributes to U.S. economic growth by supporting tens of thousands of jobs in exporting businesses and their supply chains across the United States.  Since 1992, EX has generated more than $9 billion for the U.S. Treasury for repayment of U.S. debt.  Learn more at: www.exim.gov"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/96k-federal-grant-will-help-ripta-expand-access-to-transportation-assistance-for-older-adults-and-individuals-with-disabilities,"PROVIDENCE, RI – In an effort to help Rhode Islanders with limited mobility better utilize public transportation, U.S. Senator Jack Reed and Governor Dan McKee announced that the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is receiving a nearly $100,000 federal grant to develop a new Statewide Travel Training Network in partnership with public and private-sector organizations serving older adults, individuals with disabilities, minorities, and lower income individuals.  The $96,000 federal grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) program, will be utilized by RIPTA, in partnership with other agencies and transportation providers, to make it easier for Rhode Islanders to navigate the process of scheduling and accessing transportation services.The ICAM program is designed to enhance access to transportation services and public transportation by expanding partnerships between health, transportation, and other service providers.  RIPTA will take the lead in developing a shared training curriculum and mobility management network to help travelers gain skills and confidence in using public transit and other mobility services.  By providing training resources for case managers, caregivers, senior center staff, and other service providers, the Rhode Island Statewide Travel Training Network will introduce a variety of transportation options to thousands of Rhode Islanders experiencing limited mobility. This will ultimately give them the ability to plan and take trips independently so that they can participate in community activities and lead healthier lives.Rhode Island was one 16 states to win competitive ICAM funding from this round of $8.4 million in federal grants geared toward improving public transportation for underserved groups, with a focus on health and wellness.“Today’s news is pro-transit.  I’ve fought and won more funding for RIPTA every year and that’s meant hundreds of millions of dollars for transit because I’m a believer in transit. This federal funding will help improve the safety, availability and convenience of transportation services for older adults, people with disabilities, and underserved populations.  The goal is to ensure everyone has access to safe, reliable transportation when and where they need it. These ICAM funds will remove barriers and help RIPTA coordinate with its partners on a streamlined system that makes getting a ride more efficient for everyone,” said Senator Reed.“The ICAM grant will help accelerate our State’s ability to improve transportation resources for Rhode Islanders with limited mobility,” said Governor Dan McKee. “I thank Senator Reed for his unwavering support of public transportation and continued commitment to improving mobility access.”“We’re excited that this ICAM grant will help provide an opportunity for RIPTA to partner with community-driven organizations and utilize our resources to develop coordinated travel training programs to help people plan and take trips independently with confidence,” said Scott Avedisian, RIPTA Chief Executive Officer. By creating a Statewide Travel Training Network, RIPTA and its public and non-profit partners have an opportunity to leverage their current training resources and collaborate to improve training delivery. Ultimately, this multi-agency effort will enhance community access to existing transportation services and may underscore the need for new services.  The Rhode Island Travel Training Network will target disadvantaged communities that are low income and have high transportation cost burden and/or low transportation access, as well as transit dependency associated with income, disability, or lack of access to a private vehicle.Several key organizations/agencies provided support for this grant and will help RIPTA coordinate its implementation, including: RI Office of Healthy Aging; RI Senior Center Directors Association; RI Dept. of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities, and Hospitals; RI Office of Rehabilitation Services; Ocean State Center for Independent Living (OSCIL);  RI Dept. of Health;  RI Dept. of Human Services; and  RI Association of Community Action Agencies.Senator Reed, a member of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which oversees public transportation programs and the FTA, helped include $24 million for ICAM in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).More information on public transit and alternative transportation options like ridesharing and paratransit service through the RIde Program, is available on RIPTA’s website."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-signing-of-landmark-inflation-reduction-act-is-a-breakthrough-victory-for-all-americans,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, after President Joe Biden signed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act into law, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), who voted for the bill, issued the following statement:“This is a breakthrough victory for all Americans. “The Inflation Reduction Act empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices to drive down health costs.  It makes historic clean energy investments to combat climate change and strengthen America’s energy independence and U.S. manufacturing.  And it responsibly directs savings toward deficit reduction.“While this new law represents a major achievement, there is still a lot more work to do.“For decades, many Republicans denied climate science and delayed meaningful action to confront the growing climate threat -- exacerbating the crisis, increasing pollution, and making solutions more expensive. “Clearly, there is urgent need for climate action across all levels of government and the private sector.  This law marks the biggest ever investment in improving air quality, increasing renewable energy, and reducing pollution.  It’s a needed down payment that is long overdue, and it’s got to be followed up with a sustained commitment to renewable energy.“Similarly, when it comes to prescription drug pricing reform, for years Republicans in Congress and special interests blocked commonsense steps to lower prices for consumers.  As a result, many patients skipped needed but unaffordable prescriptions or treatments.  And Republicans stopped us from capping insulin prices at $35 for everyone in this law.  That’s something we’ve got to keep pushing to fix because it will save lives and save millions of families real money.“This law makes the tax code fairer and directs savings to reducing the debt.  It ensures that corporations and the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share, without raising taxes or audits on families earning $400,000 or less each year.“It will take some time, but the Inflation Reduction Act is a major step forward that will control costs for working families.  Congress needs to build on this success by working together to address additional issues such as affordable housing, child care costs, food prices and other key factors that are taking a bite out of Americans’ wallets.”The Inflation Reduction Act will:Lower prescription drug prices: Empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000; and prevents excessive price hikes for Medicare patients.Lower the cost of health care: Reduces the cost of health care for millions by extending American Care Act subsidies for three more years, locking in lower health care premiums that save 13 million people an average of $800 a year;Lower energy costs and undertakes largest-ever climate action: Invests in domestic renewable energy production and manufacturing, while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030 with historic investments in America’s energy independence and security; andLower the deficit and helps fight inflation: Reduces the deficit by nearly $300 billion to fight inflation."

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-announces-78-million-for-accessibility-and-resiliency-upgrades-to-providence-riverwalk-and-waterplace-park,"PROVIDENCE, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced that the City of Providence has been awarded $7.8 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program to support accessibility and design improvements and resiliency upgrades to the Providence Riverwalk and Waterplace Park. “We can’t ignore sea level rise and must factor it in to responsible city planning.  As the City thinks about ways to upgrade the area around the river, this federal funding will ensure those plans include ways to make Providence safer, more accessible, and resilient.  It will fund environmental assessments, economic development analysis, and community engagement with the goal of making Providence more flood resistant and building a more sustainable future,” said Senator Reed. “After decades of wear and tear and increasingly frequent flooding, the Providence Riverwalk and Waterplace Park are gems in need of a little polishing,” said Senator Whitehouse.  “This grant will allow the City to advance the riverfront’s next phase so that it can be enjoyed by more Rhode Islanders and will continue to provide a fittingly vibrant venue for WaterFire.” “As rising sea levels and subsequent flooding threatens the Providence Riverwalk and Waterplace Park, now is the time to invest in structural upgrades and resiliency to ensure that these Rhode Island staples can be enjoyed for generations to come,” said Congressman Langevin. “I’m particularly pleased that these federal dollars will be used to make the Riverwalk more accessible for people with disabilities, so that all Rhode Islanders can experience everything that the Riverwalk has to offer.” “The City of Providence is home to many public spaces and great parks that are important gathering places for the community,” said Congressman Cicilline.  “I was proud to support this federal funding, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that will enable the City to undertake key priorities to address resiliency issues, improve safety, and enhance accessibility in two heavily visited downtown spaces, the Riverwalk and Waterplace Park.  This is a great example of how vital federal funding can help preserve and improve these public spaces for generations to come.” The City plans to build a new ADA-accessible shared use path between Francis and Steeple Streets that will be safe for people of all ages and abilities, and create seven new ADA access points to the Riverwalk.  The project will also address public safety concerns and improve pedestrian and bicycle accessibility.  Finished in 1994, the Riverwalk has contended with more frequent flooding in recent years.  Planned upgrades for the area will address future sea level rise by raising the Riverwalk, improving stormwater runoff systems, and fixing structural deficiencies in sections of the Riverwalk’s walls. “This generous grant is a game-changer for the City and will allow us to execute on our collective vision for reclaiming the waterfront for our community members,” said Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza.  “New improvements made possible by this funding will greatly increase connectivity to our Urban Trail Network and dramatically enhance ADA accessibility in our Downtown neighborhood.” The federal grant will fund engineering and permitting, a community engagement process, and an economic development analysis for the planned improvements."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-and-whitehouse-push-for-robust-federal-response-to-monkeypox-public-health-emergency,"PROVIDENCE, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse joined a group of 14 U.S. Senators in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) urging Senate leadership to include funding to address the monkeypox (MPV)/orthopoxvirus Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress.“As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022,” wrote the Senators.  “The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history.”In their letter, the Senators note that the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting constituents to necessary medical care and resources.  Yet this system is underfunded and continues to be strained by the COVID-19 pandemic.“MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner,” they continued.  “Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States.  Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents.”The Biden administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency on August 5.  According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, the state has confirmed at least 30 cases.Reed and Whitehouse joined the letter along with Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).In reaction to the Senators’ letter, David C. Harvey, Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, stated: “The nation’s sexual health clinics have been managing frontline testing, treatment, and vaccination for monkeypox without adequate resources, staffing, or supplies, blunting the impact of federal efforts to address the outbreak.  The success of the national response hinges on whether these clinics get the resources they need to help patients access expanded testing, treatment, and vaccines.” A PDF of the letter can be found here.  Full text of the letter is below.________________________________________Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:  We write today to express concern over the rising number of monkeypox virus (hereon referred to as MPV) cases in the United States, and to urge you to include funding to address this Public Health Emergency (PHE) in any forthcoming legislative package in the 117th Congress. As of August 9, 2022, there have been over 9,492 confirmed MPV/orthopoxvirus cases in the United States from when the first case in the current outbreak was identified on May 18, 2022. The current outbreak in the United States is the largest in the world by case count in the current global outbreak—which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization—and the largest in the nation’s history. As such, the outbreak was declared a national PHE by the Department of Health and Human Services on August 4, 2022. Nevertheless, we recognize that many experts have stated that the current number of cases is likely an undercount due to a gap in provider knowledge, limited access to information and testing, as well as social stigma that may increase reluctance to seek medical care. As the country continues to navigate the MPV PHE, the United States public health system remains on the frontlines in identifying MPV cases, informing Americans about access to vaccines and therapeutics, and connecting our constituents to necessary medical care and resources. A recent survey conducted by the National Coalition of STD Directors of more than 100 clinics nationwide—including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), reproductive and sexual health clinics, and primary care providers—demonstrates that our country’s health professionals have the willingness and expertise to play a central role in the MPV response, and are already being called upon to do so. However, these care providers are in dire need of additional resources to scale an appropriate response and prevent the spread of the virus.1  MPV testing efforts are currently encountering processing and collection barriers that have led to underreporting of cases and poor data to aid the federal government in directing necessary resources in an appropriate manner. Additionally, as both a prophylaxis and treatment, acquiring and administering vaccines swiftly is crucial to stemming the spread of MPV and protecting all communities across the United States. Finally, clinics and providers are facing additional barriers in clinical services supplies, education for providers to properly identify MPV, vaccines, testing supplies, contact tracing, and community outreach to bolster our public health response to MPV, and ensure that accurate and adequate information is reaching our constituents. We appreciate the work that Senators Leahy, Murray, and Coons have undertaken to develop and introduce an emergency supplemental funding bill to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging disease that pose a significant threat to public health, and we ask you to include additional funding in any forthcoming legislative package to address the MPV PHE in our communities. Thank you for your attention and partnership in addressing this public health concern. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/a-victory-for-veterans-biden-signs-pact-act-into-law,"WARWICK, RI – After Congress passed the largest expansion of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in generations, President Joe Biden signed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT) Act, and U.S. Senator Jack Reed, who helped pass the law, urged Rhode Island veterans impacted by toxic exposures to apply for VA health care and benefits, even if their previous application was rejected.Reed, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (Milcon-VA), noted that the new law expands health care access to over 3.5 million veterans and adds 23 burn pit and toxic exposure-related health conditions to the VA’s list of presumptive conditions, including bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and numerous cancers and respiratory illnesses.  It also requires VA to provide free toxic exposure screening to every veteran enrolled in VA health care.“The PACT Act is a victory for veterans and honors our promise to care for them.  Those Republicans who voted against this bill and delayed it tried to argue the PACT Act is too generous to veterans who served in combat and then came home and developed rare cancers and respiratory issues years later.  I think they’re wrong, and it’s clear that the vast majority of Americans want to ensure our veterans are properly cared for.  Frankly, this bill was long overdue,” said Reed.  “Veterans with these rare and often terminal medical conditions deserve our respect and access to the specialized care they need.  The PACT Act offers more than words of thanks, it’s a concrete commitment to fulfilling our moral obligation to care for veterans in need.  I appreciate President Biden swiftly signing it into law and I know the VA is working hard to assist our veterans.”The PACT Act is estimated to cost more than $270 billion over the span of a decade.Vietnam era, Gulf War era, and Post-9/11 era veterans are most likely to be impacted by the new law and could see new benefits that weren’t previously covered, and as many as 37,000 veterans across Rhode Island could benefit as a result of the PACT Act.Veterans can immediately file PACT Act-related disability compensation claims by going to the VA’s PACT Act benefits page or by calling:  800-698-2411 (TTY: 711).Reed pointed out that in addition to health care benefits, the new law also boosts toxic exposure research, invests in VA’s workforce to better serve new claimants, and improves toxic exposure-related education and training for VA personnel.“The PACT Act will help increase our understanding of the connection between health consequences and exposure to toxins, whether it’s from burn pits or other types of exposure to chemicals and pollutants, and that has the potential to benefit Americans from all walks of life,” said Reed.Over the last several decades, the U.S. military relied on open air burn pits in overseas combat settings to dispose of trash – potentially exposing millions of military personnel to toxic fumes.  As the name implies, burn pits are pits where all forms of waste, including toxic waste, are disposed of by burning.  U.S. service members lived and worked in close proximity to these burn pits, often without knowing the potential consequences to their long-term health or any way to avoid them.Since 2009, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has recognized the harm burn pits can cause.  Senator Reed has been a leader in confronting the military’s use of open air burn pits, ensuring accountability at DoD, protecting the health of our men and women in uniform, and assisting veterans who were exposed to toxins.  He has also supported military funding for safer waste management alternatives such as closed systems and deployable alternatives to open air burn pits.When Reed became Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he included language in the first national defense bill he wrote that would bar the military from using open burn pits in overseas operations.  As the bill moved through committee, it was amended so that the law now states that the only way that DoD can use a burn pit overseas is if the Secretary of Defense personally issues a waiver. Additionally, Senator Reed is an original cosponsor of S. 952, the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act of 2021.  This bill was the basis for the additional 23 presumptive conditions that were included in the final version of the Honoring Our PACT Act."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/biden-signs-chips-plus-law-to-boost-american-made-computer-chip-production-and-accelerate-high-tech-research-in-ri_nationwide,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, President Biden signed the Creating Helpful Incentives for the Production of Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act (HR 4346), known as ‘CHIPS-Plus.’  This new law will boost U.S. computer chip manufacturing and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.  It also authorizes significant investments in scientific research and development initiatives and will boost Rhode Island’s innovation and scientific research ecosystem thanks to language added by U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI).To encourage homegrown computer chip manufacturing in the U.S., create good-paying America jobs, and address supply chain vulnerabilities in these critical technologies, the CHIPS-Plus package allocates $52 billion for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing.  It authorizes federal workforce development funds to train more American workers in the in-demand skills needed to build semiconductor chips.  And it includes language that would prevent companies that receive a share of the $52 billion in funding from using that money on stock buybacks or paying stock dividends to shareholders. “Semiconductor chip manufacturing is a strategic imperative.  This bill will strengthen America's chip-making supply chain and help stabilize our economy and make it more resistant to future chip shortages, while also investing in high-tech research and scientific breakthroughs.  A strong, resilient, domestic semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem is critical to America’s national security, economic security, and global stability,” said Senator Reed. The bill also includes nearly $100 billion in authorizations over five years – subject to appropriations -- for programs to bolster the National Science Foundation’s work, establish regional technology hubs under the U.S. Department of Commerce, and focus on translating research breakthroughs into real-world commercial applications and products.To help bring new, high-tech, science-related jobs to Rhode Island, Senator Reed led efforts to include language in the CHIPS-Plus package to bolster the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  EPSCoR is a critical research and development program that’s designed to help states traditionally underfunded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) compete for research dollars by providing money to improve infrastructure and capacity.“Investing in innovation today will bring more federal R&D funding and jobs home to Rhode Island in the near future.  It will strengthen Rhode Island’s research ecosystem, and fund cutting-edge, breakthrough research that can lead to new discoveries and products.  Without this EPSCoR language, it’s possible our state would lose out on millions of dollars,” said Senator Reed.  “I want Rhode Island to serve as a launching pad for new ideas, innovations, and technologies.  This bill invests in helping Rhode Island-based researchers working across a variety of fields develop and commercialize technological breakthroughs.”Specifically, the Reed-backed language in the bill will quadruple the amount of funding authorized for Department of Energy (DOE) EPSCoR over 5 years, while also increasing by fivefold the percent of the DOE research budget that goes to EPSCoR.  The bill will also boost EPSCoR funding up from 12.5 percent to 20 percent of the NSF research budget over seven years.  And it would also require at least 20 percent of NSF scholarship funding goes to EPSCoR institutions by 2025.  These provisions are estimated to bring an additional $1.8 billion in competitive funding to EPSCoR states over that period.The University of Rhode Island and Brown University are expected to receive the bulk of EPSCoR research dollars in Rhode Island and the universities work collaboratively with businesses and other researchers on a variety of programs, including marine, energy, and coastal research projects.  Since EPSCoR launched in Rhode Island in 2004, $88 million has been directed to the state for cutting-edge collaborative research projects. “EPSCoR provides critical support for the University of Rhode Island, the state’s public flagship research university, and our mission to advance research that drives innovation locally and globally,” said URI President Marc Parlange. ""We are grateful for Senator Reed’s leadership in securing historic funding for this program in the CHIPS-Plus Act. EPSCoR-funded research is addressing pressing societal challenges, including developing new approaches to assess, predict, and respond to the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems, while supporting workforce and career development. This increased investment in EPSCoR will bolster URI's ability to continue to conduct collaborative, translational research that helps all Rhode Islanders.”Jill Pipher, vice president for research at Brown University, said EPSCoR funding has been instrumental in enabling research at Brown on leading-edge technologies, conducted in collaboration with the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and other academic partners.One Brown research team continues to make discoveries about an emerging clean energy technology — the use of perovskites, a class of materials that will be the backbone of next-generation solar cells. Another is advancing understanding of the materials that will be the foundation of quantum computers, which may one day solve complex challenges that even today’s most powerful supercomputers cannot. A third is developing new ways to detect and predict the environmental impacts of climate change on Narragansett Bay’s coastal ecosystems.“EPSCoR has been a driving force in Rhode Island’s ability to serve as a home for groundbreaking research, and the program’s investments in emerging science come with real, concrete benefits for the state and its residents,” Pipher said. “These kinds of technologies offer the potential to create jobs, attract new companies and position Rhode Island as among the most competitive states in regard to scientific and economic innovation. And for Brown, EPSCoR continues to be a key source of funding for research that will ultimately make a positive impact on many of the most pressing challenges facing our state and the world beyond. Brown University is grateful for Senator Reed’s continued leadership and support of the EPSCoR programs that do so much for Rhode Island.”The breakdown of five-year funding authorizations to bolster U.S. scientific research, includes $81 billion for the National Science Foundation; $11 billion for programs at the U.S. Commerce Department; and $10 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The measure also authorizes nearly $68 billion for programs at the U.S. Department of Energy.The CHIPS-Plus package was approved by the U.S. Senate on a 64-33 vote, and by the U.S. House of Representatives on a vote of 243-187.Highlights of the science portion of the bill include:"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ripta-gets-2237-million-federal-raise-grant-to-electrify-aquidneck-island-bus-service,"NEWPORT, RI -- The days of diesel-powered buses rolling along Aquidneck Island streets are numbered, thanks to a new federal RAISE grant to procure 25 new clean-energy electric buses and recharging infrastructure.Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline announced a new $22,370,800 federal Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity (RAISE) grant for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). This project will fund charging infrastructure, facility upgrades, and the procurement of approximately 25 battery-electric buses which will enable all Newport-based transit services to be electric.“This federal funding will help accelerate RIPTA’s transition to a clean energy future, curb pollution, and also help pump the brakes on climate change,” said Senator Reed, who helped create the original RAISE grant program (previously known as TIGER and BUILD) in 2009.  Reed also successfully earmarked $4 million for the project in the Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations law and previously delivered a $5.15 million Low-No Emissions Bus Grant to help RIPTA begin to convert its Newport bus fleet to lower emission, clean transportation alternatives.“Battery-powered buses will soon be the cleanest, most efficient way to get around Aquidneck Island,” said Senator Whitehouse, a Newport resident and senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  “This is a win for passengers, who will get to ride on state-of-the-art electric buses, and for our environment.”“Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, RIPTA is on the verge of replacing its diesel-powered buses with a fully electric, Newport-based bus fleet. Soon enough, all public buses operating on Aquidneck Island will be fully electric, and they’ll have the electric charging infrastructure needed to support them,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “I’m proud that these federal dollars will be used to help Rhode Island meet the threat of climate change head on, so the Ocean State can continue leading the charge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from dirty, fossil fuels.”“This significant federal investment in electric buses will help Rhode Island continue to lead the way in green energy innovation. This RAISE grant funding will help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, advance RIPTA’s ongoing efforts to make their fleet more environmentally sustainable, and combat climate change right here at home,” said Congressman Cicilline.“We are grateful for Senator Reed and the entire Congressional delegation’s steadfast support of public transportation, including their commitment to new battery-powered buses with zero emissions,” said Scott Avedisian, RIPTA CEO. “Their help in securing this most recent funding makes it possible for us to continue to move forward with our plan to electrify bus service on Aquidneck Island and our overall goal to improve air quality in our state.”RAISE grants support transportation planning and capital projects that have a significant local or regional impact, particularly in underserved communities.This new federal grant is about increasing opportunity, connecting communities, and preparing for the future. It will help RIPTA advance a major part of the Rhode Island Transit Master Plan.All four members of the delegation voted to include $7.5 billion over five years for RAISE grants in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that was signed into law last year by President Biden.Since 2010, Rhode Island has been awarded over $208 million in competitive RAISE/TIGER/BUILD grants.With this latest grant, RIPTA has now been awarded over $62 million in federal competitive grants since 2018 for capital investments, such as purchasing electric buses, rehabbing its maintenance facilities, and building new bus hubs."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-announces-extra-485-million-to-fix-ri-roads-and-bridges,"PROVIDENCE, RI – In an effort to fix Rhode Island’s roads and bridges, U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD), today announced that Rhode Island is receiving $48,536,933 in additional federal funding for transportation infrastructure upgrades this year.  The additional federal spending authority will help the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) advance shovel-ready projects in the coming weeks while providing the state with enhanced flexibility to allocate state transportation funds to other road and bridge improvement projects.The new money comes from the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) annual August redistribution.  Each year, FHWA shifts transportation funding authority from states unable to utilize the full amount of funding originally authorized to them, as well as from federal transportation grant and loan programs that were underutilized in the current fiscal year, to states that have shovel-ready projects and are able to utilize the funding before the end of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30.To qualify for this extra funding, RIDOT demonstrated that it will fully utilize the $48.5 million in the coming weeks on current projects which fit all requirements for receiving additional federal funding.  The additional funds will benefit several ongoing RIDOT projects, including the East Bay Bike Path, as well as interstate resurfacing and road repaving projects to bring Rhode Island’s roads into a state of good repair, and bridge enhancements such as upgrades to the Park Avenue Railroad Bridge and the Pawtucket River Bridge.“This is good news for the state.  It means an extra $48.5 million in federal funding for road improvements and infrastructure upgrades throughout Rhode Island.  I commend Director Alviti for his strategic and cost-effective management to help modernize our transportation network and put these federal funds to work completing projects ahead of schedule,” said Senator Reed.RIDOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. stated: “Once again, Senator Jack Reed and the Rhode Island delegation have secured funds to expedite bringing Rhode Island’s infrastructure into a state of good repair.  We will use these funds to first, backfill the gap in the actual cost of the East Bay Bike Path bridges with $9 million so we can rebuild both bridges and the remainder we will use for pavement preservation, a priority of Governor McKee.”RIDOT will obligate these funds for specific projects by September 27, 2022.This year’s redistribution for RIDOT brings the total the state has received over the last five years to $146,294,744 and marks a significant increase over last year’s amount of $22,941,747.The FHWA reallocated $6.1 billion in federal funding to states this August after revaluating its fiscal spending projections for 2022.  In order to receive the federal funds, states are required to match a percentage of the federal funds.Senator Reed helped include an estimated $376 million for Rhode Island roads and bridges through the THUD Appropriations section of the fiscal 2022 Appropriations Law and an estimated $1.7 billion in additional funding for Rhode Island’s transportation infrastructure over five years in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/ri-delegation-announces-11m-to-support-survivors-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault,"WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to provide essential services to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and strengthen the state’s support systems for people who have experienced abuse, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline announced nearly $1.1 million in new federal funding to help victims and hold perpetrators accountable.The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence is receiving a $550,000 federal grant under the Justice for Families Program to help provide targeted services for families impacted by sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, or in cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse.The Rhode Island Department of Public Safety is receiving $546,294 through the Sexual Assault Services (SAS) Grant Program, which provides dedicated funding to support rape crisis centers and organizations that provide services, direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual violence and non-offending family and household members of victims, and those collaterally affected by the sexual assault.Both grants are administered by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) and were funded in the fiscal year 2022 appropriations law.“Survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence face immense challenges and this federal funding will help people who’ve been through traumatic crisis get the help they need to be safe and secure and put their lives back together.  It provides survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence with needed support to navigate the justice system and move forward with their healing.  From providing victims with counseling and legal services to safe, secure, temporary housing, this federal funding helps make a meaningful difference for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse,” said Senator Reed.“The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety do heroic work to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in their darkest hour,” said Whitehouse.  “After years prosecuting domestic violence, I’m glad to have helped secure these federal funds to boost the services offered to survivors and help ensure those who need support are able to find a lifeline in a moment of crisis.”“Survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence do incredible work to reclaim their lives after traumatic experiences. The recovery process sometimes includes setbacks, but a lack of targeted, community-based services should never be one of them,” said Congressman Jim Langevin. “I am proud to deliver funding to ensure that survivors have the resources they need to heal on their own terms, and I have every confidence that the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety will help them do just that.”“Far too many victims of domestic violence and sexual assault do not have access to the resources they need and deserve – for themselves and their families,” said Congressman Cicilline. “This funding, and the work and programs it will support at the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, will help countless Rhode Islanders get help and heal after experiencing trauma. These types of programs are exactly why we must continue to renew and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and prevent it from lapsing ever again.”Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence Executive Director Lucy Rios said: “We are tremendously fortunate to receive this essential funding that will better protect the safety of Rhode Islanders impacted by abuse and stalking, particularly communities that are underserved and at high risk for interpersonal violence – including communities of color, immigrants and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.”“We celebrate the establishment of child-friendly safe visitation centers that will be managed by the RICADV’s member agencies, which will keep survivors of violence safe from the abuse they often experience during court-ordered child visitation exchanges with an abusive co-parent. This funding supports our work to expand life-saving services to make this possible, and strengthens the safety net Rhode Island victims and their children rely on,” she continued.The Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations law, passed earlier this year, also included the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization Act, which was supported by all four members of Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation.  The law modernizes and reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act, which supports survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking by providing federal resources and technical support for programs that help victims."

For people with diabetes, their medical expenses are approximately 2.3 times higher than people without diabetes, with many families paying hundreds of dollars every month for life-sustaining insulin medications.The Health Care Costs Institute notes that insulin prices nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, with the average price for a 40-day supply of insulin increasing from $344 to $666 during that span. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical costs and lost work and wages for people with diagnosed diabetes total $327 billion yearly, and the American Diabetes Association has asserted that diabetics account for $1 of every $4 spent on health care in the U.S.  At the same time, a 2021 bipartisan staff report from the Senate Finance Committee found that “[insulin] manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s,” and that “the amount of revenue pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining from insulin has risen.”Indeed, the sale of insulin is one example of how drug companies are gaming the system, charging inflated prices, and putting profits over people.Insulin is not a novel or new treatment that drug companies have invested millions of dollars in discovering.  Scientists developed it in 1923, almost one hundred years ago.  And the scientists who created insulin sold the patent for $1 in an attempt to make the drug widely available.   The major recent price spikes are purely for the profit of executives and shareholders, not recouping capital investments in research and development.Reed and Whitehouse have also teamed up on a slate of key bills this year that would make expensive prescription medications more affordable for Rhode Island families, including:    "

These green infrastructure projects align natural and engineering processes to improve water quality, reduce flooding, and increase efficiency of the water supply, while offering a range of co-benefits, including climate resilience, wildlife habitat, public health, and other socioeconomic and community enhancements.“Natural solutions to runoff pollution and flooding that work with the landscape and the community are the future,” said NBEP Executive Director Mike Gerel. “We are pleased to fill a gap in financial support for the vital pre-project planning work necessary to bring more high-quality green infrastructure to our region.” R.I. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, spearheaded the creation of the Southeast New England Program, which provides funding to NBEP to support programs such as the Green Infrastructure Planning Grants.“Meaningful change takes vision, planning, resources, and execution. I commend Roger Williams University and the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program for coordinating this important effort. These green infrastructure planning grants are an important step toward building a cleaner, more secure, resilient and prosperous future,” said Senator Reed.“EPA is proud of the great work being done in Narragansett Bay as part of the National Estuary Program, in partnership with our Southeast New England Program and other EPA resources. These projects will help local efforts to protect and restore the water quality and ecological integrity in Narragansett Bay,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator David W. Cash. “Estuaries are essential in protecting water quality, providing critical habitat and reducing flood impacts to communities. These benefits are very important here in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.”The Town of Bristol, R.I., is one of the grantees and will receive $70,818 to address stormwater management and long-term water quality goals in a neighborhood off of Metacom Avenue.“The Town of Bristol is very excited to receive the grant for planning our green infrastructure projects in the Sowams/Annawamscutt Neighborhood,” said Diane Williamson, Bristol’s director of community development. “This project will help us identify and plan to incorporate additional green infrastructure projects into Town-owned open space areas which will also provide many co-benefits such as improved recreational areas and habitat.”In Fall River, Mass., Groundwork Southcoast will receive $25,000 to initiate an environmental justice-grounded project to develop green spaces for the community.“Funding from NBEP is monumental for a community like Fall River. This will allow Groundwork Southcoast to implement nature-based solutions that will connect historically disenfranchised residents from Fall River’s wonderful natural resources,” said Eric Andrade, the Community Systems and Climate Manager of Groundwork Southcoast. “As someone who grew up in a Fall River ‘environmental justice’ neighborhood, unable to play outside and experience the environment around me, I can attest firsthand how bridging these gaps for residents of today can make a massive impact in how people engage with our natural and urban green and blue spaces.”The grants were awarded through a competitive process overseen by NBEP’s Grants Subcommittee. These projects were chosen because they will address stormwater pollution concerns and advance the capacity of the region to identify and implement future green infrastructure projects.

Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act of 2022
(S.4120).  Reed and Capito were joined in introducing the bill by Senators
Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).  This bipartisan legislation
would reauthorize the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, the most comprehensive
childhood cancer bill ever passed by Congress, which approved the measure
unanimously in 2018. The STAR Act helps advance pediatric cancer research and
child-focused cancer treatments, while also improving childhood cancer
surveillance and providing resources for survivors and those impacted by
childhood cancer.  Since being signed into law the STAR Act has helped
deliver over $120 million to fund promising childhood cancer research and
assist patients and families battling cancer.“Reauthoring the STAR Act would mean more help for kids battling
cancer.  It will target federal research to ensure the medical community
is better equipped to diagnose and treat pediatric cancers and assist young
patients and their families.  Renewing the STAR Act will get us closer to
the goal of one day curing cancers in children, adolescents, and young adults,”
said Senator Reed.  “The Childhood Cancer STAR Act will support
cancer research and deliver needed assistance to children with cancer and their
families.  It will develop new strategies to help survivors overcome late
health effects, such as secondary cancers.”“I was incredibly proud to be part of the passage of the STAR Act
in 2018, which has made an important difference in the lives of children with
cancer, we well as childhood cancer survivors and their families. Since that
time, the legislation has resulted in unprecedented opportunities and funding
for childhood cancer research, allowed us to better understand and track the
incidence of disease, and improved the quality of life for childhood cancer
survivors. This reauthorization will allow these opportunities to continue and
bring us closer to a world without childhood cancer,” Senator Capito said.“Far too many families in Maryland and across the country face the
nightmare of a child with cancer – and while their stories are all different,
all of these mothers, fathers, and children are looking for hope,” said Senator
Van Hollen, who introduced the Childhood Cancer STAR Act during his time in
the House of Representatives. “That’s why we fought to pass the initial
Childhood Cancer STAR Act, and why we’re working invest in even more research
and better treatments. Maryland is proud to be home to both NIH and NCI, and
this investment will help them ultimately save lives.”“Cancer is an unimaginable and heartbreaking experience for
anyone—particularly for children who are diagnosed and the caregivers who
support them in their treatment journey. The STAR Act Reauthorization takes a
multifaceted approach to addressing childhood cancer by boosting research
efforts, bolstering data collection, and improving the quality of life for all
the brave children who’ve survived this awful disease,” said Senator
Murkowski. “I’m proud to help introduce a comprehensive childhood cancer
bill in an effort to help create a world for future generations where the
phrase ‘you have cancer’ doesn’t exist.”There are over one hundred different subtypes of childhood
cancers.  Most new cancer diagnoses in children are for leukemia (28.1%)
and brain/CNS cancers (26.5%), while malignant epithelial neoplasms and
melanomas (23.3%) and brain/CNS cancers (21.9%) are top cancers for
adolescents, according to Children’s Cancer Cause.Childhood cancer research has progressed in recent years, but
after accidents, cancer is still the second leading cause of death in children
ages 1 to 14, according to the American Cancer Society.   Health
experts estimate that nearly 10,500 children in the United States under the age
of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2022.U.S. Representatives Michael McCaul (R-TX), Jackie Speier (D-CA),
G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), and Mike Kelly (R-PA), are introducing companion
legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.Summary: The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and
Research (STAR) Reauthorization Act of 2022Expand Opportunities for Childhood Cancer Research: 
Due to the relatively small population of children with cancer and the
geographic distance between these children, researching childhood cancer can be
challenging.  As such, the Childhood Cancer STAR Act reauthorizes and
expands existing efforts at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to collect
biospecimens for childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical
trials to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demographic
information on all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.Improve Childhood Cancer Surveillance: 
Building upon previous efforts, this bill authorizes grants to state cancer
registries to identify and track incidences of child, adolescent, and young
adult cancer.  This funding will be used to identify and train reporters
of childhood cancer cases, secure infrastructure to ensure early reporting and
capture of child cancer incidences, and support the collection of cases into a
national childhood cancer registry.Help Improve Quality of Life Opportunities for Childhood Cancer
Survivors:  Unfortunately, even after beating cancer, as many as
two-thirds of survivors suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment,
including secondary cancers and organ damage. This legislation will enhance
research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improve collaboration among
providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they
age, and establish a new pilot program to begin to explore innovative models of
care for childhood cancer survivors.
Ensure Pediatric Expertise at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH):  Requires the inclusion of at least one expert in pediatric
oncology on the National Cancer Advisory Board and would improve childhood
health reporting requirements to include pediatric cancer."

We must continue to support them in this fight. “Time is of the essence. Ukraine is fighting for its security and sovereignty and to halt Putin’s aggression.  Congress must expeditiously work together on a bipartisan basis to get more help to Ukraine without further delay. “I look forward to thoroughly reviewing this request and strongly support President Biden’s continued leadership on Ukraine.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-and-rounds-lead-bipartisan-call-for-treasury-to-scrutinize-governance-of-bnpl-products,"WASHINGTON, DC – As more Americans shop online and more online retailers offer consumers the option to utilize financial technology to pay using installments, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) are urging the U.S. Treasury Department to assess the effects on competition posed by the entry of nonbanks into the market for “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) products in its forthcoming report on financial technology firms and non-banks’ entry into consumer finance markets.Today, Reed and Rounds sent a letter urging Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to scrutinize the governance of BNPL products to make sure that certain nonbank institutions, which aren’t supervised like banks, don’t unfairly harm customers.BNPL products allow shoppers to divide the cost of their purchases over several months interest-free, although consumers can face late fees. For online merchants, a returned product means the merchant was charged a BNPL fee that may not be refunded by the BNPL lender.  If they are well-designed, transparent, accountable, and supervised for compliance with federal consumer protection laws, BNPL products can legitimately serve an important role in meeting the needs of consumers and businesses. But the largest participants in the market are not currently subject to meaningful federal supervision.In their letter to Treasury, the Senators note that: “The BNPL market is currently dominated by nonbank lenders.  While all BNPL products are subject to basic consumer protection laws and regulations, the nonbanks that are the largest participants in this market are not subject to ongoing federal supervision that can spot violations of those rules.  By contrast, banks are subject to routine federal oversight for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.  A gap in supervision could contribute to an uneven playing field between banks and nonbank BNPL providers that provide similar forms of consumer credit.”Full text of the letter follows:April 27, 2022The Honorable Janet YellenSecretaryU.S. Department of the Treasury1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20220Dear Secretary Yellen:We write to urge the Treasury Department to assess the effects on competition posed by the entry of nonbanks into the market for buy now, pay later (BNPL) products.BNPL is a type of unsecured deferred payment or short term installment loan that a consumer obtains when making a purchase.  BNPL credit is typically extended to the consumer at the point of sale—usually online, but sometimes in-store—to finance a specific product.  In a typical BNPL extension of credit, the customer pays a portion (often 25%) of the item’s price at the time of purchase and the remainder in equal installments.  Consumers usually pay no interest and only are charged fees for late payments.  So long as payments are made on time, BNPL credit is free to consumers. The BNPL market has experienced extraordinary growth over the past two years, catalyzed by the pandemic driving more merchants to sell products online and through mobile apps.  This trend is likely to continue.  The emergence of BNPL has potentially provided some consumers with an affordable alternative to more costly forms of credit.  BNPL has also provided small businesses with important new sales channels to meet rapidly changing consumer preferences and behavior.  As the market for BNPL products continues to grow, we share an interest in ensuring that this market remains fair, transparent, and competitive. The BNPL market is currently dominated by nonbank lenders.  While all BNPL products are subject to basic consumer protection laws and regulations, the nonbanks that are the largest participants in this market are not subject to ongoing federal supervision that can spot violations of those rules.  By contrast, banks are subject to routine federal oversight for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.  A gap in supervision could contribute to an uneven playing field between banks and nonbank BNPL providers that provide similar forms of consumer credit. In July 2021, the President issued an executive order on promoting competition in the American economy.  That executive order directed the Treasury Department to submit a report to the White House “assessing the effects on competition of large technology firms’ and other non-bank companies’ entry into consumer finance markets.”  We urge you to consider in the forthcoming report whether nonbank BNPL providers may enjoy a competitive advantage over banks due to a lack of meaningful federal oversight. We appreciate your attention to this important matter, and look forward to your prompt reply. Sincerely,"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-and-whitehouse-applaud-presidents-nomination-of-lara-montecalvo-to-the-us-court-of-appeals-for-the-first-circuit,"PROVIDENCE, RI – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse today applauded President Biden for nominating Lara E. Montecalvo, who currently leads the office of the Rhode Island Public Defender, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  The announcement comes after Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse undertook an open and in-depth selection process that included extensive interviews and careful deliberation before they jointly made their recommendations to the President.The First Circuit, based in Boston, hears appeals of federal cases from Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico.  The First Circuit is one of 13 appellate courts that sit just one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court.“Lara Montecalvo is an exceptional public servant with sterling legal credentials and a profound respect for the rule of law.  She has practiced law in every court in Rhode Island and earned high marks from her peers across the legal spectrum.  She is highly qualified for this important position and will bring a unique perspective and diversity of experience to the First Circuit.  We urge the Senate to consider and confirm her nomination in a swift and timely manner,” said Reed and Whitehouse in a joint statement.Montecalvo’s extensive litigation and appellate experience handling both criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts make her an exceptionally qualified choice.A resident of Barrington who moved to Rhode Island with her family when she was in the fourth grade, Montecalvo, 48, serves as chief public defender and is tasked with providing high-quality legal representation for Rhode Islanders who cannot afford to hire an attorney in criminal, juvenile, and parental rights cases.  Montecalvo has over twenty years of legal experience at the state and federal level.  She and her husband, Craig, have a son.Montecalvo earned a bachelor of arts degree from Swarthmore College and went on to attend Boston College Law School, where she graduated magna cum laude in 2000.After graduating from law school, Montecalvo worked as a trial lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, DC for four years, focusing on civil tax matters in federal courts before joining the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office in 2004.  Before being confirmed as the state’s Public Defender, Montecalvo served as Chief of the Appellate Division of the Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office.Reed and Whitehouse successfully recommended her predecessor in the Chief Public Defender’s office, Mary McElroy, be nominated to a seat on the federal bench at the U.S. District Court.It is customary for the President to ask U.S. Senators for recommendations for judicial appointments, although ultimately it is the President’s role to nominate a candidate who must then be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.Once Montecalvo’s nomination is formally received by the U.S. Senate, it will then be sent to the Judiciary Committee, which Senator Whitehouse serves on, to be considered, reviewed, and reported out by the committee.  After that process is completed, the nomination must then be confirmed by the full Senate.  If confirmed by the full U.S. Senate, Montecalvo will fill the vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that was created by Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson announcing her plan to take senior status.  Once a successor is confirmed, Judge Thompson will continue hearing cases, but on a more limited basis."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-helps-pass-bills-to-suspend-normal-trade-relations-with-russia-ban-russian-energy-imports-and-speed-up-military-assistance-to-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, DC – In a show of solidarity with
the people of Ukraine, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved several key pieces
of legislation this week designed to inflict greater costs on Russia as a
result of the continued violence in Ukraine.  The new measures hold the
Kremlin accountable and provide President Biden with streamlined authority to
provide military equipment to Ukraine.U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, backed the measures and says they are all the more urgent
in light of the horrific scenes of violence perpetrated against civilians.“Vladimir Putin must be held accountable for the atrocities
committed during this unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  By ratcheting up
sanctions, delivering security assistance, and further isolating Putin from the
civilized world, the United States is committed to ensuring that Putin pays a
steep price for the barbaric bloodshed he unleashed.  Taken together,
these measures will deliver severe consequences to Putin and take a bite out of
the Kremlin’s ability to wage this illegal and immoral invasion,” said Reed.This week, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Ukraine
Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act.  This initiative provides President Joe
Biden with streamlined authority to lend or lease defense articles to the
Ukrainian government.Congress has already approved over $14 billion in military and
humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Additionally, the Senate unanimously voted to ban the import of
Russian oil and energy products and suspend normal trade relations with Russia
and Belarus. The U.S. House of Representatives passed bills to suspend trade
relations and ban Russian energy products, which now go to the President’s desk
to be signed into law.  Together, these measures will further undermine
Putin’s ability to wage war against the people of Ukraine.

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/on-earth-day-ri-nets-561784-to-protect-local-wildlife-and-habitat,"PROVIDENCE, RI -- In an effort to support the
state’s conservation priorities for fish and wildlife species, U.S. Senator
Jack Reed today announced that Rhode Island will receive a $561,784 State
Wildlife Grant (SWG) from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This new federal
funding will be used to protect and preserve natural habitats supporting rare
and unique species.According to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management (DEM), which will administer the federal funding, Rhode Island is
home to almost 900 vertebrate and an estimated 20,000 invertebrate wildlife
species that range from the scenic coastline to upland and wetland forests.“I’m pleased to help deliver these conservation action dollars for
the state.  Preserving Rhode Island’s habitat and wildlife is critical to
our environment, economy, and quality of life,” said Senator Reed. “The state
has identified its conservation needs and these federal dollars will help
ensure it has the resources to preserve open spaces and protect endangered fish
and wildlife species and their habitats.”DEM developed a comprehensive Wildlife
Action Plan (WAP).  The WAP identifies the state’s Species of Greatest Conservation
Need and key habitats, and assesses the condition of and threats to both, along
with conservation measures designed to ensure their long-term survival. 
The state’s WAP notes: “Even though it is the smallest and the second-most
densely populated state in the U.S., Rhode Island’s wildlife is remarkably
diverse. It includes thousands of resident and migratory species of mammals,
birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, beetles, butterflies and moths, and other
insects, freshwater mollusks, annelids, crustaceans, and other marine
invertebrates.  From the western highlands to the coastlines and the
adjoining ocean waters, the state supports a broad spectrum of biodiversity,
ranging from the rarest and most endangered species to the most common and
abundant.”Federal SWG funds may be used to address a variety of local
conservation needs, such as research, wildlife surveys, species and habitat
management, and monitoring in Rhode Island.  These funds may also be used
to update, revise or modify Rhode Island’s WAP.
DEM partnered with the Rhode Island chapter of The Nature
Conservancy and the University of Rhode Island to update its Wildlife Action
Plan in 2015."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-announces-additional-25-million-to-help-ri-families-save-on-home-energy-bills,"WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to help more Rhode Islanders reduce their home energy costs, U.S. Senator Jack Reed today announced that Rhode Island is getting an additional $2,501,975 through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  Senator Reed led the bipartisan effort to secure this funding, which was signed into law in March as part of the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act.This latest allocation brings Rhode Island’s annual appropriation for LIHEAP up to $25,045,363.  And it comes on top of $30.8 million in federal LIHEAP funds for Rhode Island that Reed helped deliver through the American Rescue Plan Act (P.L. 117-2).“The pandemic and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to spiking energy prices, which is especially tough on seniors on fixed incomes and families with limited means.  LIHEAP helps our most vulnerable neighbors afford their energy bills.  I will continue working to bring down energy costs and deliver aid for those who need it.  America must work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and keep more of our domestic oil here at home while building toward a cleaner, more secure, resilient energy future,” said Reed.LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills by providing payment and energy crisis assistance to pay for gas, electric, and other methods customers use to heat their homes.  LIHEAP is administered by states and accessed through local Community Action Agencies.  Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources.As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Reed has long led the effort to fully fund the LIHEAP program along with U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME).Nationwide, an estimated 5.3 million households received assistance with heating and cooling costs through LIHEAP in 2020.Over 26,000 Rhode Island households benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $550 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders.The funding announced today represents the remaining 10 percent of the initial Fiscal Year 2022 LIHEAP funding release, as well as the $50 million added by Congress in the final Fiscal Year 2022 government funding law.

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-seeks-to-help-families-impacted-by-baby-formula-shortage," WASHINGTON, DC -- After a major recall by baby formula maker Abbott Nutrition – the company behind brands such as Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare -- retailers in Rhode Island and nationwide are reporting shortages of baby formula with some stores rationing sales.Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) sent a letter urging the Biden Administration to take action to address the baby formula shortage.  Senator Reed also encourages new parents to talk to their pediatricians for advice on using alternative brands.  Pediatricians stress that parents should never make homemade formula or switch to dairy whole milk early, as these options can be dangerous for infants.“This recent baby formula shortage is causing a lot of stress for new parents and it can be hard to find a specific brand at local stores.  But the good news is there is plenty of baby formula to go around, we just need to get it to those in need.  I want to ensure the federal government is doing its part, being proactive, and helping new moms and dads and solve this issue,” said Reed.  “It can sometimes be challenging to track down the right brand of formula, especially for babies with allergies or sensitive stomachs.  I know a lot of new parents are working together to help each other out.  Whether it is shopping online or letting other parents know which store has which formula in stock, there are several ways to help ease this short term problem and take steps to ensure it doesn’t become a long-term issue.”Reed’s letter notes that many factors, including inadequate staffing and supply chain disruptions for key ingredients, have contributed to the baby formula shortage, and the recent recalls of certain Abbott Nutrition powdered formula products due to possible Cronobacter sakazakii contamination have exacerbated the situation.Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that Abbott Nutrition failed to properly maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at its production plant in Michigan.  Abbott initiated a voluntary recall.  As a result, approximately 30 percent of popular baby formula brands may be sold out across the nation, according to an analysis by retail data analytics firm Datasembly, which assessed supplies in over 11,000 stores nationwide.  That is up sharply from 11 percent shortage found in November. In Rhode Island, the current rate of stores reporting “out of stock” rates for certain baby formulas may be even higher.According to Datasembly’s analysis, Minnesota had the highest out-of-stock percentage for baby formula the week of March 13th, 2022 at 54 percent, followed by Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Texas, all at 40 percent or higher.In Reed’s letter to the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FDA, he asked a series of questions:“1.What steps have your agencies taken to minimize the impact of the immediate shortage?“2.When do your agencies expect baby formula inventory to be back to sufficient levels?“3.What measures should be taken in the long term to minimize the supply chain disruptions for what is an essential product for many families?”Industry experts estimate that the baby formula shortage should improve in the near future as production ramps up again in the coming weeks. The American Academy of Pediatrics urges parents to buy no more than a two-week supply of formula to help ease the shortage."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-collins-merkley-lead-bipartisan-effort-to-boost-outdoor-education-and-connect-more-kids-to-nature,"WASHINGTON, DC - In an effort to reconnect more kids with nature, improve their mental and physical health, and address critical environmental challenges, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) today introduced legislation to strengthen and expand environmental education in America’s classrooms. The No Child Left Inside Act (S. 4041) will help bring locally developed, high-quality environmental education programs to more schools nationwide by authorizing up to $150 million annually in federal assistance to states to develop and implement environmental literacy plans.  The bill would also promote professional development for teachers on how to integrate environmental literacy and field experiences into their instruction and establish competitive grants to help schools partner with colleges and non-profits to expand research-based practices in outdoor education.Companion legislation is being introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman John Sarbanes (D-MD).Recent studies show that kids today are spending less time outside than previous generations and more time on screens.  Yet the benefits of time outdoors and connecting with nature are numerous, including:“Environmental education has so many positive impacts, from reconnecting kids with nature to health benefits, to boosting math and science test scores.  The No Child Left Inside Act will help more states provide effective environmental education programs and integrate environmental literacy and outdoor learning into other core subjects.  Ensuring students understand the natural world prepares them to navigate environmental challenges that impact our communities.  Our bipartisan bill will help more kids get outside and ensure they are learning about the world around them so they can take better care of it and each other,” said Senator Reed.  “Environmental awareness should be second nature for our young people and protecting the environment is crucial to future economic growth.”“Maine’s abundant natural resources and pristine environment make it an idyllic place for children to grow up,” said Senator Collins.  “From our verdant western mountains to our rugged coastline and all of the lakes, ponds, forests, and rivers in between, there are endless opportunities for young people to explore and enjoy the outdoors.  Our bipartisan legislation would provide grants to states to integrate environmental education into their core curriculum and also establish an outdoor education pilot program so that students can learn more about the native flora, fauna, and ecosystems in their own backyard and be inspired with a lifelong love of nature.”“Just as Oregon’s shores, forests and deserts have long been woven into the spirit of our state, America’s incredible public lands have made invaluable contributions to every region of our country,” said Senator Merkley. “It is our responsibility to be good stewards of those treasures—and to make sure our kids have the knowledge and resources to continue that stewardship—so these treasures can be enjoyed by future generations of hikers, hunters, fishermen, and other outdoor recreationists. I look forward to working with Senators Reed and Collins in ensuring our kids and future climate defenders have the education, experience, and knowledge of the world around them to protect Oregon’s—and America’s—great outdoor spaces for years to come.”The No Child Left Inside Act will help provide federal grants to states for partnerships between school districts and parks, natural resource management agencies, educator preparation programs, and museums or other organizations with expertise in engaging young people with real world examples of environmental and scientific concepts.  The legislation also establishes a pilot program for outdoor school education programs that offer intensive, hands-on learning experiences, such as residential programs and summer camps.The No Child Left Inside Act will also help coordinate federal efforts on environmental education.  It requires the Secretary of Education to establish an environmental literacy advisory panel to coordinate and report on environmental literacy activities across federal agencies.  It will also provide easy access to environmental education resources through the Department of Education’s website.When children explore the outdoors, it increases their physical activity level and may also help boost their self-esteem and improve their academic performance in other subjects.  A study by the American Institutes for Research shows that children who participated in outdoor education programs significantly raised their science test scores by 27 percent, as measured by a pre- and post-survey administered immediately upon their return to school.The No Child Left Inside Act has the support of nearly 100 organizations, representing educators, parks, museums, environmental organizations, and community-based organizations at the national, state, and local levels, including:American Federation of TeachersAssociation of Nature Center AdministratorsAssociation of Zoos and AquariumsChildren & Nature NetworkChoose OutdoorsEarth ForceEARTHDAY.ORGEcoRiseElevate YouthGlobal ChoicesGreen GuardiansInstitute for Humane EducationKwauk and AssociatesLatino OutdoorsNational Education AssociationNational Science Teaching AssociationNational Wildlife FederationNorth American Association for Environmental Education NatureBridge Outdoors Alliance for Kids (OAK)Preston-Werner VenturesREI Co-opSierra ClubSkyDaySustainable Forestry Initiative/Project Learning TreeThe Center for Green Schools at USGBCThe Wild CenterUndauntedK12Wilderness InquirySTATE/REGIONALBuffalo Audubon Society, Inc.Cape Cod Hill SchoolCathance River Education AllianceCentral Adventure ClubChesapeake Bay FoundationChewonkiChihuahuan Desert Research InstituteCincinnati Nature CenterClear Lake Education CenterDenali Education CenterDunes Learning CenterEagle Bluff Environmental Learning CenterEmpowerEd DCEnvironmental Education Alliance (Georgia)Environmental Educators of North CarolinaEnvironmental Living and Learning for Maine StudentsFriends of AcadiaFriends of the Cobbossee WatershedFriends of Outdoor SchoolGray Family FoundationGreat Smoky Mountains institute at Tremont Gulf Coast Bird Observatory HealthReach Community Health Centers of MaineHitchcock Center for the EnvironmentIrvine Nature CenterLeaps of ImaginationLeslie Science & Nature Center Maine Association for the Education of Young ChildrenMaine Environmental Education AssociationMaine Public Health AssociationMaine Youth for Climate JusticeMaryland Association for Environmental and Outdoor EducationMississippi Delta Nature and Learning Center Mount St. Helens InstituteNature Based Education ConsortiumNature at the ConfluenceNew Hampshire Environmental EducatorsOsprey Wilds Environmental Learning CenterPajarito Environmental Education CenterPfeiffer Nature CenterPotomac Valley Audubon Society, Inc.

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-justice-jackson-will-truly-be-a-justice-for-all," WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Jack Reed released the following statement today following his vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the 116th U.S. Supreme Court Justice in history and the first Black woman and former public defender to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme Court:“Judge Jackson is an extraordinary talent who reflects and represents the very best of our nation.  Throughout her distinguished career, Judge Jackson has proven herself as a defender of America’s core principles and freedoms, a protector of civil liberties, and an impartial arbiter of justice.  As the first federal public defender on the Supreme Court, she will bring a valuable perspective to the Court’s decisions.“She is living proof that through hard work, determination, and perseverance, you can achieve your dreams.  Her confirmation is a personal achievement that also signals a sense of national belonging for millions of Americans, including women, and especially, Black women.  It’s long past time America had a Black woman on the Supreme Court.  Justice Jackson is the first and certainly won’t be the last. I believe she will be among the very best to serve on the highest court in the land.  “As another racial barrier falls we must once again thank those brave Americans who fought and sacrificed for our civil rights -- those who marched and rallied and persevered in places like Seneca Falls, Selma, Stonewall, and so many others.  It is up to us to continue that climb toward true equality for all and fulfill the promise of our nation’s founding principles.” "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-steers-56m-to-ri-public-transit-in-2022," WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that Rhode Island will get $55,927,788 in federal transit funding for fiscal year 2022 thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (P.L. 117-58).  This funding level provides 58 percent more federal aid for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) to modernize and expand mass transit services across the state.  Senator Reed estimates the state will receive $291.6 million in federal mass-transit funding over the next five years, an $88.3 million boost over the life of the law.Senator Reed played an important role in crafting mass-transit investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to benefit Rhode Island and make critical investments in America’s public transportation infrastructure. “Mass transit is ultimately about human connections, enhancing mobility, expanding opportunity, and strengthening our economy.  I worked to deliver historic investments in our mass-transit funding to improve and expand Rhode Island’s bus and rail service and create better public transportation options for residents.  Without this significant federal investment, local traffic and pollution would only get worse.  By removing cars from our roads and building a coordinated, forward looking public transportation network will help reduce traffic, lower emissions, and boost economic development and opportunity,” said Senator Reed.  “I am proud to work directly with FTA Administrator Nuria Fernandez to direct more federal mass-transit funding opportunities to Rhode Island.  This federal funding will create jobs and help open doors of opportunity for every Rhode Islander.”Full-year funding is available now following Congressional passage of the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act (also known as the Omnibus spending bill).  On March 15, Senator Reed joined President Biden as he signed the omnibus into law.The $55,927,788 for Rhode Island released today reflects funding increases authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and will allow RIPTA to purchase new state-of-the-art buses, address repair backlogs, modernize their fleet, and transition to new technologies to address the climate crisis.Senator Reed also noted that Rhode Island will have an opportunity to compete for additional federal mass-transit funds in the form of competitive grants.Overall, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides up to $108 billion for public transit and $102 billion for commuter rail, Amtrak, and freight rail over the next five years.Reed noted the money comes at a time when RIPTA is starting to rebuild ridership after the pandemic caused a significant downturn.  The additional federal funds will help ensure that Rhode Island can meet the ambitious goals defined in the Transit Forward RI 2040. “RIPTA adapted during the pandemic and continued to deliver for people when we needed them.  This additional funding should help them continue with recovery and it will help deliver reliable service so people can spend less and increase mobility options,” said Reed.  “Whether you ride RIPTA or not, there are health, economic, and environmental benefits for everyone when we reduce the number of cars on the road sitting in traffic.  We’ve got to continue to invest and look forward and build toward the future.  Delivering these funds is a major step in the right direction.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-backs-10-billion-bipartisan-covid-19-preparedness-funding-agreement,"WAHINGTON, DC -- Today, after Congressional negotiators reached an agreement on a bipartisan $10 billion COVID-19 Supplemental Appropriations package, U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee, issued the following statement:“This money is needed to protect Americans and save lives.  It will help purchase more tests and vaccines and improve public health.  It will ensure medicines and treatments are readily available and hospitals have the supplies they need.  We can’t afford to be complacent or get caught off guard by the next surge.  This bipartisan agreement will improve our preparedness. “Still, I am disappointed by some of the offsets and that we were not able to get bipartisan cooperation to combat the pandemic globally.  Shortchanging the global response is short-sighted and could lead to the emergence of new, more transmissible variants in other parts of the world.  Blocking global vaccination efforts leaves Americans more vulnerable.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-hails-bidens-plan-to-leverage-strategic-petroleum-reserve-to-help-drive-down-gas-prices,"Sen. Reed applauded the administration’s actions to help calm oil markets, stabilize prices, and deny Russia a revenue windfall from its illegal invasion of UkraineWASHINGTON, DC -- Today, the White House announced a plan to release one million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in order to calm markets, stabilize prices, and deny Russia a major source of revenue.U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), who led calls for an SPR release, praised the plan as a needed step to help lower gas prices and counter the worldwide economic impact of Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Reed, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has repeatedly urged Middle Eastern partners to take additional measures to help calm markets and stabilize prices in the near term in order to deny Russia a revenue windfall from its illegal invasion.This follows the administration’s announcement yesterday of $3.16 billion in new funding through the Weatherization Assistance Program to retrofit thousands of homes to make them more energy efficient while lowering utility bills for low-income families.  Senator Reed, a vocal supporter of the Weatherization Assistance Program, led the effort to secure this funding to help more families and seniors save on energy costs.  Households that participate in the program save $372 per year in heating and cooling costs.The President announced that his administration will invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to support the production and processing of minerals and materials used for electric vehicle and other types of batteries. Invoking the DPA will help boost domestic secure sources of supply for critical materials and bolster domestic capabilities and processes to manufacture the downstream components crucial to electric vehicles and batteries.Today, Senator Reed issued the following statement:“Given the current global nature of the oil market, there is no single solution here.  But this is an important moment in the United States’ response to Putin’s abhorrent attack.  Putin is banking on high oil and gas prices to destabilize allied resolve and fill his war chest.  The global community can’t let him get away with it. “I urged President Biden to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help lower fuel prices for American families and businesses, and I am pleased he is using all available policy levers to take responsible, effective, and coordinated action to help bring down the price of oil that has spiked due to Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine.“I support the President’s strategy to invoke the DPA, as this plan will enhance our battery production capabilities and shows a commitment to domestic battery production and clean energy. This is a forward-thinking approach that will pay dividends in the form of savings for American families, good jobs, and a reduced dependence on foreign oil and other materials critical to the modern economy.“Major oil companies are pocketing their highest profits in years, and, instead of investing in production, they’re pocketing them and doing stock buy backs. Meanwhile families see those big profits for what they are: a big reason for high prices at the pump.  I’m glad the President is making it clear big oil’s profit taking and Putin’s illegal war play a big role in these price spikes.“I also urge our Middle Eastern partners to use the economic tools at their disposal to help counter Russian aggression and provide a measure of certainty to global markets.  They can start by simply closing the significant gap between their stated oil production targets and actual output, which could be as high as 1 million barrels per day, according to the head of the International Energy Agency.“Our Middle Eastern partners should help the world calm markets, stabilize oil prices, and deny Russia a major revenue windfall from its criminal invasion of Ukraine.”"

DC --
After a one-on-one meeting with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson today, U.S. Senator
Jack Reed (D-RI) announced he will vote in favor of her nomination to be an
Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This
will mark the fourth time Senator Reed will offer his stamp of approval in
favor of her nomination.  The first time was in 2010, after President
Obama nominated Jackson to become vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing
Commission.  Then in 2012, Senator Reed supported her nomination to serve
on the federal District Court in Washington, DC, where she served for eight
years.  Last June, after President Biden nominated Jackson for a seat on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit, Senator Reed was again among a
bipartisan group of U.S. Senators who backed her nomination.Today,
Senator Reed reaffirmed his strong support for Judge Jackson to sit on the
highest court in the land, and in doing so, make history as the first Black
woman and first former federal public defender to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme
Court.“Judge
Jackson is exceptional, exemplary, and extremely well qualified.  As a
judge, she has proven herself to be an impartial arbiter of justice for
all.  I am confident she will make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice
and I proudly support her nomination.“During
her hearings, the American people got to see Judge Jackson’s principled wisdom,
thoughtfulness, and integrity firsthand.  Today, she continued to impress
me in our meeting as we discussed an array of issues that are important to Rhode
Islanders and working families everywhere.“Rare
is the judge who is endorsed by such a broad cross-section of the legal
community: from public defenders to 83 Republican and Democratic former state
attorneys general, from the National Education Association to the Fraternal
Order of Police.  Judge Jackson’s keen intellect and sterling credentials
are undeniable.“Not
since Justice Thurgood Marshall has our nation had a Supreme Court Justice with
a criminal defense background.  And I know Judge Jackson will always
uphold the Constitution and defend the public good.  In word and deed,
Judge Jackson has demonstrated a commitment to equal protection under the law.“Today,
I am reminded of one of Justice Marshall’s many famous quotes: “I wish I
could say that racism and prejudice were only distant memories. We must dissent
from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from
the fear, the hatred and the mistrust…We must dissent because America can do
better, because America has no choice but to do better.”“In
elevating Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court, America is in fact doing
better.  Her journey to this point is inspiring.  She can help
restore people’s faith in the fairness of the Supreme Court and ensure it
better reflects the diversity of our great nation and truly represents the
interests of all Americans.“Judge
Jackson is a trailblazer.  While her individual accomplishments are
personal, her ascension to the Supreme Court is a uniquely American triumph
that ‘We The People’ can all share pride in.“I
look forward to once again casting my vote for her confirmation.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/senators-urge-administration-to-require-investment-advisers-to-proactively-combat-money-laundering-and-support-sanctions-compliance,"WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to combat money laundering and sanctions evasion, a group of six Senate Committee Chairs led by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) sent a letter to the Treasury Department urging the agency to revise and reissue proposed rules from 2015 that would have imposed anti-money laundering (AML) and suspicious activity report filing requirements on investment advisers, including advisers to private equity funds and hedge funds.Advisers to private funds have enjoyed an exemption from requirements to maintain AML programs, verify the identities of their customers, and report suspicious transactions to the U.S. government.  This exemption has made private funds a potentially attractive avenue for money launderers and sanctioned persons to hide their wealth, and the Senators urge Treasury to move as quickly as practicable to address this weakness in the AML system.In addition to Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Chair of the Armed Services Committee, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chair of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee; Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chair of the Finance Committee; Richard Durbin (D?IL), Chair of the Judiciary Committee; Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee; and Mark Warner (D-VA), Chair of the Intelligence Committee. “Requiring advisers to establish AML programs, report suspicious activity, and file currency transaction reports, among other requirements, would go a long way towards deterring [politically exposed Russians]—and other illicit actors—from using private equity funds, hedge funds, venture capital funds, credit funds, real estate funds, and other private pools of capital to enter the U.S. financial system.  Following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the United States has worked with its allies and partners to find the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. However, loopholes and vulnerabilities in our financial reporting laws have made it increasingly challenging for federal investigators to identify where oligarchs and other criminal actors are placing their assets.  Holding investment advisers to the same AML standards applicable to other financial institutions would help achieve this important national security objective,” the Senators wrote.Full text of the letter follows:We write to urge the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to revise and reissue, as necessary, proposed rules from 2015 on anti-money laundering (AML) and suspicious activity report filing requirements for investment advisers. In doing so, we urge FinCEN to use its discretionary authority to include investment advisers in the definition of “financial institution” in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which would require them to file currency transaction reports and keep certain records related to the transmittal of funds. Finally, we urge FinCEN to work with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure adequate examination of the industry for AML purposes.Investment advisers are exempt from requirements to maintain AML programs, verify the identities of their customers, and report suspicious transactions to FinCEN. Other financial institutions like banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers in commodities, and insurance companies, among others, have been subject to these requirements for decades. According to the SEC’s Investment Adviser Information Reports, during just the last ten years, assets under management attributed to registered investment advisers has ballooned from approximately $44 trillion to approximately $113 trillion, raising fresh questions of whether FinCEN should eliminate these special exemptions.The private funds segment of the asset management industry may be particularly attractive for money launderers and sanctioned persons due to existing regulatory gaps. In an Intelligence Bulletin from May 2020, the FBI indicated with high confidence that “threat actors likely use private placement of funds, including investments offered by hedge funds and private equity firms, to launder money, circumventing traditional AML programs.” Press reports have confirmed the FBI’s assessment. According to an article in Buzzfeed, a prominent Russian oligarch has used opaque corporate structures to invest at least $1.3 billion with private funds managed by U.S. investment advisers. And according to the New York Times, this very same oligarch made up to 100 investments in hedge funds and private equity funds managed by the nation’s largest asset managers, which allegedly did not confirm the source of these funds.While the largest advisers to private funds may voluntarily implement AML programs, those advisers are not subject to regular examinations to test the adequacy of their programs. No government agency currently holds advisers accountable for adhering to their voluntary AML and sanctions compliance commitments. By contrast, banks, broker-dealers, and insurance companies are subject to periodic examinations to spot violations of the BSA and any compliance weaknesses.Last month, FinCEN issued an alert warning financial institutions to be vigilant against attempts by politically exposed Russians to launder money, evade sanctions, and hide their assets. Requiring advisers to establish AML programs, report suspicious activity, and file currency transaction reports, among other requirements, would go a long way towards deterring these individuals—and other illicit actors—from using private equity funds, hedge funds, venture capital funds, credit funds, real estate funds, and other private pools of capital to enter the U.S. financial system. Following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the United States has worked with its allies and partners to find the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. However, loopholes and vulnerabilities in our financial reporting laws have made it increasingly challenging for federal investigators to identify where oligarchs and other criminal actors are placing their assets. Holding investment advisers to the same AML standards applicable to other financial institutions would help achieve this important national security objective.In August 2015, FinCEN proposed rules to do just that. The proposal would have closed existing regulatory gaps by requiring investment advisers to implement and maintain AML programs. In the preamble to the proposal, FinCEN noted that “[a]s long as investment advisers are not subject to AML program and suspicious activity reporting requirements, money launderers may see them as a low-risk way to enter the U.S. financial system.” The recent FBI assessment, press reports of potential sanctions evasion by Russian oligarchs, and FinCEN’s own alerts to financial institutions demonstrate that these concerns may have become more acute in the years since FinCEN proposed these rules. We are pleased that the Administration shares these concerns as described in the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption in December 2021, which commits Treasury to re-examining the proposed rules from 2015. President Biden has rightly proposed additional funding for FinCEN to address the growing regulatory and enforcement demands on the agency, and we look forward to working with our colleagues to provide expanded resources in the fight against financial crime.Investment advisers have an important role to play in safeguarding the U.S. financial system from crime. They can be valuable partners for FinCEN as it seeks to meet our enormous challenges to combat not only money laundering, but also fraud and other financial crimes. Such a partnership is also important to ensure the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions programs, which have expanded significantly during the pendency of FinCEN’s rulemaking. Accordingly, it is critical that rigorous AML and sanctions compliance standards be extended to investment advisers. For these reasons, we respectfully request that you move as quickly as practicable to address this weakness in the AML system. We appreciate FinCEN’s efforts this year on a variety of fronts and amid competing priorities, including drafting and publishing several new rules to implement the Anti-Money Laundering Act and Corporate Transparency Act of 2021. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter, and we look forward to your reply. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/senator-reed-delivers-15-million-in-weatherization-funds-to-help-riers-lower-their-utility-bills," PROVIDENCE, RI – In an effort to help Rhode Islanders improve energy efficiency and save money on their utility bills, U.S. Senator Jack Reed today delivered $14,952,774 in federal funding for Rhode Island’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).This federal funding will allow the Rhode Island Department of Human Services to partner with Community Action Agencies throughout the state to provide weatherization services to eligible households, helping low-income families permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient.  Examples of weatherization assistance includes air sealing, attic and wall insulation, heating system upgrades, energy audits, and window and roof repair and replacement.  The program also helps with home health and safety measures, such as installing smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.“Keeping your house warm in the winter isn’t easy or cheap in Rhode Island -- especially with rising fuel prices.  That’s why these federal funds are so important.  Rhode Island families will get help making their homes more efficient.  At the same time as they lower their bills and help the climate, the WAP also creates jobs for energy experts and contractors.  That’s a win-win,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee who led the bipartisan effort to include $3.5 billion in additional funding for WAP in the newly enacted Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.Studies show that low-income people and senior citizens spend a disproportionate share of their income on heating and electricity.  Energy efficiency improvements can significantly cut or eliminate the excess energy burden experienced by these households.WAP grants are administered by the Rhode Island Department of Human Services (DHS) with applications available at local Community Action Programs.  Priority is given to households with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, and those receiving Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds.  Successful applicants develop a personal action plan to help reduce household energy costs and implement conservation measures. Both homeowners and renters with the permission of their landlords may apply, and the program assists all types of housing including single-family homes, multi-family buildings, and manufactured homes.For every dollar invested by WAP, $4.50 is generated in combined energy savings and non-energy benefits such as job creation, according to the U.S Department of Energy (DOE). DOE reports that through weatherization improvements and upgrades, WAP households save $283 in heating and cooling costs year after year at current prices.For more information on WAP services and eligibility, visit: http://www.dhs.ri.gov/Programs/WAPProgramInfo.php  or your local CAP provider at: https://www.ricommunityaction.org/member-services/default.aspx Rhode Island residents with weatherization questions may direct them to: dhs.wap@dhs.ri.gov  "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-announces-104-million-to-help-end-homelessness-in-ri," PROVIDENCE, RI – In an effort to help coordinate housing and supportive services for families and individuals experiencing homelessness across Rhode Island, U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD), today announced $10,405,360.00 in federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants for Rhode Island homeless assistance programs. This federal funding, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will support 37 local homeless housing and service programs across the state.  The federal homeless assistance funds help local providers and community partners deliver safe, affordable housing and supportive services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  It will also help Rhode Island launch several new projects to create youth crisis and rapid rehousing programs, new services for people seeking Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs), a Permanent Supportive Housing project at the Rockville Mill, and a Coordinated Entry System project for survivors of domestic violence.“Ensuring every Rhode Islander has safe, private shelter and a stable place to call home is both an ambitious goal and a basic, core community commitment.  We are fortunate to live in such a caring, thriving community.  But too many people can’t afford stable housing or have other issues that cause them to experience homelessness, in no small part due to the alarming shortage of affordable housing in our state and the lingering impact of the pandemic.  It’s critical that the federal government step up to assist and we have delivered funds to enhance the state’s capacity to help unsheltered people with housing and other needs.  This federal funding is just one part of that larger effort,” said Senator Reed.  “These funds will help with rapid rehousing and permanent housing for individuals and families in need, saving lives while also saving taxpayer dollars.  I commend these organizations for the life-changing and life-saving work they do to help provide vulnerable individuals and families with a roof over their heads and supportive services.”“These federal funds are critical to the ongoing work by so many partners to prevent and end homelessness in Rhode Island,” said Carol Ventura, Executive Director of RIHousing. “We thank Senator Reed for his leadership and commitment to supporting the kinds of innovative and strategic efforts to provide the services and support needed to keep families safe and sheltered and offer them opportunities to thrive.”The federal CoC grants are coordinated at the state level by RIHousing and jointly administered by non-profits throughout the state.  CoC funds are eligible for a variety of homeless assistance activities, including permanent supportive housing, rapid re-housing, coordinated assessment, and other services to help ensure homelessness is a brief and rare experience.“The Rhode Island Continuum of Care is acutely aware of the immense need to leverage resources to support Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness and we are thrilled to have secured these new resources, which will move forward our goal of functionally ending homelessness,” said Michelle Brophy, Chair of the Rhode Island Continuum of Care. “We also want to thank Senator Reed for his continued leadership in solutions to end homelessness.”“We are grateful and honored to receive additional funds to provide more housing options to victims of domestic and sexual violence,” said Vanessa Volz, the Executive Director of Sojourner House.  “Lack of safe, secure housing is one of the major reasons that victims of abuse are unable to flee from dangerous situations.  Moreover, these grants also provide life-saving supportive services to help families secure and retain their housing. This CoC funding provides a critical bridge to help victims rebuild their lives.”Senator Reed has been a strong supporter of housing assistance and homelessness prevention initiatives while continually leading efforts in the Senate to increase funding to address the root causes of homelessness.  In the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law last week, Reed secured $3.2 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, an increase of $213 million above FY2021.  He also delivered $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, up from $1.35 billion the previous year.  This is in addition to the $352 million in Emergency Rental Assistance funds that Reed brought to Rhode Island through the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act.  These funds can be tapped to help homeless individuals.Reed is the author of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, which President Obama signed into law to streamline homeless assistance grant programs and increase homelessness prevention resources, empowering communities to more efficiently and strategically provide housing and services to this vulnerable population.People in need of shelter may call the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness CES help line: (401) 277-4316. State and local homeless projects receiving 2022 federal CoC grants include: Total: $10,405,306"

This bill is a critical first step to provide them with mental health resources to cope with the challenges they face every day. Supporting our health care workforce will benefit everyone because we all need great medical professionals to take care of us and our loved ones. By keeping our health care professionals healthy, everyone in society wins.”The law is named in honor of Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency physician in New York City who took her own life in April 2020 after working on the frontlines to care for patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Specifically, the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act will:"

RI –
Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed joined Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island in
Cranston to deliver meals to senior citizens as part of the “March for Meals”
campaign, which aims to deliver warm meals and safe, socially-distanced visits
to older homebound adults.This
year’s annual “March for Meals” honors the 50th anniversary of the Older
Americans Act Nutrition Program, the federal law that provides funding for
nutrition services for seniors and helps support programs like Meals on Wheels.In
2021, Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island served over 3,000 Rhode Islanders
statewide with hundreds of thousands of meals.  During the height of the
pandemic, Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island delivered roughly 4,000 meals a day
statewide.  Today,
Senator Reed met with volunteers who prepare and deliver hot meals for
neighbors in need and visited the home of Mr. Robert Bedrick, 86, at his home
in Cranston. Mr. Bedrick has been a Home-Delivered Meal Program client since
September 2020.  He started receiving meals after his wife of over 60
years, Sandra, passed away from breast cancer four years ago. “This
program goes beyond food.  It helps develop healthy bonds for volunteers
and clients alike.  Meals on Wheels delivers nutrition with a side of
company, conversation, and wellness.  That little bit of interaction for
folks who are less mobile than they used to be goes a long way.  It’s good
food, but also a little safety check.  Many seniors live alone and the
pandemic isolated a lot of people.  Meals on Wheels delivered when folks
needed them most and it continues to make a huge difference.  This program
represents the best of what we can do to care for vulnerable residents.
Volunteer chefs put a lot of love into the food, and the volunteer drivers put
extra care into the delivery.  It’s heartwarming and special to be a part
of it,” said Senator Reed, who delivered delicious and nutritious meals today
featuring breaded cod, brown rice, green beans, tartar sauce, cracked wheat
bread, and fresh pears.“We
were thrilled to have Sen. Reed join us once again in advocating for Meals on
Wheels of RI and our homebound senior clients,” said Meals on Wheels of
Rhode Island Executive Director Meghan Grady. “The Senator has been
a true partner in our vital work and we are deeply appreciative of his
continued support.”Meals
on Wheels of Rhode Island is a critical link in the state’s network of senior
nutrition programs, both congregate and home-delivered.  The program’s
meals are delivered through 21 meal dispatch sites around the state.  The
average cost of getting each free meal prepared and delivered to a homebound
senior is about $9.61.  The meals are delivered to clients chilled and can
be eaten immediately or heated up later.Meals
on Wheels largely relies on federal sources of funding and local efforts to
deliver food to homebound seniors in need to help them remain healthy and safe
living in their own homes.A
senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Reed has been recognized
as a Congressional champion of the Meals on Wheels program and has led efforts
to secure funding for Older Americans Act (OAA) programs, which helps Meals on
Wheels serve millions of Americans nationwide.After
the pandemic hit, the COVID-19 relief bills provided a total of $1.4 billion in
supplemental funding for Meals on Wheels, including $750 million in the
American Rescue Plan Act.  In addition, Senator Reed helped deliver a $15
million increase in regular appropriations for Meals on Wheels in the FY2022
Omnibus Appropriations law, providing $291 million this year to help the
national network of 5,000 senior nutrition programs.Founded
in 1969, Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island is the only non-profit home-delivered
meal program of its kind in the state.
“We’re
seeing the need for home-delivered meals rise and the cost to prepare and
deliver food is rising too.  So it is important for Congress to robustly
fund these critical programs and work on a bipartisan basis to bring down costs
for everyday essentials like food, gas, and medicine,” said Reed.  “I will
continue working hard to ensure Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island has strong

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-collins-clark-lead-bipartisan-bicameral-letter-urging-biden-administration-to-help-reduce-home-energy-costs,"90 members of Congress urge HHS to study impacts that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having on U.S. energy prices and whether additional LIHEAP aid is needed to offset impacts on working familiesWASHINGTON, DC – Today, a group of lawmakers led by U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Assistant Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Katherine Clark (D-MA) sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter calling on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to take additional steps to reduce energy costs in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.The uncertainty caused by Putin’s war caused oil prices to wildly surge, reaching their highest levels ($127.98 per barrel) in 14 years on March 8.  Meanwhile, natural gas prices have risen approximately 60 percent higher than this time last year.As these Russian war-related price spikes cause American consumers to pay more at the pump and to heat their homes, and make household budgeting more difficult and unpredictable, Reed, Collins, Clark and their 87 colleagues who signed the letter are seeking information from HHS about how higher energy prices are affecting the ability of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to assist eligible individuals.  They want the Biden Administration to assess the program's current needs and to prepare for next winter.LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills by providing payment and/or energy crisis assistance to pay for gas, electric, and other methods customers use to heat their homes.“We greatly appreciate your efforts to alleviate increased home energy costs from pandemic-induced volatility in global energy markets for households this winter through effective administration of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), including the pre-emptive release of $3.37 billion in FY22 funding for the program at the beginning of the winter heating season. However, more needs to be done. While we commend President Biden’s leadership in addressing rising fuel costs caused by Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, we are nonetheless concerned that this war could worsen and prolong the financial impact of high energy prices on American families,” wrote the 90 members of Congress. “LIHEAP plays a critical role in offsetting burdensome heating and cooling costs that strain the budgets of financially vulnerable Americans. But as prices skyrocket because of Russia’s aggression in Europe, states will have to make tough choices about the number of people they serve and the amount of LIHEAP assistance they can provide to each household.”They continued, “Recognizing this growing need, we respectfully request that you work with the Department of Energy to determine the impacts Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have on the home energy prices of low-income Americans for the remainder of this fiscal year and next. We also ask that you make recommendations for additional funding for LIHEAP, including supplemental and contingency funding, to minimize the impacts.”Working with their colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, Senators Reed and Collins successfully included $3.8 billion for LIHEAP in the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act that was signed into law this week.  To proactively assist families during the cold winter months, the Biden Administration has already released $3.37 billion in LIHEAP aid to states.  Now that the final bill passed, HHS still has about $425 million in LIHEAP reserves to distribute.  Additionally, they successfully included a $500 million-over-five-year investment in LIHEAP in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.Nationwide, an estimated 5.3 million households received assistance with heating and cooling costs through LIHEAP in 2020.Over 26,000 Rhode Island households and nearly 33,000 households Maine households. benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $550 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders.In addition to Reed and Collins, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Gary C. Peters (D-MI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Patty Murray (D-WA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Tina Smith (D-MN).Full text of the letter follows:March 17, 2022Dear Secretary Becerra,We greatly appreciate your efforts to alleviate increased home energy costs from pandemic-induced volatility in global energy markets for households this winter through effective administration of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), including the pre-emptive release of $3.37 billion in FY22 funding for the program at the beginning of the winter heating season. With the enactment of the FY22 Omnibus Appropriations Act, a further $425 million in LIHEAP funding is available and we urge you to expedite the delivery of these funds to the states. However, more needs to be done. While we commend President Biden’s leadership in addressing rising fuel costs caused by Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, we are nonetheless concerned that this war could worsen and prolong the financial impact of high energy prices on American families.Americans have already begun to feel the financial impact of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine as oil prices surge to their highest level since 2008 and natural gas prices have risen approximately 60 percent higher than this time last year. Prices for deliverable fuels like propane and heating oil have also remained high, and were 40 percent higher in the first week of March than they were at the same point last year. These are troubling signs for the majority of American households that use either natural gas or deliverable fuels to heat their homes. Moreover, should Russia take additional action to further destabilize global energy markets, we fear the subsequent costs on American energy bills will be severe.LIHEAP plays a critical role in offsetting burdensome heating and cooling costs that strain the budgets of financially vulnerable Americans. Yet, we know that even with the additional funding provided in this year’s funding, LIHEAP cannot meet the demand for assistance. That would be true even if energy prices were stable. But as prices skyrocket because of Russia’s aggression in Europe, states will have to make tough choices about the number of people they serve and the amount of LIHEAP assistance they can provide to each household.Recognizing this growing need, we respectfully request that you work with the Department of Energy to determine the impacts Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have on the home energy prices of low-income Americans for the remainder of this fiscal year and next. We also ask that you make recommendations for additional funding for LIHEAP, including supplemental and contingency funding, to minimize the impacts.Thank you for your consideration and for your vital work for vulnerable families.Sincerely,"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-zelenskys-address-to-congress-and-bidens-announcement-of-additional-military-aid-to-ukraine,"WASHINGTON, DC – Today, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a virtual address to a joint gathering of Congress and President Joe Biden announced $800 million in new military aid to help Ukrainian forces defend against Russia's illegal and immoral invasion, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement:“President Zelensky embodies the heart, determination, and courage of the people he represents.  He has inspired and galvanized the free world in the face of Putin’s relentless and unprovoked aggression.“This was a moving and powerful speech.  The contrast between Zelensky and Putin couldn’t be more stark: Zelensky is a servant of the people who is defending his homeland and humanity, while Putin has robbed Russia to enrich himself and launched this brutal, reckless onslaught under false and irrational pretenses.“Putin’s invasion is based on a strategy of lies, repression, and deception.  He relies on conscripted forces and a misinformation campaign at home and abroad.  Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defense is based on transparency and a volunteer force of citizens fighting for their freedom.  Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian people are performing heroically.“President Biden, Congress, and the American people are united in our support for Ukraine.  President Biden has been steadfast in leading our allies and partners and coordinating efforts to provide significant security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  Today, President Zelensky acknowledged that this aid is making a world of difference.  He thanked Americans, who are paying an economic cost for this war.“President Zelensky also wisely acknowledged that: “To be the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”  That is indeed the United States’ role here.  President Biden, along with European leaders and others, have set a prudent course of action to punish Putin for shattering peace in Europe. If Putin sought to weaken NATO and the international community, he has found himself badly mistaken. The international community is united in a way not seen in generations, and Russia is already straining under the immense costs levied against it.“The U.S. must continue to work for peace using the strength and spectrum of our diplomatic, security, and economic capabilities.  We are delivering needed help to Ukraine and coordinating with our allies to keep the pressure on Putin and hold him accountable. “Americans will continue to be an unwavering force for peace, democracy, and freedom and a check against this kind of immoral aggression.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/12-million-federal-grant-heading-to-providence-cranston-school-districts-for-clean-energy-school-buses," RHODE ISLAND-- In an effort to help local schools cut fuel and maintenance costs, reduce emissions, and lower engine noise, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline today announced that First Student Inc. – through their contract with the Providence School District – is receiving $1.2 million to replace four aging, diesel buses with new, zero-emission electric school buses. The delegation secured federal funding for this initiative in the American Rescue Plan’s Electric School Bus Rebates program.  The funds are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and geared toward helping school districts in historically underserved communities. Cranston Public Schools will also receive $40,000 to replace two diesel school buses with new buses that meet current emission standards and use cleaner energy. This funding comes from the EPA’s latest round of Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) School Bus Rebate Awards, which fund the replacement of old diesel school buses with new electric, diesel, gasoline, propane, or compressed natural gas school buses meeting current emission standards. “This new federal funding to replace old, diesel school buses with new, electric school buses is a win for students, families, school districts, and taxpayers.  It’s also a cost-effective, environmentally friendly investment that will pay off for years to come,” said Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. “These new buses will reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  I look forward to helping more local school districts and communities successfully compete for additional funding through the $5.25 billion clean and electric bus grant program in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.”  “With everything happening in the world right now, it’s clearer than ever that we need to transition away from fossil fuels.  Replacing rickety, polluting school buses is a great place to start,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. “This American Rescue Plan funding will give kids in Providence and Cranston a new, greener ride to school.” “Our students deserve clean air, reliable transportation, and greener neighborhoods,” said Congressman Jim Langevin. “This American Rescue Plan funding is a major investment not only in our students, but in the public and environmental health of their entire communities. Electric and clean energy school buses are the future, and I am thrilled to see this groundbreaking technology coming to Providence and Cranston.” “Our students need and deserve safe and reliable transportation – and that means busses that are better for our environment. As we work to build a greener world for our students, this investment represents progress in our work to improve air quality for all Rhode Islanders,” said Congressman David Cicilline. “The American Rescue Plan set us on a path to recovery by investing in our schools, students, and the environment. This is just one of many ways it is helping Rhode Island’s children.” The Electric School Bus Rebates program is administered by EPA and serves as the first step in their “Clean Trucks Plan” – a series of clean air and climate regulations that the agency will develop over the next three years to reduce pollution from trucks and buses and advance the transition to a zero-emissions transportation future.

includes $13.6B in critical aid for UkraineWASHINGTON,
DC –
After months of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, and with just hours to go
before a potential federal government shutdown, the full U.S. Senate voted
68-31 late last night to pass the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending bill, which
provides $1.5 trillion across the federal government, including $13.6 billion
in emergency funding for security assistance to Ukraine and other U.S. allies
in the region. The
bipartisan bill, which will fund the federal government through the remainder
of the fiscal year (September 30, 2022), now goes to President Biden’s desk to
be signed into law.  Congress also passed a short-term continuing
resolution to ensure there are no disruptions in federal funding while the law
is enacted and no unnecessary slowdowns in getting U.S. aid to Ukraine. “This
bill delivers a real boost for the American people.  It invests in
improving schools, strengthening public safety, enhancing economic development,
affordable health care, a cleaner environment, upgrading our transportation
network, and more.  It also delivers critical assistance to Ukraine to
ensure the Ukrainian people can defend themselves from Putin’s brutal, illegal
invasion,” said U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations
Committee, and the Chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee.The
omnibus includes a 6.7 percent increase for non-defense discretionary programs,
the largest increase in four years, and invests in critical areas that were
underfunded or neglected by the previous administration, including: health
care, child care, college affordability, science, economic development, small
business support, confronting climate change, and lowering home energy
costs. Notably,
the bill also includes a long-sought reauthorization of the Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) that was co-sponsored by Senator Reed.  VAWA provides federal
resources to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence.  Originally
enacted in 1994, and authored by then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), VAWA lapsed
four years ago due to Republican objections related to a gun provision
prohibiting convicted abusers of possessing firearms.  The new law does
not close the ‘boyfriend loophole,’ but it strengthens the criminal justice
response to domestic violence and expands support for survivors.The
omnibus also includes the bipartisan Adjustable Interest Rate (Libor) Act to
protect Rhode Island retirees, students, homeowners, consumers, and small
businesses from having their interest rates reset next year for mortgages,
student loans, credit cards, bonds, and many other kinds of credit.  As
the financial industry completes its transition away from using a little-known
but critical interest rate called Libor, Senator Reed worked across the aisle
to help ensure that borrowers will not pay higher interest rates as a result.Through
his leadership on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Reed successfully
included Congressionally-directed spending – also known as “earmarks” -- in the
appropriations package to fund numerous projects across Rhode Island.  As
a result of Reed’s advocacy, over 85 projects in Rhode Island could see over
$229 million in federal funds this year.A
senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD), Reed helped include over $700
million in federal funding for Ocean State transportation, housing, and
economic development programs.  Notably, Reed successfully secured an
extra $40 million in federal assistance for bridge repair and replacement
projects in Rhode Island.“This
federal funding will help put more people to work, upgrade our infrastructure,
and enhance safety.  This is a responsible and necessary step to help
drive our economy forward,” said Senator Reed.A
number of Senator Reed’s earmark requests for community projects and priorities
across Rhode Island were included in the final bill, such as:FY

Reed successfully delivers billions for submarine construction as well as $130 million for submarine supplier development WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, today highlighted critical funding he helped include in the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending bill, which includes appropriations for the Department of Defense.  This new federal funding will help keep America safe, deter conflict, and bring more work to Rhode Island’s defense manufacturing sector. The Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill provides a total of $743.4 billion for the Department of Defense and prioritizes essential resources for our troops, invests in the readiness and capabilities of U.S. forces, and strengthens America’s defense manufacturing capabilities, including Navy shipyards and submarine manufacturing facilities.  Last night, the Senate passed this legislation by a vote of 68-31, providing funding for the federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year and preventing a government shutdown. Submarines are among the military’s most versatile and important assets.  Their inherent stealth, endurance, mobility, and firepower enable them to support core maritime capabilities: sea control, power projection, forward presence, maritime security, and deterrence.The U.S. Navy has started production of the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine.  This requires the submarine industrial base to move from building two Block IV Virginia-class attack submarines to building two larger Block V Virginia SSNs a year, as well as one Columbia SSBN a year.As a leading authorizer and appropriator, Senator Reed is responsible for writing key legislation that authorizes and funds the Department of Defense each year.  Reed helped secure critical funds for submarine construction in Rhode Island, which has seen a significant boost in recent construction activity on Virginia-class submarines, and as Columbia-class work has commenced.“This defense appropriations bill charts the right course and means Rhode Island workers can go full throttle to help building the world's most advanced submarines.  Electric Boat estimates it will need to hire over 1,250 more workers this year in Rhode Island to keep pace with demand.  That is good news for the state and the result of many years of hard work.  The $130 million for submarine supplier development in this bill is good news for small manufacturers and local suppliers and vendors that do business with Electric Boat,” said Reed.  “I will continue working to ensure we have a strong pipeline of well-qualified workers to fill these jobs and get the work done in a timely and efficient manner.  A robust submarine fleet is vital to national security, and I salute the men and women of Electric Boat who contribute their skill and talent to building these state-of-the-art submarines.”A number of key Rhode Island-related projects and priorities are included in this bipartisan defense spending legislation, such as: The bill now goes to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-backs-biden-executive-order-on-digital-assets," WASHINGTON, DC -- Today, after President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to consider additional regulations for cryptocurrencies, create standards for overseeing digital assets, and study the impact of cryptocurrencies on financial stability and national security, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a senior member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, praised the move. Reed says the federal government must be proactive and forward-looking when it comes to financial innovation and countering strategic adversaries, he notes this executive order will help ensure the U.S. has a stronger understanding of challenges, opportunities, and vulnerabilities that exist when it comes to crypto and digital assets.In the wake of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the effectiveness of Russian sanctions demonstrates the national security benefits of maintaining U.S. dollar primacy in cross-border payments.  A U.S. central bank digital currency is crucial to preserving that primacy, especially as other nations move forward with launching and developing their own digital currencies.Last week, Senator Reed joined several colleagues in seeking information from the U.S. Treasury Department about how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for sanctions evasion by Putin’s inner circle and other bad actors.Today, Senator Reed issued the following statement:“Digital assets are becoming more interconnected with the traditional financial system and the broader economy.  We need more research and information to protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the risks posed by the dramatic growth in digital asset markets.  All participants in these markets deserve clear rules of the road.“Some of the features that make digital assets attractive to would-be users – anonymity and independence from traditional finance – also make it alluring for criminals and illicit use.  The federal government must continue working at home and abroad to develop effective regulation, supervision, and enforcement measures to detect and thwart money laundering schemes and sanctions evasion.“It is critical to national and economic security that the U.S. maintain monetary hegemony into the future.  As we are seeing in Russia, the power of the U.S. dollar is a powerful economic and diplomatic tool for influencing other countries without resorting to military conflict.  A U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) that is interoperable with other central banks’ CBDCs can help preserve the dollar’s dominant role in global finance.”"

Rhode Island projects in major spending bill making its way through CongressAfter
decade-long ban, earmarks return & Reed delivers new funding to support RI
priorities, including: infrastructure, health care, education, housing, job
training, and economic developmentWASHINGTON, DC – After months of bipartisan,
bicameral negotiations, the Senate Appropriations Committee today unveiled the
fiscal 2022 omnibus spending bill, which provides $1.5 trillion across defense
and non-defense government accounts, $13.6 billion in emergency funding for
security assistance to Ukraine and other U.S. allies in the region, and $15.6
billion in largely reprogrammed COVID-19 funds to enhance pandemic response and
preparedness.  Congress plans to pass a short stopgap funding extension
through March 15 to provide Congress with time to debate and vote on the
Omnibus Appropriations bill, which will fund the federal government through the
remainder of the fiscal year, which ends September 30, 2022.The omnibus includes a 6.7 percent increase for non-defense
discretionary programs, the largest increase in four years, and invests in
critical areas that were underfunded or neglected by the previous
administration, including: health care, child care, college affordability,
science, economic development, small business support, confronting climate
change, and lowering home energy costs.U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations
Committee, and the Chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee,
successfully included Congressionally-directed spending – also known as
“earmarks” -- in the appropriations package to fund numerous projects across
Rhode Island.  As a result of Reed’s advocacy and leadership, over 87
projects in Rhode Island could see a combined $226.25 million in federal funds
this year.“This overdue Omnibus Appropriations package strikes a balance and
invests in middle-class priorities.  Getting it across the finish line
will strengthen our economy, enhance public health, safety, and security, and
deliver a real boost for working families. The omnibus targets investments
toward our nation’s biggest challenges.  This includes upgrading our
infrastructure, improving schools, combating COVID-19, and aiding
Ukraine.  It will also help bring more federal dollars and opportunities
to Rhode Island, and it renews our commitment to cleaner air, water, and
renewable energy,” said Senator Reed. “Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is creating a
drag on the world economy and sending gas prices soaring.  I remain
focused on efforts to help lower gas prices and energy costs here at home, make
the U.S. more energy independent, and support the Ukrainian government and
people in the face of Russian aggression,” continued Reed.A senior member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD),
Reed helped include over $700 million in federal funding for Ocean State
transportation, housing, and economic development programs.  Notably, Reed
successfully secured an extra $40 million in federal assistance for bridge
repair and replacement projects in Rhode Island. “This federal funding will help put more people to work, upgrade
our infrastructure, and enhance safety.  This is a responsible and
necessary step to help drive our economy forward,” said Senator Reed.Under Congressional rules for the 117th Congress, any member of
Congress could request appropriations for local governments and non-profits by
putting the request in writing with their name attached to it, publishing the
request on their website, and taking other steps to ensure the request was made
with community support, transparency, and accountability.The omnibus also includes the bipartisan Adjustable Interest Rate
(Libor) Act to protect Rhode Island retirees, students, homeowners, consumers,
and small businesses from having their interest rates reset next year for
mortgages, student loans, credit cards, bonds, and many other kinds of
credit.  As the financial industry completes its transition away from
using a little-known but critical interest rate called Libor, Senator Reed
worked across the aisle to help ensure that borrowers will not pay higher
interest rates as a result.A number of Senator Reed’s earmark requests for community projects
and priorities across Rhode Island were included in the final bill, such as:FY 22 TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (THUD)

However, even as OFR identifies ongoing and emerging risks where regulators lack complete data, the agency is not taking the steps needed to fill these data gaps.“Under Falaschetti’s leadership, OFR has overwhelmingly failed to collect data to provide regulators with the critical information they need to assess the risks to our economy. At the same time, OFR has failed to aggressively recruit and expand staff to carry out its functions,” Senator Warren said in a statement. “Falaschetti needs to step up and ensure OFR is using the tools granted by Congress to mitigate serious risks to financial stability to help protect consumers and our economy.”“The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed new risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system and reinforced the need for OFR’s mission and monitoring capabilities.  OFR must step up and use its power to safeguard consumers, businesses, and the economy.  OFR was designed to enhance financial stability by analyzing market trends, spotting potential gaps in regulators’ view of risks, and serving as an early detection and warning system.  But I am concerned that OFR is not using all of the tools that Congress provided the agency to collect and examine data on key risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system.  OFR must be committed to transparency and oversight in the financial marketplace,” said Senator Reed.As part of its responsibilities, each year OFR reports potential threats to financial stability of the United States to Congress. In the 2021 report, OFR identified several important areas that warrant much greater attention from regulators but failed to articulate how OFR itself would address these risks. These areas include climate change, cryptocurrencies, repos, private funds and synthetic leverage, and cybersecurity. Senators Warren and Reed have requested OFR share plans to collect the data necessary to address these ongoing sources of risk no later than January 28, 2022. "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/new-471m-federal-investment-will-upgrade-and-strengthen-ri-bridges,"PROVIDENCE, RI -- As the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) plans out their 2022 construction season, the Ocean State is getting a $47.1 million federal boost for bridge projects this week, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58).Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline announced that an additional $47.1 million in federal funds is being wired to the state as a result of the bipartisan infrastructure law they helped pass last November.To go with this $47.1 million infusion of federal bridge funds this year, Rhode Island will get a projected total of $289,730,682 in base formula funding from the highway portion of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, according to the Congressional delegation.  In addition to fixing roads and bridges, the federal funds will also be invested in community priorities and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the resilience of Rhode Island’s transportation system to climate change and extreme weather.  And the bill also makes additional, significant investments in the state’s airports, transit, and electric vehicle charging networks.“RIDOT has been making concerted effort over the last several years to reduce the percentage of deficient bridges.  I’ve been pleased to bring more than $160 million additional bridge funding to the state over the last three years to help in that effort.  The $47.1 million bridge funds that will come under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will allow RIDOT to tackle even more projects to fix aging bridges that require urgent attention and upgrades.  This federal aid will accelerate bridge upgrades and repairs in Rhode Island.  It will help improve our communities and build new bridges to the future,” said Senator Reed, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, who helped ensure that the bridge funding in the bill went to states with the most need to upgrade structurally deficient bridges.“Rhode Island drivers know all too well that many of the bridges connecting the Ocean State are in need of significant repair or replacement,” said Senator Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  “Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver a major infusion of funding to modernize those bridges, creating good jobs while making travel safer for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians.”“For years, our roads and bridges have been in desperate need of repair. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, help is finally on the way to bring our aging bridges into the 21st century,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “Soon, millions of dollars in federal funding will be headed to the Ocean State, which will create thousands of good-paying union jobs, and make it safer and easier for Rhode Islanders to travel across our state.”“Funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has already been designated for Rhode Island’s airports, our highways, and the replacement of dangerous lead pipes – ensuring that every Rhode Islander has access to safe and clean drinking water. This latest round of funding will allow us to repair, modernize, and construct new bridges around the state – projects that will support good paying, local jobs and make our roads safer and more efficient,” said Congressman Cicilline.The federal bridge funding is administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).In addition to this guaranteed federal bridge funding, Rhode Island and other states will have the opportunity to vie for a share of $12.5 billion in competitive federal grants from the Bridge Investment Program, as well as a chance to compete for a share of $15 billion for major projects.All this money flows from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into law last year.  Over the life of the law, Rhode Island is estimated to get over $1.7 billion in highway funding, $277 million for mass-transit, $45 million for airports, and $23 million for new electric vehicle charging stations, as well as $100 million to expand high-speed internet coverage and help low-income residents get affordable reliable Internet access.A recent report by the national transportation research non-profit TRIP found that Rhode Island had the second worst rate of deficient bridges.  According to the report, 12 percent of Rhode Island’s urban interstate bridges were in poor or structurally deficient condition, just after West Virginia's 13 percent.While this new $47.1 million in federal bridge funding is a boost to the state, the delegation noted that it is important for Republicans to come to the table and help finish the full year 2022 Appropriations process to ensure states can properly plan and access their full allocation of transportation funding.Currently, the federal government is operating under a short-term stopgap continuing resolution that is set to expire on February 18 unless Congress acts to extend it."

Jim Langevin. “Together with my colleagues, we have delivered millions in federal funding so that every Rhode Islander can stay safe and warm during these cold winter months.”“As we continue to build back better from the health and economic crises brought about by the pandemic, we need to make sure that every Rhode Islander has the support they need to succeed,” said Congressman Cicilline. “No family or senior should have to worry about staying safe and warm this winter, and this funding will make that a reality.”Nationwide, an estimated 5.3 million households received assistance with heating and cooling costs through LIHEAP in 2020.Over 26,000 Rhode Island households benefitted from LIHEAP last year, with the average annual LIHEAP benefit covering about $550 in winter home heating costs for Rhode Islanders. LIHEAP is a federally funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills by providing payment and/or energy crisis assistance to pay for gas, electric, and other methods customers use to heat their homes. Rhode Islanders wishing to apply for LIHEAP may go to the Rhode Island Department of Human Services website to get more information and links to an online application.  Or, Rhode Islanders may contact their local Community Action Agency.  Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on income, family size, and the availability of resources."

There was, of course, no proof and no truth to the claims of aberrant voting that Mr. Trump invented in order to fuel the mob.The assault on the Capitol was an attack on the United States and on democracy itself. We have the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police to thank for defending the country against what can accurately be called an insurrection.  And while the assault failed that day thanks to the efforts of these officers and their partners from neighboring jurisdictions, an insidious campaign against our democracy continues through the baseless lies and antics of the former President and his associatesMr. Trump set the events of January 6th in motion when he refused to say he would accept the results of the November 2020 election, and he continued to value his ego over our democracy when he urged the mob to march on the Capitol and disrupt the election certification process.  He repeatedly lied that the election he lost by 7 million votes had somehow been ‘stolen’ when the facts and the courts demonstrated that was clearly not the case. Stoked by his vitriol, Mr. Trump’s supporters used pipes and flag poles to brutally beat police officers.  Some of the attacks were also directed at or planned to be directed at our own members in both the house and the senate.And anyone who refused to subvert the election was a target of the insurrectionist mob, including Mr. Trump’s own Vice President, Mike Pence.  And Mr. Trump, who lit the fuse, stood by. His actions sent a demoralizing signal to billions around the world as they watched his supporters assault the Capitol. One year ago today, the U.S. Capitol Police, federal, state, and local law enforcement partners, and the National Guard physically cleared and secured the Capitol building and grounds.  The House of Representatives impeached Mr. Trump for his actions, yet most of my Senate Republican colleagues made tortured arguments that his actions were reprehensible but not technically impeachable.  As a result, the democratically defeated former president continues his rhetorical assaults through lies and misinformation.  He would rather rip apart our country and undermine our elections and democracy rather than accept the will of the American voters. The bipartisan U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is working tirelessly to get to the truth of that day.  It is methodically collecting and following the evidence, despite a lack of cooperation from Mr. Trump and his inner circle.  The Committee must continue to be transparent and we must all continue to call out the repeated lies of Trump and his enablers. Every American, regardless of party affiliation, who believes in the right to vote and upholding the Constitution should want the truth about January 6 to come out. Congress must rise to the occasion.  The stakes could not be any higher.  Because of the former President’s actions a year ago and his relentless lying since then, a significant minority of Americans now indicate that violence is an acceptable way to resolve political disagreement.  We cannot afford to have such a sentiment persist.  Together we must accept the truth, restore trust in one another, and take steps to improve political discourse.One step we must take is to honor the officers of the Capitol Police not just with our words but with real support.  Last year, we passed a supplemental appropriations bill that provided over $107 million in additional funding, including roughly $35 million for overtime, retention bonuses, hazard pay, and student loan repayments for officers.  It also provided critical funding to address the trauma experienced by our officers and help support their mental health needs.But we can’t stop there.  We have to continue in this year’s fiscal budget 2022  to support our police continue to continue support those who protect us. I am afraid if we don’t quickly resolve our differences that we could fall in to a state of a continuing resolution, this would actually deny our police, the Capitol Police and our security forces the tools they need not only to protect us and protect themselves but also to sustain their morale, sustain their mental health, sustain their personhood.So I hope we can make progress at least on that point of reaching a budget solution on behalf of the men and women who protect us, who literally on that day gave their lives for us.Now, in addition to that, we have a critical role to play when it comes to safeguarding the rights of the American voter, and we have before us with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom To Vote Act Ready for passage, we have the opportunity and the time is now.  I continue to urge my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, to work together to swiftly pass these critical voting rights bills that are needed to protect our elections and our democracy.  We must bolster the security, accessibility, and transparency of our elections in order to mend the wounds of January 6th and begin to heal as a nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Mr. President, I yield the floor.”Link to the Floor Video  "
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/woonsocket-police-department-receives-819k-grant-for-new-program-to-curb-opioid-crisis-and-save-lives,"Federal grant will help divert people dealing with addiction to treatment rather than jailWashington, DC – U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressman David Cicilline today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance has awarded the Woonsocket Police Department a three-year $819,109 grant to create a new diversion program aimed at connecting people who are struggling with opioid addiction to treatment rather than sending them to jail.  Woonsocket’s Law Enforcement Assisted Deflection, Engagement, and Retention (LEADER) in Treatment program will be a partnership between the Woonsocket Police Department and the Community Care Alliance.The federal funding was awarded from a program created by the landmark Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which Senator Whitehouse co-authored and passed into law with bipartisan support in 2016. “I commend Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this issue and applaud the Woonsocket Police Department for winning this grant and working to put more Rhode Islanders on the path to recovery,” said Senator Reed.  “This federal funding will help save lives and change lives for the better.  It gives people a chance to get treatment and the level of care they need.  It will also help save taxpayers by reducing avoidable health and social service expenditures related to the costs of untreated addiction.”“For the many families touched by addiction, the opioid epidemic is yet another worry layered on top of the stress of the pandemic,” said Senator Whitehouse, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  “My bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is working as intended in providing this grant funding to Rhode Island.  I’m hopeful Woonsocket’s program will help divert people from jail into treatment and get more Rhode Islanders on the long, noble road to recovery.  Judge Rodgers, Chief Oates, and their partners are helping lead the way.”“Rhode Islanders are, sadly, all too familiar with the deep consequences of substance use disorders and addiction,” said Congressman Cicilline.  “This federal funding will enable the Woonsocket Police Department to develop a program to divert individuals at high risk for overdose from the criminal justice system, putting Rhode Islanders on a path to recovery instead of incarceration, and saving lives and saving families.”The LEADER in Treatment program will divert individuals with a substance use disorder who are at high risk for overdose at the post-arrest pre-prosecution stage, before they formally enter the criminal justice system.  The Woonsocket Police Department and the Community Care Alliance will work together to connect program participants with counseling and recovery support, as well as a wide range of social services. “On behalf of the various partners who have developed LEADER in Treatment, we are excited to implement this unique program that places individuals who are accused of certain non-violent offenses and who may be struggling with a substance use disorder and/or co-occurring disorder in a health-centered setting rather than the criminal justice setting,” said Kristin E. Rodgers, Associate Justice of Providence County Superior Court.  “This is not just an alternative-to-incarceration program but an alternative to the criminal justice system altogether, and we hope it will pave the way for healthy, productive living for each participant.”“The Woonsocket Police Department is looking forward to working with all the partners, led by Superior Court Judge Kristin Rodgers, who came together to create this new approach in trying to help those touched by the misuse of and addiction to opioids,” said Chief Thomas F. Oates III of the Woonsocket Police Department.  “Giving law enforcement the ability to offer a person the chance to get into a treatment program instead of getting a criminal arrest record will hopefully be the first step in a new approach in dealing with this public health crisis.”Technical assistance for the program has been provided by the New England Opioid Response Network and Brown University, along with subject matter experts at Rulo Strategies and Columbia University. "

paid tribute to the life and legacy of former Senate Majority Leader Harry M.
Reid (D-NV) who passed away after a four-year battle with pancreatic cancer.“I am deeply saddened by the loss of my former colleague and
friend, Harry Reid, who was a great champion for working families everywhere.“The distinguished senator from Searchlight, Nevada was a
brilliant legislator and a powerful voice for those without power.  As a
young man, he was a boxer, who went on to become a Capitol Police officer to
help pay for law school.  When the people of Nevada elected him to the
U.S. Senate, he kept his commitment to be their tireless advocate and fierce protector. “Harry spoke softly, but acted with purpose.  He was
equal parts caring, compassionate, competitive, and tenacious.  He worked
his tail off to help the little guy, the working family.  He didn’t win
political battles by yelling the loudest or having the slickest soundbites, but
was a master tactician who led by example.  His steady, persistent,
unselfish leadership will continue to guide us and his example will continue to
sustain us.

their grief for the loss of a truly great person.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/biden-signs-fy-22-ndaa-into-law,"SASC Chairman Reed championed measures to support U.S. troops, deter adversaries, invest in new technologies, and include historic reforms to strengthen military justice system and crack down on sexual assaultWASHINGTON, DC – Today, President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 into law.  The NDAA, which was co-authored by U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, authorizes a total of $768.2 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and national security programs of the Department of Energy.  This bipartisan legislation garnered support from 363 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 88 U.S. Senators.The FY22 NDAA strengthens our military, provides vital benefits for military personnel and their families, and includes historic reforms.“This year’s NDAA is a win for Rhode Island and the nation.  It addresses a broad range of pressing issues, from strategic competition with China and Russia, to disruptive technologies like hypersonics, AI, and quantum computing.  It provides our forces with the resources and support they need to defend our nation, makes historic reforms to help improve the lives of our servicemembers, and takes important steps to care for their families,” said Senator Reed.  “It enhances our submarine-building capacity and lays the groundwork to accelerate production in the years ahead, which means more work, jobs, and economic opportunities for Rhode Island.”Reed notes that this bipartisan bill authorizes over $13 billion for submarine research, development, and production which will support thousands of workers, suppliers, and small businesses across Rhode Island.“Rhode Island’s defense sector is a key contributor to our economy and supports over 30,000 jobs.  This bill means smart investments in workforce development and more good-paying jobs in Rhode Island for years to come,” said Reed, who has worked for decades to position Rhode Island for economic growth, invest in the state’s advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and ensure Rhode Island is a leader in the ‘blue economy’ and undersea research, development, innovation and technology, including critical work at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC); the Naval War College; local colleges and universities and private sector technology clusters; and at Quonset Point, where General Dynamics Electric Boat has submarine manufacturing facilities.In 2018, Electric Boat broke ground on a 1-million-square-foot, $800-million multi-year expansion of its manufacturing facilities at Quonset Point. Senator Reed has worked for years to help fund improvements in and around the Quonset Business Park to help attract and retain businessES in the area.The bipartisan defense bill addresses a wide range of issues:Pay Raise for Troops & Expanding Parental LeaveThe 2022 NDAA authorizes a 2.7 percent pay raise for members of the military and the DOD civilian workforce.“This bill makes critical investments in the readiness and well-being of our total force—including active duty, reserve, National Guard, civilians, and their families.  It provides them, and the DOD civilian workforce, with a well-deserved pay-raise and ensures we have the proper support, force structure, and systems in place to meet their most pressing needs,” Reed said.The bill includes several initiatives to better support military families, including authorizing a new allowance to ensure military families can meet their basic needs and increasing parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child.  The bill also creates a new two-week bereavement leave benefit for both military and Federal civilian employees.Military Justice ReformThe bill also includes historic reforms to how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses -- including murder, manslaughter, and kidnapping -- under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  To ensure a professional, fair process, it entirely removes the prosecution of these crimes from the military chain of command.  The bill creates a new punitive article criminalizing sexual harassment, and requires that complaints of sexual harassment be investigated by an independent investigator fully outside the chain of command. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to create an office to track allegations of retaliation against victims of sexual assault or harassment and third-party individuals who have reported an incident, and authorizes the Department of Defense Safe Helpline to receive sexual assault reports in both unrestricted and restricted forms and to provide support to victims making such reports.“This NDAA does more to reform the military justice system and protect survivors of sexual assault than any bill in the last half century.  It takes sexual assault and a number of other crimes entirely outside the chain of command and shifts prosecutorial authority from commanders to independent prosecutors,” noted Reed.Shipbuilding & Next Generation SubmarinesSenator Reed also helped provide key funding for the Navy’s modernization efforts – including submarine construction.  The bill authorizes funding for the procurement of 13 new ships, including two Virginia-class submarines, and supporting a second year of construction on the Columbia-class submarine program.  Reed also helped authorize $900 million in research and development funding for future submarine capabilities and $330 million to fund the expansion and modernization of the submarine industrial base.“We are ramping up production of next generation submarines, which are a vital part of America’s nuclear triad and are essential for power projection, deterrence, intelligence, and sea control.  Thousands of Rhode Islanders build the backbones of these boats and provide our nation with a strategic, technological advantage.  This defense bill will result in more good-paying jobs coming to Rhode Island for years to come.  It invests in our workforce development pipeline to get people the right training for in-demand jobs building submarines and a stronger Navy,” said Reed.To that end, the NDAA authorizes $20 million to support the submarine construction workforce training pipeline, which helps provide certainty and stability for the nation’s supply chain and industrial base workforce to move forward with critical programs and acquisitions and keep employees on the job.  It also authorizes $8.3 million for four construction projects at NUWC to build new laboratories: $4 million for a Next Generation Secure Submarine Platform Facility (P&D); $1.7 million for a Consolidated RDT&E Systems Facility (P&D); $1.4 million for a Submarine Payloads Integration Laboratory (P&D); and $1.2 million for a Next Generation Torpedo Integration Lab (P&D).Deterrence and Advanced TechnologiesThe bill includes tools and initiatives to more effectively compete with China and Russia, combat transnational threats, and strengthen U.S. alliances with key partners, including NATO and Israel, to help safeguard the nation.  Notably, it reauthorizes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to better focus Department of Defense investments on exercises with allies and partners, joint and enabling capabilities, and improved force posture in the region and identifies approximately $7.1 billion in the bill for such purposes.  It also authorizes $4 billion for European Deterrence Initiative priorities, including continued investments in infrastructure and capabilities across the theater, enhanced exercises with allies and partners, and increased force presence.  Additionally, it authorizes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to support continued training, equipment, and advisory efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities.The bill authorizes an increase of more than $3 billion in funds available for science and technology programs that fund cutting-edge research and prototyping activities at universities, small businesses, defense labs, and industry, including in critical areas such as artificial intelligence, microelectronics, advanced materials, 5G, and biotechnology.  It authorizes an increase of nearly $1 billion in funding for DARPA’s high-risk, high-payoff research, including in areas such as quantum computing.The bill includes provisions to support small businesses and the defense industrial base, particularly in Rhode Island, including: requiring the Pentagon to identify the most-promising technologies being developed under the Small Business Innovation Research program; renewing, expanding, and improving oversight to increase domestic content in critical defense acquisition programs; supporting textile manufacturers by restricting the procurement of PPE from China, and taking steps to stabilize the demand for this equipment; and establishing pilot programs that will streamline efforts to move promising technologies from research programs into procurement and commercialization.Lessons from AfghanistanThe bill directs the establishment of an independent commission to examine U.S. government failures over two decades of conflict in Afghanistan.  It also prohibits the transfer of DOD funds and resources to the Taliban.Improving Military Installation Climate Resilience and DOD’s Environmental ImpactThe bill includes many initiatives to address PFAS cleanup efforts, improve climate resilience of military installations, and advance energy efficiency goals. Some highlights include:  authorizing more than $500 million for PFAS cleanup across the services; extending the ongoing CDC study of human health effects from PFAS in drinking water sources for another two years; requires each military department to assess the vulnerability of all installations and National Guard facilities to the current and projected impacts of climate change; and requiring the Defense Department to take appropriate actions to increase the use of emission-free and net-zero-emission energy technologies in its operations, program, projects, and activities.Combating Directed Energy Attacks that Target U.S. Government PersonnelIn an effort to address the issue of directed energy attacks, sometimes referred to as “anomalous health incidents,” or in the news as “Havana Syndrome,” the bill requires the President to appoint a senior official to lead a whole-of-government effort to address these incidents.  The bill also creates a Department of Defense cross-functional team to coordinate the Pentagon’s response to these incidents.  The bill aims to address national security challenges posed by the health incidents and ensure that those who have suffered from the incidents receive timely, high-quality medical care.A number of other key initiatives Senator Reed championed are included in the bill. A comprehensive summary can be found here: Summary FY22 NDAA.  Several Rhode Island-related projects and priorities are also included in this bipartisan defense legislation now set to be considered by the Senate, such as:Additionally, the bill establishes a working group on training to enhance service member and DOD employee awareness of and defenses against foreign malign influence campaigns and boost information literacy.This marks the 61st straight year that the annual NDAA has been sent to the President’s desk. Now that the NDAA has been signed into law, it authorizes federal funds that must still be appropriated.  Senator Reed is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and serves on that panel’s Defense Subcommittee."

The Central Falls Housing Authority will receive $ $212,179; the Lincoln Housing Authority will receive $244,800; and the Pawtucket Housing Authority will receive $245,850. The federal aid will help housing agencies fund service coordinators who assist public housing residents and link them to training and supportive services that will enable participants to progress along the self-sufficiency continuum.The ROSS grant program provides job training and supportive services, such as transportation, childcare, or family counseling, to help residents of public housing transition from welfare to work.“This federal funding will allow local housing authorities to provide families and seniors in public housing with critical support services to help them achieve and maintain self-sufficiency. This program is geared towards helping people who want to help themselves,” said Reed, a member of the Banking Committee, which oversees federal housing policy. “The work that ROSS program coordinators do is invaluable. The educational, employment, and life training skills they provide will help more Rhode Islanders live independently.”The funding will be administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Affairs (HUD). The ROSS program helps participating families increase earned income; reduce or eliminate the need for welfare assistance; make progress toward achieving economic independence and housing self-sufficiency; or, in the case of elderly or disabled residents, helps improve living conditions and enables residents to age-in-place."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-backs-bidens-decision-to-extend-student-loan-payment-pause-through-may-1-2022,"PROVIDENCE, RI – Today, after the Biden Administration announced it will extend the pause on student loan payments through May 1, 2022 instead of requiring them to resume at the end of next month, U.S. Senator Jack Reed issued the following statement:“I commend President Biden for providing continued relief and peace of mind for millions of Americans by extending the pause in repayment of student loans.“While the economy is improving, there is no question that the surge of COVID-19 cases due to the highly contagious Omicron variant has impacted many people and their ability to repay their student debt.“This pause on payments, interest, and collections will provide thousands of Rhode Islanders with real savings and security as we continue to combat the pandemic.“In the longer term, Congress must take additional steps to make college more affordable, reducing the reliance on loans and delivering more need-based grant aid.”Senator Reed, a champion for doubling the Pell Grant, is the author of several key bipartisan proposals to do just that, including the Partnerships for Affordability and Student Success (PASS) Act (S. 2054), which would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reestablish a federal-state partnership for increasing need-based aid, provide grants to institutions to improve student outcomes and reduce college costs, and build public accountability for institutions of higher learning.  Senator Reed also teamed up with Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) on the Student Loan Repayment Freedom Act (S. 2976), which would help federal student loan borrowers ensure their repayment plans fit their needs by allowing borrowers to switch from one income-based repayment plan to another, without first having to make a payment under Standard Repayment or go into forbearance."

RI --
U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and
David Cicilline today announced that Rhode Island Hospital will be receiving
$599,966 from the Department of Justice’s Office of Victims of Crime to
establish Rhode Island’s first SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner) program.
This federal funding will enable Rhode Island to provide equitable access to
quality, trauma-informed medical and forensic care for survivors of sexual
assault, and support community resources that prioritize healing and justice.“It
is absolutely critical that victims of sexual assault receive proper treatment,
support, and follow-up care.  This federal funding will help Rhode Island
launch a SAFE program so that highly-trained sexual assault forensic examiners
can deliver a range of vital, professionalized services.  It will ensure
evidence is properly collected and analyzed, thereby reducing trauma for the
victim and strengthening the state’s capacity to effectively prosecute cases,” said
Senator Jack Reed.“In
partnership with law enforcement and community organizations, Lifespan is
building a new program to provide comprehensive support to survivors of sexual
assault.  This federal funding will help survivors get the compassionate care
and access to justice they need to heal,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a
senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and former Rhode Island
Attorney General.“This
federal funding will enable Rhode Island to substantially expand and improve
access to quality care for survivors of sexual assault, and make sure that they
have every resource they need to properly heal, recover, and pursue justice
following such a heinous crime,” said Rep. Jim Langevin. “I’m proud to deliver
this critical funding alongside my colleagues so that no survivor of sexual
assault goes without the necessary trauma-informed resources and services.”“Every
survivor of sexual assault should feel supported throughout their healing
process and ensuring access to trauma-informed care is an integral part of
this,” said Congressman David Cicilline. “RI SAFE is a much-needed program that
will help survivors get the care and justice they need and deserve.”“Lifespan
is pleased to lead the effort to bring the first sexual assault forensic
examiner (SAFE) program to Rhode Island and provide access to quality,
trauma-informed medical and forensic care for sexual assault survivors,” said
Lifespan Executive Vice President and Chief Nursing Executive Cathy Duquette,
PhD, RN.  “This program will lay the foundation for a system of community
supports for survivors and a coordinated statewide response that promotes
healing and justice.”The
Department of Justice grant will be used to establish a mobile, SAFE program in
coordination with the Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children's Hospital, Miriam
Hospital and Newport Hospital. Resources will be developed according to the
National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, and efforts
will aim to create a culture of trauma-informed survivor care that support
patients through training for all emergency department clinicians and staff.
RI-specific training will be provided with content developed and delivered by
local experts, including local rape crisis advocacy groups, RI Attorney
General's Office, local law enforcement, clinicians focused on mitigating
trauma and others.An
expert SAFE Director, SAFE Educator, and Coordinator will be hired to support
this effort, and a quality assurance system will be developed that maintains
patient confidentiality. Partnerships with community rape crisis advocacy and
law enforcement will also be strengthened to facilitate appropriate
information-sharing, with patient consent, to support survivor healing and
access to justice.
The
RI SAFE Project anticipates serving close to 200 patients annually when fully
operational, and it will be prepared to accommodate a growing need as survivors
of sexual assault learn about these critical services."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-statement-on-bidens-omicron-battle-plan,"PROVIDENCE, RI -- Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement:“Everyone wants to be done with the pandemic, but this virus isn’t done with us.  The highly transmissible omicron variant is rapidly spreading around the globe and threatening to reverse the hard-fought progress we’ve made.“A surge in cases is inevitable, but there is also plenty of reason for hope and optimism.  We are going to get through this.  I urge you to be COVID-safe and take proper precautions to protect yourself and others.“Every American has access to lifesaving vaccines and we continue making advances with new antivirals and treatments.“I wish President Biden had announced free tests for every American sooner, but today’s action plan to provide more support for hospitals, more free testing, and more vaccines for people who still need a shot or booster is welcome news.“I support the mobilization of 1,000 military doctors, nurses, and medics to staff local hospitals and thank these brave men and women for their dedicated, life-saving service.  The president is also sending COVID-response teams to hotspots to help build more field hospital beds, as well as ambulances and EMS personnel to help transport patients to open beds.  FEMA is also pre-positioning supplies such as masks and ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile so hospitals that run low can quickly access them if need be.“I support these actions and urge the President to continue to be proactive.  The system needs to be built for surges.  If we are over-prepared and states don’t need help, excess tests and supplies can be redirected to areas that do need them.  But the current state of testing is entirely unacceptable.  Tests are an important tool to combat COVID-19 and they should be free and widely available.  It’s good news that the Administration is purchasing 500 million coronavirus rapid tests and will start shipping them free of charge to all Americans who need and request them.  I will continue closely monitoring the situation and ensuring the system works and people are getting the tests they need.“Free and frequent testing is one of the best tools we have to combat COVID-19 and the federal government will establish new testing sites and use the Defense Production Act to help manufacture more tests.  But the federal government can’t do this alone and state and local governments have a responsibility to step up and put COVID-19 funding to work combating COVID-19 now.  I worked hard to deliver federal dollars and that money needs to be responsibly deployed to areas of greatest need. “I will continue working to ensure Rhode Islanders have everything they need to protect themselves and their loved ones.  We’re all in this together and we’ll get through it by working together and looking out for one another.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-clark-lead-bicameral-letter-urging-hhs-to-help-protect-families-this-winter-during-energy-crisis,"The cost of home heating is estimated to increase by 30 percent this winter; Letter requests information regarding implementation and sustainability of LIHEAP WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark (D-MA-5) led a bicameral letter urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address the ongoing energy crisis and its impact on families served by the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The letter is co-led by Congresswomen Gwen S. Moore (D-WI-4) and Sylvia R. Garcia (D-TX-29).The cost of home heating is estimated to increase by 30 percent this winter, which is a level that has not been seen since 2014 and would impact 61 million households that use natural gas for heat. As a consequence of these volatile prices, the purchasing power of appropriated LIHEAP funding could drop by as much as 30 percent. Specifically, the program’s value in available funding could decrease by $1.14 billion from $3.8 billion for regular appropriations and by $1.35 billion from $4.5 billion for stimulus funds. The letter requests information and timeline updates regarding implementation and eligibility for low-income families and funding needs for the Department to fulfill its obligations.“As the world economy recovers from the pandemic, global energy markets are struggling to keep up with a surge in demand and prolonged supply shortages,” the Members wrote. “For low-income families, these price increases are unsustainable and will force them to choose between heating their homes and other essentials like rent, food, or medicine. As state agencies and grantees prepare their winter programs, it is crucial that they have strong support from your department to assist low-income households.”The letter is signed by 19 U.S. Senators and 89 members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Full text of the letter follows: Dear Secretary Becerra:We thank the Department of Health and Human Services for its recent release of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program’s (LIHEAP) annual allocation that will augment relief funding provided by the American Rescue Plan. However, we remain concerned that the ongoing global energy crisis will adversely impact families who will rely on LIHEAP to stay warm this winter.As the world economy recovers from the pandemic, global energy markets are struggling to keep up with a surge in demand and prolonged supply shortages. Natural gas prices across Europe have increased sixfold compared to this time last year, while coal and natural gas deficits have plunged China into a power crisis that has forced Chinese factories and businesses to rely on diesel-fueled generators just to maintain operations. , To meet global demand, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports continue to grow faster than domestic natural gas production, depleting our natural gas inventories and raising prices on American families in the process. While we applaud President Biden’s focus on addressing high fuel costs, we are concerned that the ongoing volatility in global prices for fossil fuels like natural gas could exacerbate the anticipated spike in home heating costs as this energy crisis impacts the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the cost of home heating for households will increase by 30 percent this winter, which is a level that has not been seen since 2014, and would impact 61 million households that use natural gas for heating. The EIA expects even larger surges in home heating costs this winter for the 10 percent of American households relying on deliverable fuels like propane and heating oil. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, the average residential natural gas bill will increase from $572 to $746 and heating oil bills per household will rise from $1,272 to $1,734. As a consequence, the purchasing power of appropriated LIHEAP funding would drop by as much as 30 percent. That means that the program’s value in available funding would decrease by $1.14 billion from $3.8 billion for regular appropriations and by $1.35 billion from $4.5 billion for stimulus funds. For low-income families, these price increases are unsustainable and will force them to choose between heating their homes and other essentials like rent, food, or medicine. As state agencies and grantees prepare their winter programs, it is crucial that they have strong support from your department to assist low-income households. In consideration of these concerns, we respectfully request that you provide answers to the following questions: Thank you for your consideration and for your work for vulnerable families."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/first-tranche-of-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-funding-lands-at-ri-airports,"RI airports set to receive around $45
million over five years to improve facilities and operationsWashington, DC – U.S. Senators Jack
Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David Cicilline
today announced that the Federal Aviation Administration has delivered the
first tranche of funds from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act to Rhode Island airports.  The FY2022 funding from the infrastructure
bill totals just over $9 million, which can be used to upgrade facilities and
improve airport operations.  The state’s airports will receive an
estimated $45 million from the bill over five years.“Our airports are important economic engines for the state.  This
infusion of federal funding will help airports improve passenger experience and
accessibility, replace aging infrastructure, and upgrade terminals and
facilities.  This is a smart investment in enhancing connectivity and
creating economic opportunity,” said Senator Reed.“T.F. Green International is already one of the best, most
passenger-friendly airports in the country.  This funding from our
bipartisan infrastructure bill will allow the state to further improve the
flying experience at T.F. Green and at the smaller airports that also serve as
gateways to the Ocean State,” said Senator Whitehouse.“Rhode Island boasts some of the best airports in the
nation, but our airports have been awaiting overdue
renovations for years,” said Congressman Langevin.  “I was so proud
to support this once-in-a-generation investment in our state’s infrastructure,
which will create new, good-paying jobs for Rhode Island and help our local
airports become even safer, more convenient places to fly.”“This funding will help
better Rhode Island’s airports for Rhode Islanders and visitors alike,” said
Congressman Cicilline. “These projects, and
all those funded by the bipartisan infrastructure bill, will provide good
paying jobs for Rhode Islanders as we work to build back better.”The funding breakdown for FY2022 is as follows:·      
Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport,
$6,500,902 ·      
Westerly State Airport, $1,011,862 ·      
Block Island State Airport, $1,010,963 ·      
Quonset State Airport, $295,000 ·      
North Central State Airport, $159,000 ·      
Newport State Airport, $110,000“The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) is extremely grateful for the
hard work of our Congressional delegation in achieving the passage of
comprehensive bipartisan infrastructure legislation, including vital funding
for Rhode Island's public airports,” said Iftikhar Ahmad, President and CEO
of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation.  “We look forward to working
with the Federal Aviation Administration as guidance on the use of federal
funds is released and are prepared to move forward on numerous capital projects
that have been identified through the development of a new $850 million 20 year
Master Plan for Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport, as well as
RIAC’s newly released draft Strategic Business Plan for the state’s General
Aviation Airports which identifies $98 million in priority projects over the
next decade.”All four members of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation strongly
advocated for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed into
law by President Biden last month.  The bill will bring a total of more
than $2.5 billion to Rhode Island to rebuild the state’s physical
infrastructure, stimulate economic growth, and create jobs."

https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/new-15-million-federal-grant-will-outfit-hundreds-of-ri-police-with-body-worn-cameras,"WASHINGTON, DC – Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation has teamed up with local law enforcement, communities, and the U.S. Department of Justice to help provide frontline patrol officers across the state with body-worn cameras.  These cameras help enhance transparency and strengthen community trust and can be an effective tool for increasing police accountability, de-escalating confrontational situations, and improving evidence documentation.Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Congressmen Jim Langevin and David N. Cicilline announced a new $1.5 million federal grant under DOJ’s Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program to the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety.  This funding will provide more than 700 frontline patrol officers across the state with body-worn cameras.As the delegation wrote in their letter supporting the Department of Safety’s application: “State and municipal leaders in Rhode Island have long recognized the importance of body-worn cameras as tools to protect both citizens and law enforcement. Expanding the use of this technology by state and local law enforcement agencies will further assist police departments in promoting accountability on the part of officers and citizens, aid law enforcement by providing crucial evidence in criminal cases, and strengthen community trust in policing.”The $1,526,000 award from the Department of Justice will enable eleven municipal police agencies: Central Falls, Cranston, Jamestown, Narragansett, North Kingstown, Pawtucket, South Kingstown, Warwick, West Warwick, and Woonsocket and the Rhode Island State Police to implement broad-scale body-worn camera programs. Many police officers in Rhode Island already wear body-worn cameras, which do not run all the time, but are designed to automatically switch on in critical situations.  For instance, the cameras get instantly activated when they are within 500 feet of the location of a 911 call or any time an officer draws their firearm.  Additionally, jostling motions, such as running, or a physical altercation also activate the camera.  Similarly, many police vehicles are equipped with dashboard cameras that automatically switch on when officers are using lights or sirens."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/as-supply-chain-woes-disrupt-school-cafeterias-reed-delivers-41m-to-help-ri-schools-serve-up-healthy-meals,"WASHINGTON, DC – While no school is running out of food, food supply chain issues that have been complicating school lunch programs nationwide are likely to continue throughout the rest of the school year.  And that often makes it harder for school cafeterias to source enough fresh, healthy menu items needed to meet nutrition standards, such as whole-grain, low-sodium, and low-fat options. But now, thanks to new federal funding, Rhode Island schools will have an additional $4.1 million to help deal with the challenges of supply chain disruptions brought on by the pandemic.U.S. Senator Jack Reed announced that Rhode Island school meal programs will receive an infusion of $2,800,945 through Supply Chain Assistance Funds; $786,566 through U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foods Purchases; and $560,189 through Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreements.  The federal funds, administered by the USDA, will provide a big helping for school nutrition programs as they work with food vendors and suppliers to get healthy, nutritious foods onto students’ plates.“School nutrition contributes to success in the classroom and to healthy communities.  These federal funds will help school cafeterias navigate tricky supply chain issues and serve up healthy, nutritious meals,” said Senator Reed.  “Feeding students is important work and it takes a lot of advanced planning and preparation.  This pandemic has created some worldwide supply chain disruptions, unpredictability, and delivery delays.  Talented, hard-working food service staffers are dedicated to serving kids healthy, nutritious meal so they can grow and learn and I’ve been impressed at how creative and resilient they’ve been in terms of adjusting menus and budgets on the fly while still serving nutritious meals.  These added funds should help add some certainty and stability to school budgets.  I am committed to ensuring every student gets a good education and has access to healthy food and this increased federal funding will help schools throughout the state,” said Senator Reed.School nutrition programs help alleviate childhood food insecurity, improve children’s health, and support learning in the classroom.  To help ensure that every student has access to healthy meals, Rhode Island schools offer free and reduced-price school breakfast and lunch to low-income students through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).According to the Food Research and Action Center’s School Breakfast Scorecard released in February 2021, Rhode Island saw the fifth biggest increase in the nation (6.3%) in terms of growth in the number of free and reduced-price breakfast participants.  The School Breakfast Scorecard reports that more than 28,561 Rhode Island children ate a free school breakfast on an average school day in 2019-2020 and 52,679 students participated in the NSLP.In September, the USDA issued a waiver to provide schools more flexibility in meeting federal nutrition standards due to COVID-related supply-chain disruption.  This is in addition to a number of waivers that USDA extended in April so schools can continue providing flexible meal service options that support student’s access to nutritious meals.  All of these waivers are due to expire at the end of June.  The federal government also increased the federal reimbursement rate for school meals in July.Senator Reed says he supports extending the pandemic-era waivers that have allowed extra flexibility and increasing federal funding for school meal programs.  “The pandemic is not over and school cafeterias are facing some real challenges.  To help provide them with some needed certainty so they can plan ahead, I support extending waivers through the end of next school year and I will continue working to deliver funds to help school districts feed students healthy meals,” said Reed."
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reeds-vets-center-improvement-act-clears-key-committee-hurdle,"WASHINGTON, DC – In an effort to provide free, high-quality mental health care and other supportive services to veterans and their families, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs committee advanced U.S. Senator Reed Reed’s (D-RI) Vet Center Improvement Act.  This legislation, which Reed introduced with Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-MT), would help improve staffing and hiring practices at Vet Centers and ensure counselors at these critical institutions can effectively treat veterans for mental health issues like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).There are 300 Vets Centers nationwide, including one in Warwick, that offer an array of counseling services, including marriage and family counseling, as well as alcohol and substance use assessment.  Vets Centers are designed to help veterans, active duty military, and their families deal with issues arising from their service, including trauma and grief counseling, and help prevent them from experiencing bigger problems down the road.After allegations that changes to performance metrics at Vet Centers may have negatively impacted care and additional concerns about staffing practices, Senators Reed and Tester requested a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation.  GAO made several recommendations to improve care, transparency, and hiring and staffing methods that form the foundation for the Reed-Tester legislation to enhance these community-based Vet Centers and eliminate barriers to care.“I am pleased the Veterans’ Affairs Committee advanced the Vets Center Improvement Act.  This legislation is about putting people first and ensuring that every combat veteran, and their family, can access the quality care they need, when they need it,” said Senator Reed.  “Vets Centers provide life-changing, life-saving assistance, and this bill will ensure they have the capacity and resources to meet growing demand.  We’ve got to ensure our Vet Centers are properly staffed and can offer the necessary level of care and assistance.  The Vets Center Improvement Act will go a long way toward improving expectations and staffing, and ultimately providing better help for those who use their services and heading off other issues down the road.”The Vet Center Improvement Act requires periodic review and reform of productivity expectations at Vet Centers; the creation and periodic reevaluation of a staffing model, along with standardization of position descriptions and responsibilities across Vet Centers; the creation of a working group to implement changes to improve quality of care for veterans and recruitment and retention of staff; and the GAO to review Vet Center infrastructure and examine what future investments are needed. Additionally, the bill creates a pilot program to provide $15 million in federal grants to combat food insecurity and provide necessary utility bill assistance to veterans and their families.  Food insecurity and the need for heating and cooling assistance are growing issues for veterans and others as a result of the pandemic. "

Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, critical voting rights bills that are needed to protect our elections and our democracy.  The blockade against these bills has to end, and that’s why I agree with Senator Warnock that the Senate cannot adjourn until we address this existential crisis through every constitutional method available.  The Senate has to start working like the Senate again so we have real debate, focused amendments, and final passage on crucial matters like this.  Passage cannot wait—every day we march to the 2022 election without passing these bills, we are missing key deadlines for redistricting, voter registration, and campaign finance.  If the Senate is denied a vote now, the damage to our democracy cannot be undone before Election Day of 2022.  “Partisan attempts to restrict voting access are an affront to democracy itself.  Congress must do its job and debate this issue and then vote.  Failure by the Senate to allow votes on voting rights could spark a constitutional crisis.  Every Senator says they believe in protecting Americans’ right to vote in free and fair elections.  Now the question becomes: who is willing to actually vote that way?  My answer is: I am.”"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/us-senators-urge-cfpb-to-take-action-to-ensure-transparency-and-oversight-of-buy-now-pay-later-products_providers,"WASHINGTON, DC – As more Americans do their holiday shopping online and more online retailers offer consumers a financial technology twist on old-fashioned installment loans that could pose risks to consumers, six U.S. Senators are urging regulators to strengthen oversight and keep up with the growth of these “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) products and providers. Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) was joined by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) in sending a letter urging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to take action regarding the governance of BNPL products. BNPL products allow shoppers to divide the cost of their purchases over several months, often interest-free.  If they are well-designed, transparent, accountable, and supervised for compliance with federal consumer protection laws, BNPL products can legitimately serve an important role in meeting the needs of consumers and businesses.  However, some of these products can include hidden fees, create negative history in a consumer’s credit report, and encourage consumers to rack up debt they cannot afford to repay that could later harm their long-term financial health.In their letter to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, the Senators note that: “While the emergence of BNPL as affordable small-dollar credit has potentially provided an alternative to more costly forms of credit, these products also have the potential to cause consumer harm.  Many BNPL providers structure these products in an effort to avoid certain consumer protection obligations under the Truth in Lending Act or the Military Lending Act, which generally apply to loans that are repayable in more than four installments or are subject to a finance charge.  BNPL products generally do not receive all of the protections credit cards have, including those governing ability-to-repay, monthly statements, reasonable and proportional penalty fees, and the ability to raise merchant-related disputes. “In addition, nonbank BNPL providers currently operate without meaningful oversight.  They are not generally subject to federal supervision that can spot unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices or other violations of federal consumer protection laws.  Consumers may be unaware of these regulatory gaps and may be erroneously led to believe that credit obtained from a BNPL provider comes with protections that are similar to those for credit cards.  This regulatory gap has troubling implications,” the letter continues.The Senators commended the CFPB for working to educate and inform consumers about the structure of BNPL credit and possible consequences of missing a payment and requested that the CFPB “review BNPL products as soon as practicable and take action under the CFPB’s existing authorities to protect consumers.”Full text of the letter follows:December 15, 2021The Honorable Rohit ChopraDirectorConsumer Financial Protection Bureau1700 G Street NWWashington, DC 20552Dear Director Chopra:We write to urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to take action regarding the governance of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) products.  These interest-free, small-dollar installment loans have proven appealing to consumers, but can cause consumer harm.BNPL is a type of unsecured deferred payment or short-term installment loan that a consumer obtains when making a purchase.  BNPL credit is typically extended to a consumer at the point of sale—usually online, but sometimes in-store—to finance a specific product.  In a typical BNPL extension of credit, a consumer pays a portion (often 25%) of the item’s price at the time of purchase and the remainder in equal installments.  Consumers usually pay no interest and only are charged fees for late payments.  So long as payments are made on time, BNPL credit is free to consumers.  Rather, BNPL providers are paid directly by merchants.  Fees are typically a single-digit percentage of the purchase price plus a fixed amount per transaction.The BNPL market has experienced extraordinary growth over the past two years, catalyzed by the pandemic driving more consumers to shop online and through mobile apps, and by merchants using BNPL to increase sales from consumers wary of credit cards.  This trend is likely to continue.While the emergence of BNPL as affordable small-dollar credit has potentially provided an alternative to more costly forms of credit, these products also have the potential to cause consumer harm.  Many BNPL providers structure these products in an effort to avoid certain consumer protection obligations under the Truth in Lending Act or the Military Lending Act, which generally apply to loans that are repayable in more than four installments or are subject to a finance charge.  BNPL products generally do not receive all of the protections credit cards have, including those governing ability-to-repay, monthly statements, reasonable and proportional penalty fees, and the ability to raise merchant-related disputes. In addition, nonbank BNPL providers currently operate without meaningful oversight.  They are not generally subject to federal supervision that can spot unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices or other violations of federal consumer protection laws.  Consumers may be unaware of these regulatory gaps and may be erroneously led to believe that credit obtained from a BNPL provider comes with protections that are similar to those for credit cards.  This regulatory gap has troubling implications.First, consumers may not have full awareness of the risks associated with obtaining BNPL credit.  In the absence of consolidated account statements, confusion about repayment schedules and consequences of default can lead to missed payments and associated late fees.  Lack of standardized disclosures can also create potential for hidden fees and expenses.  Marketing through retailers’ websites and mobile apps compound this problem by advertising BNPL products as available at “no cost” or with “no interest.”  That can create a misperception that credit is truly free.  Consumers are also exposed to risk of overdrafts because they typically repay BNPL credit through automatic withdrawals from bank accounts or payment via debit cards. Second, consumers may not have an ability to repay BNPL credit.  Nonbank providers typically do not engage in rigorous underwriting practices.  They conduct only a “soft” inquiry on a consumer’s credit for the limited purposes of verifying a consumer’s identity and preventing fraud.  Even multiple BNPL loans will not typically appear on a consumer’s credit report.  This can lead to elevated levels of indebtedness because consumers may have multiple outstanding transactions across different providers that together add up to a high overall balance.  It is important for consumers to understand—before taking out a loan—that BNPL repayment obligations are debt.  Clear underwriting standards and expectations could protect consumers from overextending themselves. Third, unlike other credit products and with limited exceptions, on-time payments are not usually reported to the credit bureaus, but delinquencies or defaults may be.  That can make it difficult for consumers to use BNPL to build positive credit history.  Even if positive payments were reported, those payments might actually reduce a consumer’s credit score by lowering the average age of their credit accounts.  BNPL users tend to be younger individuals without a long credit history.  Negative credit history for young consumers can have effects later in life, making it harder to qualify for favorable rates when they seek to finance a car or a home.  We appreciate that the CFPB published a blog post in July to inform consumers about the structure of BNPL credit and consequences of missing a payment.For these reasons, we respectfully request that you review BNPL products as soon as practicable and take action under the CFPB’s existing authorities to protect consumers.  We appreciate your attention to this critical matter, and look forward to your prompt reply.  Sincerely,"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/initial-290-million-payment-heading-to-ri-to-upgrade-states-highways,"WASHINGTON, DC – Rhode Island is getting its first down payment under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), who helped pass the law, says the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will provide $289,730,682 in transportation funding for Rhode Island highways and surface transportation projects.“This is a big boost for Rhode Island’s highway infrastructure that will help the state make these well-travelled corridors safer, more resilient, and reduce congestion,” said Senator Reed, a member of the Appropriations Committee.  “There will be a lot more money coming to Rhode Island under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and that money needs to be put to work creating jobs, modernizing our infrastructure, and making it work better for every Rhode Islander in every community.”This infusion of federal funds may be used to repair roads, bridges and highways, along with other strategies to reduce traffic incidents.More federal infrastructure funding for Rhode Island is expected to be announced in the near future and will help the state upgrade other critical infrastructure, including public transportation, mass-transit, rail, ports, and airports.Over the life of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Reed estimates that Rhode Island should get over $1.7 billion in highway funding, $277 million for mass-transit, $45 million for airports, and $23 million for new electric vehicle charging stations. Rhode Island will also receive $100 million to expand high-speed internet coverage and help low-income residents get affordable reliable Internet access. In the digital age it is no longer enough to have limited or slow internet access. Connectivity facilitates education, opportunity, employment and connection.In addition to federal formula funds that will go directly to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT), the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC), and other state entities, Senator Reed also noted that Rhode Island will be able to apply for and receive additional federal funding under a $12.5 billion competitive program for economically significant bridges and a $16 billion program to fund major projects deemed to provide substantial economic benefits.  There’s also $30 billion to make improvements for Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor guided by environmental and state input, $8 billion set aside for capital improvement grants that could benefit Rhode Island transit, $15 billion for the RAISE Grant program, and $5.25 billion for low and no emissions bus grants.Senator Reed also notes the bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $55 billion for water infrastructure, which would represent the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.  Senator Reed estimates that Rhode Island should receive about $377.6 million to strengthen the state’s clean water infrastructure under the bill.“The investments in this bill will help us build on the progress we’ve made and make critical advancements toward modernizing our electrical grid, water mains, and sewage systems.  It will help replace old lead pipes and deliver clean water.  It will make America more energy-efficient while reducing congestion and pollution and creating new jobs,” emphasized Senator Reed.The federal funding from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would provide Rhode Island a big boost toward improving the state’s infrastructure.  Recently the American Society of Civil Engineers gave Rhode Island a C- grade on its infrastructure report card.Highlights of the bill include:"
https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/reed-hails-final-passage-of-defense-bill-to-benefit-servicemembers-national-security-and-ri,"Reed champions historic reforms to strengthen military justice system and support for survivors of sexual assault & helps bolster RI's defense workforceWASHINGTON, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate voted 89-10 to approve the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022, which authorizes a total of $768.2 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) and national security programs of the Department of Energy.  This legislation, which previously passed the U.S. House of Representatives, now goes to President Biden to be signed into law.U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says the FY22 NDAA strengthens our military, provides a framework to ensure each service can accomplish its highest priority missions, boosts advanced technologies and capabilities, and delivers historic reform to protect our forces and their families.“With this vote, Congress is standing up for our servicemembers to ensure they have the resources and support needed to carry out their missions and keep Americans safe,” said Senator Reed.  “This NDAA addresses a broad range of pressing issues, from strategic competition with China and Russia, to disruptive technologies like hypersonics, AI, and quantum computing.  It provides our forces with the resources and support they need to defend our nation, makes historic reforms to help improve the lives of our servicemembers, and takes important steps to care for their families.Reed notes that this bipartisan bill authorizes over $13 billion for submarine research, development, and production which will support thousands of workers, suppliers, and small businesses across Rhode Island.“Rhode Island’s defense sector is a key contributor to our economy and supports over 30,000 jobs.  This bill means smart investments in workforce development and more good-paying jobs in Rhode Island for years to come,” said Reed, who has worked for decades to position Rhode Island for economic growth, invest in the state’s advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and ensure Rhode Island is a leader in the ‘blue economy’ and undersea research, development, innovation and technology, including critical work the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC); the Naval War College; local colleges and universities and private sector technology clusters; and at Quonset Point, where General Dynamics Electric Boat has submarine manufacturing facilities.In 2018, Electric Boat broke ground on a 1-million-square-foot, $800-million multi-year expansion of its manufacturing facilities at Quonset Point. Senator Reed has worked for years to help fund improvements in and around the Quonset Business Park to help attract and retain business in the area.The bipartisan defense bill addresses a wide range of issues:Pay Raise for Troops & Expanding Parental LeaveThe 2022 NDAA authorizes a 2.7 percent pay raise for members of the military and the DOD civilian workforce.“This bill makes critical investments in the readiness and well-being of our total force—including active duty, reserve, National Guard, civilians, and their families.  It provides them, and the DOD civilian workforce, with a well-deserved pay-raise and ensures we have the proper support, force structure, and systems in place to meet their most pressing needs,” Reed said.The bill includes several initiatives to better support military families, including authorizing a new allowance to ensure military families can meet their basic needs and increasing parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child.  The bill also creates a new two-week bereavement leave benefit for both military and Federal civilian employees.Military Justice ReformThe bill also includes historic reforms to how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses -- including murder, manslaughter, and kidnapping -- under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  To ensure a professional, fair process, it entirely removes the prosecution of these crimes from the military chain of command.  The bill creates a new punitive article criminalizing sexual harassment, and requires that complaints of sexual harassment be investigated by an independent investigator fully outside the chain of command. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to create an office to track allegations of retaliation against victims of sexual assault or harassment and third-party individuals who have reported an incident, and authorizes the Department of Defense Safe Helpline to receive sexual assault reports in both unrestricted and restricted forms and to provide support to victims making such reports.“This NDAA does more to reform the military justice system and protect survivors of sexual assault than any bill in the last half century.  It takes sexual assault and other crimes entirely outside the chain of command and shifts prosecutorial authority from commanders to independent prosecutors,” noted Reed.Shipbuilding & Next Generation SubmarinesSenator Reed also helped provide key funding for the Navy’s modernization efforts – including submarine construction.  The bill authorizes funding for the procurement of 13 new ships, including two Virginia-class submarines, and supporting a second year of construction on the Columbia-class submarine program.  Reed also helped authorize $900 million in research and development funding for future submarine capabilities and $330 million to fund the expansion and modernization of the submarine industrial base.“We are ramping up production of next generation submarines, which are a vital part of America’s nuclear triad and are essential for power projection, deterrence, intelligence, and sea control.  Thousands of Rhode Islanders build the backbones of these boats and provide our nation with a strategic, technological advantage.  This defense bill will result in more good-paying jobs coming to Rhode Island for years to come.  It invests in our workforce development pipeline to get people the right training for in-demand jobs building submarines and a stronger Navy,” said Reed.To that end, the NDAA authorizes $20 million to support the submarine construction workforce training pipeline, which helps provide certainty and stability for the nation’s supply chain and industrial base workforce to move forward with critical programs and acquisitions and keep employees on the job.  It also authorizes $8.3 million for four construction projects at NUWC to build new laboratories: $4 million for a Next Generation Secure Submarine Platform Facility (P&D); $1.7 million for a Consolidated RDT&E Systems Facility (P&D); $1.4 million for a Submarine Payloads Integration Laboratory (P&D); and $1.2 million for a Next Generation Torpedo Integration Lab (P&D).Deterrence and Advanced TechnologiesThe bill includes tools and initiatives to more effectively compete with China and Russia, combat transnational threats, and strengthen U.S. alliances with key partners, including NATO and Israel, to help safeguard the nation.  Notably, it reauthorizes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to better focus Department of Defense investments on exercises with allies and partners, joint and enabling capabilities, and improved force posture in the region and identifies approximately $7.1 billion in the bill for such purposes.  It also authorizes $4 billion for European Deterrence Initiative priorities, including continued investments in infrastructure and capabilities across the theater, enhanced exercises with allies and partners, and increased force presence.  Additionally, it authorizes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to support continued training, equipment, and advisory efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities.The bill authorizes an increase of more than $3 billion in funds available for science and technology programs that fund cutting-edge research and prototyping activities at universities, small businesses, defense labs, and industry, including in critical areas such as artificial intelligence, microelectronics, advanced materials, 5G, and biotechnology.  It authorizes an increase of nearly $1 billion in funding for DARPA’s high-risk, high-payoff research, including in areas such as quantum computing.The bill includes provisions to support small businesses and the defense industrial base, particularly in Rhode Island, including: requiring the Pentagon to identify the most-promising technologies being developed under the Small Business Innovation Research program; renewing, expanding, and improving oversight to increase domestic content in critical defense acquisition programs; supporting textile manufacturers by restricting the procurement of PPE from China, and taking steps to stabilize the demand for this equipment; and establishing pilot programs that will streamline efforts to move promising technologies from research programs into procurement and commercialization.Lessons from AfghanistanThe bill directs the establishment of an independent commission to examine U.S. government failures over two decades of conflict in Afghanistan.  It also prohibits the transfer of DOD funds and resources to the Taliban.Improving Military Installation Climate Resilience and DOD’s Environmental ImpactThe bill includes many initiatives to address PFAS cleanup efforts, improve climate resilience of military installations, and advance energy efficiency goals. Some highlights include:  authorizing more than $500 million for PFAS cleanup across the services; extending the ongoing CDC study of human health effects from PFAS in drinking water sources for another two years; requires each military department to assess the vulnerability of all installations and National Guard facilities to the current and projected impacts of climate change; and requiring the Defense Department to take appropriate actions to increase the use of emission-free and net-zero-emission energy technologies in its operations, program, projects, and activities.Combating Directed Energy Attacks that Target U.S. Government PersonnelIn an effort to address the issue of directed energy attacks, sometimes referred to as “anomalous health incidents,” or in the news as “Havana Syndrome,” the bill requires the President to appoint a senior official to lead a whole-of-government effort to address these incidents.  The bill also creates a Department of Defense cross-functional team to coordinate the Pentagon’s response to these incidents.  The bill aims to address national security challenges posed by the health incidents and ensure that those who have suffered from the incidents receive timely, high-quality medical care.A number of other key initiatives Senator Reed championed are included in the bill. A comprehensive summary can be found here: Summary FY22 NDAA.  Several Rhode Island-related projects and priorities are also included in this bipartisan defense legislation now set to be considered by the Senate, such as:Additionally, the bill establishes a working group on training to enhance service member and DOD employee awareness of and defenses against foreign malign influence campaigns and boost information literacy.This marks the 61st straight year that the annual NDAA has been completed.

DC –
Today, the U.S. Senate voted 86-13 to advance the Fiscal Year 2022 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes historic reforms to how the
military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses --
including murder, manslaughter, and kidnapping -- under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice.  Once the bill becomes law and is implemented,
specialized, independent military prosecutors will decide which cases get
prosecuted, rather than commanders.  Also, for the first time, the NDAA
will create a new punitive article criminalizing sexual harassment in the
military as prejudicial to good order and discipline.  In the civilian
U.S. legal system, sexual harassment is not a crime and is generally handled as
a civil matter.After
the cloture vote, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, thanked and credited the Guillen family for their
tireless, unwavering advocacy to strengthen the military justice system and
historically change the way the military responds to allegations of sexual
assault and other crimes.“This
bill is a major victory for all military sexual assault survivors and will lead
to lasting changes in the military justice system to ensure the fair and
impartial administration of justice within the armed forces.  This is a
historic step toward ensuring that no one ever suffers in silence or feels
their voice won’t be heard,” said Reed.“The
family of U.S. Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen deserves special recognition for
their role in bringing about this transformative change.  I hope today’s
vote and the reforms it brings about offer some measure of comfort to her
family.  They have suffered an unspeakable tragedy and used their voices
to help others and deliver positive, lasting change,” said Reed.  “After
traveling to Fort Hood in September 2020 in the aftermath of the investigations
into Specialist Guillen’s murder and other cases, I came away convinced that
not only was there systemic failure by the chain of command and other Fort Hood
leadership to protect soldiers under their command, but that reforms were
needed to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.”In
addition to establishing sexual harassment as a new criminal offense, the NDAA
requires that complaints of sexual harassment be investigated by an independent
investigator outside the chain of command.  The bill further requires the
Secretary of Defense to designate an office to track allegations of retaliation
against victims of sexual assault or harassment within the armed forces,
authorizes the Department of Defense Safe Helpline to receive restricted
reports of sexual assault, and authorizes the Department to provide support to
victims making such reports.  It also gives victims the right to know
about administrative actions taken against their offenders.“This
legislation is a major step forward, but it won’t be the last.  We must
continue to focus on this issue and work to ensure the law is effective. 
There is no legislative ‘silver bullet’ here.  We have to tackle this
issue from every angle, and continue working to change the culture of how the
military – and society – prevents and handles sexual misconduct.  From
ensuring accountability to increasing prevention to changing command culture
and climate to enhancing victim care, we’ve got to keep working to serve
justice and stamp out sexual misconduct in the military, the workplace, on
college campuses, and throughout society,” said Reed.
Now
that cloture has been invoked, the Senate may use up to thirty hours of debate
before voting on final passage.  The NDAA previously passed the U.S. House
of Representatives 363-70.  After final passage in the U.S. Senate, it
will be sent to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law."
